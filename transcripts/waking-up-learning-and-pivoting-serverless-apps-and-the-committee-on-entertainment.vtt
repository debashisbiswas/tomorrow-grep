WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 Dax, fix your headphones. Hey, hey, Dax, Dax. Oh shit, have you been here for a while?

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.080
 Is this not working again? Goddamn it. Oh, there we go. I can hear it. I'm going to

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.880
 turn to you for a while. How long? About two minutes. I only been recording for a few

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.280
 seconds, but I just sat and talked to you while you couldn't hear me. It was fun. It was fun

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.120
 to watch you just in your element like you didn't know I was watching. You're just like

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.080
 surfing the web or whatever you're doing. No, I got these working finally. Oh, did you?

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.080
 Is that what that was? That was the one. That was the one working. That was me not working.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:01:07.080
 But they were working. Oh, so much to talk about. Let's start. Oh, you go first. Well,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.080
 the most immediate thing is I woke up, I usually wake up at seven and I woke up at five

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.320
 thirty today. And it was because like around five o'clock, I was like, I kind of woke up

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.960
 a little bit and I was like, it kind of smells like poop. And I was like, Oh, no, I'm probably

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.000
 like just imagining it. And I can sleep through anything. So I was like, Liz really needs to

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.640
 get that checked out. I actually was like, maybe it, you know, was one of us. And then

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.000
 Liz was like, like twice a minute later, she woke up and she was like, it smells like

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.200
 poop. And I was like, God damn it. If we both know that it must be real. And we opened

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.320
 the, she pulled out her phone and she looked on the camera because we have a camera. And

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.160
 so Zuko sleeps in my office, which is this room. Yeah. And we have a camera in the back

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.880
 corner there. And he was just sleeping nicely and we couldn't really see anything. They were

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.680
 like, okay, are we imagining it? Then she likes scroll back to the history. And then you can

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.400
 see him might get up and just take a shit in front of the door. So in front of the, like

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.920
 front door or in front of your bedroom door? No, my, my office is closed while he sleeps

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.440
 in here. Oh, he's, he's locked in there. Gotcha. And then he like pooper in front of the door.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.000
 And he does this thing where he like spreads it around. It's like this weird thing where

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.360
 he like, I think he doesn't want to get in trouble. So he tries to like do something.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.400
 Hide it. Yeah. But like it makes everything worse. It's always this weird pattern where

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.840
 it's like the mound. And there's like surrounded by like streaks of like, I don't even know

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.040
 how to explain it. Like it's like coming out from the mound, but like all around it perfectly.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.880
 So I feel like he goes here and draws a line from the center out like all around it for

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.240
 some reason. I don't know why he does that. He can smell it from your bedroom, huh? Yeah,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.680
 he's a big dog. And then obviously this room was just a disaster because it was closed and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.680
 there's like no ventilation in here. Really? Like the kind of have my window. Yeah. Is it

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.000
 better now? I mean, you got in the smell out? Yeah, most of it. And I mean, I, I, part of

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.400
 me probably just got used to it. Burning incense sticks really helps with this thing. It like

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.760
 really drastically fixed it. Liz is on a run right now, but she's going to go pick up

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.440
 some like more heavy duty cleaning supplies. Yeah. It's going to look like you're trying

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.680
 to get rid of a body or something. Yeah, I mean, it's maybe worse, maybe more difficult.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.960
 But the other thing is his like poops haven't been super solid lately. Like, oh, no, it wasn't

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.360
 like, yeah, if it was a solid poop would actually, to be honest, like a solid dog poop is crazy

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.880
 to clean. It's like a little like spudge leftover. It's fine. Sounds super easy. Yeah, no, this

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.760
 was definitely somewhere in the middle on that on that spectrum of tools. When I said we had

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.440
 a lot to talk about this was not on my punch list of things. But that is, I know how that

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.880
 can take up a day. I mean, it can just kind of like dominate your thoughts for a day when

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.160
 you have to be able to something like that first thing. I mean, we very explicitly got

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.160
 him because we were like, let's like work up to having a kid. And this was like a little

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.040
 simulation of like having to wake up randomly and dealing with. Yeah. I don't think I've

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.200
 ever had to deal with anything that bad with my two children. So I mean, not like feces

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.080
 all over the floor and spread around. But I imagine there's like a lot of poop getting

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.360
 in places. And I can remember times like the blowouts where it just like the diaper wasn't

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.280
 big enough and it just shoots up the back. That stuff's really gross. You kind of forget

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.640
 about though. It's funny. No, you used to it. Yeah. You think like this is the worst experience

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.320
 of my life and I'll never forget it. And then like a few years later, I don't know, they're

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.600
 cute. I mean, you just kind of get over it. My friend has a story where in the middle

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.520
 of night, half asleep, he liked like right at the beginning with his first kid. So he

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.440
 didn't know like all the little tricks. He lifted her up like this in front of to like

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.640
 hold her in front of him. Oh, and she peed directly into his mouth. Oh, that's a tale

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.000
 as old as time. You've seen that in the movies, even like they hold up the baby and it just

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 pees on their face. But in the mouth, that's that's tough. Never hold. Never hold. Yeah.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.520
 Yeah. That was my morning. Well, that sounds like a fun morning. It does not sound like

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.560
 a fun morning. Actually woke up like an hour and a half earlier than normal. Okay. Sounds

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.560
 like that. Well, you're just like an hour and a half early. Is that what you said? Yeah.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.560
 Exactly. Yeah. I woke up. I normally wake up like five 30 and I was up at four just like

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.800
 bright eyed could not sleep anymore. So I got up. Are you excited about something? No, that's

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.840
 the thing like normally like if I have our time sleeping, it's because of the thing I'm

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.080
 ready to work on. I wouldn't say I'm going to particularly like I'm excited about each

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.640
 individual thing I'm working on now. Like I'm excited generally about my work, but I'm

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.680
 not like there's not a thing that's like going to get me out of bed. So it's kind of weird.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.600
 I haven't had that feeling for a bit. I don't love it because I used to sleep like six hours

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.960
 a night a lot. Like I just I would prioritize time in my office working over health. And

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.000
 I felt like I could do that for a while. Like I could I could do a few months of six hours

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.120
 at night and be fine. But the more I've like read the science and the papers, your favorite

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.120
 studies. I know that you love the studies. It's just like not good for you to not give

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.200
 yourself enough sleep. So I hate doing it. But when you can't sleep, you can't sleep if

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.480
 like in that moment I'm not going back to sleep. So I might as well get up. I never have ever

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.400
 had that problem of like not being able to sleep. Oh, really? Like I fall asleep immediately

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.960
 and I can really say is sleep forever through anything in earthquake, whatever it is interesting.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.960
 That sounds like a super power rock. Like I fall asleep fast. Yeah. Casey hates how easy

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.600
 I can fall asleep because it takes her a lot of she has like worked out really hard in

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.160
 a day. If she doesn't have a really good workout, then it's hard for her to fall asleep at night.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:52.040
 Just her mind is very active. Like a puppy. I always can fall asleep. Like if I lay down

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.640
 my head on a pillow, I will fall asleep. But I've had a hard time staying asleep, especially

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.520
 as I get excited about things. Yeah. Speaking of waking up, I think has reminded me of

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.960
 this thing. So I think the most scared I've ever been in my life was so I was when I was

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.860
 living in New York. I was asleep and I was around like five or six a.m. It was like the

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:20.480
 loudest explosion I have ever heard. Like a super, super loud like explosion and like

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.080
 the windows were rattling and I was like, Oh my God, we were hit by a bomb or like a

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.560
 nuke went off. And like I think a few weeks before that, like that, I don't know if you

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.760
 remember like some, some, I think it was like a chemical plant in Lebanon exploded and I

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.680
 was like, Oh, I do remember that. That's like a crazy huge explosion. Right. Like I just

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.720
 being completely asleep and then just waking up to that explosion ever. And I was just like

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:51.480
 what the and then, but it didn't seem like I couldn't see anything. There was like nothing

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:58.200
 visible. And it was just as like really weird. They call it like a bomb lightning or something.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:06.800
 It's like pretty rare. Whoa. But it's like this crazy, crazy loud lightning thunder situation.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.000
 But it is like the loudest. It just hit really close to you. Everyone like everyone in downtown

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.440
 Manhattan had the same experience. Like it's that loud. I don't even know where it hit.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.960
 It might not even been that close to me. But it is like, like I heard Carl Armstrong going

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:24.520
 off like yeah, wild. I've never heard of this. Terrifying to wake up to. I was like, Oh my

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.080
 God, I'm going to die. Like I wake up and I see like the World Trade Center right right

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.760
 from my window. Like that's where I live. And I was like, yeah. Oh my God. Like it got hit

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:38.040
 or something like the new one. You mean? Yeah, the new one. Yeah. Just you, you pointing

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.960
 out like the anytime like I learned of a new, a new thing that I feel like I should have

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.160
 known, like that knowledge gap, especially like a natural phenomenon. It reminds me of

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.640
 have you heard of a moon bow? No, never heard of that. So there's another kind of rainbow

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.840
 that happens at night. Like in the moonlight, it's like purple and blue. And it only happens

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.720
 in Hawaii. And you're going to have to look it up because I can't remember the science

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.160
 behind it. It's mind boggling that there's like a specific rainbow that only can happen

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.560
 in one little island in the world. But it's called a moon bow. And we discovered it we

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.360
 were when we went to Maui, we were doing the drive up Holly Akala. It's the like, yeah.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:22.880
 That's a good time. We're driving up at night. I mean, like in the early hours in the morning

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.320
 for the sun is up. And we see this what looks like a rainbow, but it's like purple and it's

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.600
 it doesn't look like a round of moon. No, it's like a rent like shaped like a rainbow would

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.440
 be like on the horizon. Okay. And we're like Googling like what in the world is that like

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:44.640
 what is a rainbow at night? It's a moon bow, wild. So I think I think it's only Hawaii.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.640
 I can't believe Hawaii exists. It's just like every it just has every crazy thing possible.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:55.120
 Mm hmm. Like a moon bow now like it already has volcanoes as a crater like yeah, I think

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.360
 doesn't Maui have like every one of the different climates or something has some crazy climate

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.680
 diversity. Oh, really? The different parts of Maui experience all these different microclimates.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.680
 Yeah, I mean, I think we've talked about before, but my main memory was thinking like like on

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:14.440
 that, that drive that you did, you could stop anywhere and just walk into the woods and

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.280
 you'll come across something that would be like the main attraction somewhere else. Like

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.480
 just like the most beautiful waterfall you've ever seen, but it's just like a side thing

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.280
 in Maui. Yeah, we did. We talked about the road to Hana probably. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.000
 time. Okay, we actually have stuff to talk about. And we're just we're just like, just

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 we're small talking. But like there's there's things. Well, you sent me a message yesterday

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.720
 about boomy. Let's talk about that because I was sad to hear. Well, maybe not sad to

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.520
 hear. I want to hear your thoughts. To me and Liz were talking yesterday and we are probably

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.720
 going to pivot from not probably we're definitely going to pivot from what we had been working

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:58.680
 on. I feel like in the past year, I've learned so much about mostly myself, like like a little

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.820
 bit about business, but it's like 50% about business, but I feel percent also myself. Again,

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.880
 it's not anything new. Of course, as I was complaining about the other day, like every

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.000
 time I go to start a company, I'm like, I've learned other lessons and then you like really

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.360
 learn them again. And you're like, this time, I really understand it. But it's all stuff

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.920
 that you've heard a million times before, but like I hit a threshold of like true, like

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:26.280
 understanding with it. And a lot of that was like kind of in conflict with what boomy was.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.160
 Yeah. So I would say like some of the fundamental things, you know, again, it's like mostly Liz

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:35.840
 working out full time. I just kind of worked on it here and there. But even with that, I

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:41.080
 have like this interesting side by side comparison where I held his work that I was doing for

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:48.080
 SST. And I was working, I had this work that I was doing for boomy. And the quality gap is

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:56.240
 like insane. It's like the stuff I do for SST is so, so, so, so much better. And fundamentals

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:01.960
 essentially, the key difference is that it was a product for myself. I built the stuff

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:08.920
 I built for SST is for myself. Yeah. And the level of motivation I have is just like, it

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.800
 just it's like, you can't even compare it. And then two, just like, I don't need to spend

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.720
 a bunch of time understanding the user, of course, I have questions here and there that

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:23.280
 I talked to people about, but yeah, fundamentally, like I know, like I really deeply understand

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.800
 like what is needed and what's good, because I'm just building it for myself. Yeah. And

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:33.520
 if you step back, choosing to not build for yourself means you're like crazy, like it's

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.760
 a crazy handicap that you're just accepting. Yeah, the communication barriers, like you're

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.280
 going to now have to get all that information from someone else. And that is the friction

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.720
 and the lossiness of communication. And then beyond that, it's, it's a prod, like what

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:54.520
 boom. So just for context, what boomy was originally or is right now is it's a product

00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:00.280
 for specific type of like healthcare type business. Liz used to work at companies that

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.920
 were in this category stuff, but and you think that's good. And it is good, because she has

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.400
 a lot of concerts, what's needed, but she no longer works at those companies. She's no

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.680
 longer a user using her product every single day, right? Yep. So it's interesting because

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:20.760
 I would say actually, most people are not users of their own product. I think most companies

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:25.880
 build for some kind of niche. And there's no, it's like weird to expect your employees

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.960
 to like somehow need the product. Yeah, right. So I don't think it's like a universal thing

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.840
 everyone has to do this. But just in my personal situation, I've just seen this like crazy

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:42.480
 gap between these two and I'm like, I'm basically saying that I'm choosing to build a business

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.200
 where the product is going to be 10 times worse. And that just doesn't isn't click. Then the

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:53.200
 second thing is, so J is, I mentioned before, J has been reading the Henry Ford book. And

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.960
 there's this line in there that he mentioned. And it's just like stuck in my head for the

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:04.760
 past two months. And I feel like I've explained so much of a lot of the challenges I've had

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:10.960
 in general, not just at this company, but like just widely. Yeah. And he says that his

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:16.680
 advice is if you're an inventor, go work on something everyone can use. And it's so simple.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:22.720
 But I'm like, that's actually clicks with me a lot. Like, I want to build something where

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.640
 every single one of my friends can use it. It's not like this weird niche thing that only

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.480
 some of my friends can use. Yep. And like Liz brought up in a different way where she

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.240
 was like, I don't ever want to be at a party and have someone ask what we do and then have

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.800
 it be this like eyes glaze over really complicated thing you can't really explain is I even though

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.280
 that's boring. It's like we couldn't even explain the previous thing because it was so like in

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.560
 a weird niche. Yeah, because the person you're talking to doesn't have the context just like

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.880
 you don't really have the same thing as you're talking about. So it's like a proxy for like

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.320
 if you can feel comfortable explaining to someone at a party, it's a good proxy for like, are

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.160
 you building something that's like fairly universal? Yeah. And obviously it's a spectrum like the

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.840
 most extreme end of the spectrum is like building a phone. Like that's something that everybody

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:13.840
 in the world literally would have. But even something like SST is way broader than a lot

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.480
 of stuff that I've worked at, right? Because oh, yeah, the target there is like potentially

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.680
 every developer in the world. Like there's not yeah, we have to like be amazing to actually

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:27.040
 hit that but there's a shot at every developer in the world. So I've like really learned that

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:33.040
 this idea of focusing on a niche is not what I want to do. And the one clear mistake we

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.480
 did, and this is probably the biggest lesson is everyone knows that when you get started,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:45.280
 you have to scope down your products to be an MVP. It's very easy to do that by scoping

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:51.240
 down your market instead of scoping down your product. So one thing we did, we kept scoping

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.160
 down like, oh, instead of like serving all of health care, we just serve like this one

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.160
 specific part and then like in that we just kept slicing it down. And that's how we got

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.760
 to like a theoretically simple MVP. But the reality of that is like, you just kind of

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.240
 eliminate your future like you'd like don't have anywhere to go. And yeah, your product

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.400
 actually doesn't even get that much simpler. Like it's so like a really complicated part.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.600
 So it's just like it's so obvious in hindsight, but it's like, yeah, yeah, we actually do

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.840
 is forgot a simple product. It's a complicated product for a small group of people. So it's

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.960
 kind of like the worst of both ends. Yeah, exactly. It's not the worst situation because

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:33.680
 this isn't the type of the benefit of doing this type of thing is like the revenue per

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.040
 customer is a lot bigger. So it's not like, yeah, we like did all this for like a $10

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.280
 month customer, right? No, right. Yeah. So I think the decision we made was with our

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:49.600
 existing customers, there was an opportunity to continue building what they wanted. And

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.360
 we would like grow, even just like the existing customers we have, they would just start paying

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.720
 like four or five times more. Yeah. But we said, okay, we're not going to chase that

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.340
 because even if we do that, there's like no clear way to like get a lot bigger. Yeah.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:07.640
 And that's that like will be the same amount of work as anything else that has like a much

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:12.600
 bigger opportunity. Yeah. So we have actually some ideas for the direction we want to go.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.200
 Like now that like, I'm able to find all these constraints of it has to be a product

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.840
 that I'm going to use. It has to be a product that a lot of people can use, maybe not every

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:25.720
 single person, but you know, a lot of people, they might not like it, but it could actually

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:31.880
 make sense for them to use. So we have some some ideas in that, but those constraints

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:37.600
 have been really helpful. So that's the next move. I was kind of going to head to is what's

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.140
 next. Like, yeah, it doesn't have to be specific things you're going to work on. But like,

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:47.920
 you're just going to sort of like find a new market new product, but generally like build

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:54.280
 a SaaS type thing. Is that not actually sure because like, the reality is, is like Liz

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.120
 can work. Liz is on this full time. Like that's like a full time. There's a lot of resources

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.480
 that we can allocate just like her full time effort. So it can be anything. And we're considering

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.800
 some stuff that's like a little bit weirder potential. But the thing that I mean, I can

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.900
 just share what's clicking. Yeah, I didn't want to pry too hard. It's like already a pretty

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.880
 vulnerable conversation. I didn't want to make you like spill it all out. But yeah, yeah.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:22.160
 No, so okay. So this is something that, okay, so the idea that's really clicking for us is

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.920
 funny because it's not novel at all. And it's been tried a million times before, which is

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.560
 just a personal finance app. There are a million, we've all tried a million. We got a really

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.400
 excited to use it for the first month, and then just want to shit. And then we never like

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.400
 really kept track of stuff. And we're all on the back of our head. Like, I really should

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.160
 keep better track of this than we never do. So my immediate reaction is like, there was

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:50.000
 like mint so long ago. And it took off, didn't it? Like mint did really well, got acquired,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.800
 I think, into it maybe. But then there have been like big ones since then. So it seems

00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:00.160
 like every five years, there's like a new one that is the one. What's the one that rocket

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.800
 money is pretty big? I use I use rocket money, which was which was true bill. And I got acquired

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.600
 by rocket mortgage and became rocket rocket money. So I would argue that like there's

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:14.560
 acquisition potential. Yeah, but more specifically, I would say once a product acquired, I don't

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.240
 think it's going to ever be better than it was. Yeah, yeah, it's worse from there. Yeah,

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:26.240
 exactly. But even so, so I currently use rocket money. And I think I, okay, so one, this is

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.000
 the reason this is a good choice is like, I'm very disorganized in a lot of parts of

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.920
 my life, but this is one of the areas where I'm like, like a crazy anal person, like I'm

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:42.880
 like, I'm like, very good about this stuff. I love money, as I've said many times before.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.640
 And I have just now what I need is actually very simple. And I've never found the right

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.980
 product and rocket money is close because it happens to have some of the features that

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.120
 I need and does things in the way that I need. Yeah. And honestly, genuinely, I actually

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.800
 like learned some stuff from using the app. Like I've developed new habits from using

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.320
 the app that are actually good. So I would say it's like, well executed. But the reality

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:07.040
 is is there is no linear for this category. No one has done like the amazing product.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.640
 Amazing experience, right? Yeah, that's one. And I've seen that I can achieve that when

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:17.080
 I care about the thing. Two, here's like a very classic issue that I don't know why

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.740
 no one's really I haven't seen anyone try to solve this. You connect your personal finance,

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.240
 you connect your bank accounts, you connect your credit card, get it all set up. What

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:32.280
 do you see? You see a pie chart and in the pie chart, it says 30% shopping category.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.800
 Every single thing in there is all your Amazon charges. Because everything from Amazon, I

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:42.200
 get more granular into that. So it's true. So we think that's like a nice initial hook

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.960
 of just like, so we have a friend where she's also like really seems like really like crazy,

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:53.680
 you know about this stuff. She literally downloads her Amazon order history as a CSV every month

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:59.120
 and like manually categorizes. Wow. Yeah. So now you add the concepts of LLMs that can

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.120
 just you can just say, Hey, here are like the 20 possible categories. Here's item description.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.240
 Here's item name. What category is it? It's probably going to do a pretty good job. Oh,

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:13.320
 yeah. So just having something that lets you connect Amazon and then say, okay, pipe this

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.560
 into a special you connect your Amazon account. I think you know, you could do that. So that's

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:23.160
 what you can do. It involves like screen scraping and stuff, but gotcha, whatever. That's that's

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.320
 you can, that's an obstacle you can get over, have a bunch of destination, just like Zapier,

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:33.160
 right? Like here in my sources, I want to have an always updated Google Doc with this stuff.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:39.480
 And that's like a really small initial thing. And from there, we can like add more sources.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.680
 We can add more destinations. And then we can kind of build, slowly build like a full type

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.040
 of thing that just just for me and Liz, like just for me and Liz, what we need to run our

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.320
 household. Yeah. So that's like kind of exciting for us. There's like just the other thing that

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:59.280
 I realize is when you have an idea, you want to be drowned by like other ideas that you

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.360
 want to do on top of it, right? You have an idea where it's like, you're not really thinking

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.040
 of like a hundred things you want to do. It's maybe not the right thing. Whereas with this,

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.000
 we're like, Oh, we have this other problem. We have that other problem. Like there's just

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.680
 so much. Yeah. Just layer stuff on top forever. Yeah. So my initial thoughts, first, I mean,

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:23.120
 obviously, big category could be every person. I mean, that's every person, right? Every adult,

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:30.000
 two or second, whatever I said, I don't know. So I think like when mint did this so long ago,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.480
 they had to like, they would have had to like build out all the integrations with the banks,

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.960
 right? And today, there's like plaid. He's just like connected, but that's awesome. That's just

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.320
 such an advantage to be able to build all the actual useful stuff on top without all the plumbing.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.480
 Do you know plaid started? They just started screen scraping also. They would just like have

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.800
 a browser that would just type in your password and lock into the bank. Are you serious? They're

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.000
 just like to a face effect. Then even even today, I think a lot of their integrations are so

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.880
 powered that way, because they still ask for your password. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You put it in your

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.880
 credentials. Yeah. Yeah. Like there's no OAuth. So they're actually just like headless browser

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:12.080
 opening the thing. And are you serious? Yeah, it just thought it's so much more sophisticated

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.880
 than that. Yeah. Well, I've seen like most of my my current bank, Mercury, they actually implemented

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.520
 OAuth or some some kind of flow that it does seem like it's OAuth. And I'm like, duh, like,

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:28.000
 obviously, this is like, why am I setting my password to plaid? Yeah. But yeah, it's yeah,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.640
 it's so much easier now than I was. And they like also do, they also like try to like clean

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.520
 up the transactions and stuff. That's another thing where every single one of these apps,

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:43.280
 you do need to override some of the auto categorizations. Yeah. But it's always like kind of annoying

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:48.800
 to set up. And I like the idea of connecting all my stuff in one place and clean up the

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:53.520
 transactions in one place and then piping it to wherever I need it. Like, yeah, I want to create a

00:23:53.520 --> 00:24:01.040
 view that's like all transactions, over $500, whatever for this thing. I want everything in that

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.200
 view to go to a Slack channel so I can see the transactions as I come in. Maybe I want to go to

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.120
 a spreadsheet. Maybe I want to do whatever. Like, there's just like a lot of things that I personally

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.960
 need. So this might be way beyond what you're thinking in terms of scope. But if you got into

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.880
 business stuff and could replace QuickBooks for me, that would be great. I'd give you all money.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:24.080
 Okay. So that we also considered that concept because that was another clear pain point I have,

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:30.320
 like just when we've talked about before, like I've tried so many different self-employed type,

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.880
 like invoicing expense tracking products. And I just keep talking about the QuickBooks,

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.720
 because at least I know how it works. But yeah, with this, I actually want to see if I can get

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.360
 rid of the expense tracking at least in QuickBooks. If I have everything perfectly categorized and

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.560
 I can just create a view that's just transactions for my business card and then get a report

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.440
 broken down by category, that's literally what just goes into your tax form. And then all I

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:59.120
 would need is an invoicing, invoicing tracking thing, which is I can find some other minimal

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.000
 invoicing product for that. Man, I hate seeing the charge every month for QuickBooks.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.160
 It's so expensive. It's so expensive and I'm just trapped. I just know I'm going to pay

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:14.000
 it for the rest of my life. And it's just not a good product, it's just a mess. It's just so bad.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.480
 Yeah, into it, their whole, they're freaking trifecta of how it's like they own mints,

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:27.040
 they own QuickBooks, they own TurboTax. It's the worst. Yeah, it's just the pain. But yeah,

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.480
 like as we're talking, there's like a million little ideas. I'm excited. I'm excited for you guys.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:38.560
 It's like moving, I just love moving into a new house or just moving into a new to you house.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.880
 Like there's something about the feeling of a big change in life where you're kind of like

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:48.320
 entering new territory. Just love it. Yeah, it's great. Plus like we've, in a lot of ways,

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.760
 we've kind of been in denial for a while. Because I just don't think the product we built was very

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.880
 good. And I think it took us a while to like, say it out loud. I can't, I can't say anything.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.880
 I've never seen it. So I mean, I'm not a doctor. It's a problem. There's no reason for you or

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:10.000
 anyone else. Yeah. I mean, it's kind of interesting though, because it ended up being more of a

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.920
 consultancy. Like I built like a very, very generic product. Yeah. And it doesn't really need that

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:22.160
 much upkeep. And Liz uses it to like almost consult with these customers, like help them

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:28.160
 do operation stuff. And she said consulting that comes with our own product. So that's nice.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:34.240
 And that's like a nice fallback. Like, you know, she can always kind of explore that. And she has

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:39.680
 like a weird specialty in this area. But it's just not like a business that's going to be

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:45.600
 giants. Yeah. That's that's like a big thing that again, I've like always shot away from being like,

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:51.040
 I've had this weird thing where I've always like would see these giant companies and I would kind

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.160
 of be like, Oh yeah, that's why I'm never going to be me. Like, who am I to do something like that?

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.440
 But lately, I just really understood that you might as well shoot for something big because

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.960
 it's not any harder. Like it's always hard no matter what it is. And like, you actually don't need

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:13.280
 anything that special. Really? Like I've just seen like how stupid part like there's very level

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:19.600
 success. Like regardless of that. So the bar is low. It just reminded me like you're kind of like

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:26.400
 going into this maintenance mode with this app. serverless apps do really well on maintenance.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.920
 But I know in my limited experience, like I built, I built a thing in the healthcare kind of

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.040
 dentist dental space. But it's like three years ago. Yeah, I think it was three years ago,

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.880
 built like this app for managing it's like this big dentist office here that they have.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:46.480
 It's like a giant. It's nuts. But they manage all their patient. Like,

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.160
 the doctor needs them now they per whatever. Yeah, hygienists is cleaning them now and they just

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.280
 kind of like manage our whole whatever office workflow. So I built this app and it's all serverless

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:03.360
 stuff. I think like since they went live with it three years ago, there's been like twice.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:08.560
 It's maybe like every year when daylight savings happens. There's like a dependency on some stupid

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.520
 library that like their appointments disappear for two hours and then they come back. And then

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.280
 I guess I've never fixed it because I think that happened again this year. Anyway, that's like

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.640
 the it's it. I mean, it's I mean, it's one office. It's not like this giant deployment where there's

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:28.400
 like bigger potential for things to go haywire. But it's pretty incredible. That was not my

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.000
 experience at least early in my career. Maybe part of it's just getting later in the career,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.280
 but early in my career, I remember building these for people and it broke literally every

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.840
 month and like just constantly having to take care of something. Yeah, we were actually talking

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.720
 about this exact same thing yesterday because when I was first learning serverless, I built

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.600
 like a calmly alternative. Oh, yeah. It's funny. Like I should just double down on that because

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.560
 Cal.com came out and like became huge. Yeah. That was stupid of me. There's a few of those too.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:59.040
 Savvy Cal. Sorry. Yeah. But I would have made it open source, which was like the key thing.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:04.080
 And this new whatever thing we work on is also going to be open source as well. Just again,

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:09.200
 just from like a people can look at it not for like any actual reason. But yeah, we were talking

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.320
 about yesterday. This was when I was first first. It was my first attempt at doing anything

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.880
 serverless and I did everything pretty much wrong compared to how I do it now. Despite that,

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:25.440
 like it's still up and it works. And it's weird how that's like such a novel experience that,

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:30.160
 wow, like this thing could just continue to exist like without like I forgot that it even existed.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.920
 Yeah. You know, and it's still fine. And the same thing that you said like prior to that,

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:39.120
 I would need some kind of monitoring up. I would need some kind of like memory

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:44.640
 on for something and we're like, yeah, something would kind of grow and then need to be restarted.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.800
 Like it's just there's a maintenance burden was always there. And it's crazy that I just

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.320
 have forgotten about this thing. And I can still go to the URL and it works perfectly.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:58.640
 Yeah. Well, some might say it's future. I think it is. Yeah. I think we're past that. I don't know.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:06.080
 I still see people. I still see debate over it. But I mean, yeah, I have like input that I would

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.560
 love to provide at some point when I've cleared it with my employer. I mean, just in terms of

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:16.320
 serverless and scaling and costs and like, I don't know, I don't see a lot of the cons that

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:21.040
 you would traditionally think like, oh, don't use serverless because it's really expensive

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:26.480
 at scale or it's really whatever. Yeah, I don't think any of that has affected us.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.000
 Yeah, I'm excited for you to be able to talk about that more because I think so many,

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:36.640
 I think the one thing that bothers me is there's kind of these like

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:43.760
 platitudes almost that everyone says where I mean, one of the things you said like, oh,

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:47.280
 yeah, like when you start, you use serverless. And then when you get bigger,

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.160
 right, you can refund that seems like a measured smart person take like you're not saying it

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.600
 sucks or saying like, Oh, yeah, I use it here. And then I don't use it there. Yeah. But like,

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:59.920
 you're just making that up. Like, no, I don't think that's like a real thing. It just sounds

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:04.720
 reasonable because it's like 5050 on both sides. So people are like, Oh, it's true. The reality,

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:11.280
 I think is actually kind of unreasonable, which is no, like 95% of things never need to change.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:16.720
 And it's actually a weird exception that does need to maybe rework itself at some point. And

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.800
 yeah, I think the stuff that you work on, there's a bunch of like narrative violations like that

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.680
 where it's like, while we're doing the exact opposite of what you're saying,

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.280
 makes sense at like, yeah, at this amount of traffic. So yeah, it'll be interesting to see all that.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:36.320
 Yeah, most people, it's like, oh, yeah, you'll switch off a serverless once you hire like a dev,

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:41.520
 a dev ops team. It's like, why is that a requirement? When you grow, do you have to have a dev ops

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:47.760
 team? Also, you can manage your, your clusters and stuff. Like, what if you didn't have to?

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.200
 Yeah, it's because eventually you want to like get the cost down or like, it's just like generic

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.440
 stuff like that where I'm like, okay, I know that you've actually never been in the position to make

00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.000
 that decision. Because it's just like a random thing that's just sounds like it makes sense.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.440
 Yeah, another one I hear constantly, and I talk about this a lot where whenever a company talks

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:10.880
 about, especially like a smaller company talks about their process, like maybe they don't do

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:16.080
 certain things, maybe they don't have like a stand up or maybe they like don't do pull request

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:23.680
 reviews. I love what they're called PR reviews. I've been so long. I feel they're called PR reviews.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:31.040
 Is that right? It sounds weird to me. Okay. Yeah. You always see people being like,

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.880
 oh, yeah, that works for you, but it won't work when you're at like 200 people. And I'm like,

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:39.120
 okay, why the hell is that an assumption that you need to? Yeah, right. As you get successful,

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.640
 you're also going to have 100, 200 people to illustrate to what extreme that this happens in.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:49.760
 This happened to the linear people. So like a couple of weeks ago, to linear has been a lot

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.480
 more public about talking about how they build their company. And there's so many of these like

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:59.280
 violations in there. Like they don't, they do a lot of things that are just so different from

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:05.920
 other companies operate. And they posted about it. And again, you can't say anything to them because

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:10.000
 they just crush it on the product. They're deliverable is amazing is it not questionable.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.200
 They make they make money. They make a crazy amount of money for a size they are. They're just so

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.600
 successful in every dimension. They talked about their process. And of course, there was a

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.720
 whole bunch of people being like, Oh, yeah, that'll work for you for now. But like, you know,

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:30.960
 you'll see when you get so that someone from notion was like, some sales person that notion

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.360
 was like, Oh, yeah, like we tried doing that. But then after a certain size, like, here's all the

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:42.800
 reasons why it's not going to work for you. And they were just like, like fuck off. The funniest

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:50.240
 part is the current head, the COO, the operate the deal at linear, yeah, work that notion. So

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:57.280
 someone is like explaining. It's just like, you cannot escape this that people will always try to

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:03.040
 tell you what's best for you. And like even someone like linear can't escape that the linear

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.200
 founders can escape that like we're all screwed like people are always going to be telling us that.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:13.840
 Oh, that's cute. But it's not really going to work. Just yeah, it just pays in the modern age to

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:20.160
 have some discernment and judgment to build a thing for yourself. And just yeah, just get off

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:28.160
 Twitter. I just people, I don't know the Twitter mob that has opinions on all the things. Can I

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:34.720
 tell you like a totally, totally ship. Is that okay? Okay. This is like privilege problems or

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.520
 something. I don't know if I need to explain this. My favorite category.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:47.040
 So I'm building a home theater. And we had a home theater in our last house. And we spent

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:51.440
 all of our time in there. Granted, we didn't have kids yet. But like, watch stuff all the time.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:59.120
 Loved our home theater. And as I go about specking out and ordering equipment and like

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.640
 figuring out what this theater is going to be, last time I had like a company do it,

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.200
 this time I'm just doing it because they just, they didn't do a very good job. And I just knew

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.720
 when they said certain products were gonna be good, they weren't. And they wouldn't be.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:15.200
 Anyway, so I'm just taking matters in my own hands. It's kind of a fun hobby for me. But

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:23.360
 I've ordered a like this 140 inch Stuart film screen, amazing, like fantastic screen that I'm

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.240
 very excited about, acoustically transparent. So you put your your left and right channel

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:32.320
 speakers behind it. Behind it. Oh, cool. Yeah. And that's what we did in our last house. It was a

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.280
 drag and fly acousta weaved screen, but basically the same idea. Acoustically transparent. You put

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.200
 your center and your left and right speakers behind it. And those get mounted in the wall.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:48.000
 So I've ordered a screen and I've ordered my LCR speakers. So my, my front speakers. Nothing

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.800
 else yet. And yesterday talking with Casey, okay, this is just, it's gonna sound like a spousal

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.840
 like dispute conversation. And that's, I guess that's kind of what it is. But, but it's, it's

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:04.320
 on my mind. And I just feel like I need them. Get it out. We're talking through the theater. And

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:10.800
 she doesn't want it to be surround sound. What is a home theater without like, oh, no,

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:16.720
 without a brand. Oh my God. This is like driving me insane. Because I love surround sound. I love

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:22.000
 it so much. I'm just so in the sound. And like spatial audio is such a cool thing. And you get

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.360
 the atmos speakers up in the ceiling and just top. It's amazing. Like the feeling of hearing

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:33.040
 something behind you when you're watching a movie. Yeah. In her eyes, we should have this 140 inch

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:38.320
 screen and this amazing projector. And then maybe, I don't know, just put a sound bar

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:43.440
 up below the screen with that work in the theater. No, well, it wouldn't because I've ordered speakers.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.760
 But also, please know, this is what's going to happen. Dax, could you convince her that it's good?

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.760
 Hang on, what's her? What's her reasoning? Is it just like a complexity, a price thing?

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.480
 No, no, no, she's very sensitive to sound. And I know this, but we had it theater and she loved it.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:03.120
 I just turned things up too loud. But if I can change, I really can. I cannot feel it. She says,

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:08.480
 I like to feel it. And I do. I like to feel it. But I will, I'll convince myself that I don't

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:14.160
 like to feel it. But it's got to be around me. Yeah, exactly. So you're not trying.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.400
 The thing that's amazing about surround sound isn't the loudness. It's the immersion.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:23.120
 Exactly. That's what you need to be loud, even if it's just like a little bit of, because I mean,

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:28.640
 we had a, even in our pre-department, we had rear speakers and like, they would be pretty quiet,

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.640
 but you would just hear like, just stuff going on there once in a while. And it made a big difference

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:37.280
 immersion thing. So it sounds a big loud. So she cites our previous theater that the

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.880
 rears were too loud and you can hear the dialogue. And I'm like, yeah, that was their problem.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.840
 They messed it up. They didn't, they didn't do a good job. I'll do a good job. But then she says,

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:51.440
 she doesn't like surround sound. It triggered. She bothers her. Just sounds around her trigger.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:57.120
 Wait, so do the rear speakers go in the wall? Yes. Okay. So just put them in the wall and she

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:03.200
 won't know they're there. I mean, you're banking on this. She doesn't listen to this podcast,

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:09.840
 which she doesn't. But, but also that she can't hear anything behind you. Just be like, oh,

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:16.480
 that's like real life noises. Those bullets are actually flying around outside of her house.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:21.120
 That's funny. Oh, that's tough, though, man. That's like, I don't know what to do. Yeah,

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.840
 I don't know what to do. For me, the whole effort is not even, it's not worth it.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.000
 It's not, but I've already got this huge screen coming. We can have this giant visual,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.200
 this amazing picture and no audio. The audio is so important. It's, it's more probably a bigger

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.280
 part than the visual. Yeah, it's more immersive. Yeah. She disagrees. But that's what I say.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.440
 So I don't know why I told you this. I just need you to solve this problem for me. Liz is also

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:48.080
 sensitive to sound. And it's got worse after COVID and actually got worse for all of us, I think.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.600
 Because I think we just, I remember, I don't know if I should have this already, but

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.560
 again, we loved going to the theater. Big thing me and my friends always did.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.640
 Yep. Couldn't do it during COVID. So then once the theaters opened back up,

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:06.000
 the first movie we saw there was King Congress Godzilla, which is like the loudest movie you could

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.400
 possibly go to in our next also. And we, I like couldn't stand like the last 20 minutes.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.960
 Oh, it's just too loud. It was just so, so, so loud. Well, you're not, you're not helping me

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.400
 here to act. This is not helping my case. Well, here's the thing. That's just a theater thing.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.000
 That wasn't like a universal thing. Yeah. We can control the volume. We can turn it down.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.400
 That argument has not worked so far though. My point in saying this is I can be empathetic to

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.760
 that because I have like seen how annoying it is. But yeah, it's not a loudness thing.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.400
 It's it's really not. It's no, it's a quality. It's a version that worries that

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:44.560
 once they're in there, it's going to become a loudness thing. So this whole thing is about trust

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.240
 at the end of the day. She says, no, you convinced me of it. And then they're here. You have all of

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.400
 it set up and then you can turn it up when you want to. And I'm saying like, what if I want to

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.800
 listen to it when it's loud? Maybe, maybe I still want to listen to it loud, but like just the two

00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.960
 of us. And then when you're here, yeah, when she's here, you just turn off the rear speakers. If that's

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:06.880
 a problem. Oh, that's brilliant. Oh, I knew I should tell you this. You have an answer. That's the

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:12.400
 answer. We can physically unplug them to like prove that they're not plugged. I mean, no,

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.160
 because they're in the wall. That would be very hard. But they go to the receiver, right?

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.560
 Oh, yeah. But she could. Okay, so she'd go. It's gonna be like in a whole another room behind the

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:26.560
 theater. I mean, it's not that she would literally do this, but she has control over what happens.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:30.160
 But I could also just have like, we could just have like a stereo mode. And you're just like,

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:35.200
 we turn on stereo mode when she's in the theater. I love it. Okay. Thank you. I think you saw my

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:40.080
 problem. Well, I mean, if if that fly if that is a reasonable compromise for her, I think so.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.880
 Because I think it won't have any sound coming behind her. It will all be in front of her.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:52.000
 I couldn't even explain to her, like why a soundbar would not do justice for a visual like that.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.280
 She's like, what? You can hear it. Like you'd be able to hear the words. Who cares? I'm like,

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:04.160
 no, it's just like, can I understand what they said? Cool. That it's good.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.480
 We, uh, me and Liz have this thing where we joke. We like have like these joke titles

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:16.720
 for each other and for different areas of responsibilities. And I'm the master of entertainment. Oh, nice.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:22.400
 So I just, or it's a master of, I might, we have a few different things. I know a master of time

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:27.680
 and that it's my job to get us to places on time. Oh, yeah, nice. She cannot do that.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:35.600
 Also, master of entertainment. So anything in this category, she just is like, does not. Yeah,

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:41.520
 you got it. She checks out entirely. And I tried to deliver like a good experience for everyone.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.840
 Yeah, apparently I've broken that trust at some point. So I am not given the master of

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:51.440
 entertainment label. Yeah, it's now, it's now a, what's it called? It's now a committee of

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:56.960
 entertainment. Yes. It's very much a committee. I can hope that it's a committee. It may not be.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:06.400
 It may still be a master. I'm just not the master. Yeah, damn. That would, I can really empathize

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.640
 with you in this situation, because I can really imagine like how desperate I want the best set up

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:19.040
 and like someone saying I can't have it would just. Yeah, I have always had like a huge emphasis on

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:26.080
 audio going back to literally my first job ever. I was a lifeguard in high school. And I used literally

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:31.760
 all my money that summer on a car stereo, like put every dollar I earned as a lifeguard into this

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.080
 car stereo. And it was incredible. Now I sound like a total nerd. I was the guy in high school that

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:40.320
 cared about his car studio. But is that nerdy? That doesn't sound nerdy to me. I don't know.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.080
 Maybe it's not nerdy. I don't know. I was just super into sound. I'm like listening to

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:53.440
 this is nerdy. Like James Taylor. Like super nerdy, like old people music. But I just loved

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:58.800
 good audio. And then every computer setup, every like entertainment setup we've ever had,

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:04.720
 we've had giant, awesome audio. And it's just hard. It's hard not to have that. And she knows

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:10.480
 that she's using it against me. She knows that I've always invested in this. She thought I regretted

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:15.280
 it though. She's like, think of all the times you've put all that money into audio and then like,

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:20.800
 look, did it really pay? I'm like, yes, it did. I love to read it. She thinks I regretted,

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.360
 because I one time I said that it was stupid that I put all my money into a car studio when I was

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.640
 in high school. And it was stupid. I still loved it. I wouldn't do anything differently

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:34.400
 just to be able to stupid. But you're like, I should have invested it in Apple stock.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:44.800
 Yeah. Now the audio makes a huge difference. And I maybe this isn't obvious, but for watching

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:50.320
 movies, the immersion, it's like the audio will go 10 times further. Oh, for sure. You can even

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:56.960
 have like a 1080p thing if you have good audio. I feel insane. But also like, just get a 4K thing.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:03.200
 Yeah. Oh, man. Projectors have come. Projectors have come so far in the last few years. Like,

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:10.400
 we built ours like 10 years ago. And that just the amount of projector you get for the money now is

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.080
 is kind of nice. I mean, with that pixel shifting thing too. Like, that's what we have in our bedroom.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:20.240
 I know it's not like the full 4K, but the pixel shifting 4K projectors are like a third

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:24.240
 or fourth of the price. Yeah. And like, it's really hard to tell a difference

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:29.520
 with that and like authentic. I mean, it just like, and we also have the the short throw. Oh, yeah.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.200
 Because we don't like for us, we got that as a good flexible setup, because this is when we're

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.560
 going back to work between Miami and we're like, no matter what house we live in, there's going

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.200
 to be some more. Yeah, if you don't know, you're going to have a dedicated like full length space,

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:47.440
 then that's way more flexible. Yeah. So this like short throw 4K projector covers our whole wall.

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:53.520
 And it like looks fantastic. And it wasn't even that expensive. And yeah, like you're never going

00:44:53.520 --> 00:45:00.000
 to get a TV that size. And I actually, before like, before we started building what is going to be

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.880
 the theater, I thought like maybe we'll just put a TV in there, like get a TV big enough, like,

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:10.000
 I don't know, to make huge TVs these days. And then then just like, I can chill and not do the whole

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.760
 theater thing and like obsess over it. But then it's like that room, that wall, they're not TVs big

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:19.840
 enough. There really aren't, you can't get a TV that like fills that wall. And it would just look

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:24.960
 super mousey. And then the room, like you'd be so far away from it. So and then once you started

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.600
 on the projector route, it's you're all in. Yeah, we did invest in like a really good TV a couple

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:36.000
 years ago, like a really good OLED one. That was also a shocking thing, because I cannot believe

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.560
 how thin TVs have gotten. Oh, yeah. Yeah, like the TV we had, it's an LG OLED, just one of the LG ones.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:50.400
 It's it's like too thin when we were transporting it the from from New York, the movers spent like

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:56.080
 20 or 30 minutes wrapping it because it is like super super thin. It is like almost paper thin.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.600
 It's like thinner than your phone, like thinner than any other electronic device you have.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:04.560
 And I'm like, did they need to go this far? Like, is there like a benefit to go ahead?

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.960
 Because I don't need to be this thing at all. Yeah, it just like some of the things they can

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.120
 improve you too. It literally flexes like if you like lift it, it like bends and stuff and

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.960
 I'm like, you just feel so delicate. That's the OLED specifically, right? Like they can't do that

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:22.320
 with like an LCD. Yeah, yeah, exactly. With OLED, they can make them ship it then. And it does look

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.320
 cool against the wall, but and we did do like a flush mountain, everything. So it's like right

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:33.680
 up against the wall. But we know what we also got. We also have the the rear lighting behind the TV.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:39.200
 Ooh, is that nice? Yeah, it actually is really nice. It's like connected to the like it knows

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:44.400
 what the picture showing it colors based on that's cool. Yeah, so like, so that this looks at whatever

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:50.080
 colors at the edge of the screen and like, yeah, spills over. Yeah, especially when you're when

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:54.480
 you're watching like a really stylized movie and like you turn off all lights, like it looks very

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:58.240
 cool. Yeah, it's obviously a similar effect to a projector because the projector is like emitting

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:02.160
 a lot of light and covering the whole wall anyway. But yeah, it just kind of makes it feel

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:10.560
 bigger. Yes, I love movies. I love like the theater. I always did. In case you just so not into it,

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.920
 that I find myself like carrying less about it every year. But now it's kind of been like

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:22.160
 perked back up just putting the theater together. It's I'm remembering how much I care about movies.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:26.000
 Yeah, it is like a giant waste of time and like objectively she can point that out and it's like,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.800
 I guess so. Yeah, we're not really like interacting compared to what you guys not talk during movies,

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:35.920
 like me and Liz talk constantly about the whole movie. I'm not really a big movie talker. Yeah,

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:42.080
 I'd rather like watch the movie. I mean, okay, some like when we're at the theater,

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:46.560
 we definitely are not talking as much as usually like no, it's bigger movies. But at home, we're like,

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:51.520
 just talking a whole time and you can pay attention. You can like know what's going on or do you just

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:57.680
 not care? Well, it's funny because yes. So very specifically, me and Liz love talking

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.280
 through movies and that's like something that we like enjoyed doing together and we've talked

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:06.160
 about that a lot. But yesterday, she was like, you know what, I'm going to be honest. I'm tired

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:15.360
 of pretending that I can both talk and pay attention. So yeah, certain scenes like definitely if it's

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:20.960
 like very critical to the plot, like I think we'll have to quiet down for. But yeah, yeah,

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:25.600
 I have no issue with it. But yeah, I can recognize it's challenging. But we also always have subtitles

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:33.760
 on. So like me talking is an obscuring. Yeah, I see you waiting and just I don't turn on subtitles.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:39.040
 But also like trying to read and have a conversation and keep up with the plot. Now I just can't do

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.880
 it. Oh, really? It's very, I feel it's very, I think it feels pretty normal. I mean, I think

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:48.400
 you're just kind of prioritizing like the relationship, the communication more than the entertainment,

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:54.320
 which is good. Just like, well, I'm saying that's why it doesn't feel like a complete waste of time.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:59.760
 Yeah, no, it's a point. Okay. Yeah, that's good. But I will. So we're also kind of going through a

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:05.600
 little bit of a shift with our movie stuff. So I think for a while now, I feel like I'd seen

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:11.600
 every movie I wanted to see. But only because I had this weird thing where to be honest, we were,

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:17.680
 we definitely watched good movies, but only like obviously good movies that were like

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.720
 extremely mainstream, like a Christopher Nolan movie that, of course, like going to be a fantastic

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:28.000
 movie, but also like everyone's going to see it. Yeah, like a Netflix special movie where there's

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.040
 like some hiking and that girl from not like that. I don't, I don't really understand.

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:37.680
 Like a good good movie. Like where you know, it's really going to be good. I don't even

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.040
 want to talk about that. Like I can't really, I like just don't even understand the thought process

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:46.960
 behind that. I don't either. So and then the rest of the movies we've watched are kind of like junk

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:52.080
 food movies. We're like, you know, not necessarily good, but they're like easy to decide to watch.

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:57.360
 Yeah. And I've had this weird mental block where I knew there was like a massive set of like

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:02.080
 genuinely good movies that I know that once I was sorry to watch them, I would really deeply

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:07.920
 enjoy. But as like weird mental block of like choosing those movies, we, I'd always be like,

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.320
 ah, let me pick this like easier to choose movie instead. Like I know what to expect.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:17.120
 But we finally got over that in the last month and we've been using my friend really got into this

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:22.640
 app, Letterbox, which is like just like the app for like movie nerdy movie people.

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:28.000
 And it's helped to discover like, like genuinely really good movies. And we've just been watching

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.840
 stuff off that. And it's like, wow, there's like a huge collection of like awesome stuff that we just

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:39.120
 haven't seen. So we've been going through that and like watching like really good movies.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.920
 And when you think of a really good movie, you like imagine something kind of boring.

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:47.200
 But some of these are like comedy, some of these are like really funny, like kind of really excellent

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.480
 stuff. So yeah, it just feels like we have like a reawakening for

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.160
 says called Letterbox. And it's just like gives you recommendations.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:59.680
 No, so their thing is it's not algorithmic at all. So there's not a single portion of that is

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:06.480
 algorithmic. It's all user generated stuff. So it's just like, there's like a culture on the app.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.320
 And it's like a pretty good culture. Like it's not like so pretentious where it's just like these

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:15.520
 weird obscure movies that you know, you have to like be a film major to understand why it's good.

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:19.440
 But it's also like just really good stuff that I think is also pretty accessible. Like people

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:24.400
 make these lists of like people just like think of these like interesting categories of movies.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:29.040
 And I'll make lists for them so you can then like explore like stuff in that category for a while.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:33.440
 Yeah, I've just found just really, really good stuff. It hasn't been hard to find

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.480
 stuff there that I've really enjoyed. So we've just been going through that.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:41.200
 Okay, I'm going to check it out because we're terrible at picking movies. Yeah, we watched one

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:46.400
 yesterday or two days ago called it's called a Banshees of Insurance or his name out of his Irish

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:53.920
 town and in the take place in the 1920s in Ireland. But it was so brilliant because the premise is

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:59.280
 it's a super small town, extremely simple life. Like everyone has their farm. They go to the pub

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:04.640
 to PM everyone knows each other. Yeah, there's no decisions to make in life. Like you know your job,

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.640
 you know your role. Everyone's like really happy and it feels like it seems like an amazing peaceful

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:16.000
 life. And there's these two guys. One's an older one, one's like more our age. And they were friends,

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.680
 they would hang out every single day. And randomly one day, the one friend was like,

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.200
 I don't want to be friends with you anymore. Don't talk to me ever again.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:29.040
 And they're trying to understand like what the hell is going on. And like he explains that

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:36.640
 he has this extremely modern feeling that just is so out of place in this time, which is

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:42.720
 this isn't the best use of my time. I have a limited amount of time left. How can I maximize

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:49.040
 like, wow, what I spend my time on is talking like making small talk with you for hours.

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:52.880
 Is that a good use of my time? No, he's like a violinist. He's like, I want to like,

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:57.840
 I should be spending my time like creating great works of music and like you like hyper optimizing

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:05.120
 like every single day. And it's so crazy out of place in this society where like the question of

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.880
 like, what are you supposed to be doing with your time does not even enter people's minds.

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:12.960
 And he like is he's like, you can tell this guy's depressed because it's entered his mind.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.720
 And he came up the stuff. And the other guys are obviously very upset. And it's like this

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:22.560
 brilliant like exploration of this concept. And it's like so relevant to it's a comedy,

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:26.080
 like it's it's pretty funny. Yeah, it just makes you think about how much,

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:32.080
 yeah, maybe it's like our circles, the, the higher achiever types.

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:36.160
 I mean, just everyone has so much choice in every single thing in their life. And like,

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:40.080
 just contrast it with all these people that just seem so happy despite having no freedom,

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:44.720
 it makes you like think about, yeah, we can talk about it more another time. But like Liz

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.560
 found this philosopher that like this is his whole thing. And she was explaining this to me

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:53.840
 after we watched the movie where he like talks about how there's so much depression and anxiety.

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.760
 Even when we do things that are traditional, we like turn it into this like stupid way of

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:04.560
 looking at it. Like we're always like self improving or like, you know, working ourselves or like

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:09.920
 anything we do is an act of like optimizing ourselves. Yep. Yep. Even when we're trying to

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:15.120
 like mimic the times of old, like with community and with, yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's always

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:19.760
 for taking it all. And it's all just like for self improvement. Yeah. Yeah. And this guy,

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:26.640
 this guy, this philosopher's like really against social media and he's not on it at all. And Liz

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.000
 feels like it explains literally like she's actually had a lot of these thoughts herself.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.720
 And I feel like it feels like it like perfectly puts words to this. And this movie coincidentally

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.600
 happened to kind of, I feel like it definitely it seemed to me like that was a theme. I don't

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:44.240
 know if we were projecting that onto it. But like to me, like the joke was that this is just like

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:51.840
 a super modern dude like this. Yeah, the traditional world. Yeah. Okay. So that is a topic for another

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.880
 day because this is something case. And I think we've talked about it, but we talked about a lot,

00:54:54.880 --> 00:55:02.720
 like just modern struggles in terms of our very connected world. I really have to pee. And I want

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:06.240
 to talk for longer because I have more I want to talk about, but we're gonna have to stay that

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.680
 because I just have to really pee or really have to pee and come back. We want to keep going.

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:21.120
 Could pee and come back. Do you want to keep going? Yeah. Okay. Just pause. Okay. I'll be right back.
