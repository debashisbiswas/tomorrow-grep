00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 Oh, oh bad, on the other side, it's on the dark side of your...

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:13.720
 Oh, the cut, like stabbing and cutting, just like, ugh, the idea just gives me the hibbly jibilis.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.380
 Ugh, do you need something like that? Is it that deep?

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:24.240
 Oh, I don't know, no, no, no, I don't want to, ugh, ugh, ugh, like peeling an apple, like that kind of, ugh.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:47.360
 ♪♪♪

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.620
 Your background looks different.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.160
 Yeah, I moved, I literally moved my office across the house, into a different room entirely.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.180
 Wait, really?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.680
 Yeah, we, uh, we switched the workout room and my office.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.240
 How come?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.160
 Well, theoretically, over here, there will be no noise.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.020
 I don't have to deal with the kids running around upstairs.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.240
 It just should be like, I can record any time without disrupting the house.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.480
 And I'm trying to get the Pro To Be Us self-paced stuff done.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.280
 That's gonna take, uh, some dedicated quiet time in the house, and that's impossible.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.980
 So, we moved my office.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.480
 It was actually a huge, huge undertaking.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.200
 Uh, because as you know, the fiber terminates in my office closet.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.100
 I was just gonna say that, I was gonna say that fiber no longer making your office, or does it?

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.960
 The fiber terminates there, uh, but the modem is the only thing in that closet now, and it sends, uh, it's connected through ethernet.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.320
 I moved my server rack across the house, which meant electricians running new dedicated circuits.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.580
 I mean, it was like a huge undertaking, uh, but it all went pretty smooth.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.880
 It was like one day, it took a whole day.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.660
 I was really sore the next day, uh, so I did this on Wednesday.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.020
 Yesterday, my toes, everything somehow is sore from moving all this heavy stuff.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.600
 Isn't it funny that no matter how much you work out, the moment you do, like, a different motion?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.940
 That's not what you've been doing.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.200
 It's just like, you suck at life again.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.540
 You find all the little things that have not been worked out, yeah.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.540
 Yeah.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.720
 'Cause I had to move our gym, which had, like, some crazy heavy stuff.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.240
 I'd get a hand truck, like, it was a whole deal.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.620
 I always find the concept of, like, moving weights to be funny.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.860
 Like, you, uh, like, you order weights from Amazon or whatever, and it's like, they just have to bring this really heavy package to you.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.400
 But the purpose of the package is no purpose of letting them be heavy.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.900
 It's something about that, I find really funny.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.000
 So you have to move your weights, and it's like, oh, why do you think so heavy?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.100
 Well, that's, that's like what you bought them for, to be heavy.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.900
 Yeah, exactly.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.200
 So you're given, uh, I guess the UPS drivers get a little work out every day, moving people's fitness equipment.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200
 Yeah.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.700
 Yeah.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.400
 It is, if we talked about the arbitrary nature of exercise, like, on the podcast, just how weird it is.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.900
 No, it ain't--

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.600
 Well, just, like, the idea of exercise as this idea that we had to introduce, because we just don't move anymore.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.500
 We used to, like, 500 years ago, they didn't have to exercise.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.000
 They just, like, they moved all the time, right?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.700
 So there's this funny observation that someone had made the nice experience of it in real life.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:30.700
 Uh, when I was in New York, the gym I would go to was, so weirdly, I lived in Manhattan, but I live a nice one mall, like, a very suburban feeling mall.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.100
 And the gym was on the second floor, and so I'd have to go up there.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.700
 And, of course, I had two options, like the escalator or the stairs.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.700
 And instinctively, I'd go on the escalator so that I could go to the gym and then, like, do exercise, right?

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.400
 It's just, yeah, my brain is, like, I can't exert here, but I can exert there.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400
 Exactly.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:04.300
 It's such a bizarre thing, like, when you really think about what we do, all the different things we do in fitness, and just how big of an industry it is, like, strength training and cardio, all these things that just, like, they're all modern.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.100
 They're constructs that we had to invent just to move, like, little hamsters on a hamster wheel.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:18.900
 Yeah, I mean, it's funny this now extends to animals to, like, Zuko needs a workout every day because he gets these so far removed from his natural state as well.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.800
 It's not bad.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.800
 I'm not complaining about it.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.600
 It's just kind of funny when you think about it.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.100
 Yeah.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.600
 Like, us doing all these things that are kind of mimicking, like, what our long-ago ancestors would have done just in daily life.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.800
 Yeah, this is a, it's fine.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:40.500
 I figured I'd bring up to 11 every single episode lately, but yeah, it's this funny line where he's like, the best workout is a random street fight every day.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.500
 Yeah, that'll do it.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.300
 Uh, the adrenaline, I mean, I, I don't know, like, a street fight.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.900
 I'm sure that's a whole nother level, but, like, Zuko tournaments is about as much adrenaline as I've felt.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.900
 I mean, I played high school football.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.500
 Like, I've done some things in life that would have been, like, pretty adrenaline driving.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.000
 Uh, just Zuko tournaments, like, when you're fighting another person, there's just something about it.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.500
 It, it, you exert things that you just can't exert.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.700
 You can't mimic it in the gym.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.200
 Like, I can't go in the gym and, like, actually drum that up.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.600
 It all has to come through physiology.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.100
 Yeah.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:24.300
 I think his point, uh, beyond the adrenaline is that, uh, the randomness of a street fight, similar to you moving your ways.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.000
 Yeah.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.400
 Like, you know, the street fights are random every time.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.900
 So.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.700
 Yeah.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.200
 It, it is really interesting.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:36.900
 Like, as I've been getting more and more into strength training, I have a personal trainer, just the isolated nature of every movement.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:45.200
 Like, we're doing these crazy specific movements in this full range of motion that, like, ultimately is really isolating muscle groups.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.300
 But then, yeah, you do something totally random, like, move your furniture around and you find out.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.200
 There's a lot of connected stuff, a lot of other little muscles that I'm not really working in the gym.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:03.000
 It's, it's funny because I feel like my, it's things have been inverted because when I was younger and I would play, like, three or four hours of sports every day.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.400
 We had to, like, go to the weight room for practice, but, like, I, like, never did anything in there.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.800
 Like, completely tested.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.000
 It didn't matter because I was, like, doing the actual thing, like, actual sport, otherwise.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.700
 So it's, like, just an optimization on top of that, that I, that I was skipping.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:26.900
 But now it's the complete opposite where, like, I never play sports. I don't just do the other work, which is a lot less fun.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.100
 And I feel like a lot less effective, generally.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:35.600
 Yeah. So on that note, we're going to play a basketball game at Larricon in, like, two weeks.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.800
 I mean, it's soon.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.300
 I don't.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.800
 Yeah.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.100
 You have not touched a basketball. I saw you say on Slack.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.900
 I don't know when the last time was, like, six years, maybe.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:51.800
 I also didn't know. I went in the other day and just buy myself in the gym because there was nobody there.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.100
 I didn't know in early mornings if there'd be, like, pick up games or something, but nobody there.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.400
 I just shot around, just, like, ran around and shot, but not even, like, ran around a lot.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.900
 Like, stayed on one half court and just kind of, like, you know, you know, like, just kind of, like, mimicking game situations.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.600
 I did some post stuff, but it's, whatever.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:15.800
 I burned, like, 400 calories in 45 minutes, which is just insane for, like, shooting around.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.000
 I'm not, like, playing a, if I played a game of basketball, my heart would explode, first of all.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.400
 But I'd have that whole, like, first time back where you taste blood, like, you know what I'm talking about?

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.400
 Like, there's something about, like, getting that first game experience.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.800
 But just shooting around. I burned a ton of calories. I was sweating, like, crazy.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.400
 It was amazing work. And it was just fun.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.100
 Like, I never once thought, like, I'm doing a hard thing.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.600
 It's just, like, this is a good time. And the same thing with playing a game.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.600
 Like, you get caught up in it and you're just huffing and puffing.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.100
 But it's nothing like arbitrary workouts where you kind of hate every second and you just want to be done.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.600
 So we got to play sports.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.700
 I know. I got to get back into it. It's, uh, yeah.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:04.000
 I remember, like, in the summer when I was in high school, like, literally for hours every single day in the hot summer.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.700
 Like, I'd be doing something. And, like, by the end of the summer, I just could run forever.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.500
 Like, we just run and never get tired. And now, like, I can barely run.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.300
 Yeah. Yeah, I still remember that feeling.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.900
 So are you going to do anything before this, this much anticipated game?

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.100
 I don't know. It's really not my style, too.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:27.100
 You can turn it all about just dying in a full court pickup game.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.100
 I am going to die for sure. But we've got a lot of subs.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.400
 Like, but we can only say that so much. Somebody has to play.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.300
 I think we have enough subs where we can literally just have, like, where, like, you don't have to play for more than 10 minutes.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.800
 You don't watch. Oh, really? Okay. Nice. Okay. So I'm putting too much pressure on it.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.900
 Was it like seven players per side?

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.100
 Would there just be two subs or are we playing four on four?

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.700
 If we hang on, I think it was maybe it was nine.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.000
 I forgot what David said, but I mean, even two subs is good, right?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.300
 Cause you just said, well, if me and you are both dying and we have to sub out and we can't come back in and that means they're bales.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.900
 That's to keep playing.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.900
 We just do frequent subs, you know, short breaks.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.700
 Okay. Yeah. Short breaks on the side and then we'll see something back in that.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:18.300
 In my opinion, given the average age of everyone, I thought we should just do half court for the court and the camera.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.900
 So it would be easier too.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.200
 It's true. But I don't know.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.900
 Did you see the three on three Olympics stuff?

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.300
 How dumb is that sport?

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.900
 Like the three on three basketball?

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.000
 I didn't see it.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.100
 It just shouldn't exist.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.500
 It looked so stupid.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.400
 Like the real basketball, like just all of them playing on a half court, three on three.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.900
 I don't know.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.900
 Just for the Olympics, it just feels like the Olympics should be better than that.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.700
 I don't know.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.300
 More like epic.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.700
 I just felt like this weird pickup game.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.800
 I didn't even realize there was like, did we really need more basketball?

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.400
 Like, why is there like basketball?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.500
 And then like, what's the one I'm just like kind of a basketball, okay?

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.500
 Yeah, I don't get it.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.400
 Like, who's asking for that?

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.700
 Who actually does decide what sports are played at the Olympics?

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.300
 Yeah, I mean, there's a Olympic committee.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.000
 But then I was like, I was thinking about one, I didn't watch.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.600
 I didn't watch any of the Olympics.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.000
 Like I would do some of that showed up on Twitter and stuff.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Yeah, I guess I didn't either.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 I mean, I followed like, I saw the headlines that like the US won the basketball.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.700
 Like, some things like that.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.700
 I guess I did catch a couple like highlights, like the Lyles 100 meter.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.200
 Yeah.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.100
 Did you see that?

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.700
 That was crazy.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.700
 Yeah.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.600
 Yeah, I didn't really want.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.100
 I didn't sit down and watch the Olympics ever.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.400
 Yeah.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.700
 So someone like made a thread of highlights and one of them was the synchronized swimming,

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.900
 which is, you know, really like insane and crazy.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.400
 What's that?

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400
 You just put it?

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:33.900
 Yeah.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.400
 Yeah.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:34.400
 Yeah.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:34.400
 Yeah.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:34.900
 Okay.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:39.400
 But I just couldn't shake the thought of like, how did we even come up with this in the first

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:39.900
 place?

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.800
 Like, how was there like, because one, I was imagining, how do you get into this?

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.600
 In the first place.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.400
 It's like so random.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.000
 How did you believe like, get into this?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.600
 So I can imagine at some point someone was like, oh, like you can do like these cool

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.600
 dancing moves in the water and like, maybe that turned to a sport.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.600
 But at what point were they like, okay, but now it's a team sport and we're going to

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.600
 like, it's an entire concept is going to be us and think you are.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.600
 It just seems so like contrived.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.600
 How did that?

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.600
 Yeah.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:07.600
 Yeah.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.600
 That's how people get so good at it.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.600
 How did it get like accepted to Olympic level?

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.600
 How is there like a scoring category for it?

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.600
 There's so many things like that.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.600
 Yeah.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600
 In the Olympics.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.600
 And like, yeah, when did all this happen?

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.600
 To be honest, I'm bothered by all of the different events that have like a judge.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.600
 It just feels like subjective and like, there's not this objective truth that like, you crossed

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.600
 the line before the other people you win.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.600
 It's like, ah, I'm going to dock you a little bit for your style points on this event.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.600
 Like, what does that mean?

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.600
 I don't know.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.600
 It just feels bad to me.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.600
 I actually feel the other way around.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:48.600
 My issue with the judges is that they're judges, but then it seems really narrow in terms of

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.600
 getting score like there's like a rubric they basically fill out.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.600
 Just the deductions and all that.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.600
 Yeah.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.600
 Yeah.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.600
 And like, there's like a technical score for everything.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.600
 There's like, you know, an execution score and all that.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.600
 The difficulty.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.600
 Yeah.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.600
 Yeah.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.600
 To me, that all feels made up to the point where I'm just like, or it feels like it robs it

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.600
 or something where I just rather be like, like, better if they were just judges that were

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.600
 like about a 10.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.600
 Yeah.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.600
 Isn't that used to be the thing?

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.600
 Like, you got an eight.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.600
 They hold up the card.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.600
 Wasn't that a thing?

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.600
 Oh, that's the dumb contest.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.600
 I thought that was the Olympics.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:29.600
 I mean, I love the dumb contest, but a reason because it's a showmanship and like surprising

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.600
 people and all of that.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.600
 So I rather than commit to the idea of judges versus this weird middle ground.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600
 Okay.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.600
 So that brings up a great thing I want to talk to you about.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.600
 I'm not a great thing.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.600
 It's just a stupid storyline, I think, but this break dancing thing.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.600
 You break dance.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.600
 Yeah.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.600
 You break dancer.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.600
 I watched the clip.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.600
 I just, I saw it scrolling through Twitter.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.600
 Didn't know anything about the story.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.600
 And I couldn't have told you she was good or bad at break dancing.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.600
 It didn't look like she wasn't break dancing to me.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.600
 Everyone freaked out.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.600
 She got zero points.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.600
 She scanned her way in or something.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.600
 To me, it looked like she was break dancing.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.600
 Are you serious?

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.600
 Yeah.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.600
 I don't know.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.600
 That's what I'm saying.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.600
 Like to the layman.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.600
 I don't think that was uncommon because that was the first day of the event and that was

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.600
 some of the first clips that people saw.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.600
 And a lot of replies were, I can't believe they put break dancing Olympic.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.600
 So I guess a lot of people concluded that that's what break dancing was.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600
 Yeah.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.600
 And it wasn't that impressive.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.600
 So this is like.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.600
 So I need to watch some of the other contestants so I can understand why she got a zero.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.600
 Okay.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.600
 So break dancing is funny because.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.600
 What she was doing, I'd never seen anyone move like that.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.600
 That was like.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.600
 Someone described it in this hilariously perfect way where they were like.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:50.600
 This seems like one of those spy comedies where like the spy has to act like they're in.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.600
 In a break dance contest.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.600
 Yeah.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.600
 Like video center something.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.600
 Yeah.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.600
 Or something.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:02.600
 Just doing what they think break dancing would be in this comedic way.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.600
 That's really what it came across like to me.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.600
 Okay.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.600
 Now's how the movements are.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.600
 That said, there's also this other extreme.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:18.600
 So if you watch like the next days with like the more like expert people.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.600
 People watched some of them.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.600
 They were like, how did that person not win?

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.600
 They were good at the best.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.600
 So there's a version of break dancing.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.600
 There's two things in break dancing.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.600
 There's like power moves and there's like style.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.600
 So power moves tend to be the things that if you don't know much about break dancing,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.600
 it's like pulling shit. How did they even do that?

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.600
 Like that they go upside down.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.600
 They're flying around.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.600
 They're doing all these like crazy, like effectively like gymnastics, but you know,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.600
 in the break dancing form.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.600
 And so you think that that's like what that's all about and like whatever does that stuff.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.600
 The best is the one that wins, but it's not because there's a musicality component to it,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.600
 which is where the style thing comes in.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.600
 The best people are the ones that can like compose those crazy moves together along with like.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.600
 More traditional dancing things like hit the beat and like and all that stuff.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.600
 And if you're not like into music or into like dancing in general,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.600
 you might not even pick up on that on some of those things.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.600
 Yeah, I picked up on none of those.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.600
 I mean, some of it looked ridiculous.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.600
 Some of the things she did, like the Winsher Wiper looking moves with their legs.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.600
 I got that that looks stupid, but then she did some stuff that looked like,

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.600
 I don't know, I've seen break dancers do no, not at all.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.600
 It's not really and like I know Scott, Scott is like, yeah, Scott's let's keep syntax.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.600
 He's like way better than I ever was.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.600
 Like he's very, very, very, very good.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.600
 I saw him do some of it at React Miami.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.600
 Yeah, he's quite good.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.600
 I never really got into the power moves.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.600
 I kind of stayed with the style of stuff and he's very good at the power stuff as well.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:49.600
 And he was like trying to like defend the situation, which I totally get like in general,

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:56.600
 if this person performed or like was at like some kind of break dancing event and did what she did,

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.600
 most people would not say anything to me.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.600
 They would like be nice and support her because it's the Olympics, which is kind of spirit.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.600
 He was trying to bring kind of like remind people of.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.600
 But at the same time, like it's the Olympics, like this is, this is a lot that you have put yourself in.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.600
 You've opted into, you understand that, you know, you're choosing to compete at this level.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:22.600
 And I'm really skeptical that in the entire country of Australia, people were saying like,

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.600
 Oh, you know, like female break dancing isn't as pertinent, but like, that's not really true.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.600
 Like, like there's something.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.600
 They actually spun it up.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.600
 Like if the Olympics is at male and female.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.600
 Yeah, I think it was men versus.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.600
 Yeah, it was separate.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.600
 So I feel like there had to be someone else in the entire country of Australia that was better.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.600
 It just might be that like, it's a new, it's a new event.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.600
 Maybe people weren't interested or like it was like annoying to qualify or whatever it was.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.600
 Well, no, there's like the whole story.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.600
 You've not heard like the she was the head of the committee or her and her husband or something.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.600
 Like she basically like fought her way in.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600
 Oh, is that a thing?

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.600
 Yeah, like it was kind of a scan, a bit of a scandal.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:06.600
 But to me, it isn't like surprising, I guess that like this many sports, this many countries,

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.600
 there's going to be some people get in that like maybe they shouldn't have been in.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.600
 I don't know, I guess it's bad for if you're an Australian woman, break dancer and you didn't get in because this.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.600
 Yeah, woman forced her way in, then you feel bad and that sucks.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.600
 But like, it's not surprising to me.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.600
 I'm surprised actually if this is the first time this kind of thing's happened, that'd be surprising to me.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.600
 Like I feel like this should be pretty common.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.600
 Yeah.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:36.600
 Yeah, I mean, I think the image didn't help because it was that and then like she's like a professor.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.600
 She's like an academic, you know, of break dancing.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.600
 Yeah.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.600
 Well, not.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.600
 I mean, people are saying that, but that's like a little bit of an exaggeration.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.600
 I think she's had some papers on like.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.600
 It's a tough thing that I hate.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.600
 People write papers on really contrived pretentious things.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.600
 It's like the effect on break dancing of social economics.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.600
 It's just like, it's just stuff like that, right?

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.600
 Like something that it doesn't look good.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.600
 Like maybe there's some value in that paper, but you can see how it seems like it's probably just made up.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.600
 Yeah.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:16.600
 So it really just feels like this outsider that kind of was like a fan of this thing and tried to like claim it.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.600
 I mean, that's what it, what it looks like.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.600
 Yeah.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.600
 I just struggled to imagine that there weren't, there wasn't someone better that.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.600
 Actually, it could have.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.600
 Oh, sure.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.600
 Could have put it forward.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.600
 She got zero points.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.600
 That's funny.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.600
 That's impressive, actually.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.600
 Like to go out there and get zero points.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.600
 I feel like that's almost as hard as getting a really good score, right?

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.600
 Yeah.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.600
 I did.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.600
 Okay.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:45.600
 So I will say, I think there is a split between people that I observe.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:52.600
 So when something like this happens, so I will laugh at it and I will think that it's funny in some cases.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:57.600
 But my first thought is always, oh my God, like, what if that was me?

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:06.600
 Like, in this situation, the whole world thinks I suck at dancing and like, I was talking about it.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.600
 Like, I just think about how easily that just could have been me, even though it's a completely rational.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.600
 Like, why would I have it in the situation?

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.600
 Yeah.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.600
 And they're like tempers.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.600
 Like any kind of reaction to have a good amount.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.600
 But other people just, that doesn't cross their head at all.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:26.600
 And they just like go at it with full force and people just can't believe that they could randomly be in that situation.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:31.600
 And this extends to the point where like, like anything crazy, like anyone that's like killed someone.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.600
 And I'm like, oh my God, like, what if I was in a situation where I killed someone?

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.600
 I don't do that.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.600
 No.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:49.600
 Well, if I told you what I do, which is like, if somebody was like somebody in this room killed someone, I immediately feel like it was me.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.600
 Like, I'm a guilty one.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.600
 I always had this feeling of guilt and I don't know where that comes from.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.600
 I think it's kind of related.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.600
 Yeah, it's kind of related.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.600
 Yeah.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.600
 I would say, I watched.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.600
 It's a ray gun.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.600
 I watched the clips like so many times.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.600
 Like, I watched.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.600
 So I went and I like collected them all in different tabs.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.600
 And it's what is watching over and over and over and over.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.600
 And finally someone made like a full compilation.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.600
 I was like, thank you.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.600
 And they watched that one over and over and over again.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.600
 Just because it was like enjoyable, funny to you or.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.600
 There's just one move that she does where it looks like she's trying to do like app workouts.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.600
 Which is the honor.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.600
 I just like crunching.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.600
 I'm like, yeah.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.600
 I know what you're talking about.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.600
 Yeah.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.600
 I like this.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.600
 This, this so reminds me of like, you know how workout classes get like weirder and weirder

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.600
 and weirder over time because they need to like get people excited about moving.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.600
 Yeah.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.600
 Yeah.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.600
 Yeah.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.600
 This is looks like some weird Pilates alternative.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.600
 Someone, someone came up with.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:53.000
 I mean, like again, if you don't know anything about break dancing, it all just seems like

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 the same stuff to me.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 Like what's the difference?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 It like, why is that not impressive?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.240
 But this other random movement is, I mean, I know it's not random, but it just seems weird

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.240
 to me in arbitrary.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.240
 Okay.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.440
 You, you, you could have done all of those movements with zero.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.000
 Oh, I couldn't, I couldn't do real break dancing moves where you're saying like those

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.080
 like watching what she did.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.080
 Yeah.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.480
 You, you, I can't think of a single movement in there that you would need like, okay.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.000
 So I could just like actually, ooh, how many people have like fully done the full routine,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 like mimics.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.760
 Like, that'd be an interesting exercise.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.240
 Can I do the entire routine?

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.520
 I'll film it if I do.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.560
 And I also, another thing that this was funny about specifically stuff in the hip hop category

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:38.720
 because so much of it is there's not technical rules to it.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:45.280
 And so much of about it is this unmeasurable thing that's, you can't articulate someone

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:51.480
 out there could probably, I bet I could actually even do this, could go do that exact same

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.480
 routine.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.640
 It's like basically the exact same and it would look like 10 times better.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.640
 Interesting.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.520
 Just because they have a certain sense of a certain thing that is totally missing.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.520
 Is it Riz?

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520
 Is that what?

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.520
 Yeah.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.520
 It's like it's that category.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.520
 Yeah.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.000
 It's like, and even if I'm watching it, then I'll think about it if we compare it to and

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.160
 be like that person's better, but you wouldn't be able to really, really say why.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:19.000
 Like if, if Michael Jackson was still alive and he did those moves, it'd be like, oh,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 that's actually pretty cool.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 Okay.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 It would look cooler doing it.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Yeah.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.920
 And a lot of it, like there's some like, it could come down to the clothes you wear, if

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.200
 you come down to like the shape of your body, just understanding all that and how to make

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.200
 stuff look good.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.200
 Yeah.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.480
 It's not like someone sit there and sit there and studies and figures it out.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.760
 They're just like a instinct you develop over time around those things.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.720
 It's interesting that there's like, that there is like these objective, like that looks

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.080
 better than that.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:50.960
 It's interesting that we prefer on the viewing side that we have these weird, like instinctual

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.360
 preferences that we don't decide.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.560
 And it's like that was more aesthetically pleasing than that when it comes out of these

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.520
 very complex things, like dance movements.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.680
 It's super interesting.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.680
 Yeah.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.080
 I respect dancers a lot.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.440
 Like that just looks hard.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:10.480
 When I watch like Casey watches TikTok stuff, when I see like crazy dance stuff people do,

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.480
 that's impressive.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.960
 Like to be able to control your body like that as someone who's tried to play some sports,

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.960
 not easy.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.960
 Like I can't imagine doing some of those things.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.960
 Yeah.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.960
 Yeah.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.680
 I definitely experienced because I was super into dance up in high school and I also played

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.640
 sports and there's like a great synergy between the two.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:31.440
 Like when you get knocked around, maintaining your balance and like recovering and stuff.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.320
 Like it's so similar to like the dancing motions you get used to.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.320
 Yeah.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.320
 I think I like Steph Curry.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.320
 He'd probably be a really good dancer.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.320
 Yeah.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.320
 I'm guessing.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.320
 Okay.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.320
 This conversation got weird.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.320
 Let's move on.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.560
 Where we're at right now.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.560
 What's going on?

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.440
 I feel like we haven't talked much, I'm a bit out of the loop on basically everything.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.440
 Yeah.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.440
 You've been kind of silent.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440
 I have been.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.800
 What's going on in the world or in our little world?

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.560
 I cut my head yesterday shaving and it's bad.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:04.280
 You can't see it and I'm not going to show it to you because I think on the other side,

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.280
 it's right.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.280
 It's back here.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.280
 It's on the dark side of your.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.520
 I was going like this and then I was going really fast, which I should not do.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.520
 And I just went.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:17.040
 And I was like, that felt like what a yeah, and we got like stabbing and cutting just

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.680
 like the idea just gives me the ability to do this.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.880
 I was in the shower and I was just bleeding for like 15 minutes and then I put a bandit

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.240
 over and this morning I took it off and it's so kind of bleeding because that's not good.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.120
 Maybe you need like a not a stitch, but like one of those butterfly bandaid things.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.640
 Do you need something like that?

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.640
 Is it that deep?

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.440
 Oh, it's not deep.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.560
 It's like a super clean.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.560
 Okay.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.560
 Oh, don't.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.400
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.000
 You're killing an apple like, yeah, it's just shallow.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 Okay.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.720
 So the first time I ever met, Ken Wheelie, which was a react Miami the day before I did

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.720
 the same thing.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.720
 So the side of my head.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.720
 I've only come in twice.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.720
 These are the two times that happened.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:03.360
 And I was describing to him and he goes, Oh, of course, he's like, so he's got so good

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.360
 with birds.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.760
 He's like, Oh, you like slice a little piece of bacon off.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:11.080
 And I was like, yeah, it's actually exactly what it was.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.600
 Because when we cut back and we do it really thinly.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.600
 I know.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.600
 Yeah.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.300
 It's a thing that I do a lot often.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.300
 Yeah.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:22.520
 I'm going to go slice some bacon right now, probably actually just give me a second.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.920
 No, I'm sure it makes sense to you.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.080
 So that's what's going on with me.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.240
 So you cut your head.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.240
 That's literally.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.240
 Okay.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:39.120
 Well, it's anything else happened in the world, like in the tech world.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.120
 What's going on on Twitter?

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.760
 I don't feel like I've been on Twitter hardly.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.760
 There's a fantasy football league.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.680
 That's the only time I go on Twitter now is check the DM's for the fantasy football

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.680
 league.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.400
 We got a little group of tech friendlies.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.400
 It's good time.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.400
 Who's going to win?

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.400
 Is there?

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.400
 I will say I have won the last two fantasy football leagues I was in.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.400
 Really?

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.400
 Just saying.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.440
 I do it every year, but like, I've got a secret and I'm not going to divulge it on

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.440
 the podcast.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.240
 Is there a punishment for someone that comes and wants?

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.240
 We're going to come up with something.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.240
 Yes.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.720
 If you want to help, you're quite the saddest.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.440
 They have to sign up and take the SATs.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.440
 Okay.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.440
 Sounds fun.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.440
 That sounds awful.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.440
 That would be the kind of to you that it would just haunt me.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.120
 It's like, I got to go do the stupid SATs because I lost fantasy football.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:30.840
 We got to come up with a winning thing and a losing thing.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.200
 So it actually that we have an audience.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.200
 I always forget.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.200
 It's not just me and you.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.800
 Anyone in the audience that wants to, we need like an email address.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.600
 We need some way for people to like officially send us suggestions.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.960
 Let's do it.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.120
 Send it to something, anything, anything really at tomorrow.fm.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.120
 Whatever you want.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.200
 We'll just have it on an alias that forwards to me and DAX.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.080
 So you can send it to DAX at tomorrow.fm.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.000
 You can send it to Adam at tomorrow.fm.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.380
 You can send it to slice off a little piece of bacon at tomorrow.fm.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.920
 Whatever you'd like, really.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.480
 If you have suggestions for our fantasy football league, I'd like to hear from DAX too here.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:16.400
 But if you have like a good prize or a good, you lose situation, let us know.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:22.320
 If you lose, you have to post that tailwind sucks and then reply to every single reply

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.320
 you get.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.320
 It's doubling down.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.320
 That sounds terrible.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.820
 There's something along those lines.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.800
 Oh, speaking of Ken, Ken's in the league.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.800
 Ken Rakes.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.800
 Wow.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:36.800
 It's a good league.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.800
 Well, let's take a quick break.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.040
 I'm just going to say that when I have to pee now.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.040
 Okay.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.680
 I'm going to take a quick break.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:51.560
 You're going to hear from our sponsors, I'll get it back.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:56.080
 This episode of What About Tomorrow is brought to you by the fact that DAX forgot to switch

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.920
 his microphone to the proper input setting.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.560
 And so you're hearing the entirety of his office plates and scratches on the table as

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.200
 it records from his computer microphone.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:11.200
 You can support future episodes of this podcast by tweeting @dax on Twitter @thdxr and reminding

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.000
 him to switch his microphone to the proper input.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.880
 Alternatively, you can also visit terminal.shop to buy some fun products, like coffee, possibly,

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.360
 which I don't think they shipped Canada.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:27.280
 So I don't know if it actually works, but I trust that what they're saying is true.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.280
 Terminal.shop.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.680
 And now back to the show.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.400
 Do you have a primary care physician?

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:40.700
 Yeah, but like not like a, I don't have like the person for life, which I have, I'm slowly

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.600
 filling in for other things, but I haven't figured that out for you.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.680
 Person for life, like your BFF, your BFF.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.840
 With these things, like I like to try to find someone that's really good and like rely

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.840
 on forever.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.840
 It's like the remainder of their career.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.800
 Like the plumber and electrician.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.800
 Yeah, exactly.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.800
 Yeah.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.680
 I have an electrician now named Ed.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.360
 He's done like three or four jobs for me.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.320
 He's my electrician for life, as long as I live in the Ozarks.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.320
 Shout out to Ed.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.320
 Yeah.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.320
 It sucks.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.320
 When you move, you got to start over.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.320
 It's kind of what happened to me.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.320
 You got to start over.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.320
 It's not really for life, is it?

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.320
 Yeah.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.240
 That said, I, I went to a PCP and I got, I'm sorry, what's a PCP?

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.200
 Oh, primary care physician.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.600
 Sorry, you know, I wasn't helped like so, so I know these things.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:32.320
 I went, but I hadn't gone, I hadn't had a good physical in like a year.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.520
 I, no, I don't think I've been to a doctor.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:41.160
 I've gone to the hospital two or three times in the last couple years, haven't been to

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.320
 a doctor and I don't know how long, like maybe not in adulthood.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.680
 Like I don't think I've, I've never had a primary care physician.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:53.160
 It's like my doctor is that, well, never, like in high school, like growing up, I had

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.560
 one, like our family doctor, but like in adulthood, I've never been able to fill that

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.160
 out on the form, you know, when you go in and you had to fill out your forms, who's your

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.240
 primary care physician, I've never had one.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:06.240
 And I'm trying to establish one, I went to the doctor yesterday for the first time in

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.560
 a very long time.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.840
 One thing I told them is that I pee a lot.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:16.120
 Just, that's what maybe, I told them, I have a podcast and they make fun of me that I have

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.200
 to pee all the time.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.760
 So said to get in there that I have a podcast, you know, I mean, just one more listening.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.040
 If you find your podcast, you'd be like, why are you telling me that?

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:32.000
 I'm vegan, by the way, Neil, I don't just, if you're curious, doctor.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.920
 The challenge me and Liz are struggling with is, and this is, okay, I have to say, this

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.920
 is first thoughts.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.520
 I'm going to say that out loud, because she always gives me shit when I repeat her thoughts.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.400
 We went to this person to get our wisdom teeth out.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.160
 I got mine out and she got hers out a little bit later.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:56.160
 The most competent person ever, like, makes you feel amazing, like, so you like really

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.160
 understand everything's going out.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:02.080
 I really like confidence in what's going to happen, just really great unique vibe that

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.320
 makes you feel that way.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:09.480
 Then the actual procedure also like was way, like my wisdom teeth and hers did not hurt

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:15.480
 at all because they did all this stuff beforehand, they take these different things like a few

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.480
 days leading up to it.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.680
 And then like, it was like, it was a very prescriptive thing that most people don't, I'm

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.880
 like, I had a rough experience and it was really good.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:30.720
 So just like extremely, extremely, extremely competent, but he only freaking does mouth

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.720
 jaw stuff.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:37.120
 Like, I can't go to him if I'm like, I'm peeing a lot, you know, I'm just like, he's probably

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.120
 going to help you.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.120
 Here's the thing.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:45.400
 He's like in the top 1% of doctors to the point where I'm like, Hey, if I need knee surgery,

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.440
 like he's want to take a crack at it, like, I'm sure you're good.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:55.280
 Probably better than, yeah, knee surgery in the Ozarks, for sure.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.800
 I'm sure you could figure something out.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.800
 Yeah.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.240
 So we're like, why it just sucks because it's such a precise field that even if you do find

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.960
 these people, yeah, it's just for such a narrow spot in your life.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:12.200
 Do you ever think about like the different, we know that there's like, there's the 10x

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.160
 engineer trope, but there's like, engineers are like a hundred and a thousand times better

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.760
 than other people who are paid to be an engineer.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.000
 Do you ever think about that difference when you go to the doctor, like, all the time?

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.400
 Is this a 2x doctor?

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.160
 I'm in the Ozarks.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.680
 So I'm like, is this a, is this a doctor?

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.680
 Yeah.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.320
 I mean, this thing clicked for me at some point because I, I was like, we just assume all

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.320
 doctors are smart.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.200
 It's hard to be a doctor, but within that pool, there's still the traditional distribution

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.080
 in there is every single career.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.080
 It doesn't matter.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.080
 Mm hmm.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.200
 Like the worst doctor is so, it's probably horrible, you know?

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.200
 Yeah.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.360
 Yeah, when you like, I follow sports when I hear about like the knee surgeon, they all

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.360
 go to you.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.360
 Or like an Achilles tear.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.360
 It's like the guy you go to this guy.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.320
 And I think like he's probably like a million times better at surgery than the guy that did

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.320
 my knee surgery.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.320
 Like easily.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.320
 Yeah.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.680
 But again, it's a, it's a specialization that's crazy.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:09.320
 So let's have to get her gallbladder out and the guy, the doctor that did it, at first

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.480
 we were like a little, she was like a little nervous about it because he was pretty old,

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.920
 but he was maybe like 70.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.080
 So it kind of felt like, oh, like, you know, is he going to like, yeah, because you have

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.520
 to carry all of those things.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:27.200
 But immediately, once you start talking about it, she felt way better because this is the

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.720
 only thing he has done for literally that same every day.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.720
 He wakes up.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.720
 Same surgery.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.720
 Sucks out, sucks out to a gallbladder.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.520
 And he's removed like 1000s, like, I don't know how many, like.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.480
 It's wild to think about actually, like these people who, the surgeons that literally do

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:45.280
 one surgery repeatedly, yeah, all day long, they're scheduled out for this, like one thing

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.280
 they work on.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.880
 There's no equivalent to that in our industry.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:52.360
 Is there like, because there's manual labor at the end of the day, it's manual, like craftsmanship

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.360
 labor.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.360
 Yeah.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.080
 You would hire someone to like build you a table.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.080
 They built the same table.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.040
 That was the exact same type of thing.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.040
 Yeah.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.040
 Yeah.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.840
 Is there like, what's the most specialized you get in tech?

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.120
 It's like, oh, this is the, the mobile developer.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.440
 What's the, what's the equivalent or the closest?

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.440
 The closest thing we have.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.440
 This does exist.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.440
 This definitely exists.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.600
 Like, I know there's like the font rendering specialist that make like a million and a half

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.920
 at Google a year.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:24.340
 There's that kind of thing where like, there's like a handful of people that know that stuff

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.040
 and they do it really well.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.600
 Is that, is that close?

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.320
 I think it usually ends up not being pure tech like that.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.840
 They usually end up being like, uh, something in a specific industry, like software in a

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.840
 specific industry.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.840
 Oh, I see.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.000
 So it's more about the, the type of software than it is.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Yeah.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 Yeah.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Okay.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Interesting.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Yeah.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.980
 So, but it's, again, it's just not, it's like rare for, yeah, but we don't generally operate

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.980
 that way.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.040
 We operate as generalists.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:56.320
 But yeah, I just can't imagine like, I'm sure there's ways to like get more interested

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:02.560
 in new technique show up, but he's just doing that same second of all letters every single.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.040
 Do they literally suck them out?

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.440
 They remove the gold or it's funny because it sounds like a joke, but I think they do

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.240
 use some kind of like a suction that's crazy.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.240
 Yeah.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.240
 Yeah.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.400
 I guess like all of my wife, Casey's family has had their gallbladders removed.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.240
 So I did know that gallbladders get removed.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.720
 Like there's a problem with your gallbladder.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.720
 It's coming out.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.720
 Apparently we don't need it.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.720
 So here's a career.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.920
 I think you and my husband just talked to, I think you just posted, you need to get it

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.920
 out.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.920
 Oh, really?

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.920
 So here's a crazy part, right?

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.920
 So he's been doing this.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.920
 He and also in our fantasy football league just every time we talk about someone who's

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.760
 in the fantasy football league, I'm going to call it out that's also not in the fantasy

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.360
 football league, sorry, I'm not in it.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.560
 So he's just, the soccer's been doing this for 50 years where everything will be.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.600
 He's never had a bad result.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.640
 Wow.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.520
 That's amazing.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.280
 Imagine if we were that good at our jobs and we had never shipped above to production.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.120
 He's never messed up.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.120
 Wow.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.120
 I took production down yesterday, literally.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:59.320
 I didn't really do it, but it was my team.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.320
 I mean, it was us.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.320
 We did it.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.320
 Yeah.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.320
 Yeah.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:09.000
 That's like, I mean, like think about pilots, like every pilot that you see, I was on a

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.160
 plane once when it was the last flight for this captain and they did all like, you've

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.160
 done that.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:19.400
 The whole like fire trucks shooting the, they just shoot the fire hose yet the arriving

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.360
 airport, they're like shooting a bunch of fire trucks lined up, shooting the fire hose

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.360
 up in the air.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.360
 Like a big arch.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.360
 It was amazing.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.760
 The, his whole family was on the plane.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.040
 It's like this crazy moment that you're getting to experience.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.040
 Yeah.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.000
 He's like, he's never, he's never crashed a plane.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 He wouldn't be here.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.440
 Like he's, he's flown for 35 years and never, never did the thing, what worked out nailed

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.440
 it.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.440
 Yeah.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.440
 I mean, that's all just a matter of what we're talking about.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:49.080
 Because when I was on a plane, kind of from Spain, the rain, it's been mostly falls in

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.080
 the plane.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.080
 Wait, what?

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.080
 Is that a thing?

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.080
 Yeah.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.080
 The thing.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.080
 In the Spain.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.080
 Sorry.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.080
 I don't know that one.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:02.480
 So he was, uh, there's coming back from Barcelona, and this is like, he had like two

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.480
 other flights.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.280
 But this was the last flight from Barcelona.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.880
 And he's like, I've been doing this route since like the eighties.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.880
 Wow.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:15.680
 I'm like, he's just flying back and forth from Barcelona and Miami for like 30 plus 30 40

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.680
 years.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.240
 And he's like, yeah, imagine like you just see the city change over time.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.320
 And then the next day you're in Miami and the next day you're in Barcelona and you're

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:29.920
 students for super, super long and he has really amazing speech about like, uh, like

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.440
 thanking the city and like seeing a change and like actually vacationing there and like

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.440
 in the beginning experience, like, you know, all the culture and all that.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:45.720
 And it's yeah, this is a very normal American guy that just every other day was in Barcelona.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.720
 That's wild.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.720
 Decades.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.720
 So mind blown.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.720
 Like, would you have a home there?

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.720
 If you just were like dedicated to, I'm going to do this route because with seniority

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.640
 in the airlines, like you can kind of like, if you're, you've been there a long time,

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.520
 you can just choose your thing and know you're going to keep doing that thing forever.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:05.080
 Like, would you have a home there or no, you just stay at a hotel every single time.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.960
 Well, it's funny because he was saying his daughter started abroad there and then he

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:09.960
 like, Victor.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.960
 That's wild.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.440
 Yeah, it's just like this thing that's so crazy.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:20.920
 We just go into the other side of the planet and just becomes your day like casual.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:21.920
 Yeah.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.640
 That is actually surprising to me.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.640
 I'm not a pilot.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.600
 So I don't know the psychology here.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.120
 Maybe it's like just an enjoyable route, but I would think I'd want to do different things

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.040
 like day to day, week to week.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.960
 I can't imagine being like, I want to do this exact same flight for the rest of my career.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:41.480
 It just sounds so like, I don't know.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.480
 Yeah.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.480
 It's depressing to me.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.480
 Some of these things are like that.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.600
 Like, it's the same thing every single day and people do it, but some people might like

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.600
 that.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.600
 They might like the routine of it.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:56.200
 They just have like spice and variety and other areas of life and just not their job.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.800
 Are pilots a lot to like listen to podcasts or watch TV?

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.420
 Oh, surely, right?

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.080
 I think so.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.080
 My brother's a pilot for Delta.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.080
 I'll ask him.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.080
 I don't know.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.240
 Can they just like, yeah, could they watch Apple TV on their iPad?

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.240
 Hmm.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:15.400
 Because I do think about some of these like jobs where it's routine and kind of mundane.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.880
 And I wonder, can you just become like the world's expert on something just because you

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:20.880
 have so much time?

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.880
 Yeah, so much time.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.880
 Oh, that's a good point.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.880
 Like truck drivers.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.080
 Not for sure. they can just listen to whatever.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.080
 Huh.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.080
 Like they could read every book ever.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.160
 They could be like the most well-read person in the world.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.160
 Why don't they?

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.160
 Hmm.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.160
 Maybe someone else.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.160
 Yeah.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.160
 I wouldn't be surprised.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.960
 I want to say something, but I'm not going to say it.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.440
 It's not going to sell thing to truck drivers.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.440
 Yeah.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.440
 No, it wasn't.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.440
 It wasn't going to be an insult to truck drivers.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.440
 There's more.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.440
 Never mind.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.640
 Just sometimes I just know better.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.640
 The truck driving thing that just reminds me, I just heard something the other day about

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:57.120
 we've talked about full self-driving and that whole situation.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:02.720
 I heard something on a podcast, I think, about like what it could do to our economy.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:07.400
 Like the number one job for males in America is driving and if like truck drivers get

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:12.440
 replaced with autonomous cars that can just drive across the country, that's crazy actually.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.720
 But will they actually make a huge difference or will it just be like a whole generation

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.880
 that doesn't sign up for that job and does something else?

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.880
 I don't know.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.880
 It's like the economics.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:20.880
 Yeah.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.520
 And like, I think with the truck driving one, they also point out the cascading effects.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:29.200
 Like there's so many businesses that service these routes.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200
 Like truck stops.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.200
 Yeah.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.400
 Truck stops, like diners and all of the different things.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.400
 Yeah.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.400
 Yeah.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.400
 It's okay.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.400
 This is completely random.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.400
 When I would drive, and a bunch of people are going to know exactly what I'm talking

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.400
 about because I've done this.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.200
 When I used to drive from New York to Miami-

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.040
 From Spain to, oh, okay.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.400
 You're in Lisbon by the way.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.400
 No, Adam Spain.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.400
 It's across the ocean.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.400
 I can't drive.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.400
 I like the Bering Strait or something.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.400
 I don't know.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.400
 I can see that.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.400
 I can see that.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.400
 That's the other way.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.400
 Okay.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.240
 There's just a, there's just rust stops called south of the border.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.600
 And it's so random.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:07.160
 It is like a, it's like a theme park almost.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.440
 That's like Mexican themed.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.680
 It's just like, but it's not in Mexico.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.120
 It's not south of any border.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.840
 It's south of a, it's a way, under South Carolina.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.080
 I forgot where it was.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.400
 There's like some, it's like right on the border between two states.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.400
 Yeah.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.720
 It's just like this big random business that is like kind of like a theme park.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:27.000
 I've actually never stopped there because we'd always be there too late.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 Yeah.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.520
 But everyone sees it on the way and like, yeah, like the truck drivers are stopping there

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.520
 all the time.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.680
 And if that goes away, south of the border is going to have to shut down.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:40.880
 So rest stops is an interesting topic because I've driven some pretty long like south Florida

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.520
 to Missouri.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.200
 Some states like Florida has really nice, really nice rest stops.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.160
 Like they'll be like these giant complexes.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.560
 It's like a shopping mall.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.640
 Florida's a third with highway stuff.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.640
 Is that what it is?

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:58.080
 It's wild because you can see it when, so when we do the drive, the moment we cross from

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.320
 Georgia to Florida, everything's completely different.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.320
 Like the highway.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.320
 Like in China.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.320
 Yeah.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.320
 Yeah.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.320
 Yeah.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.320
 Yeah.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.320
 Florida's has a lot of money.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.320
 Oh, they have a lot of money.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.320
 Is that the tourism?

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.320
 Just the, yeah, yeah.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.320
 Just, I mean, a lot of.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.320
 Because they don't charge state income tax.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.600
 So they make up so much money from just the people coming in.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.440
 They only charge consumption taxes.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.920
 So whenever you're spending money in Florida, you're paying taxes.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.920
 Whatever.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.920
 It's property.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.920
 That's a good idea.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:24.920
 I feel like that's a good idea.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.920
 And a lot of money is spent in Florida.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.120
 Like a lot of money is spent in Florida.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.080
 So they're getting a percentage off of that.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.720
 It ends up working out.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.720
 Every state can't do that.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.560
 Now, the thing is, the reason is not a good idea is, you might come across this, but let's

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.320
 say you get rid of income tax and you only tax on what you spend.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.920
 That seems like a good system because you're like, if you're someone that doesn't spend

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:49.040
 a lot, you get tax less, so you imagine people that are not like, you know, don't have a

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.200
 lot of money and they're not blowing their money.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:56.440
 But if you don't make a lot of money, you spend 100% of your money, so 100% of income

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.440
 is tax.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.440
 Oh.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.440
 I see.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.000
 So it's actually worse for low earners.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 Yeah.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 It's worse.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 It's called regressive tax.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 It's worse for people that make.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 Interesting.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 Okay.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 Counterintuitive.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 Counterintuitive.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 That is counterintuitive.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.640
 I've had this thought before, like, why don't we all just, yeah, do the no.

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.160
 That's how it works in Florida.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.160
 So why?

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.160
 Okay.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.760
 I'm trying to think of the other states that are no income tax.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.800
 I guess a lot of people spend money in Texas.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.800
 That kind of makes sense.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.800
 Nevada.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.800
 I think.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.800
 Yeah.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.800
 Nevada, the gambling, I guess.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.800
 I'm in Washington.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:29.800
 Why Washington?

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.800
 Why would they be no?

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.280
 Is Wyoming a no-state income tax?

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.080
 Do you ever just forget a state exists?

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.400
 The other day, I was still in Casey, something about-

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.080
 Yeah, they're called fly over states.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.080
 Is that what it is?

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.080
 Oh, Missouri.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.080
 Yeah, Missouri.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.000
 I would forget that one too if I didn't live here.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 But Idaho.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:52.160
 I was telling Casey about something about a nice area in Idaho, or I think it was Idaho.

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.160
 And she was like-

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.160
 Boise?

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.240
 No, it wasn't Boise.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:58.080
 Some place in the mountains where they have that billionaire retreat.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.080
 Anyway.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.240
 I was saying something about Idaho and she was like, she thought I was talking about Ohio

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.240
 or Iowa.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.240
 We're not sure.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.960
 She was like not thinking it was somewhere out west.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.920
 And I realized, yeah, she's saying remember Idaho exists and why would she?

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.920
 It's like there's 50 of them.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.000
 We don't have to think about these states ever.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 Yeah.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.320
 I mean, if you had to name every state for memory, it's probably pretty hard.

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.320
 That's tough.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.680
 If you had to draw where it's at too.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.680
 Sorry.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:29.160
 So income tax, state's why I come tax Alaska, New Hampshire, Texas, Florida, South Dakota,

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.000
 Washington, Nevada, Tennessee, and Wyoming, so you're right right there.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 There's no way a lot of people spend in the money in South Dakota.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 There's just no way.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.040
 There's not a lot of people in South Dakota.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.840
 It's just prime.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.680
 Yeah, just prime.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.680
 Okay.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.680
 So I don't understand.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.680
 Good thing.

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.680
 I'm not an economist.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.680
 Good thing.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.680
 I'm not in charge of any of this because...

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.680
 Well, so hang on.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.680
 South Dakota, it's on the oil, right?

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.680
 Oh, really?

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.680
 Learn something new?

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.680
 Yeah.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.680
 Oil production there.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:55.680
 I don't know if it's still the case, but historically...

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:56.680
 Interesting.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.680
 Didn't know this.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:58.680
 Alaska also oil.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.680
 Okay.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.680
 I just realized I don't care.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.840
 I mostly don't care about any of these states.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.080
 There you go.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.080
 There's a move to Wyoming to stop paying taxes out.

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.080
 There you go.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.080
 The state taxes, I guess.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.800
 It is crazy that people live in California.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:17.840
 I remember a Nikita tweet that was like, "It's crazy that people spend 13% tax in California

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.160
 and only get to be outside 200% more."

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.560
 Or something like that.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.720
 It's like, "Is that literally it?

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.720
 Do people just live in California because it's nice weather?"

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:30.800
 Well, I mean, it is a very nice place, beautiful, nice place to live in a lot of ways.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.440
 But it just acts like they mess it up in a lot of ways that make it really unpleasant

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.960
 that aren't necessary.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:40.640
 But yeah, he's always speaking about that, but Florida is a counter to everything he says

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.800
 because it has no getting tax.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.800
 No, it compacts.

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.200
 But it's also a different kind of nice.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.200
 South Florida is warm, but like...

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.400
 Yeah, it's not as nice as California.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.400
 Yeah, the humidity.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.400
 It talks about being outside.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.400
 Yeah.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.800
 This is the thing that's very important to Casey and I.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.600
 We're trying to figure out how we can spend more time outside and the Ozarks are very

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.600
 humid.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.560
 Did you know that they measure humidity?

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.200
 The official scientific tiers, have you seen this?

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:10.400
 Yes, I have, but you really have to go to a place to understand what the climate is

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:16.360
 like because Miami is humid, but we're by the ocean and there's a constant breeze all

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.360
 the time.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.280
 Yeah, so that's way, way, way less.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:24.120
 It's way more pleasant to be here than Orlando, which is just four hours north, but they're

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:28.840
 like a little bit inside from, like, though, which is not as close.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.760
 Yeah, it's like a nine day difference between how pleasant it is.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.480
 So we don't have the breeze.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:38.240
 We're in the hills and it's just like trees and it's stagnant and it's disgusting.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.400
 It's actually the top two tiers are miserable.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.920
 That's literally the top tier.

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:48.440
 It's like over 80% humidity is called miserable and the one below that, like 60 and 80 is

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.440
 oppressive.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.080
 That's so pretty.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.040
 Like it's oppressively humid today.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.500
 It's miserable humid.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:47:01.080
 I just say about time now, like it's miserable outside scientifically speaking, but here's

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.240
 the thing.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.240
 This is the me thing.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.040
 I don't mind the humidity.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.040
 Really?

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.040
 Yeah.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.520
 It must be here in the inheritance.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.520
 I think so.

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.520
 Yeah.

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.480
 I think my jeans have just been made for this this whole summer.

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:18.100
 I continue to work out outside and it's been really like the worst of the worst it gets

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:22.800
 and I've been working outside and yeah, I don't like a bucket of sweat.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.800
 It's like crazy.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.520
 I'm like, I'm just like covered.

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.520
 Yeah.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.680
 The layer of sweat.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.680
 But like it's fine.

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.680
 Yeah, it's funny.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.440
 I'm like, I don't go outside in the summer here because it's just disgusting and I don't

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.440
 want to get--

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.440
 Or the winter because it's cold.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.440
 Or the winter because it's cold.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.440
 Yeah.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.440
 I don't want to go outside.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.440
 But then I'll get in the sauna and the cold plunge because like, if it's on my turn.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.440
 Exactly.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.960
 It's exactly different if I choose it, you know what I mean?

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:46.960
 That's funny.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.960
 Yeah.

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:48.960
 So I find that.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.540
 I don't think there's a month here where I've been like, I'm just talking about the

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:52.540
 outside.

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.540
 Ironically.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:54.540
 Wow.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:59.800
 The one time it's kind of true is like in January where it gets cold and by cold I think it's

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.800
 like 60 degrees.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.880
 I love South Florida in the winter.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.880
 It's beautiful.

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:05.240
 No, here's why I hate it.

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:09.760
 I'm so used to just being able to wake up and go outside and then I go to do that and

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.760
 I feel horrible.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.520
 I'm like, yeah, I have to like think about what to put on and like, my friend just does

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.520
 not.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.520
 It just doesn't work.

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:28.280
 You told me this before that you hate having to put a shirt on to go outside.

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:32.200
 The other day I was, here's a before I have to jump off here's a funny little ticket.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:35.960
 So I was in my office and I was just in my box or something else.

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.520
 And I had to go to the bathroom.

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:45.260
 But my cleaning lady was in the house and I was like, oh, no, like, and she was like,

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:50.920
 right at the other side of it and just close it and this is like, hey, can you bring me

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:51.920
 a shirt?

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:57.280
 I don't want to be weird, but then I looked into my closet and it was in my closet either

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.160
 Theo or Mark or someone left of Tony here.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.160
 Nice.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.160
 It's in the closet.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.160
 I just flipped on.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.160
 Oh, that's awesome.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.160
 Yeah.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.160
 Thanks, Ping.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.160
 Thanks, Theo.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.160
 All right.

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.160
 You got to go out for a phone call.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.160
 Yeah.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.160
 Let's take a quick break.
