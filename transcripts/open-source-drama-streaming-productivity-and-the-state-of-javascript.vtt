00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 Uh, before this doesn't count for the podcast, Chris, just all this, just cut all this out.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.600
 I whenever you say that he just does and cut it out.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.640
 That's true.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.520
 Have you not learned?

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.000
 I know.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.720
 It's like it's fine.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.240
 It's like a signal from to include it.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.040
 But this is different.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.760
 It's not like I want you to cut it out because it's sensitive.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.440
 It's like, it's going to be super boring.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.880
 Let's just not put this at the beginning of our podcast because it's just, it's been a week off.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.240
 And like, this is not entertaining.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.720
 But I just had to set up everything to do this.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.000
 I've not, I'm not prepared to record our podcast on my stream.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.040
 And I did it first try.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.560
 I just wanted you to be proud of me for something because you're not proud of me for a lot of other things.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.920
 I just nailed it.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.640
 First try.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.360
 Did you?

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.320
 There's no audio.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.120
 There's no audio.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.920
 Are you serious?

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.680
 Double dax.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.560
 Oh, geez.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.960
 Hang on.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.360
 Okay.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.680
 Let's.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.280
 [MUSIC]

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.200
 Your haircut does, does look good.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.840
 Hey, thanks.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.040
 I appreciate compliments from you because I don't always get them.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.920
 No, it looks really good.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.960
 It looks way better than whatever the hell was going on yesterday.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:25.280
 Alex, I intentionally like went out of my way to try to be way more personable with my

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.920
 haircutter, my barber, to the point that he probably thought something was wrong with me.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.120
 Like what's going on with this guy?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.960
 Because I also had him change my haircut.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.480
 Like I was the first time in a year.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.920
 I've never tried something new.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.080
 And I was like, what do the zero fade?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.720
 And he's probably thinking like I just got divorced.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.640
 I just, something major just happened.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.000
 My dog died or something because I'm like talking to him all chatty and I'm like,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.120
 changing my head completely.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.360
 It didn't go the best.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.880
 He did not seem to want to talk.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.000
 I think it's his side.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.280
 I think that's not my fault.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.800
 I think he actually doesn't want to talk to me.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.880
 For whatever reason.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.800
 But then I start talking about movies and he kind of perked up.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.280
 That's just my little update on haircut talking.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.920
 I'm done.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.120
 And how did you feel out the word?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.680
 Were you, were you glad that you, you tried?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.520
 I mean, the whole time it was very meta in my brain.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.160
 I was just thinking about how Dax is going to be so proud of me when I tell him about this.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.240
 Like that's all I could think about.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.640
 So maybe that was, maybe that's why I didn't want to talk to me.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.160
 You could tell that wasn't really paying attention.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.040
 I was just like trying to get points for being social.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.640
 So I had an interesting experience as well at the barber.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.680
 So I was in Maine this past week.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.400
 I was like, yeah, you were.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.240
 I was in New Jersey in New York.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.880
 We'll get to it.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.400
 And in Maine, jerk.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.520
 And I was like, one morning, I was like, oh, let me just go get my head.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.360
 Like a head trim, get my head shaved.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.840
 Yeah.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.600
 So I just go to the most random place.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.800
 Just like the most random local, like super cheap place.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.800
 And the person that weighs me over because they have a slot open is

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.600
 an extremely, extremely old man.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.480
 Like I wouldn't be surprised if he was in his like 80s.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.480
 Like he was, he was quite old.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.640
 What?

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.920
 Okay.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.440
 His hands.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.200
 No, we're shaking the whole time.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.560
 But it was fine because he was just using the electric trimmer.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.560
 And so he did that.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.080
 Yeah, he didn't have a straight blade.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.600
 He wasn't like razoring your head.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.720
 At first, he didn't have a straight blade.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.280
 Oh, no.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.960
 He got up and then he finished.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.920
 And then he was like, and then he pulls out the straight blade to do stuff.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.360
 And he's like, and they're shaking.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.160
 And like, I was extremely, extremely nervous the whole time.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.800
 But it was fine.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.760
 I think it's weird.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.920
 Like his hands got stable when he used it.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.160
 Stable ish.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.600
 Once the adrenaline got flowing, once he gets into the zone,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.040
 he's in a slow state.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.400
 And he's like, I got this now.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.480
 But it wasn't a good result.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.200
 Like the head texture, my head felt super weird.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.080
 And it made me really appreciate the people I go to.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.280
 I don't go to a barber all the time.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.600
 But when I do go, they spend time just getting every little strand of hair out.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.840
 And then when I'm done, I have a completely smooth head.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.760
 And if I'm super rich one day, I think the one unique thing I'm going to spend my money on

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.280
 is I want someone to come to my house every morning and shave my head.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.440
 Oh, fresh cut every day.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.200
 Yeah, so we're going to have a smooth head every single day.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.040
 That'd be actually a pretty great routine.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.960
 Like, I bet that'd be very therapeutic.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.400
 You just have like a routine where you step there and you think about whatever that morning.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.800
 What's going on for the day and you're getting your head shaved?

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.840
 No, I have to talk to the person.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.320
 We as we as well.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.520
 Oh, we have to talk to the person.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.320
 That's right.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.960
 If you hire them to come to your house, you really have to talk to them at that point.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.080
 I feel like at that point, there's kind of an established pecking order here.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.480
 Like, I hired you to come to my house and shave my head.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.000
 I'm not going to talk to.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.720
 That's just too much.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.680
 I think that's kind of the relationship where you want to have that person in your life for

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.240
 a long time.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.000
 So I think it's actually the opposite if anything.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.200
 It's not as anonymous.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.920
 I could see that.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.240
 But I always think about how like the rock, when does he ever have hair that's like kind

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.720
 of growing?

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.680
 It's never a good point.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.400
 His head is perfectly smooth every single day.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.960
 I don't know how because it looks very, very, very, very good.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.120
 And maybe he does get it done every single day.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.240
 I kind of wanted to just like laser roll the hair off my head because it's like kind of,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.360
 the half state is pointless.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.800
 So it's that a thing.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.320
 Can you actually go with like laser away hair that'll never grow back?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.880
 Like if I just want to stop, if I just want to lock in this facial hair, can I just laser

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.240
 all around it and it'll just stay growing in this spot?

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.920
 I don't ever have to shave my cheeks again.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.640
 Is that a thing?

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.760
 That sounded so weird.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.160
 Shave my cheeks, my face cheeks.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.720
 I think so.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.880
 It is like a, it is a painful thing.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.960
 And it's, it's like semi-permanent, like it'll eventually like after years and years.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.480
 So that's probably maybe worth it, but I think lasering your face area.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.360
 Yeah.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.640
 This one's going to say, how does it kill the hair follicle and not like damage your skin in some way?

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.120
 I think it does slightly damage your skin because when you, when you get, when you get it done,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.080
 you can't go out in the sun for a little bit.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.400
 Ooh.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.920
 So I think your skin is damaged.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.160
 Speaking of damaged skin, did you see that video that was floating around?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.400
 Like explaining how a tattoo works?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.640
 No, but I'm very curious now.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.440
 You got me.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.040
 It is the craziest thing ever.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:21.920
 It's like the most, it's so much more violent of a process than, than you would think.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.400
 Yeah, I'm just realizing, I just know it's a needle and it like, it's like, is it like a sewing machine?

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.600
 That's all I know about tattoos.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.720
 I've never really understood how the ink stays there, how it like, I don't, I don't understand.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.000
 So here's what's wild.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.240
 You think of it as entirely a physical process where like they just shove ink under your skin.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.640
 Yep.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.960
 Yep.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.320
 And it just stays there, but it actually only works because of how our immune system works.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.600
 And it's really, really wild.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.800
 So when the immune system.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.520
 I would not have guessed it.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.560
 The needle goes, goes in and like super fast, right?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.480
 It's like, I think like four times a second or something.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.080
 It's like basically blasting holes into your skin all the way to, like the layer right below it.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.680
 And suppositing these giant things of these giant like molecules of ink.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.000
 Yep.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.120
 And your body sees that as like a traumatic event.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.560
 So it sends a bunch of white blood cells to try to like, you know,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.280
 get rid of all the bacteria and stuff that was pulled in.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.080
 In that process, it keeps, it tries to figure out what to do with ink.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.680
 And it, it hits a point where it gives up because it doesn't know how to like defeat the ink.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.000
 Yeah.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.040
 And it basically like surrounds it and locks the ink in place to prevent it from going

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.320
 into the rest of your body.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.440
 Do your body identifies it as like a threat?

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.280
 And your white blood cells like sacrifice themselves to keep it trapped there.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.520
 And that's why it like, it stays there and it stays still.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.640
 And over time, obviously, some of it breaks apart and like, you know,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.760
 gets flushed through your body.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.280
 And that's why it gets a little bit blurry over time.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:51.840
 Yeah.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.040
 But it's a little bit.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.360
 Yeah.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.320
 If it wasn't for your immune system, they would just kind of like dissipate through your body.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.120
 Like, really?

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.880
 I never considered that.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.600
 Like why the ink stays in the spot that it stays.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.360
 I guess I probably just thought it was like dying the cells.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.360
 Like just coloring the cells or something.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.440
 But I guess your cells are constantly replacing themselves.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.400
 So that doesn't make sense.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.240
 Well, the skin layer is like, it's constantly like rising.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.640
 Like it pushes dead things to the top.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.360
 And then I like, you know, you're shedding like millions of them every minute or something crazy

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.760
 like that.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.080
 So it needs to go below the skin and then something needs to kind of hold it in place.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.120
 That is wild.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.680
 So your skin is just translucent enough to kind of see the ink.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.800
 Yeah.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.400
 Through the, oh, yeah, you have a tattoo.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.600
 We've talked about this.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.480
 Yeah, right here.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:34.880
 Yeah.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.280
 So that's now you know how it all works.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.120
 Does it make you feel differently about your tattoo?

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.360
 Yeah.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.920
 Because the video really like dramatize dramatize it.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.080
 Yeah.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.960
 The same thought like, wait, dramatize it.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.200
 It's just like this horrible moment for your body and all these like my blood cells

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.240
 sacrifice themselves so that you can you can have a tattoo.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.120
 And now I understand why when people get big tattoos,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.600
 they get really tired or almost like sick for a couple of days.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.080
 Mm hmm.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.000
 Because you're making it work in the response.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.400
 Yeah.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.920
 Interesting.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.200
 Yeah.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.640
 Now I definitely don't want a tattoo.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.520
 I was kind of on the fence.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.400
 I was kind of on the fence now just knowing that like my immune system gets involved.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:12.720
 Nah.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.520
 I'm good.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.880
 You got your new haircut.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.560
 I feel like a tattoo would go.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.280
 Honestly, if you got the exact same tattoo as me with that haircut,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.240
 I think you would look great.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.680
 So that would be kind of cool actually.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.320
 That'd be like locking in our friendship that is now dead.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.280
 Is our friendship dead?

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.960
 Could we go over that a little bit?

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.040
 We haven't just been on the two of us in like four or five weeks.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:31.760
 It's been a while.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.320
 I feel like we've lost that dialogue.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.280
 We used to talk a lot.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.840
 And then you travel constantly.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.360
 And I'm a little bothered and then you watch me stream and you're bothered.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.720
 So do we just not like each other anymore?

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.280
 Is that the deal?

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.560
 Are we just over each other?

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.440
 I think that's what happened.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.800
 It's not funny for a couple of weeks.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.880
 And we realized it's actually better that we don't talk at all.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.360
 That will be realized.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.320
 Oh, geez.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.680
 That was the conclusion you came to.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.160
 Okay.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.040
 Feels good.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.160
 No, I'm just kidding.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.600
 Why were you so frustrated?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.880
 For context, the podcast listeners are not necessarily stream watchers.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.880
 You joined my stream this morning.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.560
 I've been streaming again in the last couple of weeks.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.800
 And sometimes you watch me and you just can't handle it.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.000
 You're like, this guy's too dumb.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.160
 I can't watch this guy program for another second.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.480
 And you just start screaming in chat with all caps.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.720
 What was this specifically this morning?

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.160
 Because like most times I know like, yeah,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.360
 that part of it was refreshing.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.480
 This morning, I don't know.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.960
 I didn't figure out exactly what you're frustrated by.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.120
 It was just like any other time.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.400
 Like I see what the problem is.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.320
 And I'm having a hard time communicating it.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.760
 And it's like then there's like the lag.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.120
 Like I say something.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.360
 And you're looking at something else.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.240
 You're not looking at chat.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.400
 Takes a while from the end of the time you come look at it.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.720
 Like the context is totally lost.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.480
 And you're just like, what the hell is he talking about?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:46.880
 Yeah.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.720
 He's just a lot of frustrating back and forth.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.480
 And I was in the shower when I was watching.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.560
 Which is totally normal to watch Twitch.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.160
 I'm not even going to try to explain that.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:56.800
 Yeah, that's fine.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.320
 And my phone was getting wet.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.680
 So I couldn't even type properly.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.760
 So half of those messages of me screaming

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.200
 were just me trying to actually just type.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.200
 And it was just the water was.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.160
 And I got so annoyed that I got out of the shower

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.080
 and I went to my computer to type it out.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.080
 You said you had a theory about why I'm so slow on Twitch.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.760
 Is that real or were you just messing with me?

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.080
 I've like made like this kind of implicit assumption

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.720
 where I'm like, because I know you get a lot of stuff done.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.320
 You definitely get a lot of stuff done.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.960
 And I would say like an above average amount of stuff.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.640
 You get together.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.080
 But you would never know that watching your stream.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.600
 I've heard this.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.640
 So I'm like, Adam must be like really good off stream

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.160
 like by comparison because he has to make up for it.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.920
 Yeah, once it does make up for a little time in.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.840
 And yeah, I just like get as much done as you do.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.720
 But so now it's taking another day like, okay,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.120
 like what is actually going wrong?

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.440
 Because it's not of course everyone on Twitch

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.200
 like you start reading chat and you get distracted.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.560
 It's like your time thing.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.120
 But I swear when you're on Twitch,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.400
 there's this other thing that happens

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.240
 where you just like zoom in way too far.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.080
 Just like the next step.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:06.480
 Uh-huh.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.480
 And I'm like, there's, and then so like,

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.240
 sometimes you're doing things and you're like,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.720
 not like why am I doing this?

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.040
 Yeah.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.560
 It's like part of your brain turns off

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.240
 and you just like do whatever chat does.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.880
 Really? It is. There's something,

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.280
 because I've tried when I came back to streaming,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.200
 I knew I have to actually be productive

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.160
 or I won't keep doing it.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.760
 Like at some point I realized like,

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.880
 I'm not really getting anything done.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.000
 I got to stop streaming.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.040
 And I want to stream.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.360
 It's so fun to have friends on the internet

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.640
 that you interact with.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.080
 You know the fun parts of streaming.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.040
 Like they're very fun.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.920
 So I want to keep it like as this long-term thing

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.000
 that I do just a little bit every day,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.680
 maybe just a little bit every week, whatever.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.880
 So I've consciously came into it saying,

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.600
 I'm going to stay focused and I'm going to actually get stuff done.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.960
 And I feel like I've done a much better job

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.880
 of actually staying focused on my screen

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.240
 and actually in my text editor and not just talking.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.440
 I've done that part, but there's something different.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.280
 And my theory was that like,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.120
 you know how you're different around certain people?

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.800
 You just have like a certain, not like intentionally,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.600
 but you're just you're a different person around every individual.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.760
 Like you have a different personality that comes out.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.960
 I feel like something about the Twitch chat community,

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.160
 like my friends on Twitch.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.240
 And Twitter, I mean they're on Twitter too.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.080
 But I feel like when I'm around that group,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.280
 I'm just a totally different person.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.640
 And I can't quite describe it,

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.720
 but that person is not very good at programming.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.880
 We're not very good at like, it's not programming.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.320
 It's not very good at like you're saying,

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.720
 like seeing the whole picture and just like being effective

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.800
 and getting things done on a schedule.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.280
 It's like I do, I obsess over stupid little things

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.480
 that I don't need to spend time on.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.000
 And then I spend 45 minutes on it.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.160
 And like, I wouldn't do that just sitting here alone.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
 And I don't know exactly what it is.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.680
 It's not like I think it's good content.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.560
 It's not like I'm like,

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.120
 I'm going to wow them with me staring at this padding issue

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.480
 for 45 minutes.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.640
 I don't actually think that's entertaining.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.080
 But for some reason,

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.360
 I feel like I'm that different person.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.480
 I don't know, I got to figure it out.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.320
 Or just stop streaming.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.400
 Yeah, I actually, I actually don't think,

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.160
 I mean, the focusing on details part,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.000
 like I'm like, I think that's fine.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.320
 Like I don't think that's, that's weird.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.040
 I think that's.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.720
 Oh, and I'm super into details.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.000
 Like when I'm off stream,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.320
 I mean, I very much care to get all the little things right.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.360
 I just can't figure out what it is about being on Twitch

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.600
 that I think I focus, I do focus on the wrong things.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.880
 I don't know, I don't like it.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.560
 Yeah, I mean, I kind of get it too,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.600
 because I think when you work normally you have like,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.520
 I don't know, I feel like you have like this larger,

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.920
 not you just people in general, like yourself too.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.600
 Have this larger sense of what you're trying to do.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.760
 And maybe on Twitch,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.040
 it kind of feels like you're trying to figure out

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.440
 the next thing you're going to do.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.360
 I don't know, it just feels like there's like a larger context missing.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.200
 Yeah, there's definitely something missing.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.080
 I don't know.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:38.560
 Yeah.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.360
 Twitch chat says maybe I'm anxious or nervous.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.080
 I don't think so.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.120
 I mean, I don't think I get nervous being on Twitch.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.600
 It's not that it feels totally random to me.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.200
 It feels like you're just behaving in this completely random other way.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.480
 Yeah, it's just a different, I just feel like a different person.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.560
 But I feel that way like I've had this thought,

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.320
 this kind of branches out into other stuff.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.080
 I've had this thought in terms of like,

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.120
 if I'm just talking with you,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.760
 I feel like this is as much me just myself as I can be.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.520
 Like I'm like you or with you, like I am with Casey.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.160
 Like my closest friends, I feel like I'm just me.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:18.240
 But like react Miami in like a small group of like four or five people

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.800
 where it's you plus other people, I'm just not me.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.160
 And I'm a different person.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.560
 And then I start feeling like I have this different identity.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.200
 Do you feel that way?

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.720
 Do you feel like I have different identities?

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.400
 Like completely different personhoods depending on who's around.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.640
 Yeah, I definitely have that, but it's not,

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.560
 that's not like what trips it.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.720
 I think for me, and this is like a very normal thing.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.920
 It's when I meet someone new,

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.920
 it takes me like a couple of weeks of like meeting them a few times

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.920
 for like my actual personality to come out.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.840
 And more and more lately, I'm like,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.600
 that first personality is so fake.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.600
 Or like it just like, I hate it.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.720
 I hate it so much.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.120
 And I don't know how it just comes out every single time.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.320
 And Chan had this funny tweet.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.560
 I don't think he saw it because you were talking about the same

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.160
 dynamic in a different way where he was like,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.440
 a trick for that is when you meet someone new,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.600
 just try to figure out who they remind you most of

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.920
 and just pretend that that's who they are.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.600
 I'm like, that actually I remember this tweet.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.320
 Yeah.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.840
 I'm like, that seems like that could help me.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.960
 That's my exact problem.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.760
 Like I need to, I just wish I could pretend

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.960
 whatever initial layer I need to get over.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.800
 Like I wish that would happen right away.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.560
 Yeah, I remember that tweet because I responded

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.440
 because I don't do it intentionally, but certain people,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.640
 and I don't do it with everybody.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.640
 Maybe if I did it with everybody, it would help me.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.840
 Like if I were intentional about it.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.480
 But there are certain people that remind me so much

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.560
 of somebody that I just am that person.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.520
 Like I go back.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.920
 So for instance, prime is my college friend, Rob,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.960
 like to a tee.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.240
 I mean, their voice is the same.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.800
 Like literally like they're the same in my mind,

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.000
 they're the same person.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.760
 So when I'm around prime, I find myself,

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.280
 it's like that's Rob.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.920
 And I feel like I'm thinking how I was with Rob

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.040
 in college and that's just not, that's not prime.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.080
 It's a different human being.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.280
 He doesn't have any of that context.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.840
 So then I like try and not be that, and it's just even harder.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.520
 There's people like that.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.200
 They just remind me so much of somebody

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.120
 that was, I was close to it some time.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.600
 And then I just become the person that I was.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.680
 It's effective in like getting over that initial hurdle

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.040
 until it's very distracting.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.600
 And you're constantly thinking about it when you're around that person.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.000
 Yeah, I think you're thinking with groups.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.280
 You feel like your personality is different,

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.600
 or do you just feel like you are quieter?

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.080
 Like that's what I feel like I just lose my personality.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.360
 Yeah, I just don't have one.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.680
 I become completely a shell of a person.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.360
 I just kind of walk around and stare.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.160
 Is that autism?

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:40.880
 What is that?

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.240
 I blame everything on autism.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.880
 I will say that if you're specifically talking

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.400
 about hanging out, react Miami.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.560
 So this is always a thing, right?

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.000
 When groups of people hang out,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.160
 sometimes it's hard to like get a word in.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.920
 Yeah, especially if like the dynamic is new.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.320
 Yeah.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.320
 And on top of that, we're like,

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.400
 we're hanging out with professional talkers, you know?

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.600
 That's true.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.320
 So yeah, our group is kind of good at talking.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.400
 So true.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.320
 Yeah, it just becomes like,

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.640
 I think it's extra more in that direction.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.200
 So you've got to be really like,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.800
 you've got to be like really practiced,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.080
 or really wanting to say something to like say a lot

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.520
 in those contexts, is that what you're saying?

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.960
 Yeah, I mean, I felt this way when I first started at meet Liz's friend,

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.480
 like Liz's friends from high school, like they're all married,

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.640
 but even their husbands have been part of that group for a very long time.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:32.960
 Yeah.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.800
 And when I first started hanging out with them,

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.600
 I was super quiet because there's a rhythm to things.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.760
 And I couldn't like, I couldn't think fast enough.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.800
 I couldn't, you know, whatever.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.200
 But over time, it got a lot better just through practice.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.480
 Liz had this funny thing.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.240
 So the reason I was in Maine is Alan is getting married.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.520
 So his wife was having,

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.120
 or his friend says having a bachelorette type of thing.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.440
 So Liz went and they spent basically like four days in a cabin in Maine,

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.200
 and me and Alan hung out as a apartment.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:07.040
 And Liz came back and she's like, wow, I feel smarter,

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.480
 because I just spent four days like socializing for 12 hours a day.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.720
 And my brain just feels faster.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.920
 I feel less slow.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.880
 And yeah, she's like, I think after COVID,

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.320
 all that stuff, that part of her life just reduced a lot.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.320
 And she thinks it's literally making her dumber,

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.840
 because it's like a part of your brain.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.280
 You need to exercise.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.560
 And yeah, she just felt like, like just, I don't know,

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.480
 she just felt, I can tell, like from her energy,

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.400
 like she just literally seemed smarter just from talking.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.960
 - Yeah, just being in that situation,

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.560
 having to interact with other people.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.200
 - Yeah.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.360
 I definitely feel slow if I do that for a while.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.760
 - It feels to me like, I think I'm having thoughts

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.360
 in those moments in those settings,

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.560
 where it's like I'm trying to figure out what I bring to the converse,

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.760
 to the, what I bring to the conversation,

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.800
 what I bring to the group, what do I have to offer here?

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.320
 Because I don't really, like,

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.040
 things don't just pop in my head that I want to say out loud.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.960
 Like, it's like I lose that ability.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.120
 And I guess when I'm with people I'm really close with,

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.400
 things pop in my head constantly.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.760
 But when I'm in a group like that,

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.480
 even a small group of people I would call friends,

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.280
 it feels like I don't have things popping in my head.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.400
 It's like, instead, I just think,

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.480
 what would I even want to talk about right now?

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.360
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.680
 I tell like, I think that is normal.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.360
 It feels like you're watching TV all of a sudden.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.640
 You're just there to like observe.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.840
 - Yes, yes.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.280
 That's a perfect description.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:23.920
 Yeah.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.360
 - But I think it's just practice.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.160
 - It's just practice.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.960
 Yeah.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.720
 I think I'm more talkative when I'm really,

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.000
 I think I'm really confident in where I belong,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.400
 or my place in a setting.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.800
 Like, if I go back to school,

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.760
 or like, any groups where I'm established,

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.080
 and it's not like I can only have one friend

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.360
 where I talk one-on-one.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.840
 I know I can be in groups and be myself,

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.520
 but I think it's like,

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.400
 I had to establish some kind of a bearing.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.320
 Like, this is how I fit into this.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.360
 Or maybe it's just repetition.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.800
 I've just been around them enough.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.800
 And now, it's totally natural.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.880
 I'm describing like, very normal basic stuff.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.680
 I'm just like, socialization 101.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.920
 And I'm actually like, I have insights here,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.480
 but I'm learning things.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.600
 I'm 38, I'm learning.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.840
 - Those are insightful, what it's not is autism.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.680
 - Okay, it's not autism.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.440
 I gotta stop saying everything is just autism.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.960
 I'm like, man, I'm bad at everything.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.840
 I'm probably just autistic.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.040
 I actually think autism is better than being normal.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.040
 So I don't want to shame anyone who's autistic.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:23.520
 I'm just saying.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.800
 - Yeah, you're claiming it.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.520
 - It's like, you're not kidding.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.160
 - I'm claiming, yeah.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.080
 I'm saying, I want to be autistic.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.040
 I hope I'm autistic.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.400
 - Social stuff is hard.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:32.960
 - It's so hard.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.000
 Let's talk about a ton of stuff that's happened,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.760
 I guess, since we last talked.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.160
 So we can pick our, pick up the litter.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.400
 But I want to talk about this whole open source thing.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.880
 - The node 0.4.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:51.360
 It's so fascinating just to get this little window

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.400
 into a world that has existed for years

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.600
 in terms of like established open source maintainer,

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.880
 maintains lots of projects.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.160
 Everyone in open source is interacted with this person

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.280
 and has opinions.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.800
 But then something pops up that kind of like

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.200
 takes over the zeitgeist on Twitter

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.040
 and everybody gets a peek all at once

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.200
 into this dynamic that's existed for a while.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.520
 Do you have thoughts on the whole situation?

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.000
 Had you bumped into this individual?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.760
 Did you have already, okay.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.720
 - No, okay, so just for context,

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.200
 there was a GitHub issue.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.320
 There was actually two good issues,

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.280
 I think, what I saw, where this person who is like,

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.760
 well, well, known, I guess in the community

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.800
 was adding a bunch of packages as dependencies

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.800
 that were quite large, very, very large,

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.440
 complicated packages depended on a bunch of other packages

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.520
 to a project to make it support node 0.4,

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.360
 which I don't even know how old that is, like.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.960
 - I have no idea.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.920
 - 10 years old, I gotta know.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.480
 That's forever ago, 0.4.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.240
 Everyone's like, why are you doing this?

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.840
 Literally, nobody has asked for this at all.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.320
 And he kept explaining his reasons why,

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.400
 like, backwards compatibility, blah, blah, blah.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.600
 What cracked me up was Rich Harris was in there a bunch

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.000
 'cause it was a project that Spelt uses.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.880
 And he was just like, what are you talking about?

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.960
 Like, why are you doing this?

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.880
 And I was very, very confused.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.240
 And I just found it really funny

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.680
 'cause, you know, Rich Harris' time is worth a lot

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.360
 in terms of what he could be doing.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.080
 Looking at that, he probably spent, like,

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.480
 at least two hours, like, probably in the way

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.760
 we're applying to this.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.120
 And I'm like, this is so funny

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.640
 that someone could just monopolize his time like that.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.240
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.760
 - Yeah, and then it got posted on Twitter,

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.200
 and then a bunch of people started piling on,

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.040
 and then the threads started being locked.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.720
 And I think the interesting bit was,

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.680
 there was some accusation of something

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:53.200
 because he seemed to be basically just for very little reason,

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.160
 just taking default things and wrapping them

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.760
 in his own packages and then using that as a dependency.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.840
 And people pointed out that he was part of some company tied lift

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.240
 that pays OSS developers to follow certain security practices

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.080
 and based off of how much your packages used you get paid more.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.360
 So people were like, is that because this makes no sense?

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.200
 Is that what's motivating you?

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.880
 So yeah, that situation was pretty funny.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.000
 - I have so many different thoughts around the whole thing.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.560
 - They're just in rapid-fire random order.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.920
 First of all, why have 0.4?

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.840
 If you're gonna go back and you're gonna be all purist about it,

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.800
 why not 0.1?

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.480
 I don't know, what was the first node version?

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.280
 Like, why'd you stop?

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.800
 What was the change between 0.4 and 0.1

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.640
 that you were like, can't support that?

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.920
 Those guys, they're in the cold.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.360
 But 0.4, you're good.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.560
 That's just random to me that it's 0.4.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.840
 Yeah, the other thing, I guess like the incentive thing,

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.440
 it's like clearly, I mean,

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.240
 I don't understand where the money's coming from

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.120
 for this tied lift thing.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.200
 I don't understand that whole business model.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.000
 I don't get it.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.960
 But just assuming--

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.080
 - Just assuming it makes no sense.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:00.880
 - It makes no sense.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.280
 But you get money based on packaged downloads.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.840
 And like, whether it's not like,

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.880
 I don't like trying to like, guess people's motives,

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.680
 because you just can't.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.920
 You can't know why someone's motivated to do something.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.840
 But you're clearly incentivized.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.440
 Whether it's your motive or not,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.600
 you are incentivized to get more packaged downloads.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.440
 So it is kind of fishy on that angle.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.840
 But the biggest thing for me is just like,

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.200
 if the whole world, like all of the Twitter mob is angry at you,

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.720
 there's probably something to that.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.200
 It's not like, just Twitter being Twitter.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.440
 Like, if everybody in GitHub and everybody on Twitter

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.080
 disagrees with you, I don't know, maybe you're wrong.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.160
 And like, also, why are we all using these packages?

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.280
 Why can't we just like, not use them, fork them,

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.160
 use something else?

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.280
 Like, I don't understand how this person has maintained

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.760
 so much power within the open source community,

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.120
 maintaining 400 packages.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.720
 Why do people keep handling this person?

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.000
 Maintainership.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 When he's already got 400 packages under his name.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.440
 Like, maybe, maybe not.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.640
 Maybe he finds someone else.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.120
 - Yeah.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.400
 - I don't understand that dynamic.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.440
 - Yeah, it's weird.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.800
 But I have seen this type of thing before.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.800
 To me, it's almost like hoarding.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.680
 Like, I feel like there's a weird obsession

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.840
 to doing these things of just like hoarding these

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.000
 very low value packages, to be honest.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.520
 Like, it's just a, there's like a history there,

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.040
 which is why the package exists.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.800
 And like, if you're building something new,

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.160
 you would never use any of this stuff.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.160
 So it's just like this historical kind of cluster

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.200
 of stuff, like 400 packages is what,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.320
 I mean, I don't know what the actual number is,

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.920
 but 400, if it's 400 packages,

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.840
 that's like, I don't use anywhere near that many

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.640
 across all my projects, like nowhere near that many.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.520
 And I probably even use a single one of those packages either.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:39.840
 - Yeah.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.840
 - So, yeah, it's a bizarre thing.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.920
 - Well, directly, or do you think you use them?

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.840
 Does SST depend on any of them transitively or otherwise?

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.880
 Have you done the check thing?

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.920
 There's like a check.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.400
 - Yeah, I know.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.320
 But I don't think, I don't think we do,

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.000
 'cause we, I mean, maybe not through pulling me.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.120
 We haven't checked, well,

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.960
 'cause pulling me might bring in a bunch of stuff.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.120
 - Do you remember what the thing was?

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.960
 - Volda, it was like Voldemort.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.040
 (both laughing)

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.840
 - See if it's packed.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.360
 (both laughing)

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.360
 Voldemort open-sourced light.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.800
 - What was even crazier is,

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.840
 somebody in there linked some kind of solution

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.360
 to this specific person?

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.240
 I don't know if you saw that.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.040
 - No.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.640
 - So we built like a project that just swaps

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.680
 all of his stuff out.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.880
 - Oh, really?

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.080
 - And it wasn't something, so I was like,

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.280
 oh, did they just build this and react?

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.480
 No, they built this a while ago,

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.680
 'cause I guess they, this has been a problem for a while.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.200
 - This is like a whole subculture

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.840
 of people who know about this guy, hate this guy.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.080
 And then there's like the human element of this,

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.080
 'cause I've now seen him on Twitter.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.960
 I didn't know at first that he wasn't just on GitHub.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.880
 And it's like, I don't know, he's got,

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.520
 I'm sure he's got like a family and he's whatever he's human.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.760
 But like, it doesn't matter if you're a human,

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.720
 we're all humans.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.080
 So like, don't be a dick online, I don't know.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.240
 Don't be such a whatever he's being.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.880
 Like, if he's upset or like you're patronizing me

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.960
 or whatever and he's saying stuff on Twitter,

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.560
 like everyone disagrees with you.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.240
 So maybe just like bow down?

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.200
 - That's what's weird.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.040
 It was like, it wasn't a debate.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.000
 It was like a 100% person.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.280
 - 100% person.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.960
 - Is there one person, that's what I'd love to know.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.640
 If anyone listening to this knows a person

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.600
 who sides with this individual and says, yes,

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.400
 this stuff is important because I'm on TC39 or whatever,

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.240
 I would love to hear it.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.400
 Because I haven't seen a single person come out and defend.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.720
 And I'd love to know, is this person literally on an island?

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.880
 And then why, why be so staunch?

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.160
 - I have like a bigger thought

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.920
 about this backwards compatibility thing.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.680
 I have like a very strong thought on this.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:38.960
 I think that a lot of engineers obsess over backwards compatibility

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.960
 and they hold it to like as like some kind of trying.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.880
 And it holds like a ton of things back

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.080
 and you're actually a bad engineer

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.800
 if you just like obsessively focus on it.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.080
 It's like one of those things where it's technically correct, right?

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.160
 Everyone can agree it's good to be backwards compatible.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.680
 It's easy to tell whether you're being backwards compatible or not.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.600
 And because it's just obvious in those ways,

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.680
 people just 100% optimize for it.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.440
 It's like any 100% test coverage or something.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.840
 And it's seen as this like thing that you can't

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.840
 violate or you're bad if you break it.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.520
 But there's so much like it's like everything else in engineering.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.960
 It's about judgment being infinitely backwards compatible is horrible.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.280
 And we have so many problems in the ecosystem because

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.040
 there's just this engineering bias towards backwards compatibility.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.640
 Like, yeah, it sucks when things break,

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.600
 but the world changes and there's new ideas.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.640
 There's new things that can exist.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.240
 And if you're just constantly focused on backwards compatibility,

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.040
 what you end up creating are these like,

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.520
 you think that, oh, if we're backwards compatible forever,

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.080
 that means like we're bringing people along forever.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.240
 But what actually happens is you have some kind of thing that's working

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.040
 and the world changes and it needs to make this jump.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.040
 It never makes that jump.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.240
 So you end up just trapping all these people in this little bubble

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.560
 that can never make the jump to the next thing.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.400
 And then you end up someone else that ends up having to create a new thing

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.320
 instead of just like iterating on the old thing

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.680
 because the old things aren't evolving enough.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.000
 And they get stuck in this like local, local maxima.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.720
 So yeah, you see this with a CJS ESM thing.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.120
 Everyone is like, what's he commented on?

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.440
 Have you seen, I don't know if you've seen his comments on that?

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.400
 No, what did he say?

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.080
 Somebody dug up some of his comments about it should like ESM was a mistake

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.680
 and it should everything just be CJS.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.200
 That's the only way you can be safe and like accepting of all users.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.480
 ESM's hostile.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.320
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.840
 So ignoring whether or not ESM should have existed period,

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.520
 let's say, let's just take that for granted.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.360
 Like there's this new thing that ESM makes sense as a concept.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.480
 People keep shipping ESM plus CJS packages.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.760
 And that like mode leads to so many, so many, so many issues

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.560
 because it's very hard to ship both them together correctly.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.920
 And tools don't handle them well and there's like confusion.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.520
 And people keep just trying to ship both over and over.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.640
 And so that just being like, we're not supporting CJS anymore.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.560
 We're just moving forward to ESM.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.560
 It's going to be a one or two painful years.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.840
 But it's better than like 10 years of being stuck on both.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.400
 And some packages have done that switch to be fair.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.240
 Well, yeah, didn't, what's his name?

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.200
 Syndrome or the really famous other big things?

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:17.920
 Didn't he do that?

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.600
 Didn't he say, yeah, I thought did he go ESM only?

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.160
 I think so.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.040
 I think he made some shift and a lot of people were upset.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.000
 But what I don't get is there's older versions of the library.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:28.720
 You can still use it.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:28.880
 Right.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.840
 You can just still use it.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.720
 Yeah, I don't get it.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.600
 I don't get that.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.720
 It's just a practical, it's the lack of touch with reality.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:39.840
 Because I think Rich here is somebody on the salt side of that PR discussion mentioned

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.760
 that they released this breaking change where they didn't support all Node-Vint versions

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.360
 like a year ago.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.080
 And no one has raised a single issue saying, yes, exactly, yeah.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.480
 Like a year and nobody has an issue.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.560
 And like, it's practically speaking, you can stand on your correctness.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:59.920
 Like everything has to be more correct or that's the most important thing.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.880
 And I think that's the way this person, I haven't said the name.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.840
 I just don't want to, I don't know.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.400
 I think everyone can figure out who this person is.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.840
 But they sort of tried to frame the conversation in the PR as like, yeah,

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.960
 I get that you're frustrated.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.680
 It's frustrating when someone values something and somebody values another.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.440
 But it's not about who values what?

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.560
 Because there's like objective, you're not making good judgment.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:23.200
 You can say I value correctness more than you and you value whatever more than me.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.000
 But it's not that.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.840
 It's you just don't have good judgment.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.400
 And that's okay.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.560
 But you shouldn't be in charge of 400 NPM packages.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.920
 If you have that bad judgment.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.080
 And as an ecosystem, I'm not saying he should do something.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:37.600
 I'm just saying as a community, why do we keep handling this person more packages to maintain?

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.760
 And also, why do we keep using these packages?

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.320
 Why can't we just, I don't understand the simple question like,

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.760
 why have we not moved off of some of these dependencies?

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.280
 And just fork them and maintain.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.320
 I know that's like work.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.600
 Somebody has to maintain them.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.320
 Yeah.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:50.960
 Is that the problem?

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.000
 Is that all it blows down to?

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.080
 It's like nobody's stepped up to just do the work.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.160
 Yeah, it's tedious boring work.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.680
 Like, forking it and updating everything and then, you know, just setting up.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.680
 See, yeah, it's all of that just stupid.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:01.920
 Yeah.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.480
 Trivio, like, logistical work.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.800
 It's better than I not have to do that.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.120
 And like the mode, yeah, it's just weird.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.320
 Like, I don't, I just, all this is so alien to me.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.920
 Why would I want to maintain 400 packages?

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.760
 Like, not new stuff that's being worked on.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.520
 Just 400 packages that, like, barely irrelevant.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.280
 And nobody should be using anymore.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.480
 Yeah, that, that's when I start to, like, guess.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.960
 I don't say it publicly, but that's when I start to guess it motives.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.960
 Like, I know the incentives are there for the, the tide lift thing.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:40.080
 But when, when I learn that there's 400 packages under this person's direct maintainer ship,

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.040
 that's when I start assuming some things about you.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.120
 I'm not going to say it here because it's just, I don't know.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.040
 I don't need to, like, attack some of these characters.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.520
 But like, there's a certain type of personality that would be like,

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:56.560
 I want to have as much control or as much whatever responsibility or ownership or

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.960
 surface area in this ecosystem as possible.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:05.040
 I don't think that's just like, I don't know how to frame that in like a, uh, charitable light,

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.480
 I guess is how I would say it.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.000
 Yeah, I used to go deeper into it.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.360
 Like, I did have some other thoughts on something because, uh, again,

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.040
 like we're just judging based off of random messages that this person has posted.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.200
 So we could be reading into this too much.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.720
 Yeah. And I, I've only known to this person for like three days.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.520
 So what do I know?

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.400
 Like, I, I'm sure I'm oversimplifying everything here.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.680
 And I don't have all the back history.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.160
 This person sits on the TC 39 committee or whatever.

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.200
 He chaired it.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.880
 I don't know stuff that's way over my head that I don't understand how browsers work

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.600
 or JavaScript.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.400
 Oh, you know what?

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.680
 Let's talk about TC 39.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.960
 And there, there are another example of what I'm just so tired of.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.040
 Like it's just the most bureaucratic.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:46.000
 It sounds like I get, again, these things are framed as just objectively good.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.680
 Oh, it's like an open committee with like everyone collaborating.

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.280
 And like we're all deciding on a future.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.200
 It sounds good, but what it is the end of the day is it's a committee that lacks any vision.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.640
 If you look at certain proposals, I've just been stuck forever for the dumbest reasons.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:06.080
 Like a great example is the, the pipe operator in JavaScript.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.680
 Clearly a lot of people want it.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.320
 I'm someone that extremely wants the pipe operator.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.200
 I think there's, um, there's, there's a lot of value in it.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:19.200
 There's just been endless discussion and debate over how exactly to implement it.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:25.680
 When other languages have it in every flavor that you can look at and they're all fine.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.160
 Just pick one, but it's just like infinite because it, oh, it's a type of thing where

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.000
 there's like room for discussion.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.360
 So then infinite discussion happens.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:33.760
 Yeah.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.080
 Yeah.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.200
 Nobody like makes a call.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.800
 Fills the container like a liquid.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.200
 Yeah.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:37.520
 Yeah.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.080
 Exactly.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:38.480
 Exactly.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:38.960
 Exactly.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:44.720
 So it's like, yeah, you can't make the wrong decision because all these things are permanent,

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.880
 but you also need to have some kind of judgment.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.520
 Like literally any one of these proposals would have been fine.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.000
 I'm okay with literally any, any one of them.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.920
 And other languages, there's a language that's successful with each, each implementation.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.080
 So you just, you literally can't go completely wrong.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:58.560
 Yeah.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.960
 The only thing wrong is just like waffling and making it drag out forever.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.320
 Like that's the only way you can screw it up.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.240
 It's been literal years for now.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:06.480
 Yes.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.680
 I think that, yeah.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.760
 Well, I was just going to say, what is an example?

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.640
 You mentioned other languages.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.800
 What's an example of an ecosystem that gets this right?

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.040
 And how can the JavaScript community learn from that?

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.240
 And what would it take?

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.120
 Is it even possible?

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.880
 Is it like voting for politicians?

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.080
 It just feels like pointless.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:20.960
 It's never going to change.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.560
 Other languages have BDFLs.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.800
 That's really what it comes down to.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:25.200
 Big.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:25.680
 I don't know.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.640
 What is BDFL?

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.600
 I was going to try and guess.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.600
 Oh, benevolent dictator for life.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:35.120
 Like you take things like Python or Elixir or nice.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.080
 And that works out.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.200
 That's the best approach.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.680
 It's to have a individual.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.000
 It's the best approach when you're fortunate enough

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.280
 to have a talented individual.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.480
 That's like rare.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:46.880
 Yeah.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.960
 And then it's the worst approach when they're not.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.520
 When that person moves on and we're like the most takes over.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.080
 Yeah.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.920
 It's just like it's like a lottery.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.760
 Like some things in the world were lucky enough

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.560
 that that lined up.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.120
 So is there any hope for JavaScript to like move

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.480
 towards something more like that?

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.360
 Or just less committee, death by committee stuff?

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.400
 No, there isn't.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.720
 But the only thing I'm really complaining about here

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.320
 is the attitude around this stuff.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.480
 We don't have a BDFL.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.000
 We have a committee.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.120
 No one should be proud that we have a committee.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.480
 We're settling for a committee

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.680
 because we don't have a BDFL.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.600
 But there's so much like pride over all this bureaucratic stuff

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.880
 where it's like nobody wants that actually.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.120
 Yeah, there's like an era of like respect.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.760
 You must bestow upon the TC 39.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.840
 Like I don't know what that is and I don't care.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.520
 Like I'm sorry.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.880
 This just seems, I feel like that's not going to make it

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.840
 through the generations.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.160
 Like I just feel like there's a generation coming up

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.520
 even more detached than I am.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.160
 That's just going to be like, who cares?

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.360
 And how do they get around it?

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.400
 I don't know how they get around it

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.160
 because they like browsers and stuff.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.520
 Like the TC 39 has a lot of power, right?

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:55.280
 In the sense that this influences browser road maps,

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.920
 I guess, like the teams on these browsers.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.560
 And here's like a, okay, we have an even worse situation.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.080
 We actually have a we have a committee

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.880
 sacked on top of a committee because there's also

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.680
 there's winter CG group, which is not.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.400
 So TC 39 is working on JavaScript.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.560
 And primarily they're concerned about the browser.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.360
 And winter CG is all the server run times

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.800
 that are banding together.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.680
 So Cloudflare workers, bun is on there.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.720
 I think Dino's on there.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.800
 There's a bunch of them being like,

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:29.840
 and their idea is we want to use web APIs for everything.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.960
 Even though we're on the server,

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.320
 we want to like take web APIs that TC 39 puts out

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.080
 and like make sure that they work on the server.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.600
 And we want to all be compatible with each other

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.280
 so that it's not confusing for.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.040
 You didn't say node, was that intentional?

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.800
 Is node part of winter CG?

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.360
 I don't know if node is part of winter CG.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.040
 They might be, I just don't know.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.480
 And what sucks about this is

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.480
 they've arbitrarily attached themselves

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.600
 to another committee.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.160
 TC 39 does not care about winter CG at all.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.320
 They don't care about JavaScript as a server.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.480
 So they come up with APIs that are just stupid.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.400
 Like all the crypto,

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.880
 all the new crypto APIs are async for some reason.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.200
 And that makes sense in the browser

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.480
 where like really everything is async

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.560
 because you want nothing to block the UI thread.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:12.880
 Yeah.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.840
 This causes so much stupid stuff on the back end,

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.440
 the fact that it's async.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.600
 Like everything from performance is just practical issues.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.920
 It like pollutes your whole code base

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.120
 where everything has to be async,

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.760
 even things that like crypto on the back end

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.960
 does not need to be async.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.080
 But winter CG is their guiding philosophy is

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.120
 web APIs everywhere.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.640
 So developers can just learn one thing

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.920
 and use it everywhere,

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.760
 which I get, but it's stupid.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.600
 It's just not going to work.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.800
 You're just not like practically

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.120
 you just build APIs that are good for browser

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.160
 and to the server.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:42.880
 And on top of that,

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.080
 TC 39 does not care about you.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.840
 They don't care about your needs at all.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.000
 So yeah, it's always committees.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.840
 It sucks.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.960
 And I guess somebody in chat called out Jared Sumner with Bun.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.560
 They've definitely been like some hope.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.080
 I mean, just like his approach is like

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.400
 f at all, like doing my own thing.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.160
 But I'm going to make it work everywhere.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.240
 He's got it's like the very free market approach.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.680
 I feel like Jared has taken.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.440
 It's like, I'm going to make something so good

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.040
 that it makes an impact.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.240
 Is that accurate?

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.120
 Did I sum that up?

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:11.440
 Yeah.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.280
 And he's part of TC 39.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.320
 And he's always like, yeah, I don't like we're part of it.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.400
 But like, you know, yeah.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.880
 The renegades are a bunch.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.280
 They're not really betting their future on that.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.000
 And they do like they like try crazy things.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 And sometimes some of those ideas are bad.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.640
 And maybe cause pain across the industry, but.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.720
 But it feels very anti bureaucratic.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.200
 He feels like the opposite of like bureaucracy.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:35.200
 Yeah.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:35.680
 Yeah.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.080
 He like just want his his thing is

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.080
 things should be simple.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.120
 Things should be easy.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:44.720
 Everything you can like rationalize your way out of that

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:48.160
 through all this like smart ways of thinking on paper.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:48.560
 Yeah.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.200
 But if it results of things being stupid for the end user,

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.800
 like it doesn't matter how smart it sounds.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.000
 Like it would just you did a bad job.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.480
 Yeah.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:54.480
 Yeah.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.040
 Yeah.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.440
 I think that a good guiding principle to have

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:02.560
 is you want your stuff not to surprise people.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.320
 Like you don't want any behavior that's surprising.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.560
 Like when someone tries to use something,

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.400
 it should behave in a certain way.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.520
 Even if their expectations are technically wrong,

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.760
 if the expectations are generally applied generally,

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.520
 a lot of people have the expectation.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.960
 You should just make it work.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.360
 It doesn't matter that their expectations are off.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.280
 And it's very hard as an engineer.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.080
 Like it's hard to find engineers that think that way,

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:27.120
 especially engineers working on like systems level stuff.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.080
 Like fun.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.560
 So I'm hopeful for that because they're at least shaking things up

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.720
 and they're like this counterforce.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.440
 Yeah.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.440
 Can we bring up the thing you've talked about doing for years?

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.480
 And I know you're not going to be,

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.640
 I'm not trying to put the pressure on you to be like the chosen one

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.400
 and be the BDFL JavaScript.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.760
 But you have talked about this idea of like stamping,

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.400
 like having a body that like stamps, not a body.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.040
 That sounds way too bureaucratic.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.440
 Just having like a company or an official stamp on packages

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.360
 that are good with a capital G and all the bad ones

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.800
 cannot have that stamp.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.200
 And it would just help the ecosystem say,

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.160
 oh, this package, I'm comparing two packages.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.280
 One of them has the stamp from smart people who looked at it

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.600
 and understand that it's packaged correctly.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.320
 It doesn't do stupid stuff like the AWS SDKs.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.400
 And like it's going to generally be a better choice

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.000
 than the non-stamped one.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.640
 Like the seal of approval, the DAX seal of approval

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.320
 for lack of a better word.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.520
 Do you still consider doing this?

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.560
 Because I would love it.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.840
 It sounds so nice.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.440
 I think this is something that I still want to do.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:35.200
 And what's funny about this is it'll upset people

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.920
 because someone is like claiming something.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.840
 And I'll get a bunch of technical

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.840
 probably arguments about these things.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.400
 But the fun part is it's not about technical details.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.600
 It's actually all about taste.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.320
 Yeah, it's taste.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.200
 You have good taste.

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:47.920
 That's all it is.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.120
 So I already do this.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.320
 I already come to you when it's like,

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.680
 I need a package for this.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.400
 What's the best?

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.280
 What's the right one?

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.080
 Sometimes I don't have to come to you.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:54.960
 I just look at your repos.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.880
 It's like, oh, he uses--

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.880
 what's the one for time that you use?

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.000
 Luxon.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.720
 Luxon.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.640
 So I just assume that's the best one.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.440
 If DAX uses it, it's probably the best one.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.280
 I already do that because I knew you have good taste.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.880
 You're good at figuring this stuff out.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.240
 You're a taste maker.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.520
 You saw Drizzle very early.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.000
 You know when something is like,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.200
 this team knows what they're doing.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.800
 And you can kind of look at a repo.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.640
 And I don't know what you're looking at.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.480
 But you can figure out really quick,

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.960
 looking at their package JSON and all the other stuff

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.120
 that they either get it or don't.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.000
 And that's good taste.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:26.800
 And that's such a good point.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.000
 So few people have good taste.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.800
 So we need someone, you, with good taste

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.040
 to do this thing for us as a community.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.720
 Yeah, I would definitely like to do that.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.800
 I think I see a pathway to start doing more of that stuff,

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.720
 especially with how the ecosystems evolve.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.880
 I think, yeah, it's funny because the taste thing is--

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.960
 it's interesting because it sticks out

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.200
 when we're on to another team that fits.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.600
 It's like the thing I was describing about the bun team,

00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:00.320
 they're so user focused and certain teams are that way.

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.920
 There's a lot of projects where when you start

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.440
 talking to the maintainers and you're like,

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.400
 hey, I ran to this issue, they start to give you--

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.280
 they start to talk about like some grand theory,

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.080
 like grand unified theory about why it is that way.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:12.640
 Yeah.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.600
 Versus being embarrassed.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.600
 Nice.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.400
 And there are certain teams that are just always embarrassed.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.480
 And they're like, we got to figure that out.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.280
 And that's like 90% of it.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.160
 The packages speak for themselves when they operate that way.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:26.640
 Yeah.

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.520
 OK.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.280
 Well, I'm going to keep checking them with you.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.000
 Maybe next year.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.640
 We'll just-- every year or so, we'll

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.200
 see how the DAX bandwidth is looking.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:35.600
 You know what?

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.400
 Another example of this is Rametta.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.280
 I don't know if you saw that one.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.240
 You said everywhere.

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.200
 I use it everywhere now, too, because I saw you use it everywhere.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.800
 It's like a low dash replacement, right?

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.360
 It only needs to exist because the stupid pipe operator

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.680
 that is not getting passed.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.680
 Is that TC39?

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:55.680
 Is that-- where does that fit into the bureaucracy picture?

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:59.280
 It's been slowly, slowly, slowly,

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.120
 inching forward in TC39.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.600
 And yeah, there's just been years of pain

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.200
 because we don't have that.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.600
 And it leads to so many cascading issues.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.480
 I talked about this the other day where in JavaScript,

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.640
 we just keep attaching methods to prototypes.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:15.600
 We're like, oh, let's add like a group by to array.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.840
 Oh, let's add like a sort by to array.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.760
 Let's add a min. Let's add a max.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.320
 And then it's all of a sudden we're like, oh, shit.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.040
 We forgot to add it to iterators.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.240
 OK, we need a new proposal.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.680
 Let's add group by iterators.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.640
 Let's sort by.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.480
 Oh, no, objects are iteratable, too.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.000
 How do we-- it's just like we're like slowly just adding more and more.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.600
 It's like-- it's like n things, right?

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.440
 Like you add one thing if the add n places.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.960
 And it's just like this infinite slog.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.040
 And each time you go to the whole bureaucratic loop,

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:47.520
 elixir works completely differently in this specific zone

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.160
 because if a pipe operator, your functions

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.000
 are independent of the thing that they operate on.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.240
 So if you implement a sort function, that's standalone.

00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.440
 You can pipe an object into it.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.400
 You can pipe an array into it.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.600
 You can pipe an iterator into it.

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.240
 Anything that's iteratable, this sort function can do.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.080
 So you just have this nice standalone collection

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.480
 of functions that can operate on these things.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.520
 And it works for everything.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.360
 It's because of the pipe operator.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.880
 It's a lot more natural to do it there.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.080
 So sort of that, I use remetta.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.120
 Everyone else is low dash, like low dash, low dash, low dash,

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:19.680
 blah, blah, blah.

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.840
 Why do I use remetta?

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.320
 Why do you--

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.440
 But two reasons.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.960
 First, low dash's ESM story was a mess for a very long time.

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.240
 It did not tree shake properly.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:31.600
 They have a separate low dash dash ESM package now.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:35.280
 But like they're again straddling that weird,

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.400
 we're trying to do both things.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.800
 Second, remetta is lazy for all operations.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.280
 But if you have like a chain of things where it's like,

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.320
 I have an array, filter map take three.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.440
 If you do that, do that stuff with things.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:53.440
 Just iterate one by one until it meets your final condition.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.760
 It won't go through the whole array multiple times.

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.240
 It's just little details like that.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.080
 I don't think you spend a lot of time being like,

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:04.160
 I'm going to spend a week looking for a good utility library like this.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.640
 You're just not going to arrive at that level of decision.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.240
 So most people just don't have the time to do that,

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.880
 which is why this kind of stamp of approval thing can help.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.080
 Yeah, it would be great.

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.760
 I'm just picturing a little badge on the repo where it's like,

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:19.040
 it got a little seal and you just know it's a good option.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.360
 It would help me save me a ton of time.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.040
 I mean, I can already just look at your repos.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.480
 I should at least maintain a list of good packages.

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.640
 Just just have a page, just literally a web,

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.760
 like a page on your website.

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.440
 That's like, here's a list of good packages.

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.640
 Yes, just do that.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.120
 And then I can just go to that page every time if you keep it up to date.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.520
 We could even put, we could push pull requests to it as a community.

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.120
 People could be like, look, backscapes using this.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:39.840
 Yeah, I can reject them.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.800
 Yeah, and you could reject them.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.920
 That's funny.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.760
 Did you see the state of JavaScript stuff?

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.240
 A little.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.120
 I don't keep up to it enough.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.480
 Like every year it kind of comes ago.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.000
 It's like advent of code.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.920
 I always think like I'm going to get into it this year

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.240
 and I'm going to really read it and do the survey or whatever,

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.800
 but it's just never a priority at the moment.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:01.440
 I don't know.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.040
 Tell me what came out of it.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.320
 What were the big takeaways?

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.160
 I have a little quote in there actually.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:06.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:07.600
 It's meant to submit.

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:11.120
 I just plug Replicash as if I don't do that enough.

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.000
 You famous.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.400
 Oh, did you also plug Linear or just Replicash?

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.080
 No, just Replicash.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.920
 Because it helps you build things like Linear.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.880
 Oh, yeah, right.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:26.400
 Who did the state of JS Chancellor reach out to you?

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.680
 Like, how did you get a quote in there?

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:29.920
 They're just like, hey, DAX.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.200
 There's like several quotes on every page

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.560
 just asking people like, what's your favorite package this year or something?

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.240
 I have some interesting things.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.200
 Can you DM me this?

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.920
 I want to see it or I can just go looking forward, I guess, but.

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.720
 Native JS.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.280
 I think the main.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.240
 It's fine.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:46.560
 Every time.

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.680
 So when this happens, like all the framework authors post,

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.840
 like a little snippet being like, we're doing so great.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.720
 Because they find like, there's always something in there that is good.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:55.920
 There's some positive angle.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:56.240
 Yeah.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.320
 Yeah, but overall to me.

00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.280
 Unless you're Gatsby.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:48:59.600
 Sorry.

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.320
 There's no positive.

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.080
 Overall, it felt very negative.

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.480
 Like zoomed in like there were certain things.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:11.840
 Like I think Ashrow had some pretty positive results, but not like crazy positive, right?

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.760
 And solid like pretty much stayed where it was.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.720
 Overall, it seems pretty negative.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.640
 Like everyone seems like really down on the ecosystem.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.840
 A lot of things people are interested in before and are longer interested in.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:24.320
 Really?

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.920
 Potentions not looking good.

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.720
 Like when frameworks are young, they just tend to do well every year.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.400
 Just because they're like growing.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.160
 Some of them already seem like they're past that just within one or two years.

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.000
 React, like the interest in React is so far down.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.240
 There's definitely a moment that started a couple of years ago,

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.600
 where we're like, okay, a bunch of disruption and innovation is going to happen.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.440
 Obviously those are chaotic periods.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.000
 Yeah.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.600
 The sentiment I get is everyone's sick of how long it's taking.

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:58.320
 And they just want to like go back to like getting stuff done with something stable and stuff.

00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.040
 Not just.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:04.480
 Does the state of JS kind of reflect just like more react, sticking with react

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.240
 Homerism or something or no?

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.280
 Not exactly because React is also part of all this change, right?

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.760
 Like with how much next is change and how.

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.440
 The new React stuff.

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:14.400
 Yeah, sure.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.400
 Everything is just in this like half state.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:20.960
 Like app router is still like so broken and so many things don't work.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.120
 And then people are like now even questioning like, is this all worth it?

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.600
 You know, like we're promises will be worth it.

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.920
 You only have a certain amount of time to deliver on that promise, right?

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.680
 Like people can only stay in limbo for so long.

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.560
 So that's the feeling I've gotten and other frameworks, like.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.080
 So I'll start has taken a very long time and it's like just.

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.520
 Just finally released and it's still very early.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.240
 So yeah.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.680
 Yeah, I think everyone's taking everything away long and expected.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.120
 Well, now I actually want to read the report.

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.440
 I want to see, I want to see if this is like a jaded DAX point of view.

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.120
 And like you're just seeing everything a certain way.

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.920
 Or if if I see the same thing, if it feels that way reading it.

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.120
 It wasn't just in the report.

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:00.000
 So I kind of felt that way from the report and I talked to Fred

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.320
 and Ryan Carnaudio about it.

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:06.000
 And everyone just feels like these aren't like good numbers.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.440
 Yeah, people aren't like super enthused this year.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.880
 Like they were in years past.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:11.280
 Yeah.

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.240
 There's some hope dwindling and optimism fading.

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.360
 Yeah, interesting.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:20.000
 And it's funny because there are it's almost like there's a industry wide mood.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.720
 And yeah, there's moods where people are open to certain things.

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.200
 There's moods where people are like more closed off.

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:31.600
 And you have to like deliver your thing to line up with that.

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.960
 And sometimes you just get unlucky.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:33.760
 It's interesting.

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.760
 Like when you say all this, and it makes you think of some of the Twitter sentiment

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.840
 shifting towards the DHH and rails kind of like rails is back.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.040
 Rails was never gone.

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.040
 Why'd you all get so complicated?

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.400
 That's kind of been the mood on Twitter, which I just largely ignore as like,

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.480
 it comes and goes, the mood does.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.880
 But if it's something like this, if it's showing up in the state of JS,

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.960
 I feel like that's a little more significant.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:52:01.040
 If like somehow this like we're tired of all the quote unquote innovation and complexity,

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:05.520
 if that's kind of like seeping into this broader, I would assume this survey kind of

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.160
 hits a larger swath than just the Twitter crowd, right?

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.760
 Or is it largely still?

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.680
 Yeah, no, I'm sure it hits a large.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:15.600
 I mean, I think there was maybe one question there that was like,

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.960
 how did you end up on the survey?

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:17.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.920
 And a large percentage of like the it was like number two or something.

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.320
 Oh, just.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.560
 It might still be biased, just like in the small bubble.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.000
 But yeah, I mean, if you just assume that it's a larger swath,

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.280
 I do think it is a.

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.640
 Yeah, do you feel like that's kind of lines up with the Twitter sentiment

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.480
 of like a shift toward going back to old times and simpler times?

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.160
 And that all sounds familiar.

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:38.320
 Yeah.

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:42.240
 And like I think rotating back to Rails is like a little bit extreme,

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.720
 but just take like your own experience.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.440
 Remember pages?

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:45.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:46.560
 Router.

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:47.120
 The pages.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:47.760
 Yeah, sure.

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:47.760
 Sure.

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.080
 Like you built a lot of stuff on there.

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.000
 I don't think you ever really had a bad time.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.440
 No, yeah.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.800
 Even today, you can still use it.

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.000
 And it's probably one of the better ways to build something like that.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:58.560
 Yeah.

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.160
 In JavaScript.

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:00.640
 Yeah.

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.600
 I've actually had real experiences with the app router now that I can speak

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.840
 intelligibly about like the pains.

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:06.320
 Yeah.

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.280
 And like the promise, I mean, I see the pitch.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:14.080
 Like I see like it'd be nice if, but there's just implementation of it.

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.320
 And the reality of it today is pretty painful,

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.480
 which I don't want to go into all of it right now.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:23.120
 Do you see Web Dev Cody's tweet about the composition tweet?

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.160
 No.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.640
 You know how like RSCs are all about composition and reacts?

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.080
 Like we're always about composition.

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.720
 So he tweeted like, you don't understand next and react.

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.080
 They're all about composition.

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.760
 Oh, wait, you can't enforce a reaction.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.040
 Oh, wait, you can't explain anything.

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:35.440
 Oh, wait.

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.720
 So he's got like all of these just things where like it's.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.040
 Yeah.

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:42.400
 If you look at the one narrow lens, it looks composable, but in practice,

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.240
 it like is the opposite in a lot of ways.

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:44.800
 Yeah.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.920
 So I think this is reflective of the sentiment.

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.400
 I think the next show has pages.

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.600
 They got to a pretty good place earlier than everyone else.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.720
 And that kind of remix came to that set up later.

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.280
 Yeah.

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.040
 And I think that was like peak.

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.880
 That was like the peak of something.

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.320
 And ever since then, it's just been downhill.

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:05.280
 It's been two years of, there's a weird, weird zone.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.880
 And yeah, I think people are tired of it.

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.160
 Yeah, interesting.

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.360
 I'm definitely tired of something.

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:13.440
 I'm tired of something.

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.560
 It's like a, I think the, like the local first stuff,

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.120
 super interesting, the way you build like productivity apps.

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:24.400
 I'm finding myself like wanting to build something that would use that paradigm,

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.680
 but I just end up building all these things where it doesn't make sense.

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.760
 Like stat news, it doesn't make sense for us.

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:33.280
 And I just wish there was such a clear picture.

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.680
 I feel like it's such a clear picture in 2024.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.520
 How to build an app like that way?

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:37.840
 Yeah.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.120
 With replicas or something else.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.320
 It just feels so like, well, like defined.

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:44.000
 You don't have a million options.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.360
 It's like, there's a way to do it.

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.080
 Do it.

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:52.560
 And I feel like on the other side with sites or more like page driven apps or websites,

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:56.000
 whatever, like the other side like stat news where it's like Wikipedia.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.360
 It feels so up in the air.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.120
 Like you should be server generating this part.

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:01.200
 You should be not server generating this part.

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:01.840
 Just, I don't know.

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:02.880
 It's just, it's a lot.

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:03.280
 It's funny.

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.400
 Someone in the chat was like, I'm surprised that I didn't mention zero.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.840
 I was just about to mention zero.

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.440
 Oh yeah, replicas zero.

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:09.760
 Yeah.

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.520
 Man, I am so excited for this.

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:15.280
 It's going to like, this stack that we're going to put together with zero

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:21.760
 is going to look so simple and easy compared to whatever the hell is going on in the other side

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:22.560
 of the world.

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:22.880
 Yeah.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.680
 And it's going to be able to do almost all the same things.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.880
 Things are going to be server rendered.

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:30.160
 And then once they're on the client, everything's going to take over.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.720
 Is this the, is there a world where that's just for everything?

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.080
 Where we don't have to make a decision?

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.520
 And it's like, that works for everything.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:35.840
 Yeah.

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:36.320
 Okay.

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.280
 That's my goal.

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.880
 It's, it's so crazy.

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:43.840
 Like you can basically the idea with zero, like specifically with React is,

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:50.400
 you stop passing stuff around in props, like every, um, component just writes a query that it needs.

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:53.680
 So if you have like, like a component that renders a user,

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.920
 you don't like passing the whole user object as a prop.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:00.480
 You just write like a query, like you pass in the ID and you just write a level zero query.

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:00.640
 Yeah.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.360
 And it doesn't matter because it's all local.

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.400
 So it's just going to fetch it.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:08.320
 Yeah, we instantly and every component is super self contained.

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.880
 This was the promise of the RSC stuff, right?

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.120
 Right.

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:15.360
 Exactly. But you need a really good data layer to actually deliver on a promise of RSCs

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.160
 because your data layer probably can't handle like these granular queries.

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:18.480
 Yeah.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.520
 Replication can.

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:19.840
 Yep.

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.960
 When it's being rendered on a server, those queries just hit your database,

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.080
 but they get rolled up.

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:27.840
 They get hoisted properly into like a, into like a batch efficient.

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.480
 So everything gets server rendered.

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.200
 You just define your data right next to where you use it.

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.400
 And then it's all local first after like that's, that's freaking crazy.

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.240
 Like it's going to be, it's going to be so good.

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:41.760
 That's the dream. When, when is this available? Is it available now?

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.880
 Can we start using it?

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.120
 When is the DAX repo example going to be out there?

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:47.360
 Probably in the fall.

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.160
 Okay.

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.840
 So you'll have something out there that, what are you going to, are you going to do it with

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:52.880
 radiant or what are you going to do?

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:53.440
 Yeah.

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:53.600
 Okay.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:53.600
 Yeah.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.400
 Cool.

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:54.880
 Yeah.

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.000
 So, so we're working on radiant in a way where we're assuming zero.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.840
 We'll be ready.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:56:59.840
 Yeah.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:00.080
 Yeah.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:04.560
 But there's some little trade-offs with it that I didn't like making,

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.480
 but whatever, it's worth it for this bigger thing.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.600
 But yeah, like I'm really excited about that.

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.440
 So the guy that makes a Tamagui, I don't know if you've seen that library.

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:19.440
 But he's working on like a meta framework, basically with zero at the core of it.

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.560
 And it's not only going to be for web.

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:25.280
 It's going to work across web, react native and everything.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:30.640
 So you're going to get like server rendered local first web app.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.280
 Also, all that stuff will work in react native.

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.760
 Like it's like the ultimate thing to do everything.

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.080
 It sounds amazing and ambitious.

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:38.400
 Yeah.

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.240
 That sounds big, but awesome.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.200
 I mean, I'm very excited.

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.320
 Tamagui was successful.

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.680
 I mean, like, that was a big project.

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:44.000
 Yeah.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.600
 It's clearly this guy knows how to ship stuff.

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:46.960
 And he worked that versatile.

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:51.520
 And he's like, been very, he like left in a pretty salty way.

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.600
 But he's been like, not into everything he's been doing.

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:53.920
 Oh, really?

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:54.080
 Interesting.

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.280
 So that makes you like him a lot.

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:55.440
 Of course.

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:55.760
 Because he--

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.920
 I have to pee really bad.

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.200
 So this is going to be a super abrupt ending.

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.200
 There's no way to like, trail this off.

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:04.240
 I just have to pee.

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.680
 And it's been an hour.

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.120
 So I feel like we should end the podcast.

00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:08.320
 Is that too abrupt for you, Dax?

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.680
 Are you OK with this arrangement?

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.120
 No, I want you to pee your bands.

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:11.600
 OK, yeah.

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.640
 That sounds great.

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:13.600
 It's been-- it's been good.

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.200
 [LAUGHTER]
