WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
 If I'm being honest, it feels like I'm phoning it in

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.600
 a little bit, 1,200.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.200
 It's kind of like, we're just gonna get through these

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.480
 next 40 episodes.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.060
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.920
 - I slept 12 hours last night.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.000
 I have a cold and it sucks, so bad.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.160
 I haven't been sick in like,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.560
 I mean, aside from going to the ER,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.480
 I haven't been sick in like months.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.120
 I don't even realize the time I was like,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.960
 had a cold.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.800
 - Well, it's the fall.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 - And I know, I know how I got it.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.640
 - Oh, how'd you get it?

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.320
 - Yeah, it's the fall.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.400
 I got it because after competing in Kansas City,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.120
 there was sort of like, I've been pushing really hard.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.960
 I was like, at one point, I was really cutting weight

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.360
 to be in a different division

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.600
 than I ended up being in a different division.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.280
 Anyway, I've been like, really pushing hard

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.120
 in terms of fitness, in terms of nutrition and all that.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.680
 And we were in Kansas City, the tournament's over.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.800
 Just kind of celebrated, you know,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.640
 had a weekend where I was eating all kinds of sugar and junk.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.720
 We got a whole food, I was getting baked goods.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.400
 I mean, I was just like eating garbage.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.400
 And I haven't eaten sugar or oil in, I don't know, months.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.120
 It was a celebration and it resulted in being sick.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.960
 So I think it's like the first time my immune system

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.880
 has been degraded from food.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.080
 - That's crazy how just a change in diet

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.000
 can give you a cold.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.120
 - Yeah, I think I had a pretty good immune system going.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.720
 And then not so much.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.920
 And with kids, I feel like we used to get sick a lot.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.400
 Just kids kind of like spread stuff right.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.800
 They get sick from other kids in the neighborhood

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.760
 and then they just spread stuff throughout the house.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.180
 But I feel like it's been a long time

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.680
 to stuff at a cold.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.360
 I got in bed at like 6 p.m. last night.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.680
 I woke up at 6 a.m.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.160
 - Wow, that sounds really nice, to be honest.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.000
 - You know, you would think,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.880
 but you kind of just feel like more dead

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.920
 than you did the night before.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.880
 Like you get out of bed, everything hurts

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.760
 just from like being in bed that long.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.440
 I don't know if you've ever experienced that.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.320
 Just like aches, I don't know.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.360
 It's just not a position that I'm good with for 12 hours,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.440
 I guess.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.840
 - I can, my natural state, like if there was just nothing

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.000
 that I had to get up for,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.480
 I can easily sleep for like 18 hours, I think.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.320
 - Of what?

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.480
 - I could just sleep forever.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.560
 Like I'm like, I can like hibernate basically.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.680
 - Oh my word.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.880
 - I have no issue being in bed for a long time.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.280
 I don't really do that ever, but I could.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.560
 - It's really hard for me to stay in bed after like seven hours.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.160
 And Casey, I think Casey's like, she could sleep indefinitely.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.680
 And once we had kids, that all ended.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.080
 - I had the opposite experience yesterday.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.480
 I only slept like four or five hours.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.720
 Liz flew out to DC to just visiting a friend.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.840
 So she woke up super early.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.960
 And that would have been completely fine

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.480
 'cause like I would just in bed kind of half asleep.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.800
 And then she said, "Bye to me, I was in bed."

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.080
 But she couldn't find her keys that I had to get up

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.440
 and locked up the door for her.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.320
 So the act of getting up just woke me up

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.960
 and I just couldn't sleep at all.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.200
 And now I just feel kind of off.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.280
 So I just messed up my schedule.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.520
 - That's not enough hours.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.520
 - My door on my office, the hinge is a little loose.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.280
 And it isn't closed properly.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.480
 So I was like, lifted every time I close it.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.080
 It's crazy 'cause my previous apartment

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.000
 was not brand new, but it was pretty renovated

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.960
 and everything just worked and everything was really comfortable.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.120
 And this is the first time I'm living

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.120
 in a charming house where everything is just a little bit off

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.480
 and stuff doesn't exactly align

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.600
 and it's not super comfortable.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.680
 And it's nice and there's a lot of upside to it.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.980
 We do have a very unique house and it looks really nice.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.720
 But we were watching something the other day

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.020
 and it was like a very generic, like suburban

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.120
 big mansion type of house.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.800
 And Liz was looking at it and she was like,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.560
 what is happening to me that I'm like fantasizing about.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.640
 I'm fantasizing about like just everything working

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.280
 and being really comfortable and having like a ton of space

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.440
 and like, there's like no charm to it at all,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.800
 but it's just like, exactly.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.440
 It's like the height of comfort.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.160
 - Yeah, we lived in our, we built the house.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.080
 It's been like 10 years ago and lived in it

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.520
 for four or five years and moved from that house,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.040
 which was just exactly what we wanted.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.860
 I mean, when you build a house,

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.400
 you do like everything you want.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.400
 And it was super comfortable.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.520
 We had our theater, we had our, just our life was pretty cushy.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.960
 And then we moved to Florida to live in Naples.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.880
 And it was like, I don't know, a 30 year old home

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.920
 there in Naples and it just, it was like, it was nice.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.640
 It was just like, it wasn't our home.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.880
 And it wasn't like things were a little grimy and things.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.280
 Yeah, there were things that broke down

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.880
 and just you'd have to get stuff fixed.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.720
 That was just a new experience for us.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.040
 We even, after we, we had lived in the house

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.800
 for just like six months, we flew to Maui

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.440
 for to do as before we had kids, just for vacation.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.840
 And we couldn't hardly enjoy Maui

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.640
 because we just like missed our brand new home

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.160
 we had just built and like, we didn't have air conditioning

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.000
 in Maui at this like guest house we were living in.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.680
 We were staying in and yeah, we came home early actually.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.680
 We had a two week vacation booked and came home after a week

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.000
 just because we missed our new house.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.320
 So this suburban thing, it's nice.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.880
 I mean, comfort is nice.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.200
 Yeah, like when I go to my parents house,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.280
 I'm just like, wow, there's just, everything is just

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.280
 exactly aligned and like, there's no friction

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.560
 in doing every little thing.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.160
 My house is almost a hundred years old.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.360
 It's pretty insane.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.800
 Whoa.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.000
 But I will stay old.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.040
 Maybe a hundred exaggerations, I would say like 80,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.320
 but it's like, it's getting up there.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.440
 That's still. Yeah.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.280
 I know houses were still standing at that.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.440
 Well, that's what's crazy because I live in a place

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.280
 that gets a lot of hurricanes.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.120
 Oh yeah.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.720
 So it's not, it's like impressive how it just stood

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.400
 the test of time, like it's been fine.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.520
 And it is an old house and as much as I'm saying,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.320
 like it's not like there's, there's like, it's just not perfect.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.240
 Yeah, for houses old is actually pretty nice.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.880
 Like my biggest complaints are just like, you know,

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.760
 the doors don't align properly and like the,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.560
 just like the wall, like when you like nail things

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.240
 into the wall, it's like really like hard to get stuff in there.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.360
 Besides that, like it's really impressive.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.360
 And I asked a bunch of people because Hurricane Andrew

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.640
 here in 1992, so much destruction.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.040
 Like so much got destroyed.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.320
 And I was like, how is this like little house

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.280
 is completely fine in an area with like a ton of trees

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.520
 and everything.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.440
 And they were just like, yeah, the way they used to build

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.480
 these houses, they're just built extremely well.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.440
 Even though they look like little basic houses,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.280
 like they can just stand up.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.040
 And it's not like now when you see a new construction

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.440
 that's like hurricane proof, it looks like a fortress.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.800
 So you kind of think that's what you need to do to make it.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.440
 Like ICF, like concrete forms and all that stuff.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.280
 Yeah, exactly.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.740
 And those crazy like bulletproof looking

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.480
 and stuff, but apparently like, I mean, yes,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.280
 that's like, that does, is very effective.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.480
 But like these houses, however they used to build them

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.160
 before, yeah, they work and still standing.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.560
 And who knows how long it will stand for?

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.560
 You might have like another 100 years in it.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.000
 That's insane.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Are there a lot of older houses in your neighborhood

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 like that have also remained unscathed?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.480
 Yeah, like every house is pretty unique.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.200
 Like every house looks very different.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.600
 They're all kind of quirky and interesting.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.560
 It's why really like this neighborhood.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.200
 The thing though is as this area

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.800
 becomes a lot more attractive,

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.200
 like a lot of developers are coming in

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.000
 and kind of like destroying the old homes

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.400
 and putting them new ones.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.240
 I'm not like universally opposed to that.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.920
 Like, yes, like stuff just can't stay around forever.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.000
 Like you do need to evolve it.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.720
 But the things are putting up, man, it is like,

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.000
 so it is like the worst stuff.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.080
 And I've turned into one of those like nimby people,

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.400
 like not in my backyard people.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.040
 And I'm like, the charm of the neighborhood is going away.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.600
 Like it just happened.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.120
 I don't know what to say, it just happened.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.920
 But they put up these like quote unquote modern houses,

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.600
 but they're just these big white cubes.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.040
 They're all identical.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.800
 And they're these like awkward like cube modern,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.440
 technically looking houses.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.160
 And I like modern houses when they're well done.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.480
 Like I think they can be well done.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.560
 But these are like, you can tell that the developer

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.640
 just realized is cheap to build a square.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.840
 And as long as they like do certain things to it,

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.280
 you can sell it as modern.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.640
 I don't like fault the developers that much

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.920
 'cause they're like, they're just reacting

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.040
 to the fact that people will buy them.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.720
 Like all these people spending,

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.720
 these houses are not cheap.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.000
 They're probably like, you know, upwards of $1.5 million.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.840
 - Geez.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.000
 - You're gonna spend that much on it.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.960
 Like, can you just demand like a little bit more?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.400
 Like why is it acceptable to you when it's just like

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.280
 in this crazy quirky neighborhood full of like all these

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.840
 like unique trees and all those overgrowth,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.040
 you're gonna plop down like a generic cube

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.640
 and your neighbor has the identical house.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.600
 Like, how is that okay?

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.440
 - That sucks.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.360
 Yeah.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.040
 Just to be close to the water.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.160
 Just is it just the area is just Miami?

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.640
 Like the market's really higher.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.120
 - Well, it's Miami in general,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.200
 but this neighborhood is like the only walkable neighborhood

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.040
 in Miami.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.000
 Like I can walk 10 minutes to like 20 plus restaurants.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.280
 There's only the best restaurants in Miami.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.120
 - Yeah.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.160
 - There's a really nice neighborhood.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
 Not a lot of people here care about walkability,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.120
 which I'm thankful for.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.480
 Otherwise, this area would be impossible.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.600
 But there are people that do and they're recognizing it.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.280
 So there is more growth here.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.920
 But I hope it retains its trauma.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.240
 Like our goal is to buy this house and land.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.280
 And we might have to like knock it down.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.960
 Like realistically, like I said,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.920
 stuff just doesn't, can't last forever.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.760
 - Yeah.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.520
 - But we want to put up something that like reflects

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.160
 that like kind of maintains the same aesthetic.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.520
 - Yeah.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.600
 - Maybe like a little bit bigger,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.280
 kind of whatever else we need.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.000
 But yeah, that's, that would be ideal.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.960
 Like we're going to do that.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.880
 We're going to try to like do it really well.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.160
 - Sorry.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.000
 - Sorry.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.880
 - Okay, you're sick.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.400
 - I know, but I feel bad.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.920
 I keep telling Casey, sorry.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.320
 Like, sorry, I'm sick.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.760
 I'm just not a good patient.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.880
 And I'm not helpful at all.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.440
 Like I'm in bed all the time.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.800
 So she's got the boys by herself.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.400
 And I know it's not my fault for being sick,

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.440
 but kind of is like, I didn't,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.680
 I didn't need to have that brownie in Kansas City.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.040
 Like you didn't need to do Jiu-Jitsu.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.440
 - I didn't need, I haven't trained Jiu-Jitsu in over a week.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.400
 Cause I had my tournament last weekend.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.480
 I didn't train for a couple days before that.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.600
 Just to like give myself rest before the tournament.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.120
 And then I've been sick.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.960
 I got back.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.120
 I haven't been able to train.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:17.960
 It sucks.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.080
 It's been over a week.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.080
 I'm obsessed and I want to get back to it.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.960
 - Have you, do you think you have degraded?

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.960
 Cause you haven't went for a week?

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.120
 - I mean, I don't know.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.960
 Probably not.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.600
 I'm not too worried about it.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.640
 I mean, like long term, I'm not too worried about it.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.120
 It does, it's hard not to think about like

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.160
 all the different workouts I've been doing

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.120
 and like the progression of them.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.520
 And then to take a week off, it's like,

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.760
 things aren't the same.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.760
 If you ever experienced that, like,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.600
 you've been seeing like steady growth in a certain area,

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.720
 some stupid thing you're doing, some specific workout.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.240
 And then you take a week off and it's like,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.080
 it's kind of hard to do the one you did last time

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.600
 and you're not even pushing forward.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.080
 I just hate that stuff.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.080
 I hate getting sick.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.920
 - Yeah.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.760
 I hate that too.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.920
 That's why I ask because I think the thing that keeps me,

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.840
 like the longer you consistently do something,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.360
 it like makes it so you'll keep doing it even longer.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.600
 Cause you feel really bad to lose.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.360
 Like, oh man, I'd go this months of progress.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.680
 If I stop for a month, I basically lose a large percent of it.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.920
 I think a week is okay.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.480
 I think sometimes a week, I'll like go back

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.240
 and I'll like do better because like I gave myself

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.160
 a amount of recovery.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.840
 - Yeah, like your body rested.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.480
 - Yeah, but after like two weeks,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.200
 I know I'm like, I'm losing the work I put in.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.880
 - Yeah, my problem is what you're talking about,

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.520
 the habits, like I've lost so many good habits

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.120
 from just getting sick for a week.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.280
 And not even just like fitness related,

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.800
 but like it just shows you how your normal routines

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.880
 and you just realize you come out of it

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.640
 and you're like, oh, I used to do this every day.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.800
 And I don't anymore.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.640
 That sucks.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.560
 - Yeah, this is gonna be gone till Monday.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.760
 So I know that's gonna be like crazy disruptive.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.080
 - Wow, you and Zuko, just boys.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:54.920
 - Bachelorette.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.080
 - Me and Zuko and the two cats are a lot more.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.440
 - I was really have cats.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.120
 Why do you have cats?

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.160
 - I have a cough now too.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.320
 Did you get me sick?

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.680
 - Through the mic.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.520
 - Why do you have cats, by the way?

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.360
 Is that a list thing?

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.480
 Let's just say that's a list thing.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.320
 - No, it's not.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.480
 - You like cats?

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.400
 - It's explicitly not a list thing.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.880
 These are two cats I had with my previous girlfriend

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.000
 that I retained.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.880
 - Well, now you definitely need to get rid of them.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.480
 (laughing)

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.760
 No good reason to have cats,

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.480
 especially now they're tied to a previous relationship.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.080
 - Well, what am I gonna do?

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.160
 I kill them?

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.560
 - Oh, no, but like cats just like they wander around

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.880
 just like don't let them back in the house.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.720
 - They're not, they've never been outdoors really.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.040
 They're indoor cats, you know, they're from New York.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.040
 So they were in apartment for years.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.160
 So I mean, I'd love for them to be outdoor cats.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.720
 I feel like it's a better life,

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.600
 but they can't really make that switch once they've been indoor.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.600
 - Do you like them?

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.040
 Do you like these cats?

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.280
 - Yeah, they're really nice, actually.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.920
 - I guess you've grown accustomed to them.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.760
 - Yeah, for sure.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.440
 - Well, for cats, they are not mean at all.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.560
 Like they're never mean and they're like really,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.400
 really friendly.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.400
 One of them is nervous and she doesn't

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.680
 with new people, she just hides.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.800
 The other one is super friendly.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.960
 I think the other one could be famous.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.240
 Like he's like really funny and quirky and weird.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.680
 Like he could be like a, like a YouTube cat.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.680
 - Yeah, I feel like if I took her to like Japan or something,

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.400
 she would just become famous.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.240
 I don't know.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.080
 That was like me.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.200
 - What, Japan?

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.160
 I'm so confused.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.000
 - I don't know.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.600
 She just has this like Japanese like anime quirky vibe to her.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.400
 She's like making all these weird noises.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.400
 And like, it's like if you drew like a,

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.080
 if you'd had like an anime cartoon of a cat doing funny things,

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.440
 like this is that one.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.280
 - Okay.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.120
 - Okay, I'm almost here.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.560
 - You're painting quite a picture.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.400
 - Yeah.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.840
 - Okay, so here's my thing with cats.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.920
 And I think I might honestly always have cats

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.480
 if I really think about it.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.320
 Like probably out there are ones now that I live somewhere

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.920
 that I can have an outdoor cat, indoor outdoor cat,

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.360
 but here's what's great about them.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.920
 They're just furniture.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.760
 Right?

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.680
 You'll decorate your house.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.280
 Like to have like interesting things in your house

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.320
 to look at, to give it a nice ambiance.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.960
 Cats are very low work.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.800
 - Yeah.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.640
 - Like there's how much you need to do.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.480
 - They do just kind of take care of themselves.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.080
 - And they're, they just like positioned themselves

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.640
 as furniture in random parts of your house

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.560
 to do like occasionally cute things or funny things

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.560
 are super interesting.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.880
 Like they're crazy curious and like,

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.200
 well like investigate anything new.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.240
 So they're just nice to have around in the background.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.000
 It's like having birds in your backyard.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.800
 Like that type of thing.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.400
 - I don't know why I don't like cats.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.000
 I'm realizing like, I think I just have some like idea

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.760
 in my head that I don't like cats, but it's stupid

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.960
 'cause I don't think I actually dislike them.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.040
 I don't have a reason to.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.320
 I mean, I kind of felt that way too before I got them.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.340
 And I was like, okay, I see, I see the appeal.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.440
 I'm still mostly a dog person, but I get it.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.960
 - There's not a lot of people that are both.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.360
 I feel like maybe that's what it is.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.600
 I like dogs, I just assume I don't like cats,

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.720
 but I have no reason not to like cats.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.600
 We had cats growing up.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.440
 A lot of them.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.280
 - This is a great lesson.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.160
 There's a great lesson in here somewhere.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.000
 You know, just look good.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.120
 Just 'cause you like one thing,

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.280
 doesn't mean you gotta hate the other thing.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.600
 All you people want to text Twitter.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.480
 - Yeah, there you go.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.720
 Just 'cause you like SSC doesn't mean you have to hate

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.560
 the CDK.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.400
 I was like.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:16.360
 - There you go, lesson for all of you listening.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.440
 - I feel like we talked so much tech

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.880
 on that episode that we'll never air

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.920
 because my audio was screwed up.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.120
 We talked about spelt kit.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.580
 They're all a spelt 5 or 6.0, whatever it is.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.560
 This episode, no tech, sorry.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.000
 We got it all out of our system.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.480
 It's, you're never gonna hear it.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.480
 - There was something that I wanted to talk about,

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.800
 but I can't remember now.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.000
 - Oh, Cloudflare stuff.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.480
 Did you see all that stuff yesterday?

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.960
 - No, please tell me.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.640
 - Oh man, I feel like nobody, I feel like nobody's,

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.000
 I mean, I did see it in a bunch of places,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.120
 but I feel like it's a huge deal

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.960
 and I thought it would be like people be more excited.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.080
 - I'm pretty unplugged.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.000
 Don't take my unawares as any signal.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.120
 - Yeah, so they launched their AI stuff

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.240
 and it is very, very compelling.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.360
 So they basically now have an API

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.920
 where you can run a variety of models

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.800
 in a completely serverless way.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.440
 So, I mean, that's, I guess that's maybe too much buzzwords

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.280
 'cause technically you can just try to open an AI

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.760
 in the same way, but it's just an API, right?

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.960
 But the point is they're loading,

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.400
 they've preloaded a bunch of open source models in there.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.160
 They're gonna continue to add more.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.680
 They're gonna be able to bring your own models.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.360
 And it's obviously because Cloudflare is all global,

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.440
 we can just connect to whatever the local region is.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.040
 They're like rolling out more coverage over time.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.800
 It is insanely cheap.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.520
 It is like very, very cheap.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.120
 I think it is by far the cheapest way

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.440
 to do all kinds of interesting things.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.600
 And they've launched a vector database alongside with it.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.720
 Are you familiar with how that stuff works together?

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.160
 - I'm sort of familiar.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.240
 I know like the type of information

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.400
 that these models want to store

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.120
 is suited to vector database.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.640
 Open AI was gonna have some kind of storage,

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.800
 like all your personal information

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.400
 could be stored in a vector database.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.240
 - Yeah.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.160
 - I don't remember which one it was, but.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.240
 - Yeah, also, I don't know.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.480
 Oh, it makes sense for open AI to do that.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.400
 I don't know that they were doing that, but.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.200
 So yeah, so Cloudflare has their own.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.640
 So just for context, the idea of the vector database

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.520
 is you might have a set of data that's large.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.520
 Let's say it's, I don't know, like every PDF

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.520
 that your company, every invoice your company

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.760
 has ever sent out with the description of the work

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.200
 and then the cost and whatever.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.840
 Obviously, a random open source model

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.000
 has no idea about that data.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.600
 So the architecture you use to be able to use

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.120
 these two things together is you run each document

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.880
 through a process and to generate something called embeddings.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.880
 And embedding is just like a big array,

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.280
 it's a big array of a bunch of numbers.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.040
 So you might get like, for each PDF,

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.480
 you might get like a thousand array item

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.200
 with a bunch of other things.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.120
 You can sort of this in a vector database.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.320
 Then you can ask the AI, your prompt,

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.040
 you can say like, show me all the invoices

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.560
 where we worked on front-end stuff,

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.040
 I don't know, something like that.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.200
 You generate an embedding for that as well.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.000
 And then now you can go compare

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 and find the most similar items in your database.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.040
 And that might be enough 'cause you're just looking

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.200
 for, okay, give me, it's like a search.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.200
 Or you might need to now like process

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.840
 like that one more time today.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.640
 So then you can reprompt the AI with now

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.320
 that small subset of relevance invoices or relevant PDFs

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.400
 and rerun it through.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.240
 So this is like a very common workflow.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.920
 I'm actually gonna be playing with it today

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.240
 because so we launched that issues feature in SSC

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.240
 and a thing with every thing like Century

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.480
 that does air reporting, the big challenges

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.120
 of grouping similar errors.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.600
 So right now we have some simple heuristic for doing that.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.080
 Like the error type is the same

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.160
 and it's kind of in the same place in the code.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.120
 It's probably the same thing.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.840
 But this is like a perfect fit for this.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.080
 Like you can just generate a vector for each error

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.800
 and just find the most similar error.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.520
 If it's within a threshold, you can assume that,

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.240
 okay, maybe these should be grouped together.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.320
 So prior to this, I couldn't really,

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.120
 I didn't really see any place that was cheap enough

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.040
 for this to be viable.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.040
 But yeah, this was great.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.720
 Like it's cheap.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.240
 It's on a well mature cloud provider.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.360
 All the compliance stuff is there.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.200
 So I really think this like really enables

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.640
 the first like non-toy applications to start being built.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.480
 - Very cool.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.800
 So when you said there's built-in models,

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.720
 what did they start with?

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.920
 Could you name some of them?

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.120
 - Yeah. So the flagship one

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.840
 is the llama two thing from Facebook.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.680
 - Yep.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.640
 - Is this all just like text generation stuff

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.040
 or is there any image generation?

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.240
 - Yeah. So they have image generation stuff.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.560
 They don't have stability in there yet.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.560
 They also have, I think it's speech processing.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.920
 So audio to text.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.760
 - Yeah.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.600
 - Okay.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.480
 - And there's some dedicated ones for generating

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.320
 these vectors to the vector database,

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.960
 which is probably what I'm only playing with.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.240
 But yeah, it's right now they set up

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.880
 just like the framework for it.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.000
 And it seems that they can add more models

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.080
 as demand for them shows up.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:28.920
 - Very cool.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.720
 That reminds me that I want to talk,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.640
 this episode would be great about all the AWS stuff.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.040
 Investing in that A company, what that's it called?

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:40.880
 - Oh yeah.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.720
 At Theropic.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.560
 - At Theropic.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.160
 I want to talk about Bedrock because I mostly just have

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:49.160
 not stayed on top of AWS's LLM efforts or AI efforts.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.440
 So yeah, Cloudflare, is there like a blog post?

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.600
 I'm sure we can link the blog post.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.920
 - Yeah, yeah, they wrote a blog post about it.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.360
 Yeah, it's very, and by the way,

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.960
 you don't have to use Cloudflare workers.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.000
 It's just a normal API.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:04.840
 - Oh, nice.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.000
 - So that's why we can now plug it into our app pretty quickly.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.200
 We sign up for Cloudflare and putting our credit card

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.440
 and it's a normal API with a nice SDK.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.320
 Yeah, but I mean, speaking of the AWS stuff,

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.280
 that is very relevant.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.960
 So me and Liz have been working on a feature for Boomi

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.120
 that's going to use AI.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.160
 And we've been prototyping just with open AI stuff.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.640
 But we can't really go to production with it

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.960
 because it's in the healthcare space

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.440
 and they don't sign BAs.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.120
 So we've been waiting for AWS to do their thing,

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.440
 launch an API that does this type of,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.480
 like to do this type of inference work.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.640
 - Yep.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.040
 - And they have announced it, it's called Bedrock.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.800
 And it's going to be similar to what I just described

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.880
 with Cloudflare where it's an API

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.880
 and there's going to be a bunch of models for you to select from.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.360
 So I thought they were going to be the first

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.920
 to like get something production ready out there.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.600
 But yeah, Cloudflare beat them to it, which is, yeah.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.720
 Yeah, and Bedrock is ready.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.680
 I just don't think it's public.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.520
 But I don't think they're far behind.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.520
 - So Bedrock is not an AWS model.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.000
 It's actually just a place where you run other models.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.360
 - They have their own.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.560
 I think it's called Titan.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.400
 So one of the options is one is their own.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.680
 - Are there any details on like how that compares

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.680
 to a llama too?

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.680
 Like these things are very expensive

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.840
 and take a long time to train.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.200
 I'm just curious like what has,

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.280
 how much has AWS invested?

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.120
 Do you have any idea?

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:28.960
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.080
 I mean, I've only heard from,

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.720
 well, you're a hero, shouldn't you have gotten access?

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.960
 - I mean, maybe, I don't know.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.520
 - I just totally checked out from--

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.840
 - I'm not checked, stop it.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.840
 (laughs)

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.960
 No, I'm just, I've been checked out from literally everything

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.800
 for months as we finish up this work that I've been doing.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.600
 So I've just been completely disconnected from all this stuff.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.600
 - I thought all the heroes got access to Bedrock.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.440
 - Maybe.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.280
 - All right, I know a bunch of them.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.120
 - I need to check the slack.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:52.960
 - You might have access.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.800
 - You might have access.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.960
 - Yeah, play with it.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.000
 - Yeah, 'cause I was talking to,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.840
 I think AJ was showing me some screenshots.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.840
 It doesn't seem as good as OpenAI,

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.640
 but it still seems pretty good.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.280
 Obviously, all these production models

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.000
 are not gonna be as good as OpenAI.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.200
 I think OpenAI's brand is like,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.200
 we're the most advanced,

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.440
 but the most advanced isn't necessarily the most practical

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.320
 for most of these cases, or even needed.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.440
 But it seemed pretty good.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.000
 - I mean, they've had a huge,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.680
 they had a huge head start, right?

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.040
 I mean, they started a lot earlier

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.000
 than everybody else on training these things.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.480
 - Yeah, I guess that's what it both sound too.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.840
 I'm so surprised by how close the gap is though.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.080
 It's not that far.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.760
 - Well, didn't OpenAI, I mean,

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.000
 they even, somebody had an executive there said,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.560
 like, we really don't have any defensible anything.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.720
 Like, this is just gonna be commodity.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.560
 It's not somebody said that.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.720
 - I think someone at Google said that.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.520
 - Oh, maybe that's what it was like the headline.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.000
 - I found that so funny 'cause I'm like,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.280
 why does this make headlines?

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.520
 Like, there was some headline being like,

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.680
 Google says OpenAI has no moat.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.960
 And it was like, being spread around,

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.760
 I was like, they have no moat.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.160
 I'm just like, it's just a one random person

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.280
 that said a thing.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.080
 It's like, I do kind of agree with it,

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.000
 but it's just like, a random person at a competitor

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 that kind of got embarrassed by this company.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.080
 - Yeah, I knew the lid, that's true.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.160
 - I don't know, it was weird. - There is not a news item.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.080
 Yeah, that's interesting.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.440
 - Yeah, it's like, person says thing.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.720
 And it's just like, it's just,

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.120
 it's honestly just a tweet.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.120
 Now it's just a tweet.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:21.960
 - Yeah.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.360
 - And it like made news.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.960
 - I mean, half of like, when I end up on some,

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.480
 like, newspaper's website or whatever,

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.520
 some article these days,

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.240
 how much of it is like, thing happened on Twitter?

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.880
 Here's a whole story about it and they had like five tweets.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.120
 It's the lamest thing ever.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.440
 Like, just get on Twitter.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.440
 We don't need this.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.280
 - I know.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.120
 - It's like, you're just,

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.960
 you're just drawing our focus

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.640
 the fact that you've been like, disintermediated.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.480
 - Exactly.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.640
 - Was that a nice word?

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.480
 - Was that a good word?

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.560
 - It's hard to say.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.400
 Disintermediate.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.200
 You know, it's one of those words that I read

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.760
 and maybe I've written a bunch of times,

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.760
 but I never say that a lot.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.160
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.360
 - But basically like, replaced like.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.200
 - Disintermediated.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.880
 - Yeah, 'cause they're like an intermediary

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.720
 and we don't need them anymore.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.560
 - Yes, we don't need exactly.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.720
 'Cause we get stuff directly from the people.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.960
 - Yeah, directly from the mouth.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.920
 - We're not gonna make it x.com and not Twitter.com.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.760
 - I don't know.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.720
 Oh, did you see that their CEO

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.760
 was saying 90% of advertisers are back?

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.560
 - Wait, their CEO is not Elon Musk?

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.000
 - No, pan, you were,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.160
 you've been really busy, huh?

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.440
 No, he finally found like someone to take it on full time.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.280
 - Really?

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.120
 - It's this woman from.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:29.960
 - Is that Mr. Beast?

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.920
 - She's not actually from tech, she's from, no.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.120
 Yeah, I was kind of worried about it

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.720
 'cause I was like, I think the choice made sense.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.520
 It was someone from the advertising world

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.720
 more than, is it from the media advertising world?

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.160
 I think I forgot what February's actually was from.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.480
 Where's someone from tech?

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.480
 Which I think makes sense

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.680
 'cause you need to get this business to be profitable.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.760
 I was just worried that she would start trying

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.720
 to play product, which it doesn't seem like she has.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.640
 She's just focused on getting the business running,

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.680
 which is good.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.520
 So I think it was it.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.440
 - And you said 90%, sorry, I totally glossed over it.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.760
 The point here, 90% of it.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.600
 - She said 90% of advertisers are back.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.320
 And she said something about them turning a profit

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.400
 in the first quarter of next year.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.560
 - Oh wow, that's a big turn around.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.760
 After it crashed pretty hard.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.600
 - I can't wait.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.560
 I can't wait for them to announce the profit

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:23.560
 because just all the really confident haters that were like,

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.960
 oh yeah, definitely, there's no way

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.200
 this company can make money.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.240
 Like you can't just fire everyone and expect it to work.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.640
 And it's making money for the first time.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.160
 - Yeah, why do people, what is that reaction?

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.600
 Like, I mean, I know a lot of people

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.560
 just don't like Elon Musk, so anything he does,

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.080
 they root against, which I still,

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.120
 I don't understand disliking a person

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.760
 that you don't know, a public figure so much

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.800
 that you just want them to fail.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.600
 I don't really get that, especially when like,

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.800
 all of us would be impacted.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.800
 Like if Twitter failed and we just didn't have Twitter anymore,

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.840
 that would suck.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.680
 - Yeah.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.320
 - So I'm not like an Elon Musk fan.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.960
 I don't really have a lot of people

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.480
 that I would call myself a fan of,

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.120
 like a person I don't know, I don't know.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.800
 But it's just weird to me to be like an anti.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.360
 - Yeah, I don't really, I like don't care about him either.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.400
 - Yeah, I just don't care.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.520
 Yeah, I don't care.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.320
 - But it's weird to think that people are like,

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.800
 oh, I hope it fails, so Elon Musk.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.880
 - Yeah, I mean, I think I get it.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.440
 It's obviously firing a bunch of people

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.240
 isn't a very likable thing to do.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.520
 So I think people's understandable reaction is to say,

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:31.520
 that was a bad negative thing and it was pointless.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.200
 And it was like, there's no point to it and it was like--

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.040
 - Gotcha.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.760
 - Not only was it like obviously a tough thing to do,

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.880
 it was also like a bad pointless thing to do.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.240
 And they kind of want to believe that it was like,

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.160
 just an evil thing.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.880
 But yeah, I think that it's clear the company would have,

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.200
 especially with the downturn that happened

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.040
 right when he bought it.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.760
 - Yeah, it didn't sound good.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.040
 - It would have had to do it anyway.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.280
 - Right, yeah.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.240
 Oh man, I start having all kinds of thoughts

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.640
 when you say those things.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.160
 And I start questioning, like, am I like,

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.480
 am I right wing?

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.360
 I don't know, where do I land on this side?

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.960
 I don't know where I land on the political spectrum.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.280
 But when I hear some of this, it's kind of like,

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.200
 I don't know, it's a job.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.800
 Like, people get fired all the time.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.000
 And like, you're not entitled to a job.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.480
 And like, ultimately, if the thing isn't profitable

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.120
 and it doesn't like, if the company shouldn't have 7,000 employees,

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.000
 then like, it shouldn't have 7,000 employees.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.440
 And it's not mean to fire people.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.920
 There's like this weird perception that like full-time jobs

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.640
 are this like bedrock of America.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.960
 And you just deserve one.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.960
 And like, am I sounding super like right wing?

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.000
 I don't even know.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.520
 - I think a lot of people would perceive this as like,

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.440
 you say that as like, oh, you're a bad person

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.440
 or like, you hate workers or you just blah blah.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.480
 They'll say a bunch of bad things.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.200
 But I think the reality is, yeah, like,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.240
 we are all trying to put together something sustainable

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.800
 so that people can make a sustainable living.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.480
 Like, that happens when you have a company that is founded,

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.800
 find some way to create value

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.880
 and find a way to stick around for a long time.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.080
 And any stable job that gives you a great income,

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.120
 great world of life balance,

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.040
 like the life that you've wanted is built on the fact

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.360
 that the company itself is creating value.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.920
 If that's not there, then the other stuff can't exist.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.800
 It's like, it exists as like a downstream effect of that.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.880
 - Yeah.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.720
 - Like, I tweeted the other day and I muted it right away

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.080
 'cause I knew what was gonna happen.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.080
 I tweeted the other day that there's a weird thing

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.080
 where people are like,

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.440
 whenever they see like a founder that works really hard,

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.760
 I think a great example is Jared from Biden.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.600
 - Yeah.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.920
 - I don't know if you remember when he was like,

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.800
 people were just like, that's unhealthy, that's bad.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.840
 Like, nobody should do that.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.720
 It's, to me, it's fine if you don't wanna do that.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.160
 Like, choose the way you wanna live your life,

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.960
 choose a balance you want, that's great.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.640
 But it's weird for people to get upset about other people

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.640
 doing something different.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.720
 Particularly when the company you worked at,

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.000
 probably at some point required someone to work

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.880
 an unhealthy amount to like get it off the ground.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:02.720
 - Sure.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.520
 - So there's like this really great synergy

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.080
 of like some people choose that.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.880
 And you don't have to choose that,

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.400
 we just need a few people to choose that.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.560
 The reality is 99% of people that choose that

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.240
 walk away with nothing.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.320
 We need some people to choose that,

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.560
 but 1% of them can succeed,

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.640
 so that there's like a sustainable thing

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.160
 for the rest of us to kind of slot into.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.920
 So there's a synergy, like appreciate your great job

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.080
 in your great life.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.480
 There's like, it required like something from someone else.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.440
 So don't just say like, it's automatically bad to work

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.080
 like this, 'cause some stuff does require that.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.680
 And most people replied like being like, yeah, totally.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.460
 But there's a few people just like really upset about it.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.520
 And just being like, you don't understand anything

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.920
 about the world or the history or like economics

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.240
 or blah, blah, blah.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.640
 My favorite thing is people love to like do this thing

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.280
 where they're, when I talk about that topic,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.160
 they'll like think they're being like all like,

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.480
 they'll reply being like, well, you're good at this thing.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.840
 But the topic you're commenting on,

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.200
 like you don't really know anything about that.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.320
 They just stick to your thing.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.720
 But I get that in every single topic, like there.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.760
 So if I talk about like front engineering.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.000
 - You're good at back in, but they'll talk about front in.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:13.840
 You don't know anything.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.680
 - Exactly.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.600
 But then when I talk about back in, I get the reverse thing.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.960
 - And this one I got like, you might be a good engineer,

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.240
 but like you have a lot to learn about economics.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.080
 And the funny thing is the first tweet for me

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.760
 that ever like went big and viral was about economics.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.440
 - Yeah, the apples, right?

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.080
 - Yeah, the apples.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.600
 - The navel, navel, navel, navel?

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.880
 - Navel oranges.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.000
 - I know you've corrected me

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.980
 and I can't remember which one I said first that you corrected.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.200
 - That is the retweet.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.680
 - Yeah.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.360
 - But yeah, so it's just like, there is this thing there

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.480
 where people just see things as too black and white.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.120
 It is just really complex and you just need all kinds

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.440
 of things happening.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.120
 And like you had to appreciate what you have.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.840
 Like there's not guaranteed and people 50 years ago,

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.040
 even just as recent as 50 years ago,

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.240
 some of the type of lives that people have now,

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.040
 it's like, would there just been impossible 50 years ago?

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.720
 - I'm really hung up on this politics thing.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.320
 I mean, just like, I don't know,

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:15.280
 I think I just don't fit into any of the specific molds.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.360
 I don't know, like Casey's super progressive.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.920
 Like I would call her far on that end.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.440
 So I thought I was too, 'cause you kind of like become

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.480
 your spouse, you know what I mean?

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.680
 Like in so many ways, I've become a lot like Casey,

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.120
 things that I never would have guessed 20 years ago.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.880
 I would be a certain way, I am a certain way.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.120
 So I think I just assumed, but like,

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.280
 then I also get really bothered by like far right stuff.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.680
 I get really bothered by all of it.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.320
 I think I just don't like any of it.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.320
 Is that possible?

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.840
 Is that, does that make me moderate?

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.120
 - I think what you're describing,

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.520
 I think a lot of people would relate to,

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.880
 and I feel like I relate to what you're describing.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.740
 - Okay.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.720
 - Yeah, 'cause I don't feel like,

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:00.160
 I just don't have, I think some people have a clear like,

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:04.920
 I'm this thing, this is the leadership for that thing.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.320
 I'm into that leadership.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.320
 Whereas for me, I'm like, I don't really like any of it.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.800
 I think I can imagine a person that I would like

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.440
 and they exist, but it just,

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.240
 that person has no way of like reaching the top

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.800
 or like being a presidential candidate or whatever.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.640
 Yeah, like there's always people

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.400
 that I like very early on and,

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.760
 oh, I'm excited for the new presidential race.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.480
 - Oh yeah, that's gonna be taken over soon.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.560
 - I know people take it very seriously

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.840
 and this may be upsetting,

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.520
 but I'm just gonna be really honest.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.680
 I really like it as like an entertainment thing,

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.520
 'cause I think, oh, it's very entertaining.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.240
 All the, I mean, I listen to the podcast.

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.560
 Again, I don't care at all about much of it,

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.600
 but like I listen to the 538 podcast

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.280
 where they're like breaking down all the polls

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.280
 and all this stuff.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.040
 I don't know why it is very entertaining.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:53.880
 Something about it.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.820
 - Yeah, like the debates and all the people

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.680
 and then people, and then you like narrow it down.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.400
 It's, it's just sports and.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.600
 - It really is.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.440
 - It's just sports.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.600
 - The debates are so theater.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.440
 I mean, they're just so entertaining.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.440
 - Yeah, it's just theater.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.880
 And people can pretend like, no, I'm a good person

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.480
 'cause I like care about this stuff.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.480
 Let's be honest, 90% of the fact,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.160
 90% of the reason we're into it

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.320
 is 'cause it's entertaining like sports

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.160
 and we get to feel like it's a more of a good things.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.920
 It's a part and so it just, it just adds to the other.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.040
 But yeah, I am excited for that.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.680
 But yeah, early on in all the races,

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.480
 I always feel like, oh, like that's a person that,

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.080
 maybe like, I can see them like, I can see myself like me,

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.680
 but I know there's no chance that man

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.080
 person's making it past the primary,

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:34.920
 like it's just not happening.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.200
 - And we've gone through that.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.160
 Casey and I, we went through the whole, I don't know,

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.280
 in the last 15 years, we've been married.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.440
 At some point, one of the elections, we had the like,

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.800
 oh, but look at the independent, the third party candidates.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.920
 They're so great.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.640
 And it's like, you're throwing your vote away,

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.600
 but then if everyone does that, they'll get another like,

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.920
 I don't know, are you supposed to like die on your vote?

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.000
 And like, I did the right thing.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.440
 - I think people should.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.760
 I think that actually is, it seems wrong,

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.400
 but like any system needs feedback and it's not working.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.920
 - And that's feedback.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.600
 - Like it needs to get that feedback.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.560
 But like, the system doesn't learn from the feedback.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:17.200
 I feel like, I honestly think Democrats could easily,

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.480
 I honestly think both parties could easily win.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.800
 If they were just focused on pure strategy

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.080
 of like what would get us the W,

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.000
 I think it's actually very easy.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.600
 Like if the Republicans feel that someone that's not insane

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.120
 to the right, and we're just like a normal person,

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.080
 like maybe a little bit, like kind of conservative leaning

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.640
 on things that they try to talk about,

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.960
 that person would just win.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.200
 There's like no chance that they would even have a chance

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.040
 of losing.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.560
 But like that person's never going to be like this,

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.000
 gets a nomination, right?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.160
 Like a normal kind of boring dude,

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.200
 like is not going to get the.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.840
 - I mean, I guess the last one would have been Mitt Romney.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.720
 I'm kind of boring normal dude.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.960
 - Exactly, he's actually the perfect,

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.400
 I always think about what would have happened if he won,

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.320
 'cause I didn't want him to win when he was running.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.640
 But now looking back, I'm like,

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.320
 what if he ended up just being the leader

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.920
 of the Republican party, and like he got eight years?

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.760
 Like would it be as crazy as it is today?

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.120
 Maybe not, like maybe if you like could re-engineer history,

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.080
 like that might have been the better thing.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.280
 - Yeah, it does seem like someone like him

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.440
 flies in the face of like today's media,

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:28.040
 and like the extreme-ness of everything.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.840
 - Like I'm craving a Mitt Romney now, like I'm sure

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.880
 a lot of people are, I'm sure if you go back 10 years,

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.000
 then you told people you'd be craving this person.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.760
 It would sound ridiculous, but.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.760
 - I don't even know like where he stands on anything

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.160
 politically, it's just like you said,

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.960
 he's not an insane person, I don't think.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.000
 - Yeah, he's like, you might disagree with him,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.040
 but it's not gonna be like, I disagree with him 100%,

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.800
 I feel like, if you disagree with him,

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.560
 it might be like a 20% disagreement,

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.680
 and then you might agree on other stuff.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.840
 So I don't know, it just,

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.440
 I don't know if we're ever gonna get back to that, really.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.480
 - Yeah, the normal, like normal people being in office.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.180
 - Normal-ish people, they're always gonna be weird,

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.240
 'cause you're weird if you spend your lifetime

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.120
 at your politician. - Yeah, no, it's true.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.600
 So this whole Taylor Swift stuff,

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.560
 have you heard anything about the Taylor Swift

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.820
 and Travis Kelsey? - No.

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.920
 - Okay, well, Taylor Swift is dating a football player,

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.920
 and it's been a big story.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.200
 - I did see, okay, no, yes, I did see people talking about this.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.480
 - Yeah, so anyway, I heard through all this,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.760
 that Taylor Swift could like win the presidency

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.720
 if she just ran, like polls show.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.560
 (laughing)

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.840
 - Probably, yeah.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.480
 - It's just funny, like all the people in the public sphere

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.840
 that are just more popular than any politician

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.520
 that if they chose, they could probably just.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.080
 - Like I said, I think I mentioned this before,

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.480
 but if I had to spend this whole thing

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.600
 in the most optimistic way, I look at it as,

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.120
 in any group of people, in any society,

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.680
 there's always people that are gonna like crave power

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.480
 and wanna like do this like political thing.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:59.580
 So maybe our whole system is just like a honey,

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.880
 what's it called, a honey pot for those people,

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.240
 where it just like sucks those people in,

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.540
 and they spend their whole career

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.120
 just like fighting with this other side

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.600
 and never really accomplishing anything good or bad.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.440
 - Interesting.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.680
 - So maybe that's the whole purpose of it.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.960
 Like we just can put all those people there

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.080
 and see all this really crazy stuff,

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.680
 and they never really get anything done,

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.880
 so it's mostly fine.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.600
 - Yeah, so I had this thought run through my head earlier

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.160
 that like, doesn't really matter, whoever's president,

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.440
 like what do they actually accomplish?

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.920
 I think there's some people that would get upset

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.640
 and say, there have been some things.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.200
 - Yeah, there definitely have, yeah.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.800
 I think the Supreme Court stuff has been--

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.440
 - Yeah, the Supreme Court's what came to my mind.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.160
 - Yeah, like especially with the lifetime of appointees,

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.640
 I mean, just the nature of how long that impacts

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.760
 future generations, that stuff sucks.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.120
 So we are acknowledging Dax and I,

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.240
 I just don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna get canceled

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.960
 or whatever, I can't say that, I shouldn't say

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.400
 I don't wanna get canceled, that's itself,

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.240
 like a bad thing to say.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.080
 - Cancellable.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.240
 - Yeah, we're aware that bad things have happened

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.520
 to lots of people because of who's in office.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.240
 But it doesn't matter as much as people think.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.480
 I think that's the thing.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.120
 But they don't have as much power to change things

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.440
 as maybe it feels during election cycles.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.960
 - Yeah, at least like the individual president.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.880
 - Yeah.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.360
 - I do, the other side of it though is I do feel like,

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:24.280
 this reminds me so much of SATs where eventually

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.560
 that it just got figured out and now there are teachers

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.680
 that can coach you into getting an amazing SAT score.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.800
 And it kind of makes SATs kind of pointless now.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.320
 I kind of feel that way about like our system of government

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.240
 and I feel like everyone just figured out,

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.480
 like it was working really well, like balancing everything.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.360
 But now it's like people figured it out.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.120
 You know, there's always constant attack on any like,

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.760
 system like that.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.840
 And I feel like, yeah, I figured out

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.960
 how to like rig it in certain ways.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.520
 - This doesn't add to your point at all,

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.400
 but it's just reminds me so much of also the NFL Combine

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.760
 where there's like coaches that can shave like three tips

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.280
 in a second off your 40 time, just by like techniques.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.120
 - Exactly.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:00.940
 - Yeah.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.280
 It's like any system will be gained given enough time.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.120
 - Yeah, it will be awesome.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.480
 - It's been like a couple hundred years.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.200
 The US has had to gain the political system.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.040
 - Yeah.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.800
 - I mean, that's what you like the gerrymandering,

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.920
 all that stuff, like you think of all that,

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.240
 how that impacts things.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.520
 Yeah.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.360
 Sucks.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.200
 - Yeah.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.040
 - Sometimes.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:18.920
 - Yeah, you just wonder.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.120
 - I think my political position is apathetic.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.320
 And that's probably a privilege thing to say,

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.120
 but I just feels like none of it matters.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.880
 - Well, at least it feels like nothing I can do actually matters.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.240
 - Yeah, I mean, that's a goal though.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.400
 I think, I think it's the goal to have for most people,

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.600
 you never really hear about what's going on

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.440
 to the government, like,

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.360
 'cause it's just not really doing much.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.200
 - Yeah.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.120
 - I think, if you think about, I mean, like 10 years ago,

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.000
 I don't know, I just, I was a little,

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.680
 I was younger too, so maybe I just wasn't aware,

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.080
 but if you just weren't thinking about,

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.400
 you guys feel like people didn't have to think

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.200
 about this at all time, 'cause there just wasn't as much going on.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.160
 Yeah, you want like a government that's like,

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.960
 just kind of boring and doing their thing.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.320
 You're not like every day wondering like,

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.160
 what are they up to?

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.800
 Like, are they doing something bad?

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.640
 - Yeah.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.720
 - Yeah, trust in institutions.

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.640
 I just heard that again.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.160
 I've heard that so many times,

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.640
 that like, how low trust in institutions is at this stage.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.480
 It's been declining since like the '70s or something.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.720
 Where did I hear this?

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.160
 I don't learn things.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.640
 - I mean, I, I don't learn things.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.920
 - I'll listen to a book or something, I don't know.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.280
 - Yeah, I mean, I believe that.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.640
 I see, I see that stat all the time.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.760
 It's not surprising.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.640
 The other thing I want to talk about though is,

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.560
 I was talking a little bit about it the other day.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.120
 You've heard this term, like, in acidification, right?

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:37.960
 - No.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.240
 - In acidification of, I mean, well, people talk about

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.920
 how like, stuff oftentimes just gets shittier

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:46.240
 and we've all experienced this with like, like tech products.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.080
 - Yep.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.920
 - Well, like you'll use a product for a while

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.600
 and it'll be really good

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.360
 and it'll either get acquired

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.160
 or like the founders kind of get rich

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.240
 and they're like, aren't trying as hard

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.960
 and it's supposed to get shitty.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.640
 I feel like we're in this phase where so many things

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.720
 in parallel are in that part of the cycle at the same time.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.560
 - Yeah.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.080
 - So it kind of adds up to feeling like,

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.160
 to feeling pretty negative.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.440
 Like it's like really stupid stuff.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.080
 Like I look at Slack and I'm like,

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.520
 I remember when Slack was like, awesome.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.160
 And I loved it as a great tool.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.720
 Now I'm like clicking around and I was like,

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.440
 I just don't, there's just so much shit everywhere.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.160
 Like it's like very confusing.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.400
 I feel that way about air table.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.040
 I feel like the way I had about a bunch of different tools.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.160
 - Oh no, air table.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.360
 That was one of your few

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.200
 on your short list of recommendations.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.040
 - With air table, I can still keep it minimal,

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.240
 but like everything that they've built in the last,

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.960
 like couple of years has been completely irrelevant to me.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.680
 I was like, hide it and pretend it's not there.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.000
 - Yeah.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:38.840
 - Yeah.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.360
 And then do you have like all these big tech companies,

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.680
 like like Google where they're just like,

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.520
 haven't really, they still have a crazy amount

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.880
 of power and influence and control,

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:52.920
 but like they just don't do anything compressive or good.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.840
 So they're in like a notification.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.880
 - It's like, okay, I'm having so many thoughts.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.920
 I gotta contain them.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.200
 It's like the universe and like the entropy thing.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.160
 Everything just like moves toward chaos.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.120
 And like, is it just that all the good things

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.720
 happen at the beginning of any given lifecycle?

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.400
 And then it's just degrading from there.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.080
 Like you think about software,

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.960
 just every software company is going to continue

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.840
 to build features until they die.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.280
 Like until the software company dies,

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.040
 the thing will just keep getting more features.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.880
 And does it need more features?

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.040
 Maybe it doesn't, but like you can't just sit around

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.800
 and just have a product that you maintain forever.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.040
 That would not fly.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.840
 You gotta like grow sales and grow whatever

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.920
 and grow, grow, grow, and biggering and bigger.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.080
 The Lorax, anybody?

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.720
 So is this just like inflationary economy stuff?

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.400
 Is this the laws of the universe?

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.320
 What is this?

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.160
 What is this principle?

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.000
 - Yeah, I think I look at it more like,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.560
 if you think about when these companies came out,

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.000
 they were disrupting something.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Something was there that they were disrupting.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.120
 I mean, do you take slack?

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.640
 Like they were disrupting.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.480
 What do we use before?

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.320
 Like all those shitty--

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.160
 - Yeah, there's stuff.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.960
 - Business, messenger stuff.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.360
 - There's Microsoft products, mostly.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.160
 - Yeah, so this might just be,

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.280
 the cycle might not actually be a cycle in the world.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.960
 It might be a cycle of our like ourselves,

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.360
 like the age we're at.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.480
 Because we don't really remember

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.000
 the previous generation of things they got disrupted,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.320
 but they did exist.

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.280
 And there was something there to disrupt.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.280
 These companies disrupted them, built something much better.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.080
 But at some point, they have to become

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.280
 that shitty incumbent that gets disrupted

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.480
 by something else, right?

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.800
 So I think we're maybe in that phase where we're like,

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.760
 now seeing how those older companies

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:37.920
 came into existence.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.440
 Like they must have been good companies

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.560
 at some point as well.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.400
 - Yeah.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.000
 And now it's like our generation of companies are in that.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.480
 - But like specifically taking Slack, the product.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.360
 Like the product was great when it was at the beginning

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.200
 and it was simple.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.040
 And then over time, they're just inevitably,

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.080
 they're this big company now.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.520
 They're gonna make more features

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.400
 and they're gonna add to what was a great product

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.760
 and it's gonna become bloated

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.520
 and it's gonna become less magical.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.560
 Is that like a requirement of software

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.560
 that it must continue to add features?

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.800
 Is there anything that's just stayed?

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.440
 - No, I don't think so,

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.400
 because I think it's just very hard, right?

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.800
 Like you're basically at that point thinking about

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.760
 how do you make this company last?

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.120
 The founders own motivations, like beyond, like keep it.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:25.960
 - Yeah.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.800
 - Keep it being good.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.900
 Yes, they're gonna add more features.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.360
 But the thing is, the point is they have resources.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.800
 I mean, they need to invest those resources.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.440
 Those resources don't have to be

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.040
 into just like redesigning it

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.680
 and moving stuff around and like adding features.

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:41.520
 It could be something a lot more like a much grander vision

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.640
 or expanding into other areas

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.680
 that maybe not even directly related

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.200
 'cause you just have money, right?

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.040
 - Yeah.

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:47.880
 - To put in somewhere.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.920
 But you have a bunch of bureaucracy,

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.560
 a bunch of people that are like,

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.000
 like that think that that's too crazy.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.840
 You have a board, you've been acquired.

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.080
 Like it's just a lot of stuff gets in the way.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.440
 And like, who's really at the company like motivates

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.280
 to make that happen?

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.720
 Probably not anyone.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.640
 So it goes into the least overhead place,

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.840
 which is just like, let's add a button here.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.520
 Let's like do this other integration.

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.920
 Let's see these, the other things.

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.520
 But there are counter examples, right?

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.840
 You have examples of companies like,

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:15.920
 this is a random one, but it's--

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.840
 - Like Google, go ahead.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.000
 - But Google hasn't done that well.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.800
 They haven't expanded outside of their core business well.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.120
 - Oh, they haven't done well.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.800
 But I guess like they left the original product alone.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.320
 It's like the same mostly.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.840
 And then they invested in lots of other ideas.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.680
 Sorry, go ahead.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.960
 - Yeah, it just hasn't.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.800
 They just haven't been able to translate into any ones there.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.200
 But I was thinking about a company like Nintendo, right?

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.920
 Again, not exactly software,

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:41.040
 but they do a wide range of things at hardware

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.800
 and software in the form of games.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.680
 Been around for super long.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:48.440
 I think their quality has remained high in all those years.

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:50.800
 Of course, every company's gonna have their misses,

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.440
 but yeah, like that's like a timeless company.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.240
 You can see it lasting for another 100 years.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.080
 - Yep.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:57.920
 - A lot of other companies like most,

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.720
 I think it's hard, really hard to pull that off.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.760
 Like it's, that's lasted like,

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.960
 I mean, they started out in like the 1800s

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.560
 or something around Nintendo, like stupid old--

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:07.400
 - What?

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.200
 - They were like, it's one of those companies

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.800
 that's like remarkably old.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.080
 - I got it now now.

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:16.880
 Nintendo, how quickly can I find this?

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.800
 Here we go, 1889 found it.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.160
 Are you kidding me?

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:26.560
 What did they do, handmade playing cards?

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.040
 That's incredible.

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.760
 - Yeah.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:34.080
 - And then in the 70s, they started with games.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:36.280
 Donkey Kong in '81, wow.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.960
 - I had no idea.

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.480
 So that's like Lego too.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.440
 We've got all these Lego books and like they started,

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.200
 it's, they're so old and that was like wooden toys.

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.040
 - Oh yeah.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.480
 And then moving into the bricks.

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.240
 - Yeah, so Jay's been reading this Henry Ford book

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.840
 and it's been really crazy.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.200
 It's a book written by Henry Ford.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.360
 It seems like an autobiography,

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.920
 but it's more like his like manual for running businesses.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.480
 And it's crazy, simple and super relevant.

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.240
 And one of the concepts he has in it is,

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.200
 he's like, I have nothing against retirement,

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:11.000
 but don't retire while you're still running the company.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.680
 'Cause that is just bad for society.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.520
 - Yeah.

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.120
 - So I think a lot of these companies,

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.520
 the people running them are effectively retired

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.320
 in that they're like, I've done the big thing

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.720
 that I'm doing my life.

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.400
 But they're still running this company

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.160
 and controlling these resources and allocating them.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.320
 And they're not gonna allocate them in the same way

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.800
 that someone that has something to prove is gonna do it, right?

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.320
 But yeah, and it's a really great concept.

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.640
 Like this idea of like, these companies are retired.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.000
 But they didn't get out of the game.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.360
 They're like still in it.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.520
 - Interesting.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.320
 I learned some new things today.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.400
 I'm trying to remember what I learned.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.600
 (laughs)

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.480
 The Nintendo thing is fresh, but yeah.

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.920
 So I just feel like we're in this cycle

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.680
 where a bunch of these things are aligning

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.160
 and it just is not very inspiring.

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.600
 I'm so optimistic in that.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.840
 This is a very hard time.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.320
 So there's a bunch of founders right now

00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.160
 that are probably gonna be incredible founders 10 years from now.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.360
 - Just they're being born in this,

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.840
 hardened in this terrible cycle.

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.760
 - They're being forged at this moment.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.360
 - Yeah, that's forged.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.880
 - They're only gonna be obvious in hindsight.

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:09.800
 - Yeah.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.800
 I hope this episode makes it.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.880
 I think it will.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.640
 Second attempt at number 60.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.080
 60 episodes.

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.000
 I'm just gonna, every 10, I'm gonna be like 70 episodes.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:20.840
 How about that?

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.720
 - The next milestone is definitely 100.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.560
 - Yeah, I know.

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.720
 - We gotta do something special for 100.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.560
 - Yeah, we will.

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.080
 I feel like I'm kind of, if I'm being honest,

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.480
 it feels like I'm phoning it in a little bit.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.960
 Tall 100.

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:32.560
 It's kind of like, we're just gonna get through these

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.720
 next 40 episodes.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.560
 - Are you retired?

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.400
 Have you retired?

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.240
 And you're still doing a lot?

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.080
 - I haven't retired.

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.880
 Someone once made a comment that I was in that phase.

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.320
 I think I was Aaron, actually.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:42.760
 - 'Cause Aaron, 100% Aaron.

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:43.920
 I don't remember that.

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.080
 (laughing)

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.280
 - Oh, you didn't say it directly,

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.400
 but I read between the tea leaves.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.480
 Wait, read between the lines.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.320
 Read the tea leaves?

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.280
 I don't know.

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.480
 Anyway, I'm retired.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.320
 Don't bother me.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.160
 (laughing)

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.720
 - Weirdly you were like, are busier than ever,

00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.440
 so you're the opposite retired, if anything.

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.280
 - I know.

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.200
 I wish I were retired.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.120
 Geez.

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:06.840
 I haven't had time to get on Twitter in weeks.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.880
 I mean, I have, I just haven't.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.280
 I guess I slept 12 hours last night.

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:12.760
 I shouldn't talk about how I don't have time for things.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.640
 But I'm sick.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.480
 So that's different.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.040
 - When I retire, I'm gonna be on Twitter so much.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.360
 You think I'm on Twitter a lot now.

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.200
 - Yeah.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.040
 - Wait, some retire.

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:20.880
 - No kidding.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.720
 When you don't have any work to do.

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.560
 - If you follow me, your whole feed

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.280
 is just gonna be my tweet to nothing else.

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.800
 I'm gonna be tweeting every four minutes.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.200
 - When I do get on Twitter, 'cause it knows that I like you.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.680
 It knows that I like your tweets.

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.160
 So when I do get on, it's like,

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.800
 I'm catching up on all your tweets from the last three days.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.080
 And it's like seven tweets in a row or an ax.

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:37.920
 It's a good time.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:38.760
 - Yeah.

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.720
 I do wonder what they, so I wanna do this thing

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.720
 and I hope it picks up.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.320
 I want everyone to go to their For You page

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.440
 and record 30 seconds of rolling talent.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.280
 'Cause I'm really curious what everyone's experience is like.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.640
 'Cause when I look at my For You page, I'm like,

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.480
 "This is good."

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.080
 Like, I like what I'm seeing here.

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.400
 Everyone has a completely different feelings around it.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.240
 Like, it sucks.

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.080
 It's always showing me stuff I hate.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.720
 - Do I am curious for people that are in our bubble?

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.880
 Are they basically seeing the same stuff that I'm seeing?

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:08.080
 Or are they seeing like radically other other stuff?

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.440
 - I'm so curious.

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.680
 - Could you get everyone to do that?

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.440
 Could you make that happen?

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.280
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.120
 I was thinking about it.

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.240
 I gotta post it.

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.400
 - Now I'm looking at my For You

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.600
 'cause I was on my following tab

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.520
 and I didn't even realize it.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.960
 - It has to be the For You tab

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.800
 because if there's anything embarrassing in there,

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:24.960
 it needs to be deniable.

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.160
 (laughing)

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.000
 - Yeah.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.240
 - Like, oh, how did that get in there?

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.800
 (laughing)

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.120
 - What in the world is going on on Twitter?

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.480
 I haven't looked at the For You in a while and huh.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.080
 It's just a mix of like absolute garbage

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:42.160
 and then like, you guys are all so smart.

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.440
 What do you guys, how do you know all this stuff?

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.800
 - No, I need to get back to work

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.800
 'cause I'm just getting into the doom scrolling.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.040
 I'm just still scrolling.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:51.160
 - Hey, good times.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.600
 Thanks for getting on.

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.520
 I keep thanking you.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.920
 That's apparently a new thing I do.

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:55.880
 Like, thank you to Axe.

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.720
 - You're welcome.

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.520
 - You don't know when this will be the last episode

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.360
 and you just don't want to get on again.

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.640
 So I'm just gonna thank you, I guess, every episode.

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:05.040
 Until 100.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.440
 - I'm just gonna glee into it and be like, you owe me.

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.280
 - You're welcome.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.120
 You owe me.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:09.960
 - You owe me one.

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.680
 - Every one of these episodes, I'm indebted a little bit more.

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.520
 (laughing)

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.080
 All right, hey, we didn't stream this one.

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:18.080
 Maybe that's the trick.

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.440
 Maybe that's the key to recording successfully

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.240
 is not streaming.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.440
 - I really wanted to stream this week.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.440
 I was really hoping--

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.280
 - Yeah, you said you were going to.

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.120
 - Yeah, I wanted to.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.800
 I just don't think it's gonna happen.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.440
 Busy rolling out.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.280
 Very large.

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.560
 - What do you really, like, you keep hitting,

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.160
 like, I totally relate to it

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.360
 'cause everyone's gone through this,

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.400
 but you keep hitting like, oh, like,

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.080
 we're basically done milestone.

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.560
 But then it's like, oh no, we're basic.

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.200
 - So this morning, we were gonna roll out to Australia,

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.480
 which is 1% of our traffic.

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.720
 - That's so funny 'cause in my head,

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.400
 you guys were just like, half fuck Australia.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:48.240
 (laughing)

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.080
 You get our buggy code.

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.520
 (laughing)

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:54.680
 - I mean, we just wanted, it needs to be geographically isolated

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.520
 because just the nature of Route 53

00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:00.200
 and there are different options there.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.520
 So it needed to be geography

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.680
 and we wanted a nice clean 1%

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.880
 and that happens to be Australia, so.

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.440
 - I wonder if this is a common experience for Australians

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.440
 where they're always just doing--

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.800
 - Oh, maybe.

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.680
 - Just 'cause they're so, they're literally on a hill end,

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.160
 so it's like, you can easily route traffic to just them.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.320
 - Yeah, maybe, they wake up and they're like,

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:22.640
 stat news, I can't think of any Australian accent words.

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:23.480
 (laughing)

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.880
 - Good day, mate.

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:25.720
 - Or nor.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.160
 - Stat news is down, okay, I don't know.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.080
 That was terrible.

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:33.160
 Yeah, so we were gonna roll it out this morning.

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.960
 There's just a couple little hang ups

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.200
 that I'm working through right now and then,

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.160
 and then we'll probably roll it out.

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.960
 They'll be asleep by the time I get it rolled out today,

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:40.800
 but.

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.800
 - It's happening.

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.140
 Run, Paul, Giff.

00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:47.400
 - Oh, yeah.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.240
 - Run, Paul.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.080
 - Yeah, remember, run, Paul.

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.520
 (laughing)

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.600
 All right.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.040
 I'm gonna go sleep for 12 hours.

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:53.920
 - I'll see you later.

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:54.760
 - Okay.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:55.580
 - See ya.

00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:56.420
 - See ya.

00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:59.000
 (upbeat music)
