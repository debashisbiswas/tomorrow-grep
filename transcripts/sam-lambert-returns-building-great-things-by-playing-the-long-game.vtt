WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
 - The thing I love about this job is you have to build

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.000
 with the paranoia assuming the server will arrive

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.440
 with no discs available to you.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.920
 You just have to like do all this loopy stuff.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.760
 And it's really fun.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.440
 It's actually just like really interesting

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.080
 to engineer at the extreme edge

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.000
 with those needs for paranoia.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.840
 - It's cool.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.680
 It's really cool.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.260
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:41.120
 - So how was the party?

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.960
 Was that yesterday?

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.760
 - No, it was the day before,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.080
 but like an ad hoc party started yesterday again.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.200
 The, we had guests were still here

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.520
 at like 2 a.m. in the morning after the party.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.360
 It was ridiculous.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.180
 It was ridiculous.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.960
 Like a DJ, we had food trucks.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.480
 It was like, just so many people showed up.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.320
 It was amazing.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.160
 It was really, really cool.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.360
 I can't wait for you to come visit sometime.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.560
 I know, you know, you're too cool for San Francisco,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.280
 but come and do an edition of it.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.560
 Just come work from the office, man.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.680
 Just kind of like, come hang out.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 It's like the space for you whenever you want to be here.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.520
 It's gonna.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.360
 - No, I appreciate that.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.920
 I mean, when I saw the, yeah,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.200
 I saw you mentioned the party and I saw,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.560
 I didn't see too many pictures.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.800
 I feel like I just saw like a handful.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.800
 And I was like, man, this is one I wish that I lived in SF.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.800
 I mean, I love it.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.600
 I think it's like a beautiful city, you know?

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.440
 - Yeah.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.280
 - And I absolutely like love being there,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.280
 but I just haven't been there in a while.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.920
 But yeah, it's cool, you can do this kind of thing.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.760
 - Your company is gonna rip.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.000
 And when it does, you are gonna just have to come here a lot.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.120
 Like it just becomes like, it's the hard.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.960
 That's why I love living here

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.280
 is 'cause everyone comes and sees me, right?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.360
 - Yeah, it's funny you say it's good being in SF

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.620
 because, you know, people are always there

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.560
 and they kind of, you just have someone in town

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.840
 visiting all the time that happens in Miami too,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.000
 except it's always someone here for their bachelor party.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.880
 It's like the reason I see someone.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.720
 Yeah.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.840
 My friends are in that group where they're like,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.320
 the age range where they're just finishing that up.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.520
 So I haven't, I'm like seeing less and less people now.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.360
 - Yeah.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.360
 - 'Cause they're not going to bachelor parties as much,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.320
 but yeah, it's what it's nice being in a city.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.960
 - I hated that early 30s era

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.760
 where every weekend was like, my wife is in like a, yeah,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.240
 like a bridal party or whatever.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.760
 And I just had to hang around a hotel for hours just to go

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.760
 to a wedding with the people I don't know.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.840
 - Yeah, I think overall escaped it for the most part.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.360
 - But yeah, baby showers next.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.920
 - Oh yeah, no, we're definitely in that zone.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.720
 But you know, I don't know if this is the case everywhere,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.400
 but at least in Miami and I guess in Latin culture,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.560
 it's only a woman thing, like the men are non,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.680
 but I've never been in a baby shower period, so.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.800
 - I have, I think.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.080
 Yeah, I think people just have any reason

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.480
 to like throw a party, I guess.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.040
 And you know, in white women culture,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.160
 they're like any reason to torture the men

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.120
 with you should care about these things as much as us.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.880
 And so we have to go and do those things.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.200
 - Tell us the worst, say absolutely worst.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.200
 - It's like the opposite, like I think I'm like,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.160
 it's weird to like invite men,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.840
 like they're kind of like banned from the party.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.520
 - It's just a woman thing.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.120
 - Well, as you know, half my family is India,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.800
 which is like, why would we ask the men

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.960
 to like about raising the children?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.760
 I mean, they have nothing to do with this.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.480
 I mean, why?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.520
 - Yeah, that's funny.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.440
 - That's great.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.600
 We can build SaaS companies instead.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.080
 (laughing)

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.800
 - So speaking of how's it, how's it feel?

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.440
 I know you guys have been working on a planned scale medal

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.280
 for a while.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.400
 So it probably feels amazing just to have it out.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.640
 And you've been, I can tell you've been having a,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.920
 you've been in a good mood this whole week.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.320
 - Ooh, it's been awesome.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.680
 Actually, it's been really good.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.520
 Yeah, you know when you kind of see a new world

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.120
 and very few people know about it

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.200
 and you just feel this constant like tension.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.360
 Like you're just so, I know you're like this too,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.000
 which is, you know, once you get this focus,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.120
 you just want to jump in and put everything into it

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.880
 and anything that doesn't reflect that world

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.840
 is an annoyance.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.480
 And metal's been around for like quite a while now

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.080
 and we launched it very, very differently

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.480
 in the sense that we did our customers first

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.640
 and we were gonna, like the secret,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.880
 the behind the scenes is we were gonna be ready for reinvent

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.120
 and we were gonna go and announce it in beta

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.680
 and make a splash at reinvent.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.280
 And we started showing it to our customers

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.080
 and they were like, well, can we move now?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.120
 I mean, yeah, we can, we can move it, it's fine,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.680
 it's durable, it's like, we test everything.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.600
 There's no, you know, there's no risk,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.440
 it's just like we would need to focus only on,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.200
 you know, kind of helping you all like migrate

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.040
 and figure it out 'cause you just want to take any risk

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.880
 and do it properly.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.800
 So we, you know, we'd need to do something differently.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.360
 So if all of you are willing to be part of our launch,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.560
 we'll delay this by a whole quarter.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.840
 We'll get you up into prod and then you become the launch

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.360
 and everyone was like, sure, fine.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.160
 I mean, some of these are public companies, right?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.920
 They had to get approvals everywhere to go and do this

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.200
 and it was the first time they'd ever done this stuff.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.280
 And it was just an awesome way.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.000
 I mean, it was like very much in the style

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.280
 of what we want to do, which is push our companies forward.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.760
 Like we're, we're just a database at the end of the day,

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.040
 you know, it's only magical when they're up, right?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.920
 And doing, and building their companies.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.360
 And so yeah, so it was a kind of tough three months

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.080
 to kind of just try and stay chill,

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.480
 know that we're gonna launch this thing

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.720
 and then watch our customers be successful.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.040
 But since launching, we've just had so many inbound

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.600
 like emails and people immediately just bringing

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.440
 a credible, expensive Aurora workloads

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.880
 and saying how much would this cost on plans go?

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.160
 And it's so far every single one

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.680
 is gonna save money and get faster.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.640
 So it's very exciting.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.880
 - Yeah, it's, it's funny to hear that

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.880
 because I so struggle to keep anything quiet.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.200
 Like the moment, even before, like the moment I have an idea,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.000
 even before I've like actually built the thing,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.480
 I'm like already like wanting to talk about it.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.440
 So whenever I see like, you know, bigger,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.600
 it's kind of bigger companies that like plan a lot more

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.880
 and like, like announce things and it takes like months.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.640
 I don't know how, how I could ever do that.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.160
 I just don't know how to discipline for it.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.320
 - No, it's hard, but it's great for what you guys do, right?

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.600
 Like you just kind of ship things and it's dynamic

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.360
 and it's what people love.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.880
 I mean, it's a really good thing to be that way.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.000
 If you kind of, I would say we, we still strike that balance

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.360
 of not trying to be too perfect, right?

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.760
 You've got to hold onto that tension

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.200
 of getting out for people quickly.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.280
 But at the end of the day, especially with what we do,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.840
 no feature is worth production issues or liability issues.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.400
 And so, so we, we just, we have to be very cautious

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.200
 and careful, you know?

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.320
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.520
 The, yeah, the charts I've been seeing

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.040
 been really crazy, just very dramatic,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.560
 dramatic drops in the P99 charts.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.720
 - It's so fun.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.560
 Yeah, just like, and then people are might,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.040
 like we're just watching people migrate and they just,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.720
 they're like messaging us there, P99 graphs and being like,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.000
 oh yeah, this is what happened.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.440
 It's like, wow, I think this is good.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.280
 I mean, this is the theme.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.120
 Who doesn't want that?

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.520
 I mean, we love, as software engineers, we love that, right?

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.960
 We just love to, either graphs going up

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.400
 or graphs going down dramatically,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.600
 normally means something good or terrible.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.520
 But, you know, in this sense, we're very happy.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.360
 And the P99 is the important one too.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.760
 - Yeah, it's kind of nice in cases like this,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.600
 'cause I feel like a lot of time is wasted in software,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.600
 like debating things that are more abstract or like,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.240
 we kind of over-complicate some of these discussions

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.080
 and make it seem like really intricate.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.640
 But then in this situation, there's nothing to discuss.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.120
 Like number goes down, it's really straightforward.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.320
 There's nothing to debate.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.160
 Is this good?

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.000
 Is this bad?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.800
 You know, none of the, the whole,

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.000
 there's like no discussion around it

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.120
 'cause it's just like, you know, very straightforward.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.320
 Definitely the things that are actually good

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.880
 tend to be kind of straightforward in that way.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.120
 100%.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.520
 We're excited about it because it's that straightforward.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.760
 It goes down to being kind of the formula

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.560
 for infrastructure startup success,

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.120
 which is a kind of, whenever it's a huge shift

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.640
 in cost or performance, like that's what Snowflake did.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.160
 With, ironically, the opposite strategy,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.720
 which is by separating storage and compute,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.880
 they changed that game fundamentally.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.640
 We're going in the opposite direction technically,

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.560
 but that is kind of how you win

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.840
 is you have this just big step change in one of those.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.520
 And then doing both is obviously very special

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.280
 because before metal, although we were, as everyone knows,

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.600
 like we're running these giant workloads for like,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.840
 I mean, AAA games, you know, we all play

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.520
 just run, you know, using this stuff.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.960
 And it's amazing.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.880
 But it's not like the mass market

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.920
 that everyone can go and benefit from, right?

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.120
 Like these Aurora has just a giant base

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.920
 of revenue across hundreds of thousands of customers

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.400
 and that kind of are pitched to a lot of Aurora customers.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.840
 And if you read into Com's blog, you know,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.040
 it's very much describes it.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.360
 And they did actually have an initial blog post

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.640
 a few months back about how they're moving off Aurora

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.840
 to planet scale to tell their customers

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.840
 that they're going to be more reliable

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.800
 because Aurora is unreliable when it starts to grow.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.920
 And so our pitch was like, well, you know,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.480
 if you're an Aurora and it's starting to become unreliable

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.880
 or you can migrate to us, we'll keep you scaling,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.200
 we'll keep you at pretty much the same performance

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.680
 that you're used to for infinity,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.120
 like it just linearly will scale at that forever.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.960
 Now with metal, we're actually just saying,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.960
 yeah, if you spend $800 to $1,000 a month or more on Aurora,

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.760
 yeah, you're probably going to get faster and cheaper

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.680
 if you move.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.520
 That's huge.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.000
 Now we just have to get out of our own way

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.920
 and make it even easier to go and do that.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.480
 And it's gonna be very good.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.680
 - Yeah, so just to get into some of the details here,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.520
 when you're deploying in AWS or any of the major clouds,

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.280
 you typically will use network storage.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.560
 So this is, if you spend up a server and you need storage,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.560
 it's not attached to the server directly.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.240
 It's on separate dedicated server cluster

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.080
 that does storage.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.560
 So the trade off here is just performance

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.280
 'cause you're going over the network

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.040
 to access other storage.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.560
 The benefit is that storage can be made redundant.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.360
 Your server workload can move around.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.000
 It's okay if they need to move it to another server,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.160
 whatever, it's not attached to the physical disk

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.360
 on the server, it can access remotely.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.440
 So if you're building anything in the cloud

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.880
 that needs persistence because you need redundancy,

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.840
 you're pretty much forced into using CBS.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.840
 And if you look at a lot of these like newer clouds

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.000
 that are like simpler,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.560
 they tend not to have the eBS offering

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.320
 'cause building eBS is quite challenging.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.960
 It's a lot harder to build that than to build

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.680
 like compute offering.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.800
 It's extremely hard to run stateful workloads

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.920
 because they'll just do the thing

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.720
 where they put your database and your storage

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.320
 on the same physical server.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.040
 Your compute and storage on the same physical server.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.240
 And then when that server like runs out of space,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.920
 they got to like figure that out.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.920
 If they need to move stuff around,

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.240
 now data's in one place and you compute somewhere else.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.800
 So it's very difficult to run persistent workloads

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.840
 in simplified clouds.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.880
 But then if you do want to run a persistent workload,

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.880
 historically the problem has been while you need redundancy.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.080
 So you have to deal with the eBS penalty.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.560
 What PlanScale Metal does is it keeps you in AWS.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.760
 You can still use all the other stuff that's there.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.240
 And if you're competing there, there's no latency penalty.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.680
 But it does not use eBS.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.920
 It actually does use instant storage

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.680
 but retains a redundancy capabilities,

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.120
 retains ability to move compute around.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.720
 And that's kind of the big innovation

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.160
 which as many database offerings as there are,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.640
 there's not really one that retains all of this.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.760
 So it's kind of like the sweet spot

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.640
 for any serious workload.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.200
 - 100%.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.640
 Yeah, that's, I mean, perfectly put basically, you know,

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.320
 we, when we were back in the data center days,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.760
 your final kind of last resort for a serious issue

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.240
 was a RAID controller.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.440
 Like at the end of the day, you know,

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.280
 we ran in the data center at GitHub, you know,

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.080
 and at the end of the day,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.400
 even if we were down for a full day

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.400
 because every replica exploded, like,

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.640
 and then, you know, we needed to get data back,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.240
 we could at least have hands-on machines,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.160
 moving disks and rebuilding radar arrays

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.000
 to get the data back.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.560
 It'd be horrible that we wouldn't be,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.200
 but it's that final piece of safety.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.280
 You don't get that in the cloud.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.560
 Like once you terminate an instance,

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.680
 an EC2 node with the instance storage,

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.520
 it's gone forever.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.720
 You'll never see it again.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.440
 But with our redundancy model, that's not a problem.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.040
 And the reason it's exciting for us is

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.120
 we're just buying the same machine as Amazon does.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.680
 Like they just take those exact same machines,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.360
 they build all their software services on top of it.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.040
 And so if you're on Amazon buying convenience from Amazon,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.720
 it's hard to beat them when it's at scale.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.560
 It's about cost and efficiency.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.800
 But, you know, our software engineers have run bigger database

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.000
 workloads than Amazon themselves,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.800
 and some of the largest running on Amazon run on our software.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.880
 And so it gives us the opportunity to just fully bet

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.720
 on ourselves.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.080
 It's the same way that we increased our SLA.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.880
 I don't know if you saw that because

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.920
 we don't rely on EBS.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.520
 And, you know, it's really flexible to use EBS.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.120
 Like to, you know, we roll all of our pods every 29 days.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.920
 So every machine a parts go is less than a month old

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.600
 at any point.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.960
 And EBS makes that really easy

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.600
 because you just detach the volume,

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.120
 spin up a new pod with the new version of MySQL.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.800
 It attaches and runs and it's just easy.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.880
 And so the only trade off of moving to metal is

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.760
 we do the traditional dance of bike backup restore.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.600
 It's fine.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.720
 We've done this for millions and millions and millions of times.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.000
 It's very, very robust, but it means that we, yeah,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.840
 we get that.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.600
 And yeah, if you're starting a database company today,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.760
 you have to choose your pain.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.520
 And it's hard enough to do it one way.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.320
 So, you know, you usually end up,

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.720
 people are doing it on S3 as well.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.000
 Like there's companies like TurboPuffer,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.320
 shout out to Simon and crew, phenomenal.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.280
 Like it's not an OLTB database,

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.080
 but it uses S3 to its advantage to provide

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.440
 like an incredibly cheap, cost efficient way

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.920
 to do vector storage.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.120
 It's not, you only get a certain amount of your working set

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.320
 can be like hot basically.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.360
 And they then run that on fast local machines.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.280
 And then they back it all to S3,

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.280
 but running OLTP workloads on slow storage is just lunacy.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.400
 - Yeah, yeah, and that's even crazier

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.800
 'cause there's like, it's even more layers than trade, yes.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.400
 There's not even like a trade of file system.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.000
 - Maybe we should talk about actually like,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.840
 'cause I'd love, you know, your explanation

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.680
 will probably be way better than mine

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.600
 in terms of the impact of tail lenses, right?

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.080
 Like if we're doing like 200 queries a page, right?

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.640
 Which some people do, right?

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.800
 You know, that's not abnormal at all in a, you know,

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.720
 a large web app.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.800
 One of them spiking up to 500 milliseconds of P9.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.520
 That's a failed, like a failed request worker pipe.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.840
 Like you've seen this stuff, like, you know, it just,

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.360
 it's that band of consistent performance,

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.800
 which is actually more important than,

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.760
 than just an overall speed metric

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.880
 or average like milliset latency.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.000
 - Anyone that's ever done any kind of performance work,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.720
 you, like the first thing you learn is like,

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.360
 "Oh yeah, I don't give a shit about averages at all."

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.760
 Because your averages always look great.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.120
 They always look fantastic.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:21.960
 - Yeah.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.640
 - And then you look at your, you know, P9s and things

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.480
 at the edge.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.080
 And that's where all the problems are.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.560
 And when you fix things, that's where you see stuff react,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.960
 like immediately.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.160
 So, yeah, I mean, stuff goes viral online

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.520
 where people just like, you know, do a couple calls.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.960
 And they're like, "Oh, here's the thing."

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.040
 And it's funny, but when you're actually doing performance work,

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.800
 you know, it's, it's all about the tail ones.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.520
 And when you talk about like quality of a product,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.080
 it's about feeling reliable.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.800
 And if P9s sounds like, "Oh, that's like, you know,

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.360
 an edge case."

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.280
 Not really because like, it multiplies across number of queries.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.720
 And like as a user, you like might hit that pretty frequently.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.560
 - Yep.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.040
 - And like feeling, like when you hit something

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.440
 and it's like four out of five times,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.920
 it reacts correctly, but then the fifth time,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.440
 it's a little worse.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.400
 The users ends up feeling like the whole thing is unreliable

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.920
 because sometimes it just feels off.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.400
 So, yeah, that's where all the value is.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.960
 And that's where, you know, you have to focus.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.240
 - You know, yeah, that's where you're,

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.920
 you're normally your best customers are the ones

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.520
 that feel those the worst, right?

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.200
 Like it's they're the ones with the most data,

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.920
 they're the ones with the kind of,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.720
 yeah, I remember Bootstrap, Twitter Bootstrap,

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.120
 was by far the largest repo on GitHub for a long time.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.120
 And it just, someone browsing through the stars page of that

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.920
 with a script would just take the website down

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.280
 because it would just be pulling all of the data off

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.120
 of disk and whatever.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.960
 You know, yeah, it's like, it is so important.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.120
 And that, you know, people, you know,

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.920
 they think, well, you know, you're just putting the network

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.920
 over, you know, networks to attach stories here.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.280
 We've done this forever, stands or whatever.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.760
 I get it, I understand, but doing every IO,

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.360
 which databases are incredibly chatty.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.720
 And it's not just your queries.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.160
 The databases are doing other things

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.320
 like checkpointing and check sums and replication

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.440
 and managing a buffer pool.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.800
 Like they're doing so much reading and writing to disk

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.400
 on your behalf to maintain all of the other things

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.400
 that databases have to maintain.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.600
 They're incredibly chatty.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.200
 And to do all of that over the network

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.840
 is just unbelievably costly.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.240
 And you see this in the graphs.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.120
 And you're not just like just going over a network.

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.000
 You're going to three machines for redundancy.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.360
 You're going through a type of load balancer.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.920
 If you hit one node that's doing some kind of rebalancing

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.400
 or traffic shaping, that's gonna slow you down.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.000
 We've seen outages and we're gonna do a blog post

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.880
 about the kind of true reliability of EBS.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.280
 We've seen outages where Amazon were like,

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.000
 "Oh yeah, maybe that was just like a blip."

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.160
 And we were, it was more than a blip

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.080
 across multiple accounts.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.320
 We deployed so many EBS volumes,

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.960
 like such a massive amount that we saw,

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.520
 we noticed they had like a top of rack switch issue

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.920
 for one of the EBS racks.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.560
 We saw it across multiple accounts.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.800
 They first of all, to one customer,

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.920
 they denied it was a problem.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.640
 And then we were like, "Well,

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.480
 "three other customers as well saw the exact same thing."

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.320
 So you clearly had like a service issue

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.560
 and they're like, "Oh yeah, you're right."

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.480
 Like we did actually.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.960
 And all of those things can just happen.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.800
 And now you think about it,

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.240
 to put that in between just getting a page of data

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.760
 off of your disk, it's mad.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.680
 It's actually great, like the cloud is just,

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.560
 if that's the only cloud approach, luckily it's not,

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.400
 then it's fundamentally wrong for databases.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.720
 Like fundamentally they're not gonna work.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.240
 - Yeah, it's funny you mentioned the,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.760
 when you have visibility and just stuff,

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.080
 you do pick up on these things.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.560
 We had a similar case where,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.320
 just 'cause we see a lot of AWS customers as well.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:49.800
 We saw that a subset of our customers had problems with,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.040
 they were running this bug with Lambda.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.840
 Like they were both Lambda and like,

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.680
 the response wouldn't be correct.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.240
 But it wasn't just one region.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.160
 It was like a subset within the region.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.000
 And it was really hard to track down.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 'Cause we're like, "What is going on?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.320
 "Like we can't replicate this."

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.520
 And it turned out they had like rolled something out

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.760
 to just one, like a physical building

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.600
 before the physical partition before the rest of the region.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.160
 And like we found the bug before,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.240
 like they realized it.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.080
 - That's cool.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.920
 - So it's funny you pick up on some of these things.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.040
 And prior to that, we also found out like a Lambda function

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.160
 feature just was not working at all, like globally.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.680
 And you think someone like AWS,

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.600
 like literally a million customers,

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.840
 you would never be the first one to front to an issue,

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.520
 but yeah, there are cases where-

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.360
 - It happens.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.760
 - Where that happens, yeah.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.160
 - Well, they're now a big engineering org.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.400
 Like they've built awesome stuff,

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.400
 but when you have 400 services, it's like really hard.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.320
 It's really, really, really, really hard.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.920
 Yeah, of course, it's like innovators dilemma,

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.840
 purely very simple.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.360
 Like how do you just address all these things at once?

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.240
 It's not easy, it's really, really not easy.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.200
 But luckily we're now in this amazing era

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:03.080
 of lots of startups inside that ecosystem,

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.040
 having a fairly constrained place to be.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.960
 It was like a debate on Twitter about this last night,

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.240
 people were talking about the difference

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.600
 being that we're inside Amazon with this tech,

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.720
 because you could go and get, like you said,

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.920
 you can just go and get these machines

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.400
 from like Equinex or whoever and build on them,

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.240
 but that's not the point.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.520
 You have to be next to Lambda,

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.480
 you have to be next to S3,

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.640
 where everyone's traffic is.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.240
 We just don't see, you can't run serious services

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.040
 outside of Amazon, it just doesn't work.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.080
 And then Google second and, you know,

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.360
 there's just, everyone is there

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.520
 and they're using everything else.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:43.520
 If you're not inside, if you're like not a peer to VPC away,

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.360
 and it's just way, way too slow.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.760
 Way, way, way, way, way too slow.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.400
 Yeah, there's something I was gonna bring up next,

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.400
 'cause a lot of, so there's like,

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.200
 the pure technical side of what you guys built,

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.200
 but there's also a bunch of constraints

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.080
 that aren't like really technical constraints,

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.280
 it's just the realities of constraining yourself

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.560
 to do this in Amazon.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.600
 'Cause obviously you can go,

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.080
 that some companies that have done this,

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.960
 buy hardware somewhere else.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.520
 It's probably a lot cheaper,

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.120
 so like all your economics are probably different.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.240
 And you can like build something very performant

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.360
 outside of Amazon, but to do it in Amazon is the trick.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.160
 And it's funny 'cause it's not like a real technical,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.280
 some of them are technical limitations,

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.400
 but a lot of them are just working within what's possible

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.400
 with what AWS offers.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.680
 Just like, you know, you can't just say,

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.240
 "I wanna server with this size disk."

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.920
 There's like limits on how much to this size can be,

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.080
 like how is that core, like to CPU size, memory size.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.520
 So that probably impacts,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.840
 product decisions are in your end.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.480
 So it's funny 'cause to me,

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.360
 this is like, it's obviously the case.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.680
 Like you have to do that

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.880
 because your customers workloads are in AWS.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.880
 So you have to be in AWS.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.240
 That's just non-negotiable.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.760
 Very easy to build a great product outside of that.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.480
 So I think a lot of people show off great products

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.560
 that are not in AWS.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.840
 I don't find that super impressive

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.680
 'cause like, that's not the hard part.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.800
 Like you can't actually build a big business that way.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.760
 At the same time, I'm just like, man,

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.760
 this is a crazy, it's like way too sticky for AWS.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.760
 I'm like, how do you ever compete in certain categories

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.200
 with them when like, you just have to be in there, you know?

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.840
 Like, it's just like a ridiculous monopoly, I feel like.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.520
 - Yeah, it's like waking up and saying,

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.080
 gonna do a telecom provider or something, right?

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.800
 Like it's just, it's so difficult.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.960
 It's a giant operations game now.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.080
 And there's like clear winners.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.840
 And all the other ones that are now taking parts

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.600
 of Amazon's customer base are similarly just massive businesses

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.400
 that can light money on fire for a long, long period of time

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.720
 to go and grind out doing it.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.560
 - Yeah, it's really hard.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.640
 I mean, until you've spent significant amounts of time

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.120
 using Amazon's VPC reachability analyzer,

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.320
 you're not there yet.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.280
 You've like, once you're in that hell,

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.920
 you know you're like trying to build things of significance.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.400
 And yeah, like, you're just completely right.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.880
 It has to be inside where those workloads are.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880
 And the constraints are crazy.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.360
 Yeah, I mean, it's all of these little things,

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.760
 all of the little networking bits.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.800
 The fact that one physical availability zone

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.480
 is not the same for everyone's account.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.320
 People don't realize that, you know?

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.120
 And so you end up getting strung up

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.680
 and stuck in all of these different places.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.440
 It's complicated, it's extremely, extremely complicated.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.320
 - Yeah, just funny, like when you're working on this stuff,

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.680
 you just see underneath the abstraction where like,

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.360
 it just feels like, for most people, it feels like,

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.600
 it was just like one big computer

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.520
 that you just put stuff on.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.480
 But then when you work on this stuff more directly,

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.880
 it just, that fades away and you're back to buildings

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.320
 and like physical racks and all those problems.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.000
 - We give them hell, obviously, like everyone does.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.080
 They're kind of our competition,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.640
 but they're also our partners.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.880
 And they are amazing with us in terms of their openness.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.480
 You know, like when we get on a call with the engineering team,

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.200
 they are customer obsessed, they truly are.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.240
 You've seen this too, right?

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.200
 Like, their engineers are curious.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.480
 They will get on and they love that you find these problems.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.520
 And you know, we're having fun with the EC2 team

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:09.040
 'cause now they're like, yes, more giant databases

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.840
 to run on our stuff directly.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.440
 That's cool, you know, it's really fun.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.920
 But yeah, like you actually said,

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.240
 like you know, the long tail of shipping metal was,

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.240
 okay, do the really hard bit, which is

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.480
 how do you run petabytes of data reliably

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.000
 without losing data on machines

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.440
 that can just explode and disappear?

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.840
 The long tail is making that really reliable

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.800
 and all of a rough edge is gone.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.920
 So for example, you know, EBS, the great thing about EBS

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.440
 is you can take like a Pico node, like a quarter of a V CPU

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.400
 and attach an 80 terabyte volume to it.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.960
 You couldn't do anything obviously with it,

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.760
 but it's that flexible.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.800
 That's one amazing thing about it.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.720
 We don't need that for LTP, but you know,

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.240
 we need people to upsize, right?

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.600
 People actually have to like say

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.840
 they want to make their machines bigger.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.120
 So we have stuff that nags you.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.520
 You are 80% of your storage.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.960
 And you can just like, we'll make it so you can just turn

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.240
 this on and it will scale automatically.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.880
 But not everyone wants that, right?

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.000
 People don't, auto scaling is, that's another giant myth,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.440
 but you know that we could go hours into the auto scale.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.720
 It's works for certain things.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.360
 For other things, it's an absolute disaster.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.760
 And most people when you actually ask them

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.240
 what they're asking for, it's not,

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.080
 it's not really how auto scaling works

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:19.920
 or is implemented.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.240
 But anyway, so we have to, and there's things like,

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.440
 okay, you're going to do a schema change.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.800
 Well, if you actually apply this schema change,

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.920
 it's going to fill up that box.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.240
 So we have to kind of warn you

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.880
 that you need to upgrade before you go and do it.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.320
 It's all those kind of just little UX pieces

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.800
 that make it approachable and usable

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.560
 that takes the time in terms of building

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.560
 these kind of products out.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.320
 And yeah, you're dealing with weird.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.960
 There's this kind of, when you look at these nodes,

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.440
 the SKUs are really all over the place.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.880
 You wonder like, which customer did you add

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.440
 this custom machine type for?

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.440
 It's like, for $10 more, we can have double the memory.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.440
 You know, things like this.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.320
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, it's like,

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.360
 it's so much of the work is just not the programming part.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.160
 It's like just looking at the numbers

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.840
 and like understanding all the economics of this stuff.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.240
 And the way that they correlate, like they attach,

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.880
 'cause you're using instant storage,

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.280
 but you can't say, I want 500 gigs instant storage.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.520
 You pick an instance that has some kind of CPU

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.720
 and RAM combination and it comes with

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.880
 some fixed amount of storage.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.360
 And like, to me, those numbers are just so random.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.400
 It's like, well, I want a lot of storage,

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.640
 but I don't need like 64 cores, so.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.480
 - Yes.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.880
 - Yeah, that's just a funny problem.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.720
 - It is funny.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.560
 And so, yeah, those are the kind of things

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.640
 where we've had to kind of figure it out

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.920
 and kind of work out the SKU,

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.560
 like just the word SKU is like a meme here now,

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.360
 because the kind of just dealing

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.920
 with all of these various things.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.640
 We also had a really fun issue with these nodes,

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.040
 which was they fail too, and they have issues,

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.240
 and they can come up with unmounted disks.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.240
 And so we had an issue where they were just coming up

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.680
 and not being fit to serve.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.560
 So we've had to build something

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.400
 where Amazon will give us a machine that's not good.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.040
 And what we would do is like, we'd throw it back.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.160
 We'd just go, no, get us another one.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.960
 We get the same machine back sometimes.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.600
 It's like, oh, that's still broken.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.040
 So now we've got this logic where,

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.040
 and we've seen it chain like two or three in a row.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.360
 If you give us one that doesn't work,

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.520
 we hold it until we get given another one.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.360
 - Oh, I see.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.440
 - So we have this kind of on this pooling logic

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.360
 where we will just keep the nodes

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.200
 until we have no more node demand,

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.760
 and then we'll let Amazon have all the bad ones back

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.360
 to give to everyone else.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.200
 And you're just like finding this stuff out

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.200
 while running it live.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.640
 And with the amount of machines we've deployed,

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.640
 that one in a million failures happen a lot,

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.000
 and you get to find all these little edge cases

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.920
 and some weirdnesses, and people don't build with you.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.000
 Like the thing I love about this job

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.520
 is you have to build with the paranoia

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.000
 assuming the server will arrive

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.200
 with no disks available to you.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.200
 You just have to like do all this loopy stuff.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.040
 And it's really fun.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.360
 It's actually just like really interesting

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.600
 to kind of how to engineer at the extreme edge

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.520
 with those kind of needs for paranoia.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.000
 It's cool, it's really cool.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.360
 - Yeah, it's really fascinating to me

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.400
 'cause I know like where my skill set is,

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.160
 delivering reliable services is just not just aligned

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.080
 with where like my abilities are.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.160
 Like I just don't have a discipline for that.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.440
 I'm just way too, I don't know.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.040
 It just hasn't been my trajectory.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.160
 So hearing this stuff is interesting.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.640
 And to me, I'm just like, how do you even go about this?

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.480
 Like you build something and you think it works,

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.880
 but how do you know that like some random undiscovered

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.840
 thing isn't gonna happen, you know, a month from now?

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.520
 - Yeah, and you have to decide on an architecture

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.800
 that you believe in, and then very simple ways to fail

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.400
 that don't rely on people.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.360
 And by the way, a lot of database companies,

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.240
 they don't have the skill set of running services.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.440
 They can do the database engine stuff,

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.480
 which is incredibly hard and takes like

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.760
 a certain type of cracked person.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.760
 You need the other type of cracked person,

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:04.760
 which can run huge services at scale.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.160
 Most companies don't have the two.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.320
 That's the one thing that's very different

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.680
 about plant scales, we have both.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.880
 We have people that run mega websites

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.000
 and the deep kind of database core fundamentals of,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.440
 you know, passes and query planners

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.520
 and all the storage engines and all that stuff.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.760
 One philosophy that we have,

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.600
 which I think is kind of really amazing,

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.720
 is because of a shared nothing architecture.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.000
 We're gonna talk about shared nothing a lot more

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.640
 in the future because it's an architecture

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.120
 that people don't really understand.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.600
 It doesn't come up much and it's really truly the ideal

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.080
 and state for building these kind of systems at scale.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.400
 But essentially, you know, you can't build a reliable service

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.640
 unless it doesn't rely humans to wake up

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.440
 because you pay someone at 2 a.m. in the morning,

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.720
 it's minimum of 15 minutes.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.800
 Well, that's your SLA, just explode it anyway, right?

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.520
 You know, it's gone.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.120
 And even if they do have to intervene,

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.280
 what options can you really give them

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.960
 when they have to come up to speed and figure out?

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.720
 So essentially at plant scale,

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.080
 all of our architecture is designed

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.000
 to kind of just have one solution to everything,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.360
 just kill notes, kill the timing of that shard,

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.560
 just kill it, just get rid of it.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.720
 Like, it's the 99.9% fix for everything of like,

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.120
 why cat or not pets or whatever?

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.760
 Like, why, it's not kind of trying to understand

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.680
 this node's feelings, just shoot it,

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.120
 never think about it again.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:18.960
 And that's literally it.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.360
 Like, and Vitez just has handled failure this way,

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.600
 hundreds of millions of times.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.440
 It just knows, okay, that node is gone.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.480
 How do I get the cluster back online and quickly,

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.600
 quickly into a kind of healthy state?

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.800
 It just runs that same, like, well worn code path

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.880
 to go and do that.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:42.080
 And it makes building things reliably a lot easier.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.600
 It's hard to do that, but it's,

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.440
 with a mental model is one thing,

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.600
 get, like, kill the failing node.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.560
 And every, we've never, touch word,

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.480
 we've never caused a global outage for any customer.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.560
 The worst you can have is like,

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.080
 a minute of a shard being unavailable,

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.600
 which is partial failure, it's fine.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.560
 No one, the other reason people build unreliable services

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.160
 is 'cause they strive for, like, perfect records, no bugs.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.000
 Like, that's crazy.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 Like, you have to embrace failure,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.600
 'cause it will definitely happen.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.480
 But yeah, the resolve is always just kind of,

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.800
 you murder the node and bring it back

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.440
 and it becomes partial and it makes the mental model

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.800
 so much easier.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.240
 And it goes back to, again,

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.160
 separating storage and compute.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.080
 Because of the shared nothing architecture,

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.440
 our nodes have their own truly, like,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.080
 I guess full stack if you think about it.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.560
 They have their own disk,

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.040
 they have their own memory, own CPU, own copy of the data,

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.680
 replicated from elsewhere.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.560
 They share nothing with the others.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.600
 These kind of shared storage layer compute stuff,

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.080
 like Aurora and whatever, they share way more.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.360
 So, like, a single outage,

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.600
 any one of those layers of the stack

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.920
 is a full and total...

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.680
 - That's everything. - Yeah, exactly.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.520
 - Yeah.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.440
 It's funny how good that solution of just restarting,

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.040
 like killing and restarting is.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.560
 I was mentioned on Twitter a couple of weeks ago,

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:05.320
 I've been moving a workload from Lambda to a container.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.160
 And I'm just discovering, like,

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.080
 so many bugs that I just never bothered handling

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.560
 'cause my, with Lambda, it's effectively rebooting,

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.880
 like every 15 minutes or so.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.640
 And now that I have this long-running service,

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.480
 I'm just like, oh, great.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.840
 I like didn't dispose of these things

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.240
 in like a hundred different places

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.520
 and I gotta go, go chase it down.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.120
 And yeah, on one hand,

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.080
 I probably should have just had better discipline about it.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.640
 I mean, any discipline I had around it is just deteriorated

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.960
 ever since I moved to doing stuff on Lambda.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.080
 But, like, you know, it works.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.480
 Like, it works really effectively.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.320
 - Who cares?

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.160
 It works.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.000
 GitHub and so many other companies back in the other days,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.400
 we used to, over Christmas,

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.440
 we would always have some outage due to a memory leak

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.440
 because we'd stopped deploying the website.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.520
 And so, the conversions of the app were just living

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.880
 for like weeks longer and we're just,

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.120
 there was memory leaks everywhere.

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.480
 Like, just frequent deploys kind of covers up

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.480
 some of these things.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.320
 It's fine.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.440
 Like, who gives a shit?

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.280
 Like, it's gonna fail.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.640
 It's like definitely gonna fail.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.560
 Like, like, embrace that.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.720
 Just know it will and do the right thing.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.160
 I was gonna talk about this, you know,

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.280
 blog post about magic 'cause I think we all,

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.320
 we all wanna build things that are kind of fun and delightful

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.560
 and everyone likes their shiny web pages and whatever.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.000
 But, at the end of the day, you know,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.880
 the magical experiences are that, you know,

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.800
 getting home to your family safely at Christmas, right?

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.640
 On an aeroplane.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.200
 And it's more like building an airline

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.080
 than it is anything else.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.960
 You know, all day long, while we're talking,

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.360
 just up and down, up and down, seven, three, sevens,

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.080
 or whatever, going up into the air, coming down,

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.000
 they can be repaired at any airport on earth

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.840
 by a crew of people on a shift that are just managed,

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.400
 like through engineering firms or whatever,

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.120
 they fail in the most predictable ways.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.520
 The most regular failing parts are cashed

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.360
 at every airport in the country.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.640
 Like, how many times do you just get that kind of half an hour,

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.080
 20-minute delay while they fix something up

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.240
 and just get you going?

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.520
 And you're not unsettling, you're safe,

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.920
 you're gonna be okay.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.320
 Like, those planes don't even turn off.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.760
 Like, a seven, three, seven will land

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.520
 and we'll just like, sit there on, go back in the air.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.280
 They'll do 10 flights a day, it's just so reliable.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.160
 People need to think of themselves as building that

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.440
 and how that works, like how the food gets on,

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.360
 how the food comes up.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.320
 Like, that is the real process of building this stuff.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.120
 Not, and it's just hope it doesn't fail

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.520
 and make it really pretty, you know?

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.240
 - It's just not gonna cut it.

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.080
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.960
 I think a lot of parts in life,

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.680
 it's making things invisible is the value

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.880
 and it's so hard just to have something

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.600
 that's there that people aren't thinking about.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.240
 Whether it's tech or like, just anything in society in general,

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.000
 I feel like people really accomplish something

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.720
 when they've solved a problem, totally invisibly,

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.080
 and knowing everything's about it.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.800
 - It's beautiful, it's really beautiful.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.480
 - So, moving away from the technical stuff,

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.640
 so it's been a year, I think you said,

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.440
 since you guys look like a big shift a year ago

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.440
 from being, maybe you just wanna describe it yourself.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.840
 - Around a year ago, I think at the anniversary was last week,

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.440
 we let go of a big chunk of the company

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.560
 and doubled down on being pretty much purely

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.000
 an engineering company.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.840
 It was a reaction to multiple things.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.960
 We were kind of in, we were playing in multiple ends

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.720
 of the database market and we felt this like real strong pull

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.720
 at the top end of the database market, and the bottom end

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:27.240
 was just a painful mess basically of cloud spend

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.880
 and people that don't have real problems.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.480
 And the thing about the tech discourse

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.040
 of how can you use Twitter is you've quickly realized,

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.360
 I know you know this, which is,

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.920
 most people don't have real problems,

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.800
 like that's just truthfully like,

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.080
 sure fucking per SQLite on server,

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.720
 like who cares, like your two users won't notice,

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:50.560
 like it just doesn't matter,

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.840
 like you got argue with people about postgres or whatever,

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.520
 and you just realize they just don't,

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.200
 if they just don't see the world the way you see the world,

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.160
 right, like they just, whatever they choose,

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.960
 it's gonna work and it has and it's their lived experience

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.160
 and they feel great about it and they don't pick technologies

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.720
 for the traits that we pick technologies,

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.440
 and that's fine, it's completely, there's no hate there.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.320
 But when you're trying to kind of be in that area

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.000
 of the market and you're spending so much money

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.920
 on having like a free tier that will just not convert,

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.280
 you have to have marketing people

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.160
 that do that kind of media that works for it.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.840
 And it's just expensive and it's not optimized.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.900
 And you know, we saw a path to being a profitable company,

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.520
 which one is just incredibly powerful,

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.040
 like we threw this huge party at the office

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.160
 and you know, we have a lovely office now

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.160
 and we, you know, pay the mortgages of all of our staff

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.880
 and it's like our money, it just goes into the bank.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.680
 We're not just, you know, hype round, VC hype rounds,

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.920
 hopes and dreams, just spraying money up the wall

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.560
 while we just, every customer costs,

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.800
 like if a customer costs you more money,

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.400
 you're just reducing your burn constantly

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.040
 and we're now the opposite.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.520
 If you write, if you're a $39 a month customer with us,

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.240
 you get like, and you have a problem,

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.440
 you get a thoughtful reply from our amazing support team

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.560
 because you are a customer.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.640
 We make money from you, it's amazing.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.480
 We had an opportunity to do that, so we did it.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.680
 It was really painful, you know,

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.720
 I definitely would have done things slightly differently,

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.880
 but in the long run, it was an incredibly powerful change

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.400
 for the company because it focused us

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.920
 and gave us the autonomy to do things.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.320
 Like this launch, the way we did it,

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.600
 we just, if you were, you know, a VC backed company

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.840
 with 18 months of runway, you would just go to reinvent

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.240
 with your beta product just so you had to build pipe,

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.160
 just more pipeline, more pipeline.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.160
 Like you have to just go and ape it out there

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.520
 and shout about it out of desperation

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.360
 because you don't have long enough left.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.600
 We were like, oh, wow, yeah, actually just launching it

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.840
 with some of the major biggest tech brands around,

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.520
 already running on it, on their blogs.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.880
 That's an obviously better launch.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.880
 Well, we're not going out of business,

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.520
 so we can just do that.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.280
 Do you realize like when your daily decisions are made

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.160
 from a place of strength and not fear,

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.280
 how that compounds, like it just,

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.000
 we make decisions every single day

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.400
 that you can only make when you're profitable.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.600
 Like, and so, although, again,

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.840
 I miss the people that aren't here,

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.960
 like there's some amazing people

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.280
 that don't work a plant scale anymore.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.640
 It was like the best thing we could do

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.400
 and it gave us this year to go and build metal

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.720
 and we've done it and it's, you know,

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.320
 it's already just changing the company, like immediately.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.920
 It was the right thing to do.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.880
 And it was just a very different thing

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.920
 than we are used to in tech.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.040
 And when you're building a deep infrastructure startup,

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.920
 you just need time, like it's just time.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.200
 You just, like, you know, we've got a customer,

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.160
 I think there's a couple of million a year, I think, now.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.960
 I first showed them the product in beta,

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.400
 like it was barely real.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.680
 And they're like, "Cool, this is great."

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.680
 Four years later, they eventually became a customer.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.000
 (laughing)

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.800
 They're just not gonna...

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.640
 - Yeah.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.400
 - No one, there's no alpha in just like,

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.220
 "Yeah, we just yeeted our data over to a startup

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.480
 "and now the business is finished."

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.840
 But like, you know, like, it's like,

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.520
 they had cool features, you know,

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.840
 the website was shiny, just doesn't work.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.720
 Like, our sales stance is so funny.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.920
 You know, we're working with it at the moment.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.960
 It's really a very large public company, very famous.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.560
 And I was talking to the CTO.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.160
 And it was, you know, me and one of our sales engineers,

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.160
 and he was like, "Google sent 18 people

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.400
 "to try and sell a spanner and you're here on your own."

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.160
 And I said, "Well, I mean, let's be honest, like you,"

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.080
 and then I said, "The name of the company,

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.200
 "is anything other than like a technical proof of concept

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.480
 "where we prove to you we can do this,

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.160
 "I'm just gonna convince you, like, do you need slides

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.160
 "and an interpretive dance done in front of you?

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.720
 "Like, you just need to know we can do it

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.080
 "and you have your own requirements,

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.440
 "unless you see it for yourself, you're not gonna buy it."

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.560
 That's us now, we fully embrace that, which is,

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.320
 look at the website, it's just,

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.760
 we just tell you what we do.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.920
 We don't want to hype it up, it's like,

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.400
 if you have problems that fit our solution

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.560
 and you're serious about those,

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.760
 you just will read it and try it and it will work.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.360
 We kind of opted out of all that other crazy stuff.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.080
 - Yeah, that's super interesting.

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.400
 I mean, I have a bunch of things to ask you there,

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.400
 but on that last thing, do you ever,

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.880
 and maybe this happens less now,

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.240
 but the thing you mentioned was,

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.640
 you guys did things differently.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.280
 'Cause yeah, there's a center playbook, right,

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.280
 with certain things, right?

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.520
 Like you said, a bunch of companies

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.120
 building products for developers do this standard playbook

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:31.120
 of like investing a ton of marketing on like the lower end

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.800
 and all these orgs look exactly the same,

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.200
 they're all producing the exact same stuff.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.880
 But then also on the enterprise side,

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.080
 the way you build organizations to sell enterprises,

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.760
 also like a standard playbook there,

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.880
 did you have people telling you to like,

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.800
 are pushing to like follow those standard things?

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.560
 And like, what does that look like?

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.560
 And like, is it annoying?

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.520
 - Yeah, I mean, you do get it.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.960
 People do question it, they wander,

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.240
 and I just like don't care what anyone else says.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.160
 At the end of the day, I spend my life on this thing, right?

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.160
 I'm only gonna do it my way.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.000
 That's it.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.720
 Like at the end of the day, if we fail,

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.600
 the person like turning the lights off

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.960
 at the office for the last time is me.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.520
 And so I'm only gonna do it the way that makes sense to me.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.640
 And I'm like an odd, weird person.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.840
 I figured that out right now, like I'm just very weird.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.040
 I mean, I just have my things I wanna do

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.360
 and they either work or they don't,

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.720
 but I can't be anyone but me.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.320
 And I can't, I'm not gonna get like a 42 long blazer

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.600
 and go and kind of for the briefcase and do like--

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.680
 - Well, they tell you to hire someone that does that, right?

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.600
 That's kind of what the standard playbook is.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.400
 Like, oh, you gotta hire this guy.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.040
 He was, you know, CRO at this company.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.560
 And you know, he took them from XX.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.000
 You have to hire him, put him on your team.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.160
 And like, so he can run that same playbook again.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.520
 And that's usually how I see it.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:54.440
 It's like the investors or whatever will suggest to hire

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.160
 and that kind of fundamentally changes

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.080
 what the company is.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.160
 And that's why they kind of all end up looking kind of the same.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.000
 - Yeah.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.520
 And very few of those people have ever sold databases

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.240
 or really tough technical, deep technical stuff.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.640
 There's some types of product

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.160
 where only the go-to-market function is multiple work.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.000
 - Right.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:12.840
 - Yeah.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.160
 - The technical, like the technical standard

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.440
 can be achieved for those types of products very quickly.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.360
 Why is Ramp bigger than any of the others that started?

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.200
 Like, why?

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.240
 They just, they're a credit card issuer, right?

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.680
 Like they, you know, why?

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.440
 It's so funny you bring up Ramp

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.040
 because I have a friend that just gets free lunches

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.160
 from them all the time and just never,

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.800
 'cause they're just always hitting them up.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.920
 Like every month they're like, let me take you out the lunch,

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.600
 let me take you out the lunch, you know?

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.480
 He just does it and he just never tends to be a customer.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.120
 - But they're a go-to-market machine.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.920
 Like look at amazing companies like Ripley, right?

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.440
 Which is like, they have some like hard tech problems now

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.440
 because they're scaling.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.280
 But at the very beginning,

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.480
 it was just a phenomenal brute force product team

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.720
 that would just like understand everything a customer wants,

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.640
 build it, ship it, make it happen.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.080
 You need, you would need these types of people

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.320
 to build those types of companies.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.160
 - Yeah.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.000
 - Databases just like don't work that way.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.520
 They just, they can't work that way.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.800
 Like our core audience like backend engineers

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:11.080
 with hard problems, it just doesn't work.

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.240
 And you know, we will build out the sales

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.400
 and we will build these things out.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.200
 And we have to build, like Mongo has one

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.040
 of the best sales team ever built in tech.

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.080
 Like legendary, they wrote the book.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.200
 They still needed to do that

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.400
 to build a big database business.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:27.400
 You have to, but the marketing paradigms shift over time

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.880
 and what worked 10 years, like it's always that classic

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.160
 of like, yeah, like this person's there.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.480
 You know, and they were at Twilio

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.320
 and they did this thing.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.640
 Twilio nailed developer marketing for that generation.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.880
 The ask your developer billboard is legendary.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.320
 They crushed it.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.840
 We've moved on, we've gone past it.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.080
 Like we're elsewhere now.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:46.920
 - Yeah.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.520
 - And I think now it's going to go back

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.480
 to simplicity and value like, and we're seeing that.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.080
 Right now, I love AI.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.440
 I'm not cynical about AI at all.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.760
 I love it, but you know, there's a lot of AI

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.760
 slop content being made and it's just like rubbish.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.360
 So we're now doing a spending a month per blog post

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.440
 and we're going one going out while we're talking right now.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.040
 Like high quality, really good stuff.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.000
 It's what it takes now to cut above.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.760
 Like you've seen, you've been to reinvented.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.120
 You've seen the hundreds of millions of dollars

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.240
 of marketing spend just being screeched to each other.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.560
 You just have to do something to cut through.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.520
 And that's why we do it our way.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.080
 And if you have taste, it is such a moat.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:28.720
 Like our website started in a Google doc.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:33.080
 We just designed it in a Google doc with words.

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.800
 Holly did a thread about this last week talking all about it.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.160
 And people, some people were like,

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.560
 my God, this is genius when we shipped it.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.120
 Other people were just so confused.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.520
 They were like, this company's gone nuts.

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.680
 They're going to go crazy.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.840
 I don't know why when I said we were going to do this,

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.240
 everyone at the company was like, yeah, let's do that.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.240
 That seems like a good idea.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.080
 I don't know why.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.080
 That's just taste.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.280
 When you saw it, you were like, oh, I love this.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.600
 I don't know why you love this.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.440
 I don't know.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.280
 It's like the first thing I've thought of.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.400
 I don't understand why I like it and other people do.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.320
 And some people hate it.

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.480
 I just don't get it.

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.120
 But if you do have that, no.

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.440
 And we've had it with other things,

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.880
 like the other database branching,

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.320
 we invented that, all of these different things.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.520
 If you have that, use it.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.680
 Don't-- you just see so many companies go wrong

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.040
 by having all of this taste, this initial thing that

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.360
 made them then, them.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.040
 And they're like, OK, so we've got this unique thing that's

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:24.520
 growing.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.720
 We've got this advantage, this completely unique viewpoint

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.160
 on the world.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.160
 So let's go and do what?

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.960
 Every other company does now.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.280
 Let's just throw all that away.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.520
 And VCs are some of the worst for this.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.840
 They're like, are we back contrarians?

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:43.520
 And we want the-- and then my friends are the companies.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.720
 They'll phone me and be like, yes,

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.640
 my board is telling us like, it's now enterprise sales.

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.120
 Go to market demand, Jen.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.240
 And way too early.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.200
 And it's just like pattern matching and running the playbook.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.040
 It just--

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:54.880
 Yeah.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.560
 No great company was built that way.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.960
 Yeah, it's the thing you talk about where

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.720
 there's a time where things work and it doesn't work anymore.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.280
 I mean, that's like marketing for sure.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.880
 But across business in general, I think people

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.720
 look at great companies and they try to copy the surface

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.480
 thing there.

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.880
 But the thing that people forget is,

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.640
 when those companies were founded,

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.880
 they didn't look like anything like the great companies

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.520
 of their time.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.760
 Like they did the office.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.920
 So if you're doing that today, innately,

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.680
 you're not doing what they did.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.280
 And the marketing thing is funny because the only

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.760
 that matters in marketing is that people

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.960
 want to hear what you're saying.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:33.680
 And it's so much like fashion in that some approach to that

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.040
 will be novel for a while.

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.760
 But it so quickly becomes like a counter signal almost,

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.040
 like the whole--

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.200
 I mean, talking about landing pages,

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.280
 like linear did their crazy landing page.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.480
 And for a while, that was like really great.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.920
 But now when I see one of those,

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.040
 I get like a negative reaction.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.400
 Because somewhere in the back of my head,

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:55.960
 I'm just like, I know they hired some standard design agency.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.480
 They threw them 200k and they didn't think at all.

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.000
 And we're just like, I want a clone of this.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.280
 And without me constantly thinking that stuff,

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.600
 I just equate it with low quality.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.600
 So yeah, it's exactly like fashion.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.280
 And it's not irrational, like the whole point is novelty

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.080
 and like, you know, standing out.

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:16.320
 And especially-- and even at your guys' stage,

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.000
 like, you've got to figure out how to make your dollars go

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.960
 further than they should if you are buying attention

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:27.560
 for 100k, a company with 10x, the money is you--

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:28.800
 we'll just do that at 10x.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.960
 So yeah, this is the thing with marketing

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.480
 where I'm like, I don't know why people don't see that.

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.720
 And the flip side is, it's actually really fun

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.080
 when you set the constraint of, we need to do stuff

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.200
 that nobody else has done before.

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.760
 Like, we need to do things that are like so different

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.600
 from everybody else.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.000
 We need to do things where when people see it,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.080
 they're going to like, grab it and like,

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.640
 share it with their friends at work, right?

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.080
 If you set that constraint, it's really hard.

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.680
 Because like, you know, 99% ideas don't pass that bar.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.160
 But it's so fun because that's like,

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.760
 it's like your creative size that I feel like most people

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.400
 should love.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.480
 And it's so exciting when you like stumble on something

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.600
 and you're hyped to get it out.

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.560
 It's kind of scary as well because you have to just,

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.880
 you spend half the time being, you know, it's so funny.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.320
 You're like, why is no one else doing,

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.640
 is this so, am I just so, am I like,

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.520
 just not getting this, you know, and then you do it.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.880
 And then, you know, it works.

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.760
 You're like, oh, maybe I should try another thing.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.360
 You know, just like, we always joke,

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.160
 we're a tiny marketing team, but we always joke,

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.160
 like the biggest challenge is that we'll try anything.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.240
 I'll try anything once.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.840
 I just like, I'll just do anything.

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:35.400
 So that's more open ended and scary than anything.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.120
 'Cause, you know, you just have to go and do that now.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.440
 Like what can, like what's the highest agency thing

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.720
 you can go and do and just do it?

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.720
 Don't pattern match.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.200
 Don't listen, don't care.

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.560
 We're the only people not building a separated storage

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.680
 computer architecture.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:51.080
 Like we're the only people not building it for years.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:55.160
 And the VCs would just go, oh, I mean, snowflake,

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.760
 it worked for snowflake, you know.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.200
 And they're just like pattern matching and I'm just like,

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.400
 databases don't work that way.

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.000
 And they just look at you like, oh, yeah,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.800
 you're one of those, you're just the only one.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.760
 (laughing)

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.120
 And then you do this stuff.

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.920
 And but we spent four years being told, like, you know,

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.760
 there's another well known storage,

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.240
 separated storage computer database company.

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:17.000
 And they kind of came onto the market with like,

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.960
 loads of hype and you know, someone messaged me.

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.240
 I was like, oh, you know, what, you know,

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:22.080
 what you think about this?

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:26.040
 And I said, you could give me a magic wand right now

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.200
 and to wave that would immediately instantly switch

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.040
 plants scale to that architecture right now.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.720
 And I would throw it in the trash.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:33.880
 I would never do this.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.720
 I would never.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.680
 And they look at you like, wow, that just,

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.560
 you just sound better.

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:40.400
 And they're like, I'm sure I did to them.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.200
 But like, where are we now?

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.440
 You know, like you just like, you just have to,

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:47.520
 you just have to feel insane for years and years

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.000
 and years on end and just prove it out.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.760
 I also think, by the way, when it comes to this marketing

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.760
 stuff, generationally, we're in a different world.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.840
 Thanks to kind of the rails community.

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.320
 Thanks to the node community.

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.280
 You know, I'm old now.

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.360
 I'm 38 years old.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.440
 When I was at GitHub, I was 32.

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.800
 I had a hundred million dollar budget

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.040
 that we had for data centers and software and whatever.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.480
 I grew up in the Ruby world.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.720
 Like the tools I used were beautiful and good, right?

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.400
 Like, you know, the 2013 kind of tech era

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.720
 when I was an engineer, you were using Heroku.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.800
 You were using rails.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:22.840
 You were using all of these really well-crafted GitHub.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.600
 I mean, the wand, right?

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.800
 Like these well-crafted, beautiful tools.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.320
 Like what did GitHub do different to source for?

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.840
 I mean, nothing.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:33.680
 Like, except be usable and resonate to a generation.

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.360
 All those people who grew up on that software

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.600
 are now VPs at big companies

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.680
 and don't want to buy crappy, shitty software

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.280
 and don't care about the hardware.

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.120
 Yeah, exactly.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.440
 Like, they just don't care.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.280
 It means nothing to them.

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.800
 It just, it's just like, the sad thing about AI

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.040
 and I love AI and like an O1 Pro subscriber.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.200
 I love that thing, like, you know, it's amazing.

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.360
 The thing that ruins AI every time is the gap

00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.720
 between the hype and the reality

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.440
 because the reality is good.

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:02.200
 The reality is actually amazing.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.360
 Paired with the hype, it's ruined.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.240
 I can't watch movies.

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.920
 I just don't watch movies.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.040
 People laugh at a joke at me all the time.

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.800
 I saw The Matrix the first time I ever lost here.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.040
 I thought it was terrible.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.200
 I don't know what anyone was like.

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:16.720
 Anyway, but like, I can't because the hype kills it for me.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.720
 Like it just, you just, it's everywhere.

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.760
 And then it just cannot possibly be as good

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.160
 as everyone is saying and it ruins it.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:27.120
 And the times where I kind of just nakedly use AI

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.200
 for the things it's good at,

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.320
 it's just unbelievably magical.

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.440
 The day I wake up wishing that my Siri

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.200
 would like rearrange my life and do everything for me,

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.640
 I'm very disappointed.

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:38.480
 Yeah.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.960
 And I think we're at the beginning

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:44.440
 and I hope PlanetScale kind of shows

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.560
 that we're putting skin in the game

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.320
 is that I think we're in the post-hype era.

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.000
 I think everyone's dopamine receptors

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.440
 have been worn down to just a nub.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.760
 And I just think someone wants something that's good.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.760
 And there's a pull request of 64 versions

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.760
 of my launch post for Metal.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.520
 Because I wanted it to have as few words as part.

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:04.160
 It was like, you know what's like coding golf

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.840
 or whatever you just try and get it out.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:09.640
 It was just like, and I sent it to one of my dearest friends

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.560
 in the world, Ted Nyman.

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.400
 Shout out to Ted.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.720
 He's got an amazing company called Case that he's building.

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.800
 An incredible writer and I just kept sending it to him

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.720
 and like, I just couldn't get it where I wanted it

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.840
 to be because I just wanted it to be--

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.760
 I wanted it to convey what's special

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.880
 because you only get this tiny amount of airtime.

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.000
 But I didn't want to indulge in anything

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.240
 other than, here's a customer.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.840
 Don't-- like, what's the news flash for most companies?

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.240
 Company says, own product is amazing.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:35.960
 OK, good, thank you.

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.720
 That's great.

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.200
 Good job, you guys.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.640
 Confidence is important.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.400
 But I just wanted to be like, don't ask us.

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.800
 Who gives a shit like it's a database?

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:49.480
 It's like, go to Cash App, go and look at their public filings

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.640
 of that company, the things we know about how incredible

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.480
 that company is.

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.080
 It's in like Kendrick Lamar songs and Super Bowl ads.

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:00.360
 And that's the cool bit.

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.040
 That's the actual cool bit, right?

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:06.440
 And not the kind of semi-synch replication.

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.760
 And so that's why-- and I think now, I think,

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.400
 so I hope we're at the beginning of this post-hype era

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:15.040
 of what you actually doing.

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:19.320
 And I think it becomes the Billboard ads shot on iPhone.

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:21.000
 They're the most self-aware, amazing ads.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.360
 You look at a Google ad for a Pixel,

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.880
 and it's like, how many megapixels are we at?

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.880
 I don't know how many megapixels the iPhone camera is.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.880
 I buy the new iPhone every single year.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.560
 But it doesn't matter.

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.240
 They are so self-aware.

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.320
 Like, Google just give you a load of tech specs.

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.960
 Of course, they do, it's Google.

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.480
 Apple just say, here's a picture of a yurt

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.200
 that someone took.

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.080
 Like, that person is exploring the word and is cool.

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.600
 And we're getting out of the way so they can do it.

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.120
 Shot on iPhone.

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.360
 It's that awareness, I think.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:52.320
 And I think that's hopefully where we're getting in tech,

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:56.120
 which is we've gone through this massive amount of hype.

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.720
 And physics have not changed.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.280
 The rules of software have barely changed.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.280
 Present them simply.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.960
 Spend your time building something good.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.880
 And people will like it or they won't like it.

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:07.840
 That's all that matters.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:11.720
 Yeah, I mean, I hope you're right because the thing that is tough

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.600
 is especially with like, when you're early in a space

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.440
 or trying to figure something out where things are going,

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:20.200
 like AI, for example, the problem with that approach

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.720
 is it just creates so much noise.

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.760
 And to like have any kind of clarity, it's so much,

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:28.880
 like so much of my time, it just spent like thinking so hard

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.160
 about these things and like trying to filter out

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:35.520
 like what is definitely just some person's personal insecurity

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.760
 and manifesting as like some serious seeming opinion

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:43.920
 on something versus like, what's actually real?

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.040
 It is just really tiring.

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.040
 And I was thinking about this today.

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:52.120
 With all this, again, I'm very pro AI just like you are.

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.400
 I try to use it as much as possible.

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.280
 I'm not one of these people that are like against it.

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.480
 But there's so much talk about I just

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.360
 built like the craziest thing without any effort, whatever.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:08.200
 And there's so much discussion around this.

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.520
 And I keep thinking about the products I use.

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.200
 And I'm like, I use like five products

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.480
 and I haven't used a new one in like a long time.

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.360
 If there's all this stuff being built,

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:19.120
 how come one of you has not built something

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:20.680
 that I like love, right?

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:25.680
 It's like not showing up in the place that matters.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.680
 And I felt a way about tech for a while

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:31.120
 where I feel like we're just obsessed with these demos.

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.480
 Like here's a little demo of something

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:37.280
 whereas I'm kind of like what you guys are with this launch.

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:40.280
 It's like, oh, this thing has been in production.

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:41.960
 Look at this thing we've actually built.

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.960
 Now we're going to talk about it.

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.520
 That's so much better.

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:49.440
 I think outside of it being just better for people,

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.800
 like, you know, it has more value.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.240
 It's just a much better filter for yourself.

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:56.520
 Like if you're trying to like show something to the world,

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.360
 like just wait till you actually built something cool

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.200
 with it because that'll just kind of filter out

00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.440
 a bunch of things that you're just going to waste

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.160
 your time on.

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.840
 So we definitely try to make sure, like I said,

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.680
 even though I said that I get really excited

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.280
 to let it show stuff off,

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.440
 I make sure that I like put it into production,

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.480
 use it for something real and know that it's actually useful

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.480
 before I talk about it.

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.200
 But again, like it's just not it.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.720
 Like every single company in DevTools, whatever,

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:25.200
 they just put together like a stupid demo

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.640
 of a product that no one's going to use to show off

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:28.960
 some feature they kind of made up.

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.320
 - I think what's key that you understand

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.120
 'cause I think people couldn't miss into what you said

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:39.120
 of conflating shipping slowly with like,

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:42.920
 take being deliberate and getting it right,

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.200
 you can iterate.

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.400
 You just have to like, one of my favorite engineers

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:50.360
 at the company is a guy called Mike Kudomash.

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.200
 Mike just spent his day talking people out of scope.

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.200
 He's like, well, actually, why don't we just do less?

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.800
 Like let me just like, what's the kind of minimum thing

00:56:58.800 --> 00:56:59.640
 that proves it out?

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.320
 And there's a great, you can, for her who's listening,

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:04.080
 I can go Google, there's a Spotify had a slide

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.640
 in a talk years ago that was like iteration.

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.040
 And it was like, you know, a job is like,

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.240
 get to the shops or whatever.

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.560
 Sad person waiting for a car to get built

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:15.880
 versus skateboard scooter, bike.

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.720
 Like it just gets better daily.

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.160
 And you can still go back and forth.

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:22.400
 Like, yeah, for a while, you're trying to skateboard

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.120
 with shopping bags, I kind of imagine how that's like,

00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.600
 but you know, but at least you're doing something.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.840
 There's this minimum functionality.

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:31.000
 You can ship stuff daily that is consequential

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.320
 towards something big if you're very clever

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.800
 and selective about how you iterate and build

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:38.080
 and kind of your tooling backs the ability to do it.

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.040
 And I think people think, well, it's either like

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:43.520
 waterfall ship every six months, this perfect thing,

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.040
 or ship garbage and hype it up every day.

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.720
 And it's neither actually.

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:51.240
 It's this kind of middle ground of like pace and learning

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:55.480
 and sensibly defining incremental progress on,

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.560
 you know, like the eye, the evolution of the eye, right?

00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:01.320
 Like an eye did not appear, but some light sensing kind of,

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.880
 you know-- - Yeah, it was so useful on day one.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:05.360
 - Yeah, exactly, just sensing shadows or whatever.

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.280
 With no one else, no other thing could.

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:10.160
 I mean, so, so much, so powerful.

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:13.240
 And yeah, like we don't have point in time recovery

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.280
 for like externally for users yet, right?

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.760
 Like we can do it for you, but you know,

00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.040
 it's just not wrapped up well.

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.040
 We know we need to ship that.

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.680
 We just, big customers don't need it.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:22.880
 It's not something people do, it's massive scale.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.120
 You know, mid-market people want it.

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.240
 We know we don't have it, right?

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.120
 So like could a delayed medal or just ship medal

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.320
 and now work on that next?

00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:30.160
 And you just go through it

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.880
 and you just kind of grind it out and you make it happen.

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.320
 I will say one more thing about hype though.

00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.880
 Like I am in your audience.

00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:40.880
 Like I think in the world of AI, trust and credibility

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.320
 is gonna be essential.

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.680
 That I sense, I think that's like why we blog the way we do

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.240
 is like we wanna like educate people

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.880
 and really speak from a place of authority.

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:52.160
 Like when you say you like something, I trust it

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.400
 because you are selective and because you say

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.240
 you don't like things and you don't just kind of hype it up

00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:01.080
 and that means I'm an actual member of like your audience.

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.640
 I wanna hear what you are thinking about

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.640
 and because of that credibility and trust

00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:08.400
 and people ruin it so quickly by helping out.

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.240
 There's other YouTubers

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.080
 that I know are very good engineers.

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:13.120
 I know they are, but for money,

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:15.120
 they lie about the technologies they use.

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.840
 Like that's bad, that is bad.

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:19.840
 We are in that era of tech now where the grift is on

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:20.840
 and they know better.

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.440
 They literally know better in an exchange for money

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:26.320
 and I mean it's the same as what we watch for crypto.

00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:29.480
 Like all of the VCs that quietly shuffled off their kind of

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.200
 NFT profile pictures and are now hyping up AI.

00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.440
 It's like you can't trust these people.

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:35.960
 They just believe in everything.

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:39.040
 That's selectivity and taste and building your audience

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:42.000
 on truth, like I don't really have much of a following

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.480
 on Twitter or whatever.

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.480
 'Cause I like, I just tweet what is actually true

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.880
 about databases, tiny town of people that give a shit

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:49.880
 about that but like, I mean, who cares?

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.800
 Like why change, why risk it?

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.320
 So I think it's like holding on to being genuine

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:56.080
 and there's very few tech media.

00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:58.840
 I told you I listened to this podcast every week

00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.200
 because it's like a real thing.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.960
 And it just feels like we're in this desert

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:05.000
 of genuine good content about tech.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.040
 And hopefully that will change as time goes on

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:09.880
 and we will grow.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.560
 - Yeah, it's funny 'cause like I think when people hear

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.080
 like the word negative be genuine,

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.960
 kind of what you're describing, like from my perspective,

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.360
 it's actually a purely selfish exercise

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.280
 because you talk about, you know, like,

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.400
 if you're a YouTuber, a way to fund what you're doing

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.240
 is to take sponsorships and do XYZ things.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:34.240
 And for me, if I was ever in that position,

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.760
 the reason I wouldn't do those deals

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:41.200
 isn't because of like any kind of like moral thing.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.160
 I just find it impossible for me to think clearly

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:48.400
 the moment I have and it's like so naive to think that

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.040
 I'm still gonna be objective even though I'm getting money.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.880
 I 100% believe you want to.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.520
 I have 100% believe you really care about that.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.960
 But having clarity, the moment you have that,

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.040
 it's so, so, so, so difficult.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.360
 And to me, like that clarity is more important than anything.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.640
 And I even go like me and you have a personal relationship.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.800
 Like we like each other.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.280
 Even that affects my clarity, right?

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.800
 Like I wanna see planet scale people.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.960
 I wanna like what you guys are doing.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.960
 So I'm just like hyper aware of how easily you can kind of

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.640
 get caught up in this stuff.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.920
 So then when I see people like hyping stuff up,

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.280
 my first thought is it's not really about like,

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.680
 oh, they're like confusing people.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.840
 It's like they're confusing themselves.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.680
 Like you're not gonna reach the right destination

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.280
 if you're confusing yourself to that degree.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.600
 - 100% and that's the kind of crux of all of it,

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.480
 which is that genuine just knowing where you came from

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.640
 and what your like values are

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.840
 and just holding that like in the center

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.040
 and it's really hard and it's really difficult.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.400
 - Yeah, it's really, really tough.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.520
 Like truly, truly, truly tough.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.600
 It goes back to the marketing,

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.040
 goes back to like all of the advice

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:57.800
 and standard playbooks that people give you.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.960
 - What's it worth?

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.320
 Like people, you know, I had, you know,

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.320
 as a favor to a friend of mine who is an investor,

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.600
 they had like three young kids that, you know,

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.320
 they're like 19 and 20 going into college.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.880
 They're interning at great companies here

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.560
 and they asked like, can I get a dinner with them?

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.800
 So I went to dinner and they show up like eager with advice

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.240
 and I said, I have zero advice for you.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.560
 - No, I've had less advice to hold over your garden.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.400
 - Correct.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.160
 When I was your age, I was sleeping on my friend's floor

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.960
 and I ate rice for an entire week

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.200
 'cause I'd spent all of my money trying to like set up punctures.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.400
 That's literally all I would do.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.680
 I was an idiot at your age.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.160
 Like you were doing way better than I was.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.280
 And then all I, like I said, the only advice I have for you

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.760
 is in your twenties, never say no to going out once.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.760
 You're never gonna get those Friday nights

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.800
 where you're like, ah, these are infinite, they're not.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.680
 Like I am old and I get hangovers now.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.320
 Right, that's the only advice I had for them.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.560
 I was like, what would I know?

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.120
 I don't know your generation.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.880
 You look at me like until recently

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.600
 I was wearing low-cut socks.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.000
 That's apparently how they all know we're old.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:57.840
 I got some new one.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.400
 I got the bomb, the bomb was long ones now, which is nice.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.480
 But the point is, it's like, why would you care?

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.640
 Why would you give a shit?

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.560
 Like, do you know what I mean?

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:08.800
 Like, I see a doctor more, I'm not sick or anything,

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.480
 but I have to, I'm like, I have to go and sit to your doctor.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.320
 You don't see your doctor.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.200
 I don't even know what feeling sick it's all.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.120
 I was like, don't listen to me.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:15.960
 There's nothing I have for you.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.200
 And I also haven't achieved anything.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.520
 Why should you look up to me in any way?

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.320
 Like, it just, you don't, you know?

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.040
 It's like, it doesn't, you just have to go and go

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.200
 and just build what's, you know, true to you.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.920
 And then you're lucky if it has economic impact.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.760
 You're just lucky.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.200
 - I know, it's funny 'cause I have the same exact feeling

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.280
 as you wear.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.000
 I used to give a lot more advice.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.160
 And then nowadays, I looked back in my career,

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.320
 I'm like, this doesn't make any sense at all.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.120
 Like, I just did a bunch of random stuff

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.680
 and one thing fell into the next thing.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.680
 And like, it kind of looks like it makes sense.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.120
 And then what I'm doing now is like super weird.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:53.240
 And I just can't imagine that advice working for anyone else

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.760
 'cause it was just like a weird thing that worked for me.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.160
 So at this point, I'm just like,

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.400
 I don't know what the world's like now.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.400
 I don't know what like getting a job is like now.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.880
 Like I don't, I just don't understand anything.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:05.320
 So I have such little advice for anyone.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.280
 I have like less advice now than I had five, 10 years ago.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.120
 - No, it's so funny.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.800
 It's that confidence that they're mid-week curve, right?

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.440
 You just get to the other side of it and you're like,

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.280
 yeah, I mean, all I know is like,

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.840
 all you find with experience is that how little you know,

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.320
 you just don't know anything.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.440
 Like you just have to be lucky.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.120
 Are people downplay 'cause it's uncomfortable?

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.000
 It feels uncomfortable to just talk about luck.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:28.840
 But it's just luck.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.000
 My entire career changed 'cause like one saw one guy

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.440
 get up tweeted. - Yeah, exactly.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.000
 - Frustration that they couldn't hire a database person.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:36.920
 So I just DM'd them.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.880
 I don't know why DM'd, my entire life changed.

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.600
 Like everything.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.080
 There's two people that exist in the world,

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.880
 my two children, that would not have existed if I send that.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.200
 But like seriously, like, you just can't plan it.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.840
 But if you go out there every day and work really hard,

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.600
 'cause I will say one thing.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:58.280
 There's actually a true bit of advice is I'm not smart.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.320
 I'm not a smart person.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.560
 I'm by far the worst engineer that works at Planck's go, right?

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:08.560
 But no one can, I will not let anyone out work for me.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:12.840
 You know, 'cause smart doesn't get you anywhere

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.840
 without hard work.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.040
 And like people always say like luck has to catch you working

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:16.880
 or whatever.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.040
 I firmly believe that.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.600
 You know, you just have to be doing anything and something

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.160
 and like jump on it.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.880
 Like we are massive, because of metal,

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.000
 a massive opportunity jumped in our lap this week.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.160
 We started already.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.160
 But yesterday we made that decision instantly.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.200
 We're doing the thing that we, you know,

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.440
 I'll come back when we ship that one.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.360
 But like, it's massive, it's as big as metal.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.480
 And it was yesterday the opportunity showed up.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.320
 And now we're started.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.160
 We're just going.

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.000
 We're just doing it.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:44.840
 That's what it takes.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.920
 It just takes like relentless drive

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.520
 and moving all your chips into one place over and over again.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.120
 And then luck will kind of find you.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.720
 And other people that are all so lucky

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.840
 that can create more luck will find you.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.960
 And you can just be there.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.800
 You just do stuff.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.640
 Just do things.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:02.040
 You can just do things is just so incredible.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.480
 And it's similar to like manifestation as well.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:09.320
 I certainly simultaneously believe it's dumb and completely

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.000
 real at the same time.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.280
 No, it's true.

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.400
 And I think as I've gotten older,

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.760
 I've been like more into the stuff

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.520
 that doesn't seem logical at all.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.320
 Just because I've just seen so much come out of stuff

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.120
 that doesn't exactly make sense.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:28.080
 But it kind of does in ways that you wouldn't expect.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.840
 Yeah, the single decision thing is so crazy to me.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.160
 Because I think about it all the time.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.920
 And I think I get physically nauseous.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.200
 And I'm comfortable when I think about this.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.600
 My wife, who I met, because she came in for interview

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.600
 and we ended up hiring her at the company that I was at.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.480
 Amazing.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.040
 And she tells me that she almost blew off the interview.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.720
 And I literally get like weak to my knees.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.320
 She like just like almost flippantly just was like,

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.560
 this guy because she talked to the CEO of the company

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.360
 who admittedly was kind of weird.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.000
 She was like, he seems weird.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.400
 Like maybe I was ball of interview.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.160
 And like every tiny aspect of my life today

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.920
 that I absolutely love personal life, career, whatever.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.320
 Like can branches out from that one thing.

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.360
 And just imagine her just like flippantly blowing it off

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.440
 and being like none of my life would exist.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:19.000
 And I literally get like, I just can't handle that thought.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.440
 It's it's crazy.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.160
 So yeah, doesn't it build a sense of gratitude though?

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:26.840
 Does it make you just feel so lucky to be like alive

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:27.680
 and where you are?

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:30.240
 And just it's just incredible.

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.160
 We're just so lucky to get to do what we do.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.200
 Just even being in tech, I tweeted the other night.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.880
 Like, we're just so lucky to do what we do.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.480
 I mean, we just like, we wear sweatpants to work.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.920
 And I've never been wearing pants right now from being honest.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.520
 Exactly. It's great. Yeah. Just let it go free.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.240
 It's fine. Like you can. It just doesn't matter.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.240
 Like whatever.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.840
 And then like we just accidentally become like millionaires

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.240
 doing it. It's like cool. Like that's good.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.280
 I mean, yeah, this cut this won't exist in a hundred years.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.440
 Didn't exist a hundred years ago, you know?

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.920
 Yeah, it's wild.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.880
 It's like, yeah, your brain can't even really,

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.400
 really understand it.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.240
 It's a, I think, just kind of beyond our understanding.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.800
 The other thing I wanted to talk real quick about was

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.440
 just kind of going back to,

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.560
 this is totally out of order because we totally moved

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.120
 the topic now, but just kind of bring it back to

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.480
 just like Plan scale from like a year ago.

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.440
 When you guys made that decision,

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:20.400
 so there's a few decisions you made.

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:23.400
 You decided to shrink the team.

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.720
 You also got rid of your free tier

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.960
 to kind of focus more on mid and upmarket.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.200
 And it was really controversial.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.560
 There was like a lot of commentary about it,

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:38.120
 specifically the free tier thing where people were like,

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.160
 actually, I don't know, like what were some of the things

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.200
 that you were really frustrated about

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.600
 that you wish people understood differently?

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.240
 I didn't think I was very frustrated at all.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.320
 I think the confidence at which people

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:55.440
 just said things, you know, I look back.

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.440
 I think the thing I got most wrong, I'll start there

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.960
 because I can't just make it sound like I'm Teflon.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.400
 I won't take any of feedback or, you know,

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:04.400
 won't let anything stick.

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.480
 Like I did so many things wrong with that layoff.

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.440
 One of them is the messaging.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.520
 I think it was very cold and in reflection.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.240
 I think the blog post was very cold.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.080
 I did it.

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.840
 I sent it to my friends that happened

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.880
 to have either founded successful companies

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.560
 or just been CEOs or run a business or whatever.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.520
 And they read the post and they were like,

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.840
 oh, yeah, they agreed with the decision

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.920
 and sort of like, yeah, this is good.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.760
 You should just do this.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.960
 And I didn't really think about the kind of how it would

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.240
 be read and conveyed.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:37.440
 And I think it came across very coldly as we're doing this.

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.760
 And that's kind of a problem with me,

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.320
 which is like, once I believe in a decision,

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.480
 like I just go for it.

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.640
 Like I just don't care about even if I said

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.560
 the completely contradictory thing the day before,

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:48.400
 it just doesn't matter.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:51.320
 And I believed in this so much that I just wanted to do it

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.160
 and I did it.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.880
 And I think I hurt people and I don't feel good that I did that.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:59.800
 I think that's fair critique that it was kind of a cold way

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.880
 to message something that had a real human impact.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.360
 But then you kind of just saw this wave of stupidity

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.440
 that followed.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.720
 Like, you know, we put that we had a limited runway.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.560
 And then someone very famous with a very large audience

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.920
 got on camera and said, how is that possible?

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.160
 How can you have an infinite runway?

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.520
 And you just think to yourself, when more money

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:25.160
 goes into our bank every month that leaves,

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.960
 what data am I supposed to choose

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.840
 from when we're going to go out of business?

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.440
 Like every venture-backed founder has a cashout date

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.080
 in their head.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:36.040
 They know that at the current rate of burn,

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.240
 without giant revenue inflection,

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.640
 their bank account will go to zero.

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:44.880
 Like, ask your venture-backed vendors

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.000
 when their cashout date is.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.360
 They know, they report it every three months to their board.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.360
 We all run out of money.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.400
 If nothing else changes, a raise or a revenue inflection,

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.440
 we'll run out of business.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.640
 So like, takes like that, you're just like, wow,

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.240
 people are just hateful or stupid.

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.320
 Like, that's more honest.

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.680
 Like, you know, just help me, you know,

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.560
 help me find the day we're just going to go bust

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.160
 when we keep making more money.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.040
 Like, we ended the year with, like,

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.720
 way more money in our bank than we modeled.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.120
 Like, millions of dollars more than we thought we would have

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.960
 at the end of the year, we had it.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.040
 As thanks to I am for team cutting loads of clothesmen

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.840
 and costume, whatever, we did a bunch of that.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:22.080
 But like, the point being is that takes like that were silly.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.760
 Astro were releasing a database product,

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.120
 a week after we did the layoff.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.200
 And they were like, you know,

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.080
 and this is where I thought it was really amusing.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.640
 'Cause it's like, well, you know,

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.880
 you know, we kind of know what we're doing in databases.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.600
 Like, that was never in question.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.800
 You knew, people knew what we were doing.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.240
 We gone and just did something very drastic.

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.040
 In my mind, that would have made me feel humble.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.320
 But instead, they were like, wow, like, you know,

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.520
 amping it up and doing all this sort of stuff.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.720
 Turns out they were wrapping another database platform

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.640
 that has lost data and shipped a product without backups,

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.960
 lost customer data, and then gave data away

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.840
 by having a bug that's literally impossible to do

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.080
 on our platform where they just served other people

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.520
 random databases.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.520
 - Yeah.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.880
 - Never unlive that, never undo that.

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.880
 Not that we'd ever see companies like that

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:10.800
 in a competitive sale, but when they have competitors,

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.880
 just takes reminding people of that

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.520
 and that's over.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.720
 Like, you know, they shipped that.

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.000
 And you just think to yourself, like, the arrogance,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:19.840
 is unbelievable.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.880
 Like, you just see the level of arrogance

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.840
 and how little they know about computers.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.240
 Like, they just don't understand them.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.360
 They just think it's just this simple thing.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.000
 And as long as you do some good marketing

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.040
 and some little drawing on that, you know, it works.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:32.880
 And it just doesn't.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.360
 And so stuff like that was just like, okay, you'll see.

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.240
 It was like that long game thing of like, yeah,

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:39.120
 I got home that night and my wife looked at me

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.880
 and she just burst into tears.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.720
 And she was like, I've just read

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.200
 what everyone's saying to you on the internet.

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:45.080
 And I thought it was hilarious, like, Sandick,

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.720
 but like some really fun equipped, so some really good one.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.160
 I just thought it was really funny.

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.040
 But yeah, like, people go at you and it's not comfortable

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:52.880
 and you don't feel good.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.760
 And people remember it and whatever.

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:57.840
 But then you watch, you watch the outages.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.960
 You watch, like, the data loss.

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.680
 And you're just like, yeah, that's the long game.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:03.520
 We're just gonna keep building.

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.880
 We're building metal, we're building this stuff.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.680
 You can all confidently yap.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.240
 But then do it.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.920
 Like, when we wake up at two in the morning

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.720
 to, like, fix, figure out issues,

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.560
 I know, like, they could have infinite money

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.960
 and they couldn't fix these problems.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.120
 They literally could not.

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:23.120
 And so, you just eventually stop caring.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.520
 But, you know, at the time you were just like,

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.720
 wow, everyone is so wrong and they're so wrong about you.

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.200
 And you want your, you want a fair trial

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.960
 and you just can't get that in the court of public opinion

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:33.840
 and it gets to you.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.440
 And people have said to me, why do you care?

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:37.560
 I don't know, I do.

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.400
 I just care.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.400
 - It's impossible not to.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.320
 I think it's easy when you're not in that situation

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.080
 to be like, oh yeah, it's easy not to care.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:47.320
 But it's basically impossible not to.

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.320
 - Yeah, 100%.

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.560
 - Yeah.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.960
 - People ask me why I argue on Twitter.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.880
 It's like, well, I don't know.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.120
 I don't know, but I care.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.160
 Like, it matters, right?

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.080
 And other people care.

01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:00.840
 Like, we started to now see more folks interacting

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.600
 and kind of talking about the stuff they do at scale

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.480
 and the realities of running in tech.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.760
 And you kind of realize, like, yeah,

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.360
 there's this dormant group of folks

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.120
 that do really amazing, interesting things.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.400
 And they kind of want to talk about it.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.440
 And we're hopefully,

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.560
 hopefully uniting a revolution for these people to go

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.920
 and actually talk about what it means

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.400
 to go and do this stuff in reality.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.600
 And that's why, again, why I like your stuff

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:23.600
 because you have this kind of like, you're not cynical.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.960
 You know, you have to build for an audience

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.480
 that's young and modern and doing amazing stuff.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.360
 But you also just balance that with like,

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.720
 it's still computers.

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.280
 - Right.

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:37.120
 Yeah, it's funny 'cause we actually reference

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.600
 your guys' decision, a decent amount.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.280
 I just felt like it was so,

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.200
 I think prior to you guys doing that,

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.160
 I had a lot of doubts with my position.

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.080
 Kind of what you were saying, right?

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.640
 Like you think everyone else,

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:51.600
 you think you must be crazy

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.680
 'cause everyone else is doing things differently.

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.840
 But forever, I was just like,

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.480
 why is everyone obsessively going after this

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:02.160
 indie hacker free tier type of persona?

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.880
 Why is there a whole company oriented around that?

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.800
 In my head, I was like, this,

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.960
 I'm like trying to see it, I can't see it.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:12.080
 We, are we doing anything wrong?

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:15.520
 And then to see you guys have captured that,

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.680
 a good amount more than us,

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.280
 and then be like, oh yeah, that's like not worth it at all.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:21.600
 Like that's actually a negative thing

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.560
 and it's gonna like screw us

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.920
 if we keep going around that and like go the other way.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.840
 That was like an important data point for us

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:30.080
 'cause that was the first time we finally saw someone

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:35.080
 in the space like show that that's,

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.080
 that might actually be right.

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.560
 Like everyone's kind of chasing the thing

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.560
 that doesn't really make sense.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.160
 And then now oftentimes we see companies

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.000
 that are like blowing up

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.960
 like they're getting a bunch of usage or whatever.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.920
 And I just, the first thing we think about is like,

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.120
 man, what does their support look like?

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.880
 Like what are they just going through

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.160
 complete hell right now?

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.040
 'Cause they're getting like the dumbest people

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:59.240
 that will never pay you, just eating up your time.

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:03.280
 And we orient so much around how do we make sure that

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.840
 we build as though those people can use us,

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.400
 but like we're never in a situation

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.880
 where we're stuck supporting them.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:12.640
 100%. That is literally, that is the essence of it.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.240
 All of these people that have got negative gross margins

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:19.560
 because they just have tons of usage that will go nowhere.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.880
 Like it's like just why?

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.680
 Like what, you don't need it.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.960
 Like you just, you're completely right.

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.000
 Like I mean, this is what people are going to learn

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.840
 over time, which is, you know,

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.160
 and so many people have found, as I've said to me,

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.480
 we're not doing a free tear because of you.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.840
 Like we just don't, we're just not bothering.

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.240
 And I'm like, yeah, I think that'll be a good decision.

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.080
 Or it won't.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.080
 There's tons of business I would start

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.440
 where I would have a free tear.

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.440
 Like there will be consumption-based infrastructure businesses

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.120
 because how can you be serious about your company

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.000
 if you can't spend $39 to buy the same database

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
 that cashback has?

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.200
 How can you not be serious?

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.160
 How can you be serious?

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:56.600
 Like seriously, just like we are giving you a sign up flow

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.560
 that provably some of the greatest companies in the world,

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.680
 tech companies in the world use,

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.360
 money, businesses that just print money.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.600
 And you don't want to spend 39 bucks on that.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.520
 You're going to fail.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.520
 You failed already, this is a test for you,

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:10.080
 and you have failed it.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.600
 Like, no, I'm serious.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.680
 It's just like, yeah, you just have to not care.

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:16.000
 But again, it's going to take 10 years to prove that out.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.720
 It really will take 10 years.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.600
 And people always go like, wow, what about net new?

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:22.280
 I mean, people are the largest customer

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.920
 of one of these little Postgres startups

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.000
 is migrating to us now.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.920
 They were told by that company,

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:28.880
 you are a large customer.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.120
 That's why you're causing a struggle.

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.760
 Yeah, it's like, it's a order of magnitude below, you know,

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:36.960
 ACV even.

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:39.960
 So it's one, if that's your large customer,

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.080
 that's very bad.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:44.080
 Two, it's a hilariously small database.

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.040
 It's like 100 gig of data.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:46.880
 Wow.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.960
 So it's just like, what's your fleet here doing for you?

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.520
 That's the peak of your conversion is that.

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.080
 Yeah, I think people have this funny thing

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.960
 where they just put themselves in hell,

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.760
 not realizing the point of starting a company

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.280
 is to put yourself in a nice situation.

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:01.880
 Like, it's going to be hard for some time,

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.320
 but ideally you get to a place where it's like a nice situation.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.400
 You're happy with your life.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:11.280
 And this thing where your customers graduate out of you,

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.360
 I never want to build anything where my customers graduate.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:15.840
 Because that just hell forever.

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:18.360
 Because you're just like, you're finally making money,

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.080
 you just want to make more money, oh, and they're gone.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.920
 And now you're like fighting this infinite battle.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.960
 Like, that's just not a fun place to be.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.760
 Like, why build anything that people will outgrow.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.600
 100%

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.240
 And then you're stuck with the people that aren't paying you.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:31.040
 So it's just like, it's complete hell.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.200
 You're just UBI for Indian software development.

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:38.200
 It's just like, you know, just like we were Ubering

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.800
 to work for $5.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.440
 Oh my god, it was so good.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.000
 I put like $3 to go anywhere in Manhattan.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.240
 And it would take 40 minutes because of Uberful.

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.440
 It was fine because I was in my 20s

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.600
 and I had that much money, it was great.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.680
 Yeah, exactly.

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.160
 Like, you know, GitHub office was just Prius

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.240
 is just pulling up all morning.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.960
 Just just brilliant.

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:01.080
 The same Saudi money is now just going as compute.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.440
 Right, exactly, for students to learn.

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.320
 Like, those people are valid.

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:06.800
 I love those people.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.480
 But I have a different type of business to build.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.560
 It's just the way it is.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.560
 And all of those ones that have got the hype

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.320
 and the tweet in their user graph, tweet your revenue,

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:17.320
 tweet your gross margins if you want to be impressive.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.600
 The user graph without the YX is always,

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.160
 the YX is unlabeled.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.720
 Yeah, like it's like, hang on a second.

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:27.800
 We showed up with my sequel in this world, right?

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.320
 And like gained so much traction of like,

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.480
 just, you know, at the party, there was like a guy

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.840
 that, you know, he's building a really cool company,

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.320
 new yarn.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.960
 I was like, is there any chance on earth you would be using?

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.680
 And you'd be using Postgres, like,

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:44.000
 if it wasn't for plant scale, right?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.080
 And he was like, oh, yeah, 100%.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.560
 And it was, you know, so we showed up with that.

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.280
 You know, if the job, if all the job is,

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.760
 is like $30 million on fire to make $2 million,

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.600
 I mean, that's fucking easy.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:55.400
 I mean, I can do that.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.160
 I just buy mambos and give them a life for a third of the price.

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.600
 I mean, if that's all they're doing,

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.840
 like you see this hype in this, you see these user graphs.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.960
 It's like, yeah, like any, if that,

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:06.280
 if the job is to light money on fire,

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.720
 like to make no money, that's super easy.

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.680
 And that's, that's the vanity of,

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:14.480
 that's the vanity of tech Twitter, which is like,

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.240
 you know, David Kramer who's run Sentry is hilarious as well.

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:19.720
 You know, he puts it like, you know,

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.200
 he's built a phenomenal business.

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.440
 And he puts like 10 million ml.

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.240
 Yeah, he removed that.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.560
 He removed that recently.

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.400
 I wish he put it back because somebody didn't know who he was.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.960
 The other day and was being like,

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:32.520
 oh, how much money have you ever made?

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.280
 And I'm like, man, I wish he had that in his profile still,

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.360
 but the tens of millions, MRI.

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:40.200
 Yeah, just to generate like a phenomenal product

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:43.040
 used by just thousands of amazing companies.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:46.520
 It's just like, just goes to work and does it, you know,

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.120
 just like tech Twitter.

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.360
 That's actually, if I do, I guess I'd buy this for anyone,

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:52.760
 it's, it's all a mirage.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:56.760
 It's like, when the fucking ACH clears for millions of dollars

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.680
 into your bank and all of your employees' bank accounts,

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.880
 that's when you won.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.920
 Every minute until then is just a waste of time.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.600
 You know, like it's just thinking about anything

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.400
 other than obsessively thinking about that.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.680
 Like, it's just air.

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:10.520
 Yeah.

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.560
 And at the end of the day, like,

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:17.160
 there's a graveyard of dead companies that looked incredible.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.000
 Yeah.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.320
 All the way through and made,

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:22.920
 and then there's these rocket ships that just slowly build.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.600
 Like, like, I always like remind people

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.320
 that if you were a snowflake at the stage plant scale

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.640
 is out right now, you'd be like, dead company.

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:33.800
 Like, soon the flat revenue growth, two CEOs fired.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.520
 And then it's the long game.

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.840
 And then they go off like a rocket.

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.480
 It's just, you just can't tell.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.480
 And it just takes way, like, get up again.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:43.360
 Ripping hot company sold for an amazing, you know,

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:46.960
 exit to Microsoft in year 13 or whatever.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:49.880
 Like, it's a long grind to go and do this.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:52.760
 And checkpointing today's Twitter op

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:56.320
 at Texas in any form, form of indication of future

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.080
 or success or failure is done.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.800
 And there's just so much reinforcement of this.

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.160
 If you look at YC companies,

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:06.200
 they were like the hot YC companies during demo day.

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.480
 If you, like, analyze them,

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:09.760
 it actually, like, were like the worst.

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:12.040
 Like, you do, like, perform really badly.

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.480
 So it's so hard to, again,

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.000
 going back to, like, being able to get clarity.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.800
 It's like, that stuff just creates so much noise.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.760
 And the thing you were saying about

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.240
 the free tier and $39.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.480
 That's the thing that was so fine to me,

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.440
 because everyone was, like,

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.680
 really upset that the free tier was gone.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.720
 And to me, and I was like,

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.680
 the discussion, like, when I was talking about,

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:32.840
 to the foreground, okay, the free tier is gone.

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.560
 But, like, hold up, $39 a month is free.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.360
 Like, to me, that's like, that's free.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.800
 Like, that is free.

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.080
 Like, how is that?

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.800
 Like, we would never even think about that.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:47.000
 So it's just funny that there was so much debate over,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.360
 "Oh, the free tier is gone."

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:52.480
 But, like, man, it's like, still just basically free.

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.720
 - I wanted extra protein

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.560
 with my sweet green salad the other day.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.200
 $28 for a salad.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.040
 (laughing)

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.320
 If we found, like, it was fine.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:05.560
 I just watched, I watched to, like, out of the little trough,

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:10.560
 just scoop the pre-allocated three ounces of chicken, right?

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.680
 For six dollars.

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.200
 I mean, you just think to yourself,

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.840
 we could end thousands of businesses today

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:21.040
 by fucking up, thousands of companies could just go, right?

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:23.320
 Like, when CTOs of public companies sit you down and go,

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.600
 "If we go bust, you go bust."

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:28.480
 You're like, "Hmm, you have a $300 billion market."

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:31.320
 That's a sobering realization.

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:34.880
 And people don't want to pay $30,000 for it, yeah.

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.720
 - Yeah, I know.

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:36.560
 It doesn't necessarily sense what else.

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:37.400
 - You're not serious.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.840
 Look yourself in the face and say,

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.880
 "What else are you going to do?"

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:41.880
 That's so, you know, like, it's just,

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.640
 so that is the point of the free tier.

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:45.200
 Like, you know, don't want to hate on hobbyists,

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:48.280
 don't want, like, indie devs, whatever, do whatever you want.

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.800
 But like, at the end of the day,

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:54.480
 I have a viewpoint, they have a viewpoint.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.800
 I only care about mine.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.680
 - Yeah, yeah, and that's actually the tough part

01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:58.520
 about all this.

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.840
 It's like, it's not exactly that they're wrong.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.960
 It's just that I don't want to,

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:04.160
 I'm not interested in engaging,

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.760
 like talking to you guys about your world.

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:09.360
 Like, I want to talk in my world about the stuff

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:10.520
 that I care about with other people

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:11.920
 that are also in my world.

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.480
 But when you're online, it's just like,

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.440
 everyone just interjects into each other's stuff.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.760
 So yeah, like, the things that I'm doing

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.480
 look ridiculous from your point of view,

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:20.320
 but like, I'm not talking to you.

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.480
 I'm not saying you should live like this.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.480
 I'm not saying you should do any of this stuff,

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.880
 but it doesn't mean it doesn't make sense.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:29.800
 - Yeah, it's that famous hack and use comment to drop box.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:30.640
 - Right.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:31.480
 - You're just asking.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.440
 - Yeah. (laughs)

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.320
 - Yeah, we've been on a,

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.600
 we managed to do, between terminal and SST,

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:40.040
 we've been on a hack and everything four times this past,

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.760
 like, past year or so.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.360
 And I get so stressed every time it happens.

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.200
 Like I used to, it used to be this thing where I'd be like,

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:50.000
 man, I'd love to like, do something

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.120
 that like, makes it on Hacker News.

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.200
 And I have a feed I go through

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:56.160
 with like, Hacker News and a bunch of other stuff.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.520
 I remember I was reading something,

01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.080
 I was reading an article and I was like,

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.080
 man, this guy's getting roast in the comments.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:02.000
 I feel so bad for him,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.440
 'cause he's being misinterpreted, blah, blah, blah.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.560
 Like, I was reading that.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:05.840
 Then I swipe up to the next one

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.880
 and it's one of our stuff and I'm like, fuck.

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:09.360
 (laughs)

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.000
 So now I'm just like, I want to be out there

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.600
 but at the same time, I'm not too out there.

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.520
 'Cause, yeah.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.720
 - Yeah, no, I know it's like, wait a minute.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.440
 Yeah, you're kind of too close to the fire.

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.600
 Yeah, no, it's the same for us, which is like, yeah,

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.960
 'cause good, it drives some traffic.

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.000
 The comments are just crazy.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:25.840
 And then nothing changes.

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:26.760
 You go back to doing whatever you do.

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:27.600
 - Yeah, I know.

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.440
 (laughs)

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:29.760
 - It's just, I think it's normal.

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:30.760
 - Is that, what's that mean?

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.280
 Like, you know, is it like the title of creative,

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.280
 like, cyberbullied?

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.920
 Like, just close your laptop, bro.

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:36.840
 Like, it's just like, that's it.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.400
 You just log it off at the end of the day, you know what I mean?

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.160
 I was saying this the other day, I was like, there's so many companies

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.440
 that don't, that can't do it.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.680
 Like, if you were honest with yourselves, like,

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.960
 you just can't do the internet thing.

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:52.200
 Like, it's not in your skill set.

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.360
 You don't have to, you can just not do it.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.680
 I feel like so many companies do it and do it badly.

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.000
 It's actually totally valid to like, opt out and not do it.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.800
 If you can still do a lot of things,

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.920
 this isn't gonna be one of your channels, but whatever.

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:07.320
 - Yeah, yeah, the whole like, hello fellow kids.

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:12.320
 - It's just like, if you can't play, then it's only downside for you

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.960
 if you jump into this male's dream.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.080
 - Yeah, you can just ignore it.

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.680
 - Correct. - You can just completely ignore it.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:18.800
 - 100%. - 100%.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.680
 Well, unfortunately, I've got a day of customer calls to go and do,

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:26.080
 so I'm gonna have to part ways and say, thank you again for having me on.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.680
 Obviously love's running toward me. - I appreciate you coming on.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:32.800
 - Adam, whatever you are dealing with right now, I hope that has gone well.

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:36.160
 - I don't think it has, but I don't think I appreciate that one.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.360
 - Sending you love Adam.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.520
 But yeah, thanks for having me.

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:43.800
 And just like, thanks for producing something that gives me a little value and delight everywhere.

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.120
 - Yeah, congrats on the launch and, yeah, we'll flip our stuff over at some point

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.320
 when I have a chance to look at it, but yeah, exciting for you guys.

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:54.600
 - Yeah, you're in the, you're in the top tier of support, CEOs.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.240
 - Yes, yes, no, I talked about that a bunch.

01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:59.320
 - Yeah, whatever you need, whatever you need.

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.120
 - Appreciate it. - Thanks everyone.

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.120
 Thank you.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:11.160
 (upbeat music)
