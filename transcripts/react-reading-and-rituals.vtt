WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
 But look, I'm gonna be a pro.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.640
 I'm gonna switch to this and I'm gonna check

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.680
 if your audio works.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.520
 Say something.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.200
 - Ooh, I'm saying things.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.520
 - And your audio works.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.600
 - And my audio works.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.120
 - We're not gonna go five minutes

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.360
 and have someone yell at us.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.520
 - Look at us.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.880
 We're still on top of things.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.460
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.820
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.620
 - Sometimes I forget this is a podcast.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.280
 - What is this?

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.420
 - I've got two Twitch things to talk about.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.080
 - Let's do it.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.240
 - One, I just saw they announced TwitchCon 2024.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.620
 It's not in Vegas.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.360
 San Diego.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.000
 - I saw that and I was like,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.560
 I've always wanted to go to San Diego.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.640
 People always say San Diego is amazing.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.680
 I check out San Diego.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 Everyone loves San Diego.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.000
 This is the Mexican food so good.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.320
 There's a zoo there, I think.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.120
 - It's great, yep.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.960
 You gotta go this year.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.600
 - Yeah, I'll heavily consider it.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.960
 - Heavily consider it.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.880
 - Heavily consider it.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.720
 - The dates are right here.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.200
 September 20th to 22nd.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 - Ooh, I have plans that day.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.200
 - Do you do not?

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.080
 There's no way you plan out September.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.760
 Like that far in advance.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.320
 - That says the accent followed me on Twitter.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.160
 I'm too bored.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.560
 Okay, so I will confess.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.480
 I unfollowed a bunch of people last week.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.120
 Do not take it personally.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.120
 I'm just in a period of time

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.880
 where I need to really focus on certain things

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.880
 and I need to not get distracted by things

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.000
 that are easily distracting.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.120
 - What a jerk.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.480
 - So I'm sorry.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.520
 - Don't you know that Twitter following

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.720
 is just friendship and it means nothing else.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.960
 Adam, do you need to get into what you do?

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.000
 - I do, I do.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.720
 - You follow people,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.800
 then you realize you don't like what they're saying

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.880
 and you don't unfollow them.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.000
 You just meet them.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 - Yeah, that's the polite thing to do.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.920
 - You keep them followed.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.960
 Like I forget I'm backstabber.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.040
 - So you follow people who you have a connection to.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.440
 That's all that matters.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.520
 Connections.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.360
 It's about the thing.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.200
 - Yeah, I know.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.720
 That's why I felt weird to unfollow people

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.760
 'cause I'm like, it seems like a dramatic statement, but.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.640
 - You should feel weird and bad.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.800
 I'm sorry, Dev, on behalf of DAX.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 I'm sorry.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.320
 - Is Adam only a mute?

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.000
 - Yeah, I was starting to do the mute thing

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.080
 and I was like, this is weird.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.480
 And I'm just gonna see a bunch of like,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.840
 you've muted this all over my feed and I don't know.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.120
 It's awkward.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.600
 Don't take it personally.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.920
 I'm just trying to focus on some other things.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.280
 - I'm gonna take it personally

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.480
 on behalf of all of these people that you've now

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.440
 and followed.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.280
 I don't like it.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.400
 I don't like one bit.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.240
 Another Twitch thing, shifting back to the Twitch thing.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.480
 One, you're going to Twitch gone.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.320
 That's awesome.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.080
 Say it to Diego, it's gonna be amazing.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.080
 Two, I bought a cellular modem for streaming IRL.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.080
 - I saw your stream and it was very,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.720
 I didn't see it live, but I watched the thing.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.000
 It seemed like really good quality in terms of--

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.880
 - Well, that was actually just my phone.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.040
 - Oh, really? Okay.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.280
 - Yeah, that was just my phone on a little stand.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.560
 But after streaming one jiu-jitsu tournament,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.080
 I thought, I'm gonna stream everything I do.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.680
 I'm gonna stream all my training sessions

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.640
 with like personal trainer, my weight training sessions,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.400
 my jiu-jitsu training session.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.040
 I'm gonna stream it all.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.360
 I don't care.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.160
 'Cause I can't really stream at my desk right now.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.360
 Yeah, I'm Twitch.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.200
 - That's cool.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.880
 How does a cellular modem work you pay for

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.920
 like another line with your carrier, basically?

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.240
 - This company makes these like two and four modem setups

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.200
 that it uses like a bonded thing.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.040
 Like bonds, multiple, there's some bondage involved.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.880
 I don't know.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.720
 - Oh my God.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.440
 - It takes like, you just pay them a monthly fee

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.880
 and they provide this like multi-carrier,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.800
 stable connection thing.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.320
 - Oh, multi, oh, cool.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.520
 - Yeah, so I got two modems.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.200
 I didn't go for four.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.040
 - Nice.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.880
 - Let's see how it goes.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.600
 - And if you tried it, if you tried it with like--

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.800
 - It's not here yet.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.000
 - Oh, okay.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.200
 - But I'm gonna start as soon as it gets here.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.480
 Like everything I'm doing, physical activity-wise.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.640
 - You can be like a live news channel, you know?

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.800
 Just like whenever you see something--

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.640
 - Just walk around.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.480
 - Just run up into the stream.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.960
 - There's nothing that happens in the US arcs.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.480
 I don't go outside on streets.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.200
 I don't know what streets you're talking about, but.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.200
 - I wish that I really need to get like those glasses

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.000
 with the camera in them because I live in a place

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.840
 where literally every single day I see something ridiculous.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.160
 Like the other, yesterday I went out

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.480
 to my front yard, I was like playing with Zuko.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.040
 And I look up and there's a lime green Lamborghini SUV

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.120
 driving backwards down my street.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.700
 (laughing)

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.000
 I'm like, I bet there's people that go

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.400
 to their whole life and never see that.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.920
 - I didn't know there were any PHP developers in that--

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.880
 - No Lamborghini SUV.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.400
 - Oh, I didn't know Lamborghini made an SUV.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.160
 - No, it's actually a scam.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.440
 - I consider it a scam.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.240
 - Okay, here's why I consider it a scam.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.000
 The Lamborghini SUV is actually just an Audi SUV.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.480
 I've read the exact model.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.800
 They just bought that, the core, like the,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.080
 they call it the platform.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.800
 And they put a body kit on it to make it look like--

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.640
 - Oh, where?

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.680
 - It looks like a cool Lamborghini with like jagged edges.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.080
 - Yeah, and they're super popular because

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.400
 SUVs are really convenient, like most families need SUVs.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.480
 And if you're rich, you're like,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.720
 I want a Lamborghini SUV and--

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.720
 - Yeah, it's crazy popular.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.920
 - Parable to like, is it like a cheaper thing

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.560
 that they sell or is it?

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.280
 - I think it's still like a three or $400,000 car.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.120
 I think that the car that's built on,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.800
 it's built on top of is like a $100,000 car.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.520
 So, scam, if you buy it and I see you in it,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.640
 I know you got scammed.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.800
 - Well, you can use my glasses.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.800
 I've got some and I haven't used them in months.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.680
 Well, since that time I put them on for the podcast,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.800
 I think it's the last time I wore them.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.040
 - Wait, wait, which ones do you have, the NAPT ones?

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.880
 Or the metal ones?

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.200
 - The metal ones.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.640
 - Oh, you haven't, wait, but you got those recently,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.600
 didn't you?

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.440
 It's didn't stick?

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.320
 - Whenever that was, a few months ago, yeah,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.160
 I haven't used them.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.000
 - If you want to send them to me,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.920
 I will happily take it.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.400
 - Okay, yeah, I would love to see some Miami.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.640
 That would be fun.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.440
 There's just nothing around me in the Ozarks,

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.480
 so it's like, it'd be the inside of my house all the time

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.720
 and like, I don't know, once you've seen them once.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.880
 Kind of seeing it.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.120
 Am I, do I have a problem with consumerism?

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.520
 - I want to talk about this.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:48.120
 There was a tweet and from a friend.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.040
 And if this friend happens to notice

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040
 that I'm talking about this tweet,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.320
 just know I was not offended by you.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.840
 In fact, I can't be offended.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.720
 That's the thing about me, a personality trait of mine.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.680
 Not offended by you, but it did, it woke me up.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.040
 The tweet was basically something like,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.400
 if you replace religion in a society,

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.000
 or if you eliminate religion in a society,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.840
 then people will fill it with things,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.920
 fill that void with things that are worse,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.760
 something something like consumerism.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.480
 And I thought about how I got rid of religion in my life,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.400
 and I feel like I'm kind of a consumer.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.120
 Is it a consumerist?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.400
 What is the word, just a consumer?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.480
 And I'm an excessive consumer.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.800
 - One who partakes in consumerism.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.920
 - Yeah, I'm taking consumerism, yes.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.000
 I worship at the church of consumerism, I guess.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.160
 Not really, but I do think, yeah.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.560
 Maybe I need some spirituality in my life or something,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.960
 so I can be less, I don't know,

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.480
 like I buy meta glasses and I never wear them again.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.400
 (laughing)

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.560
 What does it mean, Dax?

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.600
 - Okay, I think that initial statement you're talking about

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.600
 combines like a million different things together.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.960
 There's a version of it that can be true.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.120
 So for me, yes, I think religion historically

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.680
 has served a lot of fulfilling things that people need,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.440
 just like a way to live life.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.200
 'Cause that's like, was not a thing you ever had to think about

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.320
 until recently, how do I live life?

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.320
 What do I do, how do I die?

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.920
 What happens when I die?

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.000
 Like how do I get buried?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.120
 Like all those questions answered?

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.720
 I don't necessarily think if you remove that,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.880
 you automatically feel it with stuff that's worse.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.400
 I think there's plenty of people that are,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.160
 in this example, they're into consumerism

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.200
 and they're also religious.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.640
 I think there's people that don't have religion

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.160
 and flop it with something, maybe even better.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.240
 So I don't know if those things are like,

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.680
 you should assume those things are related for you,

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.960
 like they might be, but I don't know.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.680
 But the question I have is like, what is consumerism?

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.520
 Like when people say that, like what are they actually

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.920
 describing, like what do you picture in your head?

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.320
 - So I'm glad you asked that.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.520
 'Cause when I thought about this question,

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.680
 I went to post to you.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.080
 I thought, Dax is gonna have an answer

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.320
 that reminds me that like, abundance and stuff.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.280
 (laughs)

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.880
 I think when I hear consumerism,

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.880
 I think like excessive consuming, excessive buying of things,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.320
 surrounding yourself with things that you don't really need,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.760
 I guess that's what I think of.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.920
 - Yeah, I mean-- - Is that accurate?

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.520
 - So I definitely feel this too.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.560
 So where do you put all your stuff when like these glasses

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.120
 that you don't, you're never gonna touch again?

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.840
 Like where do they go?

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.240
 - They're currently in my Jiu Jitsu bag,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.000
 just in case I decide-- - Oh, it's just too bad, okay.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.240
 - I'm aware of them while I'm rolling or something,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.600
 I guess, I don't know.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.960
 - When things of yours get more permanently retired,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.840
 would you put them in a singular place?

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.280
 - Permanently retired, we give them away

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.400
 to the thrift store.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.680
 - Oh, okay, so that actually feels better.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.480
 So here's my-- - It does it, okay.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.800
 I feel bad when I drop boxes full of stuff

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.600
 that we don't want there, like, I don't know.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.600
 - There was definitely a phase during COVID

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.720
 where I was making a crazy amount of money,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.040
 was making a crazy amount of money

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.120
 and like literally anything that I saw,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.120
 like I was just like, I'm just gonna get it,

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.800
 'cause it just means, you know, nothing.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.960
 - Yeah. - Like has no impact

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.480
 on my finances.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.200
 And I ended up buying like a lot of stuff.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.520
 There's a reason why I have two longboards here

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.160
 and a long word behind me, which are each like $2,000 each.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.000
 It would just-- - I didn't know

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.600
 they were that expensive, wow, okay.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.280
 - Yeah, they're electric so that later,

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.480
 I'm causing a lot, yeah.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.280
 Like I just piled up with a bunch of things

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.640
 and I will say for me personally,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.000
 that was reflecting on that, like,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.520
 that wasn't the right balance.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.760
 I would see like, 'cause I was in New York,

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.360
 like when you, you don't have a lot of space,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.160
 but you have stuff that you don't use anymore,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.200
 it like really sticks out.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.840
 And then you would start seeing these like piles of things

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.520
 or like in your closet, like a bunch of things that--

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.360
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.440
 - You just bought on a whim

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.960
 and then you're literally never gonna touch again.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.120
 And I got this image of my head where I'm like,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.360
 wow, so many products that get built

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.640
 are just future garbage.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.600
 Like if you look at Shark Tank,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.480
 there's some great products on Shark Tank,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.440
 but you know a lot of products there

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.600
 are something that are gonna get like popular,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.000
 sell $10 million worth and like just die.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.520
 And every single person that buys that

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.960
 is never gonna actually use it long term.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.360
 So they're like just manufacturing future garbage.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.880
 I think that aspect of it I've like had trouble with.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.520
 And there's also these diminishing returns where

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.480
 when you like go from not having money to having money,

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.440
 it's like crazy when you're able to buy all this stuff

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.440
 that you couldn't.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.960
 But then after you're in that phase for a while,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.320
 like you get the new thing and you're bored of it of a day

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.200
 and it's like, it's not actually impacting your life that much.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.560
 So I've been trying to like make myself

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.960
 a wait a couple days before I would like pull the trigger

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.560
 on something and I end up not a lot of the times.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.240
 And the other side of it is I'm trying to force myself

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.400
 to have like a clear pipeline of if I get something

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.480
 and I don't wanna use it,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.920
 I don't wanna just sit in my closet forever.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.320
 Like I need to have a way to have someone

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.000
 that can get some use out of it, take it.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.600
 And I also put some constraints on things.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.720
 So I wouldn't say I'm like like some aesthetic,

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.520
 aesthetic, what's the word?

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.640
 A aesthetic-- - I don't actually know

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.480
 what word you're trying to say.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.680
 - There's a word aesthetic,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.800
 it's like you've given up all earthly possessions

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.400
 or something, it's like to that extreme.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.600
 I'm definitely like not going to an degree.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.480
 - I really wanna know what it is now.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.080
 - It's like the word aesthetic, but it's spelled differently.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.400
 In a lot of ways, it's like the opposite of aesthetic.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.040
 - Is it associated with like a certain belief system?

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.520
 - Yeah, I think it's going to Eastern philosophy thing.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.840
 Yeah, so the reason I keep looking over my right is

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.920
 'cause my closet door is open

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.680
 and this is where I put all my stuff and looking at it now,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.080
 like I've gotten rid of a lot of things

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.880
 and it's like gone to people that are actually going to use it.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.520
 But I do think there's a lot of stuff that's made in the world

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.160
 that's like very clearly just you should garbage.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.120
 - Yeah, like I've got my, I don't know,

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.840
 I had an iPhone 12 or whatever number it was

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.560
 and whatever number is now 15, I don't know.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.640
 I just got a new iPhone, it had been a few iPhones

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.600
 that I skipped. - Yeah.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.480
 - But like the old iPhone, it's just sitting up there

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.360
 in my room and I don't know what to do with it.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.600
 I was going to recycle it and they never sent a box.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.440
 - Yeah.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.920
 - Apple was going to take it back anyway.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.600
 - On that topic, so another thing that I look at

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.760
 that makes me feel bad is I have a stack of phones

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.280
 that are like, - Yeah, we've got old phones

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.200
 that like maybe the kids will use them some day.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.040
 - No, they won't.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.040
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.280
 But I know there's like a efficient, productive way

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.320
 to like as a society, there's someone out there

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.480
 that knows like the right thing to do with them.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.520
 But this is why, once one of the biggest things

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.240
 I'm happy with switching to Apple,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.080
 'cause they have like this whole giant global system

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.080
 of like readjusting old phones and like

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.480
 refurbishing them and like reselling them and everything.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.320
 - Yeah, they do.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.960
 - But now I just traded my phone every single time

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.600
 and I don't have to feel bad when I upgrade

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.120
 'cause I know that they can do the most efficient

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.200
 possible thing.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.040
 - Yeah.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.240
 - And I wish that existed with like every piece

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.880
 of electronic, there's some companies in Miami

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.920
 that like just specialize in that for electronics

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.160
 and I need to like look into that a little bit more, but.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.000
 - Yeah.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.200
 - Yeah, for me, if I'm getting rid of this stuff

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.400
 in a way where I feel okay about,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.960
 I don't like worry about it too much.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.280
 That's really the part that bothers me.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.920
 - So, okay, getting away from like the consumerism angle,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.480
 am I missing, am I missing other things in my life?

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.280
 So, 'cause that's what I was really getting at.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.360
 Do you feel like, do you do like meditation or anything?

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.000
 - Jay, coworker, he has gotten super in meditation.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.560
 He's been, he does it every single morning.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.080
 He's been doing it for a very long time now

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.600
 and he's hit that threshold where it like has turned

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.480
 into another thing where like you're actually doing it

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.080
 correctly and it feels like this crazy like almost

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.400
 - Like hallucinate.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.080
 - Yeah, drugs, exactly.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.720
 And all it took was just like doing it every day

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.720
 even though it felt like it wasn't working at all.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.080
 - Yeah, how long did you say you did that?

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.240
 - I know you've been doing it for at least a year,

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.080
 maybe even more than that, but I think he's tried

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.120
 a few times in his life before and it's the first time.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:58.960
 He's like broken through on it?

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.280
 - Yeah, I've tried it.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.680
 I've maybe done 30 days, something like that,

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.520
 but it didn't ever feel like.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.920
 - Yeah, it took a while.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.240
 But I wouldn't say I have anything that's so concrete

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.080
 in terms of the spirituality category.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.320
 I think I would like to get more stuff like that a little bit.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.200
 But I will say like I do see things from,

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.000
 like I don't look at everything in life

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.680
 like super logically or rationally.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.280
 So I think that kind of steps in that direction.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.960
 Like I feel there's all sorts of like subtle ways

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.800
 to get to this.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.720
 One thing I really believe in is like taking care

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.960
 of the stuff that you use for work.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.960
 So there's like older ideas that you see in movies

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.200
 and stuff that I think have just stuck with me.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.920
 Like there's this cliche of like a samurai taking care

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.200
 of his equipment and like treating his like sword

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.600
 and like there's almost like spiritual way

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.000
 where he treats it like it to get a real entity.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.200
 I feel that way with like the stuff that I use for work

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.520
 and I like think about it in that way.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.960
 And it's not this rational thing.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.040
 I'm like, you know, this is the stuff that I use

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.160
 to like make my livelihood and I have this like relationship

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.560
 with it and kind of personifies it a little.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.960
 So I think a lot of places in my life

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.760
 like I have like a more primitive view

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.880
 or like a more like, I don't know what the word is.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.080
 Like it's almost like magical thinking I guess.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.320
 - Yeah.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.680
 - So I feel that and I think I'm naturally inclined.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.440
 It just leads to go in that direction a little bit

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.040
 and I think I need to like pull that out of myself more.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.920
 - Lean into it.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.760
 Yeah. - Yeah.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.520
 - You feel that way? - Yeah.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.760
 Well, I like, I guess I feel that way about things

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.040
 like my keyboard or like, yeah, I guess to a certain extent

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.960
 the way I customize things, they do feel,

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.920
 I've thought like about the lightsaber,

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.600
 like the Star Wars lore.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.360
 Like a lot of what we do as developers,

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.320
 once you've done it for 10 years,

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.040
 you kind of need that like, I don't know,

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.760
 expression that outlet to like customize your environment

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.680
 that you spend so many hours in.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.440
 So like, I also may tweet the other day

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.080
 about like having a fancy keyboard

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:09.080
 or having like, rice out VIM or whatever.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.960
 I think it'll make you a good programmer.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.520
 And it's not about, it's just about like,

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.360
 at some point you're gonna want those things

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.360
 to just feel like your own little home.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.960
 And I definitely thought about it in terms of,

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.920
 oh, you said the sword, like in terms of this thing

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.920
 that has brought me all of my income throughout my life.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.360
 That's not spiritual, but I think it is.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.080
 It kind of is in the sense that like you take a step back

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.440
 and you realize that like crazy and miraculous

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.760
 some of this stuff around you isn't like,

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.920
 I mean, I feel this way, to be honest,

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.960
 like every morning when I go outside,

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.840
 so it's something on days where it's sunny,

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.240
 like I'll stand outside in the morning

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.360
 and I'll feel the sun and it just feels like so crazy good.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.880
 And I'm just like, it feels amazing to be alive.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.840
 I can't believe this exists.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.520
 But I think, yeah, you have moments

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.040
 where you can reflect on that stuff.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.800
 And even with work, I think to me the tension

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.960
 is really between like rationality and efficiency

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.880
 and like doing things more off of faith or belief

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.600
 without having a reason.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.240
 A lot of big work decisions I do

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.440
 are way more in the category of like gut feel.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.440
 Like when I meet someone, do I wanna work with them?

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.600
 Who do I feel like my gut?

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.280
 Like do I get a really good feeling?

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.320
 I don't like think about it as like,

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.560
 our company is like this and we need these skills

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.800
 and we like don't have these skills.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.360
 I mean, I don't like to work that way for a lot of things.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.760
 But when I do deals with other people,

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.640
 like I don't need to like have a million contracts to sign.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.560
 I just wanna feel good about the person

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.200
 and do a handshake deal.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.800
 I think there's like aspects of life

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.440
 where you can go one way or the other.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.440
 And I feel like in the modern world,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:51.440
 we go really way too far like the rational thought process.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.280
 Yeah, I do.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.680
 Explanation for everything.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.960
 Yeah, I think that's where I'm just feeling like,

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.040
 I go too hard that way, I should find some balance

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.840
 and figure out how to introduce.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.280
 I think I've talked about this before,

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.920
 like especially with family, like having kids

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.800
 not wanting to like have no beliefs

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.200
 or spiritual aspects to my life.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.200
 Like that just feels bad.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.800
 Like they're just kind of like left

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.560
 to figure that stuff out on their own.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.000
 Like I try to prepare them for other things in life.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.920
 Why not have that as part of it?

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.760
 I don't know.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.120
 Yeah, just do stuff that doesn't make sense.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.680
 Like do you guys have like the thing that's funny for me

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.560
 is Latin people are super, are like very superstitious.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.760
 Like so my wife's family is like really superstitious.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.040
 And like I like to like, I really like to like play with it

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.760
 'cause I'll say stuff that they find like,

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.960
 oh you can't say that 'cause if you say that it'll happen.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.560
 So I love messing with that, that if things.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.240
 But yeah, like this comes,

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.680
 this shows up in so many places, right?

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.120
 Like if you, I know there's people that are like,

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.720
 that are like fans of a sports team

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.840
 and they'll have some like ritual they do before every game.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.160
 'Cause they feel like there's some connection to it.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.960
 So yeah, just like doing stuff that doesn't make sense,

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.080
 but it doesn't mean there's like something there though.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.720
 Yeah, just like make stuff up.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.520
 Sometimes I'm like the other day I was thinking like,

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.680
 maybe I should just have some like random like ritual

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.200
 I do before I start every day of work.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.880
 And in my head I'll be like, if I don't do this,

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.600
 I'm not gonna have a good day.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.200
 And it's just like a totally made up thing,

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.040
 but you know, something to it.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.160
 - There was something, some train of thought you took

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.120
 on Twitter that I want to talk about.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.760
 Oh, maybe it's the react stuff.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.120
 Absolutely lots of people came out like well respected people

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.480
 that don't like just like come out and say bad things

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.920
 about things for no reason.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.240
 And then it's not that they said bad things,

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.440
 but just express frustration.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.320
 So Cassidy and Tanner, the two that come to mind,

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.000
 are there other people I missed?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.840
 - Yeah, there were a few others too.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.680
 So just to summarize, they both wrote like,

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.000
 nothing extreme just minor, not minor,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 but like they've just felt this building frustration

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 in the direction of react and how it doesn't align

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.200
 with the stuff that they care about.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.240
 And they felt that way, they feel that way for a while.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.480
 And it's nothing major.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.320
 It's not like fundamentally technical or anything.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.640
 And I think that's, with these types of topics,

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.680
 it's tough 'cause people like bring up the technicalities

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.800
 of like, no, like what you're saying is not true

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.040
 'cause you can still do this and you can sit,

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.280
 then they bring up all the technical details,

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.360
 but it's not really about that.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.880
 It's just about the vibe and the direction.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.800
 - It's vibes man.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.120
 - And what react cares about today.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.960
 You know, it might not be what you care about

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.440
 and it feels always feels not great to be building

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.120
 on something where you feel like secondary.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.360
 If it's not technically true, it just feels,

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.280
 it can feel that way.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.960
 So I think a bunch of people wrote stuff.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.680
 My thing with this week was just like,

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.120
 I cannot believe to the extent that people

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.800
 can talk about RFCs.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.520
 Like this is like so crazy to me.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.160
 I'm like, they're really not that confusing.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.320
 - Is it a scyop?

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.800
 Is it being seeded by people who just want to see RSCs

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.760
 talked about more?

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.640
 'Cause I do wonder how we keep coming back around to it.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.760
 - Because Dan is like, very into the conversation

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.080
 even though it's frustrating for him

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.560
 because people are arguing with him.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.600
 - Yeah, why did Dan make a new Twitter by the way?

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.520
 I didn't catch that happening.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.760
 - This is a funny detail.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.440
 So Dan Abramov was working at meta,

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.960
 obviously for the past couple of years on React.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.880
 He decided to leave and guess where he joined.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.480
 - Wait, did he go to herself?

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.760
 - No, he went to blue sky.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.920
 And because he went to blue sky,

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.320
 Twitter shadow band is a real account.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.160
 So petty, the petty is again.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.880
 - People work at blue sky?

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.040
 - Yeah, I know, I feel like--

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.720
 - Dan Abramov works at blue sky.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.560
 - Blue sky.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.520
 - I need a minute to just soak that in.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.920
 - That's like three Twitter replacements ago.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.520
 Blue sky.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.960
 - I know, but I guess that's what this is--

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.600
 - Did they offer him like a truckload?

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.760
 Like what motivates Dan Abramov?

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.040
 - 'Cause I think he's genuinely, I think,

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.800
 so I remember when he was talking about leaving

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.480
 and I remember when he like,

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.320
 he said that he knew where he was gonna go

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.880
 and he wasn't joining there for a month

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.040
 or a couple months.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.840
 I think at that point, Blue Sky was actually like the,

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.320
 the thing everyone was like jumping to.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.280
 So I guess there was like some momentum behind it,

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.720
 but I can see why conceptually it's interesting.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.320
 Like conceptually of all the Twitter replacements.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.960
 - Oh, that's the one that Jack is involved with, right?

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.800
 - Yeah.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.400
 Hey, I have shares in that company, I think.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.240
 - Oh, hey.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.080
 - Yeah.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.280
 - Your block or whatever?

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.200
 - No, that block.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.520
 I think conceptually is probably the most interesting.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.240
 So if you're someone that's like interested

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.960
 in what social media can look like,

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.120
 that I would say is like the most interesting,

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.160
 weird take on it.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.560
 Like whether it's gonna be successful or not,

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.000
 I can see how that's like a stimulating way

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.320
 of doing that stuff.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.160
 But yeah, he works there.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.000
 And then he got a...

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 - He got Shadow Band, so he got a new account.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:50.840
 Wow.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.920
 - And Deb is saying his new account is also Shadow Band,

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.640
 but I've seen it a lot, I've seen it all over my feed.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.080
 So I don't know to what degree.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.080
 - Interesting.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.800
 I'm so glad I asked, 'cause that's why I didn't know

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.440
 he worked at Blue Sky.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.800
 I wouldn't have found out either.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.720
 - I didn't know either for a while.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.920
 And I was like, and I saw all the Shadow Band stuff

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.600
 and I asked someone and they were like,

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.680
 "Oh, I see."

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.760
 - Wild.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.840
 I don't know, just like when I think of Dan

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.920
 leaving Facebook and going somewhere else,

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.360
 I would never have guessed Blue Sky.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.600
 I guess I see what you're saying in terms of like,

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.280
 if you're gonna end up at a Twitter Quon in place,

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.960
 that's an interesting one, I guess.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.040
 - Yeah.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.560
 Going back to this RSC talk, it is like,

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.800
 I don't think it's a scyop.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.880
 I'm just, it's just wild to me how interested people are

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.160
 in like, I feel people are faking the confusion.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.480
 - I was gonna say, I don't find it confusing at all.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.400
 - We knew it.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.320
 - I've never thought it was confusing.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.000
 I just thought like, the vibes, the react vibes,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.080
 just bothered me.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.760
 - Yeah, but this whole week has just been about like,

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.000
 finding the inner truth of RSCs

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.160
 and what they really are and find the perfect frickin' metaphor

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.000
 for a split.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.360
 - Yeah, like.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.920
 - There's signs on dollar bills and we gotta figure out.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.480
 - Yeah, they're like trying to create some like,

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.560
 like universal physics model,

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.840
 the equivalent level complexity of RSCs

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.880
 explains the whole universe and the world

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.920
 and everything there is.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.920
 That's what it feels like to me.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.760
 I feel like they're like,

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.640
 we're like trying to look that deep into it.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.360
 And I just, and it's kind of the reason why again,

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.640
 I started on following a bunch of people because I,

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.040
 it just is not worth my, this entering my brain.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.520
 And the reason I don't follow is not a criticism of people.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.840
 It's a criticism of myself because when I see this stuff,

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.760
 I can't just ignore it.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.280
 It like does end up in my head and I do end up thinking about it.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.560
 And it's just, it's just a waste.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.800
 I just want to focus on other things.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.000
 But it just, it has, I literally thought it was going to be

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.440
 a day or two, but it's still going.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.080
 Like today, still going.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.400
 - So this is what I wanted to talk about.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.800
 This is the thing I forgot that I wanted to talk about.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.920
 Because one question I wanted to ask you,

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.400
 somebody say something about, oh, it might have been Ryan

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.040
 that there are people, he kind of came out

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.800
 in defense of React with a tweet and that mentioned

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:05.160
 that there's people incentivized to kind of like,

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.480
 make you think the end of React is coming.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.600
 And I had had the thought before I saw his tweet,

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.880
 like, is there just like some like movement

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.160
 of anti-reactism that's motivated by something?

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.040
 But I couldn't come up with,

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.360
 and I still can't come up with, what would the incentive be?

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.400
 Who is incentivized to see?

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.080
 I mean, besides like, I guess other frameworks,

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.480
 if you want to have a scarcity mindset, like solid JS,

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.200
 I could see maybe like a handful of people

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.680
 that like run open source projects that maybe their adoption

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.720
 is in direct competition with React.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.240
 But those aren't the people that are saying stuff,

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.320
 and I can't figure out why would someone be incentivized

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.360
 to trash React, to convince people that React is bad.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.840
 - Yeah, I'm sure it has happened,

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.640
 but I didn't find that point that compelling either.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.520
 I think even the people, like the people you mentioned,

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.840
 like Tanner, people that were kind of bringing it up

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.240
 this past week, that they were just kind of frustrated,

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.680
 they're all continuing to use React,

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.240
 and their products are built on React,

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.000
 and they're going to continue to use it for probably ever.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.760
 Those are genuine frustrations.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.240
 Someone like me, I have a lot of incentive,

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.320
 make it be like reactors over.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.560
 'Cause I just find it annoying.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.720
 I just find React annoying,

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.920
 and I don't like how much people talk about it,

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.600
 and I find it extremely boring.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.620
 So personally, yeah.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.920
 - But it's kind of like a manufactured incentive,

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.480
 like it's just like-- - No, I care more

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.200
 about being accurate and not exaggerating,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.680
 so that doesn't actually come into play.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.160
 I don't think it's the end of React at all,

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.240
 but I see how it's not as cherished as it once was.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:48.080
 - Yeah, and I guess I made statements a while back

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.640
 about how I felt about the vibes with React.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.080
 I know I didn't have any motivation

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.120
 to convince people React's bad.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.560
 When I see Cassidy's posts and Tanner's posts,

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.680
 I don't get the sense that they have

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.960
 some like ulterior motive, ulterior?

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.040
 Ulterior, what is that word?

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.800
 - Is it ulterior with a you?

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.960
 Ulterior? - I don't know.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.840
 That's what I just realized.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.520
 I've said ulterior motive all my life,

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.720
 and I don't know what that word is.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.040
 Is that an actual word?

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.320
 Ulterior motive?

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.000
 - I think that, I think these are two different words.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.840
 - Oh boy.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.160
 - Ulterior motive.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.000
 - Okay, ulterior motive is correct,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.440
 and I think ulterior is like the outside of something, right?

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.080
 - Okay, okay.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:29.920
 - No, I don't know.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.760
 - So I don't think those--

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.320
 - I'll sit near my ulterior is not a word.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.160
 - It's not a word.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.360
 - It's only ulterior with a you.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.040
 - With a you, okay.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.880
 Ulterior motives.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.360
 So I was mixing like alternative, alternative, yeah.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.600
 Ulterior, ulterior motives.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.720
 Anyway, I don't think any of us had ulterior motives,

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.480
 at least in that small group that I just mentioned.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.680
 So if the three of us, and we have nothing in common,

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.000
 but like the three individual people come out and say,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.400
 something about the vibes bothers me,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.400
 and we're not communicating about it.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.240
 I don't think Tanner and Cassie communicated about it.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.640
 Like, there's something there.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.640
 What is it?

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.880
 What is it about the vibes, quote unquote?

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.400
 Is it a personality?

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.400
 Is it people?

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.680
 Is it what is it?

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.520
 Docs?

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.000
 Somebody tell me, what is it that we all feel

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.840
 that we don't like?

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.880
 - To me, I think it's a combination of a lot of things.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.320
 Like, foundationally, if you're doing work,

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.240
 you're trying to build products,

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.480
 you're trying to do your day-to-day job.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.600
 And then you don't feel like the work being done

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.840
 and react is lining up with that.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.800
 That's gonna create some weirdness for you under the hood.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.320
 Then if there's like a bunch of marketing with it,

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.240
 and if there's a companies behind these things,

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.480
 and if it's like, you know, there's people behind these things

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.040
 that are pushing certain messages,

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.280
 and there's fights between those people too.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.520
 Like, you know, like next and remakes.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.360
 Like, we haven't seen any kind of blow up lately,

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.800
 but like, it's not like they particularly like each other either.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.080
 So, I think it's just like all these things that,

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:08.400
 it's so much stuff for such a little part.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.520
 Tiny, tiny part of your work.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.360
 That's my guess.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.520
 Like, I think that's why I'm just like,

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.120
 this is not an attention it takes to,

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.920
 which is, I'm really just speaking for myself at this point.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.640
 Like, just an amount of attention and focus it takes.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.360
 It's just like...

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.920
 - I mean, I'm also annoyed.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.880
 Maybe it rubs off.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.040
 Maybe you're making me annoyed at it, but...

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.600
 - I don't blame me.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.440
 - I'm definitely...

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.560
 - Blame the real criminal.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.000
 Dan Abramov, too.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.520
 - Yeah, Dan, blue sky, sorry.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:41.920
 - No, Dan's really, I like every interaction I've had with Dan,

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.880
 and that's what, I don't think it's Dan.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.720
 I think it's...

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.560
 - No, it's not him at all.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.160
 It's not an individual person.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.840
 - It's not an individual person, but it is a vibe,

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.800
 and that's carried out by groups of people, I guess.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.640
 I don't know.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.840
 - There's this thing that's called an emergent conspiracy

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.880
 where you have something that very much

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.440
 looks and operates like a conspiracy,

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:07.440
 but there's no explicit malice or explicit intention

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.800
 to create a conspiracy just emerges out of the complexity

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.160
 of people and their incentives.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.680
 So that's probably really, really all it is.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.720
 I'm just trying to do their best,

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.640
 but given the way things are laid out in the history,

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.520
 it's kind of on a certain path.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.640
 - Yeah, okay.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.480
 Who would've thought?

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:29.080
 The year 2024, the reputation of React would be diminishing,

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.040
 going downward, and the reputation of Zuck would be going up.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.800
 I feel like he's had kind of a...

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.640
 - I hate it.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.960
 I hate it so much.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.040
 - A little boost in his public perception.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.040
 - I know, the freaking cow macadamia nuts shit.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.040
 - I'm sorry, what?

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:43.880
 - Everyone loved that.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.880
 - I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.000
 - Well, you know how he bought this huge property in Hawaii,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.840
 and he's had it for a while, but I think...

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.600
 - Did he buy enough Larry Ellis or whatever?

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.920
 Like, part of his life.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.400
 - No, I don't think so.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.320
 I don't think it's an island.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.920
 I think it's a big, I don't know what it is,

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.200
 but he is raising, he's trying to raise the best beef

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:06.760
 in the world there, and he has a bunch of cows,

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.400
 he has a bunch of macadamia trees,

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.480
 and the cows eat macadamia nut and meal,

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.320
 and his kids are involved,

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.040
 and they're kind of like, gonna do all that.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.520
 And for a lot of people, it's like their fantasy of like,

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.520
 I want to quit programming and be a farmer,

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.920
 and it's kind of what their fantasy is.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.280
 So everyone's like super into that,

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.600
 and I just fucking hate Mark Zuckerberg so much.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.080
 - But he's into it too, so I kind of like him now.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.480
 I'm sorry. - Yeah, I know.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.080
 - I'm part of the problem.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.560
 Actually love macadamia nuts too. (laughs)

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.920
 - I love your macadamia nuts also, I have a big of it.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.280
 - They're so sweet, they're just the ones.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.080
 - They're great, they're one of the best nuts.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.560
 - Nobody talks about macadamia nuts.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.280
 Really? - It's the best nut by far.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.600
 - It's one of the best, it's also like, health wise too,

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.160
 it's one of the best options.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.600
 - Is it really expensive or something?

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.840
 There's gotta be a downside.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.680
 - It is, I would say it's definitely more expensive

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.800
 than other stuff, but it's not that crazy.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.320
 You can get a big ass bag.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.320
 - You're investing in your health, you know?

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.360
 You gotta, oh, that's something I want to talk about.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.800
 We talked about last time, I think last week it was,

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.520
 we talked about what's his name, Brian Johnson?

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.680
 - Yeah.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.880
 - I'm participating in a thing.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.040
 - A blueprint 5000 something.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.160
 It's like a big study, me and Casey got in,

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.480
 you had to like apply, and we had to sing a little song,

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.840
 I don't know, we got in.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.800
 And now for like 90 days, I think,

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.720
 we're gonna be taking all the supplements he takes

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.760
 or something, there's like a stack of stuff,

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.560
 and then he's gonna ship us nutty pudding,

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.160
 so we're not to make it.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.360
 There's gonna be all these different things

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.200
 we have to do to adhere to this like study,

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.000
 and they're gonna be taking all these markers

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.040
 along the way with all these 5000 people.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.760
 So it's gonna be fun, it's gonna be interesting.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.960
 - That's really cool.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.640
 I'm so yeah, I'm really excited about the research

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.840
 at ask me the very end they're doing.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.440
 Like it's, it reminds me a lot of what science

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.720
 used to be like in like the 1800s,

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.520
 like at least what I imagined.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.680
 It's always just like some like rich guy.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.500
 - Yeah.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.500
 - That's just like funding his own,

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.240
 like Darwin is just like funding his own

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.600
 trips to the Galapagos and like figuring out evolution.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.440
 - Yeah.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.200
 - It really feels like that.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.240
 - Yeah.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:09.280
 And now it's like going from just the one data point

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.360
 of his body to like potentially thousands of bodies

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.200
 who have to do this, it's interesting.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.240
 We'll see what comes of it I guess.

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.080
 - Yeah, it's great.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.280
 And it just, I also just love this story of,

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.920
 everyone like saw what he was doing initially

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.840
 and it was like, oh, this is like a selfish human

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.680
 that doesn't want to die.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.800
 But then you see this side of it and it's like,

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.640
 we're all gonna benefit.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.960
 So I love when people can be selfish

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.280
 and it's also great for everyone.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.360
 So when are you gonna eat a steak again?

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.360
 - Never.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.680
 - I mean, you're gonna die without ever eating another steak?

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.280
 - Like vegan steak.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.880
 I mean, does that count?

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.240
 - Slab grown steak, don't you sure?

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.080
 - Don't say that.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:45.920
 - Oh, blah grown.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.880
 - Look at these mycelium.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.800
 Well, there's these like mycelium, you know,

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.160
 like mushroom root.

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.240
 There's these like steak and chicken patties

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.440
 that they're making now out of mycelium.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.400
 It's unbelievable.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.240
 Like the texture and the taste.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.920
 They are so good.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.160
 And I don't want something like a bunch of crap.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.680
 And then like, they're like pretty good.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.520
 - That's the same.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.360
 - I mean, I don't know.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.560
 I've never heard of anything made of mycelium.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.600
 So I don't know how processed it has to be.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.880
 Like mycelium are these tiny little threads in the soil.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.520
 I have no idea how they harvest them.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.520
 'Cause they're like super like.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.360
 - Yeah.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.360
 - It's thinner than a hair, right?

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.200
 - Yeah.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.400
 - I don't know how in the world they're creating

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.280
 something out of that.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.200
 It feels like it's probably still pretty heavily processed.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.560
 Not a thing we would eat regularly,

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.680
 but they're really good.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:36.680
 - I mean, I don't mind if it takes a lot of work,

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.480
 that's not necessarily bad for me.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.440
 It just like, 'cause I know with like

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.320
 the meat substitute shit,

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.400
 it was just like a shit ton of weird oils plus like.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.400
 - Yeah.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.320
 - Yeah, and I was like, that doesn't seem worth it.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.720
 - Yeah, no, I don't like to eat that kind of stuff.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.280
 I mean, I'm not looking to replace the taste of steak

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.960
 in my life, but it's interesting all the different products

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.000
 that are coming out of your plant-based.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.120
 - So you're gonna die without ever eating a steak again.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.240
 - So here's the thing.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.280
 I remember like a few years into our journey.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.720
 It's now been 11 years in February.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.720
 I remember a few years into going plant-based,

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.040
 people be like, how do you have the willpower

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.520
 to just not, there's no willpower involved.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.640
 Like once you've done it for a while,

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.280
 and then you have other reasons for doing it

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.760
 that aren't just health, like we go through periods

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.720
 where we eat terribly, like we eat vegan junk food,

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.560
 like lots of it.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.040
 And we just, we lose the motivation and willpower to me.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.760
 Yeah, to care about our health,

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.160
 but we still care about other things

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.880
 that we didn't necessarily get into plant-based eating

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.680
 over those things, but just over time,

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:45.200
 they kind of like became part of our, I guess beliefs, I don't know.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.800
 And so there's no like a bit of tug from those things.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.040
 And not to mention like dairy, certain foods now,

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.000
 just the idea that makes me sick.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.280
 - Yeah, your taste can really get rewired.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.560
 - Yeah, like the idea that getting in my body

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.040
 just makes me want to throw up.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.280
 No temptation, no desire to ever eat products

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.120
 that come from animals.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.520
 We sometimes have honey, like when it's in stuff

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.160
 and it's like, we don't want to cause a scene.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.280
 That's the only like, I think it's a vegan thing

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.360
 that we've crossed the line over the last 11 years.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.040
 - Okay. - Anyway.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.800
 - I gotta trick you.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.720
 - How are you gonna trick me?

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.360
 - I gotta trick you into eating some.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.760
 - No, don't do that.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.800
 That's so awful.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.160
 That is so your brand.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.000
 You would.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.280
 Look at as you sat in the dark.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.440
 - What you said, you said it wasn't a spirit,

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.520
 you're not spiritual.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.000
 So then I feel like I don't feel bad

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.040
 if it's not like a religious thing.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.040
 - What?

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.280
 - So you only would care if, okay, maybe it is religious.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.160
 - Okay, think about it this way.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.560
 - My religious beliefs don't, don't have to be me.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.400
 (laughing)

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.560
 Don't do it next.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.400
 - Yeah.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.240
 Well, think about it this way.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.240
 If I trick someone that's religious into eating meat,

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.280
 they feel like they've committed a sin

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.960
 and that God is gonna punish them.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.120
 And like, that feels bad.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.440
 - Yeah, I feel all those things.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.280
 You better not.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.920
 - I'm gonna come and react to my aunt.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.760
 - I'm gonna be at my aunt.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.840
 - I'm gonna be at my aunties.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.920
 And you're gonna have food at your house

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.880
 or you're gonna say it's vegan.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.200
 I can't eat anything at your house now

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.880
 'cause I know this is a plan of yours.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.040
 (laughing)

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.120
 - No, okay, but actually, I have that,

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.400
 like I said, I have that restaurant

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.240
 that I've been waiting to go to till you're in town

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.040
 'cause there's no reason I'm gonna go to a vegan restaurant.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.040
 - Oh, right, there's a vegan.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.320
 - Of my own accord.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.040
 But I heard it's very good, though.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.240
 - Okay, we're checking it out.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.080
 I can't wait.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:28.920
 - There's actually two--

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.080
 - I think I'm coming the day before

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.320
 and saying the day after.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.840
 I think I made that, I made sure my react-miming trip was--

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.520
 - Do you think you're bringing your family or just you?

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.560
 - Maybe.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.560
 I mean, they're always looking for issues to go to the beach,

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.760
 so.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.400
 - Perfect.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.960
 And then we can go there.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.960
 - Yeah, we can 'cause you live by the beach.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.640
 Well, were we done with the React stuff?

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.440
 It is funny, like, we're all gonna go to React Miami.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.240
 You don't even use React.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.840
 I don't use React really anymore.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.160
 We're all talking about the vibes

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.600
 and how RSTs drive us crazy

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.400
 and all the talking about it nonstop

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.160
 and it's like, oh, React Miami.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.160
 (laughs)

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.920
 - Every single person I've talked to in private

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.480
 has these same feelings.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.240
 Like, every single, like, irrelevant person in the field

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.160
 that you would respect has these exact same feelings.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.000
 So yeah, it just is a weird time.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.800
 But you know what, that's what's great about a conference

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.520
 is like, the topic doesn't really matter

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.360
 'cause you're there to see all the people

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.200
 and that's what matters.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.040
 - It's true.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.360
 It's the party of it.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.400
 - You spend half of React Miami talking about SolidJS

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.720
 anyway, yeah.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.240
 (laughs)

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.680
 - You've gotten everything out of me this week.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.280
 Is there anything you wanted to say?

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.520
 - Going back to what I was saying earlier about it,

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.520
 we're expecting your equipment.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.920
 Like, I was not doing that at all.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.960
 It's crazy how many cascading problems is created.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.960
 So all my cables were just like hanging down

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.800
 to the ground behind my desk.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.440
 - Yeah, that's all the picture.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.720
 - Which, yeah, it was terrible.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.960
 And that was what the desk lifted up.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.000
 So imagine when it was lifted down,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.600
 they're all just lying on the ground.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.080
 (laughs)

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.960
 So we couldn't, it wasn't easy to vacuum

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.800
 underneath the desk.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.440
 - Yeah, yeah, she was just down.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.800
 - When you live in the house, like mine,

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.800
 you're like inside, outside, by going in and out.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.640
 - Oh.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.480
 - As you go.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.320
 - Drag the extra turn.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.160
 - Going in and out.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.680
 (laughs)

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.280
 And there was like, just like,

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.040
 I was just really sort of like sitting dirt.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.120
 Like, there was really just like piles of,

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.080
 it was not, it was getting to a really bad place.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.160
 And I was like, I can't believe I let it get this far.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.160
 - Yeah.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.480
 - And I have clean floors again.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.320
 I feel so much better.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.120
 I think this has to give me like,

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.800
 like a 20% productivity boost.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.640
 It has to.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.480
 - It really does help.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.800
 - When my office is clean,

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.080
 I feel so much better.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.440
 Like sometimes I let stuff build up and,

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.480
 and my wires are always clean.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.140
 I don't, I'm not an animal.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:43.880
 But, but I do sometimes like have boxes piled up

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.680
 or stuff that, I don't know.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.400
 And if I ever just take the time,

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.800
 one morning to clean it up, I do, I just feel good.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.520
 I like to look around and just feel like

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.660
 things are in place.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.640
 It's nice.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.480
 - Important.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.080
 - I don't know about a 20% boost in productivity.

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.120
 That's a little intense, but.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.480
 - I'm gonna, I'm gonna give it a 20%.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.880
 I think it might actually even be higher.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.800
 I think 20% is, is that, is that, is that, like,

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.080
 does it fade over time?

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:06.920
 I mean, surely it doesn't.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.760
 - Yeah, of course.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.600
 - It's not 20% permanent.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.420
 - Yeah.

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.800
 Then I gotta figure out the next thing to change.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.000
 - Yeah, this is your magic thinking, isn't it?

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.440
 You just got magical powers from cleaning your room.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.480
 Now you've got 20% boost.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.840
 Make it so.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.680
 Yeah.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.680
 How do you feel about like manifestation stuff?

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.320
 Casey thinks I manifest stuff.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.280
 She says, I've always said I'm good at making money

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.640
 and I am good at making money.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.720
 Like things like that.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.560
 - This concept has never really clicked that much for me,

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:36.000
 but I, I don't like disagree with it entirely.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.400
 But I think I also just don't know what it is like.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.240
 - There's a book for it.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.080
 - Like what is it?

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:39.920
 Like is it just?

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.760
 - Well, there's a book.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.600
 - There is a book.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.440
 - I know there's a book.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.280
 Whether it's a secret or whatever.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:48.280
 - Bottom stuff and like the fields of energy all around us.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.800
 - Yeah, so I obviously don't believe in that, but.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.600
 (laughing)

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.800
 - So I obviously.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.040
 - That, that's a secret, right?

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.080
 Isn't that the name of the book?

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.440
 - Oh, no, that's not the book I was talking about.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.960
 There's probably lots of books.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.960
 There's lots of books that literally every single thing.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.480
 (laughing)

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.560
 There's been a lot of time for people to write books.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.240
 - I did finally getting back into reading again.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.080
 - Are you?

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.520
 Wait, reading or listening?

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.440
 - No, reading, reading.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.280
 So I've been.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.120
 - Oh, you like sit down with a physical book

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.720
 and move your little finger across the page and read words?

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.560
 - Oh, my finger.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.960
 Oh, am I like nine years old?

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:22.800
 - Yeah.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.640
 - Do you still do that?

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.480
 Do you like?

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.600
 - No, I just, I tried to,

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.360
 I tried to drum up a visual of you setting

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.200
 with your legs across a little height.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.440
 - I think you finger read.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.280
 - Glasses.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.120
 - What's up?

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:31.960
 - I finger read.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:32.800
 - Is that what it's called?

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.960
 - I can read fingers.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.800
 (laughing)

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.920
 - Not palms.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.360
 Those are easy.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.280
 It's really hard when you just try to get to finger reading.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.720
 (laughing)

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.320
 - Stupid, very stupid.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.160
 (laughing)

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.960
 Very stupid set of sentences we just said.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.320
 - Yeah, really nice.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.800
 - But yeah, I've been like just turning off my phone

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.920
 before bed for like an hour and just been,

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.560
 it's funny, I've had this completely different-

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.720
 - The three, two, one.

00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.960
 - Angle with reading,

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.000
 every time I read before, I'm always like,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.680
 for some reason trying to read as fast as possible.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.360
 And I had this very obvious realization, like,

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.200
 for what?

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.080
 Like why am I trying to finish this?

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:07.920
 Really fast.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.880
 I actually don't, this is like the one area in my life

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.160
 where I'm like, I don't care about being good at reading

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.120
 or like having read a lot of books or like,

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:14.960
 I don't really-

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:15.800
 - What are you reading like?

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.960
 - Are you reading fiction?

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.560
 - Yeah, I found like a fantasy book.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.400
 - Oh.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.920
 - So if you're reading for fun, yeah, who cares?

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.120
 But I think I have that feeling

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.440
 'cause I'm always reading nonfiction stuff

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.440
 and I'm trying to just learn it

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.600
 and like getting my head as fast as possible.

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.520
 - I would do that with fiction too mostly

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.760
 'cause I just was into the story.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.160
 And I was like, I need to know what happens.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:36.240
 But yeah, but now I'm like, this is just a sleep aid.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.400
 Like I'm trying to read this to like make my,

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.840
 'cause I get super sleepy when I read.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.280
 So I literally read for like, I said an hour

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.240
 but really ends up being like 15 minutes,

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.880
 maybe like even 10 minutes sometimes.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.160
 And I just fall asleep like with my Kindle.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.000
 - Oh, you fall asleep.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:51.840
 - And it's perfect.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.600
 - You just like use that to literally take yourself to sleep.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.360
 - Yeah, and it's great. I read super slow.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.200
 - Yeah.

00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.040
 - Depends how I feel.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.040
 And I'm just trying to, I'm just using it as like a way

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.480
 to go to sleep and I've been really into it.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.320
 And the story's good.

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.720
 So it's really real grown up doing this.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.760
 - It's like a grown up.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.800
 - Since we talked about the sleep stuff,

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.440
 I've heard about the three, two, one.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.280
 Have you heard of this?

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.520
 Like three hours before bed, stop eating.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.600
 Two hours before bed, stop drinking.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.120
 And one hour before bed, stop looking at your phone

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:20.960
 or any other thing.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:21.800
 - Two hours before it stopped drinking.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.480
 Like stop drinking alcohol.

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.160
 - No, just like water, anything.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.000
 - Oh really?

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.640
 I drink a lot of water right before bed.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.480
 - Really?

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.120
 Do you have to get up and pee at night?

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.440
 - Nope, 'cause I don't have the butter

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.520
 of a small child like you.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.560
 - Is it 'cause I'm 37 or did I always have it?

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.720
 I don't remember anything. - I can't remember.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.080
 It was years ago, probably.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.760
 Far enough back, but I don't remember.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.760
 - Huh.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.960
 Well, I hope when you're 37,

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.920
 you have to pee so I don't have to worry about my prostate.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.520
 Well, by then I'll have known if it was something

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.360
 I need to worry about.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.760
 - Well, I'll have died from whatever.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.120
 Something just thing in this study.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.040
 - Okay, let's just get a little dark.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.160
 Let's not manifest my death here on the podcast, please.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.760
 (laughing)

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.040
 - Well, wait until the last hour,

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.120
 what do you have to do for the last hour?

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.280
 - Don't be on your phone.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.120
 Just like you said.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.120
 - And does that work?

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.200
 Did that help you?

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.840
 Are you doing that?

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.960
 - Yeah, so I stopped eating way before three hours.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:13.920
 I stopped drinking.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.080
 I have been stopping my water intake a lot earlier.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.640
 And I haven't had to get up.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.480
 So I've gone a week now, I think.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.000
 I haven't had to get up in the night and pee,

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.320
 which is super new for me.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.240
 It's nice.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.520
 And then the phone thing, yeah, I'm not usually on my phone.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.760
 The evening, well, it's the only time

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.600
 Casey and I get together.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.120
 We have like an hour and a half after the boys go to sleep

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.600
 before we go to sleep.

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.600
 So we're not really on our phones

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:38.840
 during that stretch anyway.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:42.240
 Not having to get up to pee has been huge

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.600
 for my sleep, I think.

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.440
 - Nice.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.160
 Yeah, you did bring that up, but it's simple solution.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.080
 - Well, it's simple solution.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.920
 Stop drinking water before bed.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.720
 (laughs)

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.120
 - The most overly hydrated person I know.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.560
 - Yeah, I do drink a lot of water.

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.400
 It's true.

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.240
 If I don't drink a lot of water though,

00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.920
 or maybe it's 'cause I am drinking too much water.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.240
 I cramp, like in Jiu Jitsu, I get like a lot of muscle cramps.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.480
 I've been trying liquid IVs.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.080
 Those seem to really help.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:09.920
 - They couldn't.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:10.760
 - Maybe I still have enough electrolyte.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.520
 - I was gonna say, don't you,

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.280
 you were talking about how many bananas you guys buy.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.120
 Like, I'm surprised.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.480
 - Yeah, I eat a lot of bananas.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.080
 Yeah, I don't eat in breakfast today.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.720
 It's 10 o'clock.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.760
 Max, I gotta eat.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.320
 - It's 11 for me.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.920
 And I mean either.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.000
 - You have any neither?

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:25.840
 - Mm-hmm.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:26.880
 - Look at us.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.720
 Either, either.

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.040
 - We're intermittent fasting, I guess.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:30.880
 There's a thing for everyone.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.720
 - Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.200
 Accidental intermittent fasting.

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.280
 (laughs)

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.120
 It's funny.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.280
 - Okay, we can end it.

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.520
 - Yeah, yeah, let's end it.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:40.360
 - All right.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:41.200
 See you guys. - See you.
