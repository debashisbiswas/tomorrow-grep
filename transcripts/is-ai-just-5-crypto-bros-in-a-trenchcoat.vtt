00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
 For those of you that are just dying with anticipation from all of using we've been doing.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.700
 There's probably a whole subreddit about this, the mystery project.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.420
 People who do the types of work, they're trying to hack my email.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.580
 Your wait will end, your misery will end, because we will be announcing what it is on the first day of...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:43.680
 [music]

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.600
 Damn, I look frickin' yellow.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.840
 Something is wrong with my white balance.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.240
 My monitor is not very good.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.200
 Like the one that I actually see you on, my teleprompter.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.880
 But your actual monitor is probably very good.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.080
 Oh yeah, it's really good.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.280
 But this teleprompter one, I don't know, the colors, everything just seemed kind of off.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.280
 So I can't really tell.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 You can get away with anything.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.280
 You have the Apple display?

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 Yes.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.560
 The embarrassingly expensive one, yes.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.360
 And I bought the stand, everyone always asks, "Did you buy the thousand dollars in it?"

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.360
 "Yes, I did.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.360
 I have the same."

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.240
 Do you think that's going to last you like...

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.480
 So I've considered getting that a bunch.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.000
 And the thing that always solves me is I can't...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.840
 Something in the back of my head is like, "Okay, how long of a purchase is this?

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.440
 Am I going to have this for five plus years?"

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.000
 I would easily do it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.280
 I guess I've had it a couple years, two years maybe.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.640
 I don't know why I wouldn't.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.800
 I guess I don't know what it would...

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.800
 What goes out on the monitor?

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.640
 Is the backlight going out on the monitor?

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.640
 No, I'm not saying the monitor would break.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.440
 I'm saying, "Am I going to want...

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.800
 Is something better going to show up?

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.240
 Am I going to want a different teleprompter?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 Am I going to..."

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.240
 Gotcha.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.240
 Apple Vision Pro, that whole thing.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 Exactly.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.880
 River Apple Vision Pro.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 Yeah.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.080
 Yeah, I guess something could change.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.080
 But yeah, I don't know.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.000
 When you spin this special monitor, I just can't imagine ever not using it now.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 It just looks cool.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 The back of it's all honeycomb.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Yeah, that is cool.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Liz really likes it.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.160
 But in my head, I'm like, "She can't have a better monitor than me."

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160
 Like, what the hell?

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
 I'm the one that's into computers.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.240
 If he was a robber, I'd have more sense of monitor than me.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.640
 Liz has been doing some work.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.160
 I've been seeing her progress.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.840
 Yeah, it looks really good, right?

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840
 The stuff she's working on.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.840
 Yeah.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.480
 This is the financial thing you're working on, right?

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.480
 Yeah.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.960
 I've been very inconsistent about how secretive I am.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.000
 But yeah, it's coming out nice and she's been doing just entirely front-end stuff and...

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 That's the way.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Yeah, it's great.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 I feel like every week she does...

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Start her on the front end.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Yeah.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Take that off your plate.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.520
 Which means I don't have to do it.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.520
 Yeah.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520
 Yeah.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.800
 I set up, but I mean, it's such like a nice symbiosis because when you're starting out,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.400
 you really need something that's...

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.440
 You can see and like touch.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.440
 Yeah.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.440
 So I think front-end makes sense for people to start out and also like, I don't want

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.440
 to do it.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.840
 Also, I don't want to do it.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.040
 That's my theory, that we start people in the industry on the front end because nobody

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.600
 wants to do front-end.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.600
 That's...

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.480
 I know like the whole like you get feedback and like, "Oh, you can see."

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.760
 We make up all these reasons.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.760
 Yeah.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.160
 But I honestly like, you get all that feedback in a CLI or something else.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.160
 That's true.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.760
 Yeah.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.760
 It is funny though.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.000
 I've talked about this before, I think on a stream, like, I think the most complicated

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.080
 stuff I've approached in software development is front-end stuff.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.080
 Like, you get into the layers involved in a modern front-end and like, for people new

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.440
 to the industry that are just getting started and they're like, they just learned how to

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.040
 do Hello World and JavaScript or something and then they're like, "Here, here's React

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.640
 and Babel and whatever and all these other things that do things I don't even understand.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.120
 I've been doing this 15 years.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.360
 Oh, and you need to also learn how to style stuff and then JavaScript runs in the browser.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.360
 Also on your server.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.360
 Well, not really the server.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.360
 It's the server for the front-end.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.360
 It's the back-end for the front-end.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.360
 It's not really the back-end.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.480
 Like, I can't imagine anything more complicated than like being thrown into a modern front-end

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.840
 and being like, "Hey, get your feet wet and computer science.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840
 Here you go."

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.000
 Yeah, and I think I kind of experienced some of that because I was trying to teach her

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.920
 everything and just to give a sense of this.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.000
 When I say teach everything, I mean, everything you just said plus basic ideas like, "This

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 is your terminal.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 This is your code editor.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.600
 This is like, you know all that stuff."

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.440
 So how to use our tools, yeah, you're going to laugh, so she's using Neo-Vin.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.080
 So I'm just like, if I'm going to do it, if we're going to just like go completely from

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.840
 scratch, like, might as well just get it on the front-end.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.920
 Yeah, get it all out of the way.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.480
 Not only is she using that, I was like, "I don't want her set up to deviate from mine

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.240
 at all because there's just crazy synergy with her.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.680
 I can just jump on her computer and just like do some of her help her."

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:06.140
 So she also has a server now that she is Hintu and she has a Tmux session running, so she's

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.140
 learning Tmux.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.140
 Oh my word.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.720
 It's really new to how to use Neo-Vin inside there.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.120
 It's been great because when I need to help her, I can just SSH to the same server and

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.040
 attach to the same Tmux thing.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.960
 It's like a cloud-ruthing built-in.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.200
 Wait, so two people can be attached to the same Tmux session?

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.200
 I didn't know that.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.960
 Like multiple clients and it works.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.960
 Yeah.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.400
 So like if you type, does she automatically see it?

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.400
 Yep.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.400
 It's like a screen share, basically.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.400
 Wow.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.000
 But it's like low bandwidth screen share.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.160
 How have we not in this remote post-COVID world, how have we not just embraced this as

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.680
 like the best way ever to like pair program?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.680
 Well, yeah.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.760
 And people have brought, I've seen this set up a while ago, like people have mentioned

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.840
 it's why I thought to do it.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.360
 But it's one of those cases where how often can you mandate such a strict set up for everyone

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.680
 on your team?

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.680
 Yeah.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.680
 Yeah.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.680
 I guess they see that.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.960
 I'm surprised there's not like a SAS service that's come out that's just built on top of

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.720
 Tmux and basically gives you this like multiplayer programming environment.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.960
 I think there's VS Code Server now, which is kind of that, right?

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.280
 I think the actual editor runs in the server.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.720
 And then your front end, which is still VS Code, the UI still rendering on your side.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.960
 I think it connects to the server somehow and like, yeah, I was looking into that because

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.920
 I was like, if I do need to one day use VS Code, can I still get this server client set

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.160
 up and they can support it?

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.160
 So.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.160
 Interesting.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.160
 So, yeah.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.160
 So there's all of that.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.720
 And that stuff, I would say is complicated, but it all makes sense like it's like well-designed

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.000
 old tested stuff.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Old stuff.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Yeah.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Makes sense.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.800
 And I get her to like understand our application and yeah, there's like so many layers there.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.400
 And it was actually great because I was working on SST aren't at the same time.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.400
 And I was teaching her how to like bring all this stuff up and my bar for how simple we

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.200
 had to make things just went like crazy high because I was like, I can't really explain

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.800
 why you do certain things.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.480
 I just couldn't find the words to explain.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.080
 You need to run SST dev and you need to run SST dev with your front end.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.760
 And I could not explain really to someone that doesn't really know anything like what

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.760
 that meant.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.720
 Like, what was the first one doing versus the second one?

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.680
 So there was all these little things that just got simplified to that process.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.600
 So SST ions, so simple, your spouse could use it.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.760
 Your non technical spouse.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.200
 And then so I think her process and learning worked out really well.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.680
 So she learned pure HTML CSS stuff first.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.880
 Then I dropped her into our solid code base, but she just works on making component.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.520
 I taught her how like because we use CSS and JS stuff.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.960
 So I taught her how the stuff she learned, how it like maps over and that was pretty

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.960
 easy.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.960
 But she just works on building components, composing them together.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.200
 And now and she's all the stuff she's posted.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.480
 She's posted without knowing any JavaScript.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.440
 So now she's like learning the JavaScript stuff.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.440
 Yeah, it's a good point.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.880
 I guess you can get pretty far before you have to really start messing with the interactivity

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.880
 bits.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.880
 Yep, exactly.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.840
 So she would make like these scratch components and I would like wire them up correctly, which

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.880
 took me like, you know, 10 minutes, usually once he was fully done.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.880
 Yeah.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.000
 So now, but now she's working on the actual like JavaScript part.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.120
 And yeah, I mean, it's only been one or two months.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.320
 And with that, and she's using chat GPs of tutor, I think we've talked about this before, but

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:37.680
 I think the killer thing with chat GPT is when you're learning, and even as a professional,

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.840
 you understand, you can do things, you understand it, but there's all these little questions

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.680
 that you like never bothered asking because you know, you don't understand them, but it's

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.480
 not pressing enough of an issue to actually like understand how this works.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.520
 There's always like some random CSS property, like, you know how to get it to do what you

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.560
 want, but you don't really understand how it works.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:01.000
 Whereas with chat GPT, she could just like instantly interrogate it about any little doubt

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 she has.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.120
 So her knowledge ends up being like way more complete than mine in a lot of ways.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.840
 Like she like really understands grid.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.000
 She really understands flex.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.760
 Okay, I need to start asking to add you to about grid and flex because I realized the

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:20.280
 other day that I have built front ends like UI for 15 years now.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:26.480
 And I've always felt like I can like replicate a design pixel perfect, you know, like I can

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.480
 do that work.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.960
 And then it realized at some point, like, I bet this takes me way longer than most people.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.000
 And there's certain things that I still struggle just like, should I use grid or flex here,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.560
 which is more efficient, which would accomplish this better.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.720
 Some cases, it's like clearly I need a grid here because of, you know, uniform spacing

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.400
 between certain things and different rows, like it's sometimes is very clear.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.120
 Sometimes it's not, and I realized I've never learned any of this.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.160
 I've just messed around until I figured stuff out.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.960
 So to like go back to an AI tutor and ask it some very fundamental questions, I can

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.040
 see how you're building up a much better foundation.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.040
 Yeah.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040
 You're not just winging it.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.040
 Yeah.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.040
 Yeah.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.480
 So she like knows certain things that I just like explain certain things to me where I'm

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.560
 like, oh, I've always wondered about that.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:18.280
 So the case for humans though, I'm sure I could take Josh Como's CSS for JavaScript people

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.280
 or whatever it's called.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.280
 Yeah.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.280
 I bet I could take that course.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.580
 And it may be even more efficient in terms of learning the concepts.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.920
 Somebody's really good at teaching it.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.920
 I don't know.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.920
 I've considered taking that one.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.800
 The thing though is even there, so I've read some of his like deep dives on grid and

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800
 flex.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.800
 And it was really good.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.800
 Like it really rounded out my knowledge.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:43.040
 But even there, there's always this like last mile gap where like specific question for

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.040
 my specific thing.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.040
 Yeah.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.760
 It's like me as a person, like you did a great job writing this in a much more clear way

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.960
 than anyone has, but it's maybe like 95% effective for me.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.880
 And there's a 5% gap that I have.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.120
 And every person has a different 5% gap they missed from the article.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.240
 So this just like helps fill that in.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:08.320
 And the other thing that's interesting is we're all very good at Googling, like over

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.600
 the years we've gotten very good at Googling and that's been kind of critical to us being

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.840
 effective at our jobs.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.840
 Yeah.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.320
 Liz never liked that process and she would get frustrated with it.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.600
 So a big bottleneck for her ever becoming an engineer is you have to get good at Googling

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.320
 or there was kind of a high bar of Googling needed to be good at.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.440
 That's gone now.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.000
 So because I've never clicked for her and now it's not a problem, and she's like unblocked

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.760
 in all these ways.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.720
 And I can see how like a lot of people, especially at the beginning, they just get super frustrated

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.920
 because they don't understand anything and they have to figure out how to use Google to

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.520
 get the thing that they want and like when it's not giving you the answers you probably

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.520
 know.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.320
 You need to have like the right, I feel like I'm making progress.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.320
 I'm frustrated.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.320
 I feel like I'm making progress.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.960
 And that cadence isn't automatically hit for everyone.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.960
 Yeah.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.840
 I hadn't considered the skill that we developed with Googling being less relevant now.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.600
 Like it's such a good point that somebody coming in new now doesn't have to learn that

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.600
 stuff.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.440
 It's not that those skills are still useful.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.240
 Like we can still use those skills, but somebody can accomplish the same thing without having

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.880
 those skills now because of this new tool.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.880
 Yeah.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.880
 It's interesting.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.880
 Yeah.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.440
 I'd like to think about all the things, all the advantages and disadvantages that have

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.280
 changed with the advent of this stuff.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.280
 Yeah.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.400
 I see people that don't like it feels like I've seen on Twitter recently people that

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.360
 like don't use co-pilot or they're surprised that people use co-pilot like how do you how

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:39.040
 do you not use co-pilot like the number of things that has made more efficient for me.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.920
 I can't imagine it not being worth 10 bucks a month if you're a software developer and

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.920
 that's what you do every day.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.920
 Yeah.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.680
 I feel like I get posted tweet every month that like baits people that think that way to

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.960
 reply because I'm just curious.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.240
 Is this still a thing that's going on when people are like I can't I don't see.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.040
 It's like it's funny because to me it just sounds like everyone's lying and some people

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.120
 are like lying in a more sophisticated way like there's people that are like it's useless.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.120
 I hate it.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.680
 Like I don't know why anyone finds it useful.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.680
 Okay.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.960
 Like you're lying obviously then there's people that are like trying to be reasonable but

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.120
 they're so lying.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.720
 They're like they're like sometimes to produce something good I guess.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.720
 Yeah.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.200
 But it's usually wrong and I'm like you liars not usually wrong.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.960
 It's usually useful.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.960
 Yeah.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.960
 Oh it's insane.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:33.280
 I mean like I work at a startup and startups there's always like a million things that

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:41.400
 we want to do and I'm very invested in this startup having co-founded it 10 years ago.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.840
 So I want all of it done all like right now all the time there's just like a million things

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:51.200
 I wish we would already done and I want to like hire people because I'm a startup founder

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.680
 and that's like what we used to do is just like hire more people and I've realized with

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.400
 things like co-pilot it's like no we should just get faster.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.000
 We're like we got to if I'm going to say that I think this stuff makes me so much more productive

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.280
 like we should just get all this done faster and like I try to think that way like how

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.080
 could I just accomplish more how could this team stay small and we can do everything we

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:17.880
 want to do because all these new tools make us faster and more efficient and I don't know

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.200
 if it's actually happening but I like to think that way.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.680
 I like to think like no what can we just do ourselves with AI and do this faster.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.920
 Yeah I think it takes even before this AI stuff everyone want everyone says like oh yeah

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.840
 we want to have a small team or we want our team is efficient and everyone says that but

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.920
 it takes like a really weird amount of commitment to actually do that in a meaningful way because

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:47.800
 all the defaults don't swing that way so if you look at some of our architecture for

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:53.680
 some of the products that we maintain they're kind of weird like we chose to build things

00:14:53.680 --> 00:15:00.480
 and like not our first way but they tend to be the most maintainable like lowest overhead

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.160
 way it just like wasn't what would have happened by default we didn't have this like guiding

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.880
 principle of like the only thing will sacrifice everything except for is being a burden for

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.080
 us long term.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:17.440
 So similarly with the AI stuff yeah I went and saw his co-pilot but like how far can you

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.960
 really push that you can like take it pretty far like from so initially I was using co-pilot

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.000
 I don't really use co-pilot as much anymore because I'm using other plug in in the oven

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.680
 and that's like taking me to another level but then I see some people on Twitter and

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:38.480
 they're like using it to like a much crazier degree so yeah that just doesn't happen by

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.840
 like automatically like you need to like really because it's just shifting the way you work.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.440
 So I'm realizing we talk about AI and all this stuff so much.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:51.520
 Is there like what is the percentage chance that we're just like the crypto bros but with

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.640
 this new thing and we got sucked into something is there a chance.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:16:02.680
 Yeah and you know what I'm actually happy to be that because I feel like with crypto it

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:09.800
 was definitely too late to become that whereas with AI I still as big and hype as it is like

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:15.600
 a large portion of software developers are like not really playing with it to the degree

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:23.280
 that I feel like they should yeah so I'm fine over like rotating on this because I'm like

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.800
 on the plus side like I'm relatively early to the extent that I've played with this stuff

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.680
 relative to other people so even if I'm over hyping it it's fine like there's still gonna

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.680
 be some benefits.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:38.000
 Like it is so much different than that hype cycle right like nobody ever really found good

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.640
 use cases for all the stuff they were messing with with blockchain and Ethereum and smart

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.840
 contracts and all that like they were always just searching for reasons for this technology

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:53.480
 to exist yeah that's not the case with AI like there's no very clearly stuff yeah so

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:59.080
 every time people who are like oh it's the same bros from crypto jumping on AI that may

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.080
 be true.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:06.000
 There are a bunch of those yeah but there's actually utility here and it's actually changing

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.800
 software development in front of our eyes yeah okay so we're not just bought into something

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.240
 and we didn't just get suckered into I have to ask these questions I've got to keep myself

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.200
 level and honest.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:26.940
 I don't know a question myself okay I should try that I don't self reflect no point being

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:33.980
 so I don't do that I definitely don't do that yeah so I just thought yesterday we were talking

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:38.720
 about this so there's like this interesting dynamic where whenever there's a hype cycle

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:45.520
 it becomes super easy to raise money for certain ideas like like insanely easy like yeah you

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:51.160
 can raise 10 times as much if you land on certain idea at the right time and if you look at

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.920
 that like you know YC's demo day was yesterday and typically with YC there's like certain

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.560
 companies that are hot there's like hot YC companies when they do that and they're able

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:07.480
 to raise a bunch of money but the that cohort of hot companies that the hit rate on them

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.800
 is not very high like the overall it's worse than the overall hit rate that you would see

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:18.760
 generally yeah and so similarly like imagine being like an image generation or video generation

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:24.960
 company right now you probably were able to raise a lot of money really quickly but it

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:30.360
 is like the worst feel to be in because there's so much competition everyone just like smashing

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:36.640
 the crap out of each other yeah and it's great for people that are going to use that technology

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.240
 because like every week is getting better and like a new company showing up to offer

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:46.480
 it for better for cheaper yep actually being in that froth kind of sucks and what I was

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.840
 thinking was what's interesting about all this AI stuff is yeah typically you want to

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.520
 be the person you know selling the shovels it's like historically where you want to build

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.840
 tools that other people use and that's like the best position to be in but like this froth

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.160
 is so matte like crazy right now where it's like are you really going to end up winning

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:08.920
 as a person selling shovels then I was thinking like what if you want the other side and you're

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:14.600
 like I'm just going to be the epitome of the customer that they're trying to sell to and

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.520
 I'll just assume that they're going to get 10 times better in the next year and I'm just

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.720
 going to try to be like the exact customer I sell to so what I mean by that is so a stupid

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:28.280
 example but like it's an exaggerated example but it gives you the sense of what this could

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:33.400
 look like a bunch of music generation startups helping you generate music right you could

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:40.200
 start a non tech company which is a music label today that is just fully betting on the fact

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.920
 that this stuff gets massive and you're going to be like the people the person that crushes

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.600
 every other music music label and becomes like the only music distributor on the planet right

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.080
 so something insane like that what's different is normally if you try to do that it's hard

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.880
 because scaling a non tech business is very slow usually requires a lot of people the

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:05.640
 entire idea here is AI makes non tech companies scale theoretically like in the extreme as

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.760
 well as a tech company but like is that is like that actually a better play because then

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:17.160
 you're not in the froth you just benefit from the output of whatever's going there interesting

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.560
 and the existing players are going to be super slow to adopt this stuff because it's like

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.960
 very disruptive to yeah their business you know so I don't want to get hung up on the

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:32.800
 specific example but I'm hung up on what does a music label do I just realized I have no

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.080
 idea what do they do it's like a VC fund at the end of the day okay they make bets and

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.040
 they fund ours they think we'll do well this kind of one is there's did they do something

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.960
 with distribution like don't artists go not anymore now yeah okay yeah but like presume

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.480
 I mean I think the value of labels continues to go down but if you want to be funded for

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:59.280
 a year to make your album yeah they fund you and they get some percentage of your revenue

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.080
 so compared to like a music sorry like a movie studio it's the exact same thing they fund

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.920
 it betting that okay yeah it'll make money so so you could be an AI movie studio you're

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.520
 just gonna fund movies that are made by yeah yeah your costs are like a thousand times

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.960
 less you need a thousand times less people yeah what what are your thoughts like food

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:23.360
 and a place to sleep what are your costs I don't know what they do yeah I don't know

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:31.520
 like if if okay so basically if you could make one movie that wins an Oscar at one hundredth

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:37.880
 the cost of any other movie if you pull that off once okay you're funding the creation

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:43.040
 of the movie and the movie is created through AI so there's no sets or cameramen yeah hypothetically

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:49.080
 you have to pay yeah just GPUs you have to feed you win an Oscar for a movie that costs

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.040
 a fraction of what a movie like that should cost yep you can now repeat that a thousand

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.440
 times because it's like an automated process what is the world gonna become and all of our

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.360
 media I'm sure people are hearing this and they hate the idea of everything I'm describing

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.960
 but I'm just it's like a thought experiment you know yeah yeah no it's interesting it's

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:12.560
 just challenges all find all kinds of things in my brain I mean I guess it would be cool

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:19.160
 if I could just like have a I make me the perfect movie for me on demand like that's

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.440
 where it could head right like on demand in the sense that not like I can choose to watch

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:29.200
 it whenever I want but on demand in the sense that it knows my exact preferences and it

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:35.440
 makes a movie for me that's a one-off nobody else can it do could it do that I guess it

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.560
 could what I want to watch a movie that no one else is gonna watch like that so that's

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.720
 the interesting thing so again if you take it at the extremes let's say this does work

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:49.120
 out and it can generate the exact it can generate a thousand episodes of the exact weird combination

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.560
 of things you're interested in there is no sense of hey did you see that episode it was

00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:00.800
 crazy right because no one's seen it except for you and I think we've experienced a little

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.760
 bit of this where shows used to be on TV and they would come out a new episode come out

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.420
 every Sunday we'd all watch it at the same time and be this it'd be like this universal

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:16.220
 thing that everyone was it discusses it on Monday and it was like very in sync then it

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.120
 moves to streaming and some streaming services still really sound schedule most of them just

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.840
 put out all the episodes at once yeah so everyone's like a different place and you can't talk

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.160
 to them about it because you might spoil it for them or like they watch it like six months

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.360
 later and then you're at that point you remember what happened so we're like that whole thing

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:37.680
 is been deteriorating and then now this would be like a crazy version of that yeah I guess

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:43.160
 like I don't know what that I want that I don't think if they I could make me the perfect

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.960
 movie I don't think I I don't think I want that world I want the world where somebody

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:53.040
 had to make a bet and make a movie with a bunch of money and a bunch of people and maybe

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.960
 it was a stupid movie and it didn't work out for him but maybe sometimes really good movies

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.440
 come out of that and then I get to watch it and talk about it with you about how that

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.760
 movie was good or that movie sucked yeah I like I like that world yeah and I will say

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:13.480
 like I feel like already the level of F I think studios have already like de-risked the hell

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.280
 out of movies the point where they actually just look worse and we talk about other day

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.400
 about how like when they made Lord of the Rings they're looking like hiking in a mountains

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:26.280
 to go like film oh yeah and then now they like don't risk that at all everything is fully

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:33.360
 CGI and it's genuinely worse like it just is worse we were watching this TV show pillars

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.200
 of the earth and it came out in 2010 and it doesn't look amazing because TV shows weren't

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.560
 like crazy funded back then it still looks so much better than most TV shows because it's

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.840
 like a real set and real stuff in the background and like stuff looks dirty and textured and

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:53.360
 everything and yeah I do wonder if the reality of AI produced stuff is like people don't

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:59.040
 really attack the quality dimension of it there's attack like the some other like base

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.800
 thing of like oh this is like hyper specific to you so the quality of it doesn't matter

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:08.280
 yeah so what's suck if like that that dimension like just stops existing and we're already

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.700
 kind of going down that road yeah the more I see people share like AI generated music

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:19.280
 and movie stuff or like not movies but people are sharing the clips that were videos created

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.000
 about AI yeah like I always every time I see something I have to think like where is this

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.400
 headed why and like where will the real utility come in like what doesn't just destroy it's

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.280
 the I mean it's the art too it's the image generation stuff it's like cool everyone can

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:41.920
 create an image it looks like whatever they want it to be and now what like I don't know

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:46.240
 it just the whole at the end of the day it's how like what are we doing with all this what's

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.520
 the point what's the end game it just feels like this like trick that we're all like look

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:56.840
 I can do this now yeah I know it is funny how fast that burn like the image generation stuff

00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.640
 was like crazy and I feel like it's kind of burned out in a lot of ways where we're like

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.400
 yeah this isn't that fun but it does show up in funny places like Liz's grandma texted

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:10.720
 her or it was like her aunt or someone texted her on Easter like happy Easter but like she

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:19.320
 sent like this AI generated Easter egg that had like it's like a happy Easter on it it's

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:25.280
 like so funny it's like it's basically devolved all the way down to like random shit like older

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.080
 people in your family yeah then do like it has like that vibe like like random clip art

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.360
 type of thing I do feel like there's gonna be some useful thing that comes out all of

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.640
 it the generative AI stuff it's just hard to imagine that it's what we're doing right

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.760
 now I guess it's all party tricks right now and that's fun and has value but yeah it's

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.120
 like shortly like the like the music stuff house we were I finally started playing with

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:53.360
 it yesterday you've seen the V3 of you know AI or have you seen it of what though that

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.880
 music generation companies you know that AI sooner it's either with some of them oh I saw

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.720
 your oh I saw your suit go sorry I forgot it's all yeah that's actually really good yeah

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.560
 so the V3 model came out a month ago and for some reason like it hasn't gotten a lot

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.600
 of hype I think it's starting to now but it's passed a threshold where I'm like these are

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.440
 good songs like some of these are like they get like the Zuko song got stuck in my head

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:23.320
 yeah it was like yeah I was like coming at this morning and we made a bunch so we made

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:30.920
 one so Liz's parents they they were in construction they focus on granite and her dad's nickname

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:38.880
 is Manolito and she made a song called Manolito El Rey de Granito which is the king of granite

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:44.360
 and she made it like a salsa song and it was so good like there was like the main person

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.520
 singing that they were like background vocalists like chanting back at him and it was so well

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.200
 done and it was so funny because like now he has like a jingle for his business basically

00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:00.500
 and yeah it's crazy and I'm sure like a couple months from now it's gonna feel like corny

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.520
 well it's it's how images feel now probably the music feels fresh just like the images

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.240
 did eventually they'll feel this way so even though there's like a white so you can tell

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:14.280
 to make a rap song an indie song country song whatever so it feels like unlimited possibilities

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.920
 there's still some underlying like structure to all of this and then they need a narrow

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:24.600
 the structure to make it though it's producing stuff like sense and I think our brains over

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.440
 time pick up on that whatever that like invisible subconscious structure is and it starts to

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.840
 feel cliche yeah and that's like really amazing to see because like every single you can tell

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:39.480
 a mid-journey image now it's like you can kind of feel the same whether it's like a cartoon

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.280
 image or like a realistic image you can like feel that's made with mid-journey and that

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:49.800
 feels redundant and kind of corny so yeah it's crazy we we can get desensitized anything

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:55.640
 no matter how like wild it is yeah the this is a kind of a tangent on the image generation

00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:02.640
 stuff but we actually like we have a use case for image generation style transfer something

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:09.000
 and nothing exists that does what what I need to do so we have like over five six thousand

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.440
 something like that illustrations of players that an illustrator has hand drawn for the last decade

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:21.080
 and he can only do so many a week and at the end of the day we want to roll out all these new domains

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:25.160
 but there's so many new athletes like if we want to add college football there's all these

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.320
 college football athletes that we have to hand draw and it takes months of lead up to draw enough of

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.320
 them to really feel like okay we could launch this domain we've actually build the technology

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:38.760
 for the sport faster than we can illustrate players it's a huge bottleneck so I want to just be able

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:44.120
 to say here is a set of five thousand of these images that we could train some model that could

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:51.000
 just take a photo of that person and turn it into an illustration that looks like this artist's

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.400
 style and it can't do it all these models are so good at making gibberish and spitting out random

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.720
 image vomit but they can't just do this very simple thing I feel like this is such a simple use case

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:09.080
 like that would actually be very helpful for us and if someone knows of a way to do that like we've

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.000
 tried them all and they're all just not they can't do it I don't understand I feel like that should

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.400
 be the easiest thing in the world for AI to pull off yeah I mean that that that goes to show how

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:24.040
 these things are built like the they are like tuned to produce a certain various specific type of

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.800
 output and even though it looks like you can do anything it is still very narrow and specific

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.280
 yeah so some of those limitations are interesting to understand because it really feels like it

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:38.920
 can do anything but it it's really far from that actually so another angle on the generative AI

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:44.680
 stuff that I feel like this one it was three or four years ago really that this was being pushed

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:51.720
 on I know this because it was tech that we used for our stuff but the voice matching like creating

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:57.800
 like a voice or audio of someone speaking that sounds just like them speaking and now I feel like

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.960
 they're pushing it further it's like now we need five seconds of your voice and we can completely

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:07.320
 mimic like that tech's getting super good I feel like there's probably lots of use cases for that

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:12.360
 probably I mean I know there is I know we wanted to do stuff we did stuff

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:19.560
 we so like we answer sports questions we did stuff where like the athletes

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.440
 oh that's so cool yeah it was like so if you asked who had the most passing touchdowns in a

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:30.520
 season Peyton Manning comes on he's like hey it's Peyton Manning I had 55 down with the broncos and

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:36.440
 but we did it was like the most dumb like just like string together audio files like we concatenated

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:41.400
 audio files and we did some stuff to like make it sound pretty natural like we didn't just take

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.800
 a word anywhere in a sentence like we made sure we had them saying phrases that we could use larger

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:50.760
 chunks anyway but he could like answer anything about his career in his voice on an Alexa or

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:56.680
 Google Assistant or whatever so we've looked at this tech for probably five years like doing

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:03.240
 stuff in this space and we've seen it evolve I just I don't I still don't see like real people

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:09.160
 using it for real stuff like where is the real stuff coming for all this different advancement

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.800
 and AI tech because there's so many categories that you've got like every possible category of

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.760
 thing you could generate that AI can generate now when where is it headed when's it all going

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:25.240
 to come together into like man remember life before that yeah it's not really that yet yeah so I was a

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:31.080
 so day one of YC demo day was yesterday and I watched I had in the background like while I was

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:40.360
 doing work and obviously there was like a lot of AI companies and yeah I think I think the pattern

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:48.840
 that I saw across them at least right now which I think makes sense is they picked some crazy random

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:55.720
 niche like someone that managed a lot of vacation properties or like this very specific task and

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.960
 insurance companies or there's very whatever there's even this one company I forgot what the

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:06.680
 industry they were in but they like the founders got jobs doing this thing and they would do their

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.920
 job during the day and they would try to automate it at night and they claimed that they were down

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:15.640
 to 45 minutes a day of work for them then they quit and they started a company to like

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:21.240
 deploy this as like you know a way to make these companies more efficient and this was the

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:26.760
 insurance thing something in the insurance related market there was some like just like high labor

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:34.040
 like low creativity job yeah yeah so that's how they that was a genius way of like bootstrapping

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:39.160
 that I thought yeah but it's like so many of these like just most of the companies were just like

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.880
 picking some random things so I would say that's where I think I see people actually using it but

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:52.040
 it's really it's not like spectacular it's more there's a lot of life is busy work and they're just

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:57.080
 going yeah crawling into every like niche trying to get rid of some of that busy work I actually

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:04.120
 think that with the way this stuff is going that a company will come out that will be a superset of

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:09.560
 all these little little things but if you have an air they can drive a browser really well it can

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:15.960
 kind of do all these narrow focus things that these people are niching down into like there was

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:24.680
 even this there's one company that said they they were targeting tasks that people do on fiber

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:30.040
 typically and they were helping companies that spent a lot on fiber to like go spend zero dollars

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.040
 on fiber because there would be like AI workers that that when did that yeah and so that's like a

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.520
 much broader set of tasks so yeah that's where I'm seeing in the real world but there's nothing like

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:45.080
 really spectacular or like drastically the world was different now yeah yeah type of thing yeah

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:50.520
 can I in an interject kind of like a philosophical question that that all posed for me yeah so so

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:57.480
 this person automated their job and they had some insurance so let's just assume in this hypothetical

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:03.000
 scenario that job pays you well enough that you're comfortable like you don't have big aspirations

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.600
 you're happy and you're keeping up with inflation or whatever I don't know because some people would

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.560
 say like well it depends on if that job anyway you're making enough that you're you're comfortable

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:17.560
 and you've gotten your job down to 45 minutes a day of work there's this guy who then decided I'm

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:24.440
 gonna start a YC based company there's that jumping point or there's like just chill at your job where

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:28.360
 you spend 45 minutes a day and you make a comfortable living what do you think out of like a hundred

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:33.560
 people what do you think the breakdown is of like people who would just chill at said job for

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:41.400
 45 minutes a day and enjoy their life of whatever they pursue from there versus I'm gonna go create

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:48.120
 a company to like monetize this technology or this idea well the problem is a world isn't static so

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:55.000
 you can do that for a year maybe two years maybe three years but eventually there's just so much

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.360
 so it's it's like a it's just like a game theory thing like if it's not you it's gonna be someone

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:04.680
 else I think if you're smart enough to automate it you probably will figure that is not gonna last

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:09.960
 long so so maybe it's not out of a hundred people maybe it's for you the question is for you just

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.640
 any part of you ever just want to be the person that just would just do the thing for 45 minutes

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:18.760
 a day and then be like I'm good I'm not gonna push any harder I'm just I'm good yeah I think I

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:24.680
 sometimes that the thing I always think about is like applying to 10 junior engineer roles I mean

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:31.720
 it's less of a thing now but like back in like when hiring was crazy and hiring anyone doing anything

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:39.880
 yeah right it's right about just go be a junior engineer and like you know 80k salary or something

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:46.040
 and just have like 10 of those like I'm sure I could easily like nail 10 of those yeah 10 of yeah

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:52.840
 the other option was to then or just apply to one junior engineering role and just like shock the

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:58.440
 company on how fast it was progressing and like use that momentum to like shoot it to be me or

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:09.400
 into yeah as like to the CEO or CTO yeah is that what you did with with SST come in and shoot

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:15.720
 up ahead of Frank and Jay yeah so I do think about but just I mean no I'm not I'm never I never

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.920
 actually do any of those never you would never coast my no it just feels dangerous to me like I

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:27.320
 like feel like it feels like yours you know sharks die when they don't keep swimming it kind of feels

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:31.720
 like that to me like if I'm still like I'm just gonna get killed or something that sort of feels

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.560
 like to me oh wait you're talking about the the coasting on the 45 minutes a day thing I'm talking

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:40.600
 about the people who are over employed with like 10 jobs not 10 jobs but the people who like post

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:45.640
 unread it about their three software engineering jobs and they managed to juggle them all and one

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.240
 of them they haven't had to talk to them for a year and they still get paid and like all that stuff

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:54.200
 have you seen that stuff yeah but I mean when I was a consultant I was basically doing doing that so

00:37:54.200 --> 00:38:00.280
 it doesn't feel that yeah but it's like it's okay if it's like it is funny it's okay if you're an

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.840
 independent consultant yeah of course you have 10 jobs if you find this form but not this form

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:11.000
 it's totally fine if you gave them a W9 and they give you a W2 it's totally bad don't do it that way

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.920
 ethically terrible whoa it is funny so we they're so just a pivot a bit there's a lot that was

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.240
 happening this week I think oh I have no idea I've been traveling I literally need you to catch

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:31.160
 me up on everything all right yeah to work thing okay so one I have great news oh as of this morning

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:36.680
 the lambda team fixed that streaming issue that I start yes which is really crazy because they've

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:41.960
 never this is a first okay so I'm gonna give them I'm gonna like lavish compliments yes they'll do

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:48.920
 us right now because I never do this I found this problem so I like it was investigating I started

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:55.240
 investigating on Friday I like started being like is this broken on Friday and then by Monday I was

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:59.240
 like this is definitely broken definitely broken yeah and then so then someone reached out like I

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.760
 would say a bunch of people reached out which has happened before like people from AWS have reached

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.800
 out yeah but I replied you know I always replied just in case something actually happens usually

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:14.680
 nothing happens but this time like the head head pm or product person that's hard not pm that's

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:20.120
 probably like devaluing his title just the person in charge of lambda yeah product perspective

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:24.760
 reached out and was like other teams have investigated this like we we've identified the issue I'm

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.160
 gonna roll out a fix we ended up taking them like a week longer than they expected but they like

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:34.200
 almost every day they were keeping me in the loop around what's happening yeah and like several

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:38.920
 people like someone else in that team messes me being like oh hey can we get like the code sample

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:44.520
 you're using and that person messaged me yesterday being like I tested your code sample against the

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:51.080
 fix like it does seem to work now so they were super engaged crazy reactive like you know they

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:55.320
 fix this so quickly and they kept me in the loop the whole time which is amazing this is kind of

00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:00.600
 what I this is like yeah great job like every other team and AWS should like look at this as an

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:07.480
 example of you know this is how we should engage with with the community yeah yeah great good job

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:13.800
 AWS we're gonna add streaming support to all these frameworks now that said they already had it but

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:22.600
 you know it doesn't really work my part of the problem on that one no because you tried to turn

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:27.480
 on it didn't work for you right and you turn I mean I shipped like I tried to ship Astro streaming

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:33.240
 support in SST I think no I'm saying that code probably is is correct but the code is correct yeah

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:38.520
 yeah yeah the thing is okay yeah it's using it because everyone's trying I went and looked at

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:43.400
 I went and looked at Hono I looked at like everything everyone added streaming support I tried everyone's

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:52.120
 things and I was like none of these work like why it's like nothing and to be fair it's not that

00:40:52.120 --> 00:41:00.200
 it a hundred percent didn't work it just if there was so in a stream if there was an initial chunk

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:06.680
 and another chunk those first two chunks would always get sent together so if you were testing

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:10.840
 something stupid where it sent like 10 chunks you might not notice the first two came together

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:15.880
 because then three four five six that like those would come out come like one by one yeah but in

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:21.560
 practice it's usually most sites render as two chunks because it's like the initial shell yeah

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:28.760
 and like the actual content PPR so yeah it's basically the PPR nonsense right is that right did I get

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:35.080
 it right is it PPR it's a PPR is like a like a sub like a narrow sub category of the scenario

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:40.360
 but it's also points per reception that's how I remember it fantasy football shout out to everybody

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:47.480
 that's listening that's how nerdy uh that's the only way I can remember it but that's how nerdy

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:52.440
 this web development world is they like it really is not only did they pick a new acronym that was

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:58.520
 unnecessary and like over inflating it they also just didn't realize it was already stepping onto

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:03.960
 another acronym yeah exactly so land is streaming it works now the next couple days I'm gonna add

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:09.000
 support I'm gonna test all the frameworks get support across the board um there's been this

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.320
 running joke because we'd still have next support and it's like we're like irrationally not supporting

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.520
 it at this point because so many people have asked for it and we're just like yeah for some

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:23.480
 reason we always defer it but I'm finally actually getting support in now uh for it nice but only

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:31.400
 because solid start is built on the same oh no core aspect just continue to look like good

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:36.760
 at meta for solid start and it happens to work for nugs so we have next support you could have

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:41.160
 gotten off the hook there and looked like you had good intentions but you just outed yourself

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:45.160
 I don't know what it is every time we're like okay we're gonna do nugs this week it just doesn't

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:50.840
 happen it's gone on for like a year now I somehow know what it is what is it I mean I

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.520
 because I have the same feeling about next why why is it hard to they should have just gone with

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:59.160
 the name that wasn't close to next I feel like the like it was like a tongue in cheek like next

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:05.320
 yeah I don't know it's just like it's hard to take it seriously but I know a lot of you people a lot

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:11.480
 of like okay you've said before uh the development software development or web development or whatever

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:16.120
 was split into like PHP and non-PHP there's also a view thing in there something yeah it's good

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:20.520
 there's like a little few island yeah because it just feels like a whole different community

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.200
 and I don't interact with them and I don't know and then related to the PHP community I feel like

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:29.720
 they are a lot of PHP people use view there's some weird vine diagram here somebody needs to make

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:34.760
 yeah it's like yeah these are camps that we all live in so I want to go back to the lambda thing real

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:41.480
 quick so lambda uh the lambda team had this interaction with you that was positive yeah I'd

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:46.280
 like to just request if anyone on the amplified team is listening reach out to Dax get some feedback

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:54.680
 on how you can improve amplify because I think there's just precedent now that was really well

00:43:54.680 --> 00:44:00.440
 delivered I was like yeah I just I want to build a bridge here uh there's a precedent now for SST

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.600
 working together with service teams uh and I think I think that's he has a lot of feedback for

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:12.600
 amplify so you should you should reach out that was so because I I uh because until he said amplify

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:17.080
 I was like okay I see where he's going and he said amplify I was like is he being serious he was

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:24.920
 engaging what would your feedback for the amplify team just just stop just stop stop you guys aren't

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:29.400
 beat three now like it's it's fine I really thought there was hope that you might build a better

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:38.040
 relationship with AWS but doesn't sound like it I uh I can't help but be honest I honestly think

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:42.440
 that lambda team did a really great job and I'm really impressed uh yeah for the size of AWS

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:47.800
 like this level of micro interaction is not what you can normally get I mean AWS is a big

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:53.000
 old thing so like lots of people involved it makes sense there'd be a lot of those people that

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.560
 are really good at doing these types of interactions I mean like within AWS I'm sure there are plenty

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:03.160
 of teams it would be great to work with you just haven't run into the situation where you need to

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:08.520
 work with them but then there is also this like hostility I feel I don't know I feel like I'm in

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:13.080
 the middle of it I feel like I'm like mommy and daddy are fighting at the dinner table kind of thing

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:18.440
 I wish you guys could make up I wish you and AWS you know now you've started building cloudflare

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:22.680
 stuff now it's just not helping well I was gonna say that that's the second part of the news this

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:30.280
 week so we're in the middle of cloudflare dev week uh so this is Thursday so I guess we're almost done

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:38.360
 this is episode a okay that was such a good tweet oh my god I gotta say it again so plans to go see

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:44.440
 a Sam he goes why does every company announced SSO and sock to support on Thursdays of their launch

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:51.000
 week and I was like this is such a good observation like this is so funny because there's underlying

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.880
 thing of every company does a launch week nobody has enough stuff for a launch week yeah you do not

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:03.480
 have enough silver launch week and that's why you do SSO support on Thursday yeah my Thursday

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:07.960
 you're really grasping at straws yeah personally I love SSO support like I hate it when companies

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:13.160
 don't have it uh so I'm like yes hell yeah sign sign me in with my like workspace account amazing

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:17.800
 I love it but yeah and a broad sense of things is not like the most killer killer thing to announce

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.000
 for a whole day and now I need to know all the things that cloudflare's announced because I'm sure

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.760
 you've been saying on top of it but also things that are happening on tech twitter just whatever

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:29.480
 order you can interleave them yeah so cloudflare is what I've tweeted before where I'm like most

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.720
 companies cloudflare of launch weeks are just like underwhelming but whenever cloudflare's a launch

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.720
 week I like rethink everything I'm doing oh I'm sure they've got a lot yeah yeah they have they

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:43.640
 had a lot of stuff so uh some of the more significant things that stick out so they launched something

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:49.640
 called uh workflows which is a step function equivalent basically okay yeah but it's all just

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:54.760
 a normal JavaScript so like you hope you can define steps in normal JavaScript like the definition

00:46:54.760 --> 00:47:01.640
 of it is in general code they have like a like a context.task or something and you name each step

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:06.680
 but you just right you're just writing normal code and if one step fails it'll like retry and

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:11.880
 all the stuff that you would use a step function workflow for they're durable uh they'll like you

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:16.680
 know you can sleep for a year if you want you can do all that stuff so all those like random startups

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:23.320
 like uh not random okay all those yeah so I was dedicated for the simple temporal ingest etc if

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:27.080
 you're on cloudflare like why use those there's like a native thing and it's so much better than

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:33.080
 AWS a function so I think that is awesome uh I think there's an argument to be made that if

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:40.760
 it's just normal JavaScript type script should most of your code be a workflow like anything

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.520
 that's asynchronous probably should be like it avoids having to like route stuff through a queue and

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:52.280
 and do retries yourself um so that was one major thing they launch pipelines which is a kinesis

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:57.480
 equivalent so it's uh for ingesting large amounts of data it supports kinesis endpoints but normal

00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:04.040
 HTTP endpoints even web socket sources like it can pull from whatever backup it supports kinesis

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:08.920
 endpoints what do you mean if you already have a kinesis stream you can like dump it into this

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:14.600
 thing yeah so if you want a direct integration yeah yeah or you could just like you know put stuff

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:18.760
 within their normal HTTP I think like I said they have a web socket integration as well which is

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:23.960
 kind of crazy uh and they have this whole they haven't released this yet but they've previewed

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:29.320
 what they're thinking they have this whole like stream processing system on top of it so you can

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:34.200
 define like this kind of like chained calls of being like you can like define all the ways you

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.960
 want to transform the data before like spits out the other end yeah and that just runs

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:43.320
 against everything that comes in kinesis has similar like you can put functions

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:48.760
 that modifies stream stuff yeah yeah so that you can get like aggregations and and and things like

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:54.840
 that uh it's there's some apache project that's very similar than they're like modeling it off of

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:59.080
 so those two were big because those are like did you say apache sorry it took me a second is it

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:05.880
 apache yeah you said apache it's apache right well it depends like you know like did you really think

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:10.600
 it was apache or was that just a misspeak no i i've always had apache i mean i've always had apache

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:15.560
 i've heard apache am i the wrong one i don't know like should we ask the Native Americans like

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:27.160
 who are you going off with oh i'm sorry i just forgot that is a Native American tribe oh that's

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:35.640
 so funny you're literally on their land Adam you're yeah i'm sorry and apache slash apache apache i'm

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:41.480
 pretty sure it's apache and i have a lot of Native Native American uh DNA like i think i want to

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:49.480
 say my grandma is like a quarter Native American so okay my computer says apache but there you go

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:54.120
 apache okay i'm gonna call it apache now i think it sounds nicer a little more like sophisticated

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:59.800
 i've said both so many times now they both sound ridiculous to me apache apache apache has a long

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:05.080
 history of like they were part of the lamp stack right yeah that that was like that's how they

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:09.720
 started now they're this open source foundation what part of i mean i know the a but what what did

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:16.840
 it do so Linux this it was it was like before we always use nginx okay so it was a nginx

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:22.360
 equivalent but it was it was so bad really it spawned like a process per request or something

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:30.040
 insane like that it was like oh just this garbage wait what i guess computers were

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:34.680
 old and dumb back then so it might have not been that ridiculous but it was like something like

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:39.560
 that where it was just like the slowest thing i've ever seen oh now i'm interrupting you but now

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:54.280
 Linux apache m is for MongoDB and p is for don't tell me don't tell me Php yeah wow so Php

00:50:54.280 --> 00:51:02.440
 look at it with its roots back in the original the original og stack yeah Php been around so long

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:07.800
 i actually did write Php like early in my career me too that's one of the first things i did yeah

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:12.840
 same oh man if you could go back and see the websites i would have been making for people

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:19.560
 so bad okay yeah i remember back like i didn't i don't know if Php framers were out back then but

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:25.160
 like literally i like no substance of a framework for anything i did like every page just contained

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:30.200
 a hundred percent of the code that needed to enter that page yeah it was just still how levels

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:39.640
 you know peter levels writes things but i digress yeah okay so step functions kinesis keep going

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:45.800
 yeah so those are the two big infrastructure pieces that came out so d1 their sequel light

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:51.240
 database went general availability so that's they're considering that stable now i'm sorry i always

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:55.720
 hate in launch weeks when something goes jay it's like i just want to hear about the new stuff like

00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:01.560
 who cares i thought it was jay anyway i used it anyway i didn't care like yeah ga doesn't help me

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:09.160
 it's like a lawyer distinction like the lawyers are like yeah we can use it now

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:16.440
 uh that's funny so there's a bunch of ai stuff i didn't look too deeply into that but you can

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:20.520
 basically um they did a partnership with hugging phase so any mall and hugging phase you can like

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:25.720
 instantly deploy with the cloudflare gold infrastructure which is amazing and the cloudflare costs for

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:32.360
 that stuff are crazy low uh which is awesome and they also let you deploy fine-tune models so

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:40.120
 that's it's kind of one of the best way to deploy something that's not generic at scale yeah so hugging

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:46.120
 phase integration is sort of like their bed rock play like bed rock is basically just like here's

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:50.920
 all the models you can use them and they're doing that but with the whole library of hugging phase

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:57.080
 but by the way top five company name hugging phase right is it you think a five better i can't

00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:05.800
 oh my god i hate that name so much it started to think it there's a but it's huge they do things

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:10.520
 i know it's so successful but so that's it for cloudflare launch week uh there's a bunch of other

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.680
 things that are like nice ergonomic things that we're kind of missing better there

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:19.880
 like they started to build like you know how AWS has all the service to service connections like

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:25.400
 buckets emit events that you can so they added they started to add that stuff to our two yeah so

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:30.280
 i think the major ones were the workflow for me at least the workflow and the kinesis equivalent

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:35.400
 pipelines yeah i think those two are like very significant because again it starts to look more

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:42.120
 and more and more complete but like fully natively serverless all the way down oh uh yeah i mean

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.880
 again so you didn't care but i think analytics engine went ga as well with actual pricing

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:52.360
 which is their uh click house as a service it's serverless yeah so any analytics type data

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:58.200
 is pretty cool yeah i need to play with it i need to i need to play with more of the

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:02.840
 cloudflare stuff because there's things i do that probably takes so much more effort to accomplish

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:09.880
 on AWS that would be fast on cloudflare and cheap too so today and cheap after this i'm wrapping up

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:14.920
 our cloudflare or initial cloudflare support so that you get like you know like the hot

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:20.200
 uploading while you're in development um just like all the linking work it's actually not gonna

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:26.200
 be very hot like our our crazy trick that we do for AWS lambda we run it locally it's gonna take

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:31.880
 quite a bit of effort to get that working for cloudflare workers so for this first version

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:36.440
 we're just like re-uploading your stuff every time so it's not as fast it takes like a couple

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:42.520
 seconds but it's something at least first to get started yeah but once that's there i'm gonna be

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:48.520
 like moving a project over to like the cloudflare stack yeah my mites are streaming again doing that

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:55.480
 but so i think this is the thing we should actually talk about there's an existential threat to AWS

00:54:55.480 --> 00:55:00.200
 in my eyes uh well i don't know if anything could really be a threat database etc right but

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:09.080
 at least uh in the effort to push modern web developers on to AWS versus something like cloudflare

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:19.480
 there this we've talked about this offline uh this issue of costs at the CDN level so i don't

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:26.520
 i don't understand how cloudflare can be so cheap at what they do for like DDoS mitigation so

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:32.760
 like i okay let me back up everyone a consumer website we get a lot of traffic we also get a lot

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:41.720
 of nefarious traffic is that the way you say that word nefarious nefarious nefarious apochi

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:50.040
 we get a lot of like bad actors that for various reasons hit us with absurd amounts of traffic

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:55.080
 and we have to like deal with that but we also are like we're a business like we have the funds

00:55:55.080 --> 00:56:01.240
 to handle that there's been noted cases of people who are small indie hacker types building things

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:06.520
 and then they get DDoSed on AWS and there's not really a way to like mitigate the cost element

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:14.360
 of that like if you get tons and tons of traffic and you're a small uh player like the the cost

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:20.600
 mitigation for DDoS attacks is AWS shield advanced i guess which is like 3000 a month which for a

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:27.640
 business not so big deal not a big deal uh if you have real revenue and traffic or whatever uh but

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:33.560
 below that like you're you're just building a small thing or you're whatever uh side project

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:39.240
 startup early stage uh there's not really a way to like prevent that cost worth cloudflare

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:44.840
 seemingly it's free to just stop people from spamming your stuff how does that work so i think

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:49.880
 there's a few dimensions here one is like the pure technical thing cloudflare started to do that

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:54.440
 that's how they were started they're founded to solve this problem and they just focus on this for

00:56:54.440 --> 00:57:02.760
 like a crazy amount of years like over 10 years uh and they won that category and they spent that

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:08.440
 time like integrating and deploying like hardware to like the craziest places like integrated at

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:12.840
 like the ISP level they have all these like deals that nobody else has yeah so they're in a unique

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:19.720
 position but i think the other weird dynamic is companies get addicted to certain kinds of revenue

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:25.000
 and become unable to take action that hurts that you know if the action is right long term

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:32.840
 dude look at someone like AWS the egress thing has been like a huge revenue source for them they

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:40.120
 charge a lot for bandwidth uh and that's like at this point so established in AWS that i am

00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:45.960
 skeptical they could ever launch a feature that's like writing that off to zero whereas cloudflare

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:50.440
 never had that and of course it doesn't underline stuff yeah it's all they've never been addicted

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:55.960
 to that form of revenue yeah so everything they launch now is like really generous in that dimension

00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:02.840
 i don't think AWS couldn't do it from like a technical or like unit cost yeah position it's

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:08.440
 just like you know the reality is like companies become static when they are around their revenue

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:14.760
 sources so i think that's actually it like r2 has again all these things come with ashris like r2

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:20.440
 has free egress so you can have people downloading yourself as much as you want there is some like

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:26.360
 unspoken soft limit where you will have to pay it's obviously way higher than anything AWS is

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:33.160
 willing to do uh they also have the part like the cpu billing on their cpu workers right where

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:37.560
 like if it's idle you're not build yep exactly and i think that a lot of that like now that i'm

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:44.440
 digging into it more i'm seeing how all this stuff comes together right so they built an edge network

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.200
 and they're like we need to be able to run custom logic for requests that come through so they built

00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:54.360
 those workers concept yeah which initially you can imagine it was just for like doing things like

00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:59.800
 if their quest is to this url proxy it to this back end url if it's from to like this we're like

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:06.120
 proxy like just basic proxying stuff and you see how the work there is like some initial logic and

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:10.920
 then just like pure IO yeah so you can see how workers was built around the concept of like

00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:17.320
 it's not really going to be doing much cpu work it's just going to be delegating to IO work

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:22.120
 and that expanded over time to workers became more capable more useful and yeah so i think

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:26.520
 that that reflects their pricing where they just charge for cpu because the whole purpose of it was

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:31.640
 really just to delegate IO stuff um there's so many things i find in their system where i'm like

00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:39.320
 oh like i'm i'll be looking for a specific solution for something because i i like exist in AWS and

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:44.600
 then i realize oh no you just like use a worker for that you're like use a worker for everything

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:49.000
 because a worker is just a thing that handles a request first and super cheap and you can do

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.280
 whatever logic you want in there so like there's not a thing like like in cloud front there's not

00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:58.520
 you know how cloud front has like routing rules you specify patterns and where it should go

00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:02.600
 you look for that on cloud where you're like it doesn't exist oh because you deploy a worker

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:07.800
 whatever logic you want to route however you want um yeah yeah so i think those primitives are

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:12.360
 kind of interesting yeah just simpler and i think that they had this sort of narrow way of thinking

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:17.880
 about it and then that's resulted in that yeah like lambda has to spin up a whole firecracker

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:23.000
 container you know yeah they don't have to do that so it's it's quite different so how do you how do

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.880
 you view the future of cloudflare and AWS from a like serverless modern web dev perspective

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:35.560
 how do you see it all playing out yeah i think for years i've always felt like everyone focuses on

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:44.440
 the big three like it's google cloud for some reason uh AWS and azure and azure is just living

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:50.200
 off of the network that microsoft has which is massive and whenever die google cloud is irrelevant

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:54.760
 besides the fact they have the word google at the front of it uh so i was like this is not really a

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.400
 contest like AWS is just kind of one and they're going to continue to win and there's never really

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.560
 no meaningful difference that anything any of these other two can do that's going to change that

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:09.320
 but then i saw cloudflare which was which to me looked a lot like the future that AWS kind of

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:16.200
 invented but like better like AWS does get credit for inventing like this event driven like very

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.520
 serverless way of doing things yeah and it kind of feels like cloudflare saw that and was like we

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:24.520
 can do that better because we have no baggage and we're gonna stand no baggage right they're starting

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:30.600
 from like a later vantage point and like anytime you can start later and build on ideas like that

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:34.680
 like it can be a lot simpler you can you don't have all the baggage yeah and i feel like they committed

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:39.480
 like if you give amazon credit for inventing this idea it feels like they committed to the

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:46.280
 idea way harder than amazon ever did um so there also okay this is actually potentially disruptive

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:53.160
 because if this is what the bet on the future is gonna look like and amazon feels that way yeah

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.480
 they're gonna win because there this is a their model is a better aligned for this so i've always

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:04.520
 thought they were the best like edge case disruptor of of AWS and i feel like it's just

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.640
 become more and more likely uh the adoption is nowhere does that the adoption does not reflect

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.880
 that at all like very few people are using cloudflare it just has not really happened but

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.880
 it just becomes it's kind of they're gonna reach a tipping point at some point where

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:24.360
 a lot of new projects get get started with them um i plan on doing everything new from now on on

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:31.480
 cloudflare oh the sst vote not for sst because our customers aren't able AWS but for other

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:37.960
 stuff that i'm for your projects i mean that's telling it's that's information you know it's

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.880
 useful information i might like end up there might be like you know every there's always like a

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:47.400
 rosy window where you see everything is great and you find out like xyz things

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:52.440
 suck on it i'm sure to discover those but yeah please discover those and report back

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:58.520
 i do wonder like should i be putting cloudflare in front of my cdn my cloud front cdn from like

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:07.000
 a uh logistics or not logistics from a performance latency standpoint is that just bad is it so bad

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:14.040
 this is a funny thing we realized also we're like okay AWS WAF is not as good as cloudflare

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:19.080
 as equivalent my cloudflare is better handling the reasons you're very different yeah

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:25.560
 they just solve it for you and you don't get charged that's great so presumably you want to put

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:29.400
 cloudflare in front but putting cloudflare in front isn't just dns like it means you're routing all

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:37.080
 your traffic through it yeah so your end users are hitting cloud front sorry cloudflare at some edge

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:43.240
 location then why do they even bother hitting a cloud front a cloud front edge location the

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:49.400
 extra top that's pointless but can you connect your land of function URLs directly to your cloud you

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:55.640
 can exactly so that's that's what we realized that all you need to do is deploy a worker that routes

01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:00.760
 to a lambda function that way you can keep no JS compatibility if you want and there's this

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.320
 minimizes all the hops and cloudflare can still do all the caching and the stuff that you expect

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:11.960
 so you replace cloud front with cloudflare yeah and is that a thing that will be easy in sst yep so

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:18.520
 that would be great yeah so uh i think right now everyone just like oh yeah deploy on versatile or

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:24.680
 any of the AWS and just put cloudflare in front of it but you're like doing like a really extreme

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:30.440
 thing by doing that like yeah yeah i can't in good conscience introduce a second CDN like it needs

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:37.000
 to be the only CDN second hop yeah and never talking is funny because it's like uh i'm going to try

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.680
 list it out i've tweeted this before user goes to cloud so if you put cloudflare in front for DDoS

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:49.880
 yeah user goes to cloudflare then cloudflare goes to cloud front then cloud front goes to uh

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:57.400
 Kubernetes node in the uh region then the Kubernetes node sends back to cloudflare for to execute

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:03.640
 middleware and the middleware it responds back then then the Kubernetes goes already i already

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:08.040
 lost you forwards it's an AWS lambda and the emda does the actual request and sends it back

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:13.160
 through and everything goes back to the user there's like six hops here it's pretty insane yeah i

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:18.280
 missed something in the middle there uh that was an AWS data center with a Kubernetes cluster that

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.280
 forwarded to cloudflare you said that that's how versale works yeah because they execute oh you're

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:26.680
 talking about versale that's the missing context yeah and versale it's because you're middleware

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:33.080
 in cloudflare but like you entered in through cloudflare so do you know does versale uh it's

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:38.760
 got a funny uh does versale use cloud front too did you they might not so that it's possible they

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:44.680
 don't use it but then i don't really understand how their caching could work effectively because

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:50.120
 their entry point is not cloudflare they're entry point is not cloudflare on versale it's not

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:56.200
 cloudflare what is the entry point i think it's cloud front oh okay and they just rename all the

01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:00.920
 cloud front hit to like versale hit like if you look at the headers it's like they just

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:05.160
 rename the maybe i'm wrong maybe it is maybe they don't have cloud front because i know

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:11.800
 they have a Kubernetes cluster in every region in AWS every AWS region okay yeah but still like

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:16.840
 clearly something inefficient here because like yeah it could be more efficient yeah so we're

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:23.480
 hoping that so we're going to do uh we've done AWS versions of all our front ends we're going to do

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:27.800
 cloudflare versions of all our front ends once we understand both these things really well we're

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:33.320
 going to see how it makes sense to say i actually want the AWS version but skip the cloud front

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:37.560
 stuff and just yeah give me the cloudflare instead give me the regional URL and i'll put

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:43.480
 like a cloudflare worker in front of it yeah wait sst will do that for me right yeah i don't have

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:48.120
 yeah okay when you said i i wasn't sure who i is in this case okay

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:54.280
 so what's going on in twitter what's going on in the tech world today we're a week out a week

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:59.560
 and a half from React Miami no two weeks i don't know i know don't do my math don't check my math

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:04.040
 did you see the video of our secret project what oh yeah yeah that you shared i thought you meant

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:10.120
 like we posted something online uh oh man i'm so excited we have a secret project everybody i

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:17.480
 could smell it in the video you can smell it yeah yeah you can smell it i love this i love teasing

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:22.600
 out something that we really aren't going to talk about uh but can we tease out a little more detail

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:27.400
 that people will know in just a couple weeks at React Miami what this is all about oh yeah exactly

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:33.960
 we're gonna for those of you that are just dying with anticipation from all of using we've been doing

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:39.000
 there's probably whole subreddits about this the mystery project people do the types of work

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:45.960
 yeah we're gonna hack my email your weight will end your misery will end next week or i guess two

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:51.880
 weeks from now two because we will be announcing what it is on the first day of React Miami or

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:57.000
 somewhere around then if things go according to plan yeah what is the plan for the days prior to

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.440
 that are we i guess we're not going to announce what it is we're just going to the people are

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:06.920
 going to end yeah i'm very skeptical that we're going to be pulled off that's all right i want

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:12.200
 the world okay so we'll share a little bit more we're going to be doing a stream with some people

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:18.760
 that you may know you might know for the two days prior to React Miami and somehow we're going to

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:24.360
 try to avoid talking about what the surprise is what it is working on the surprise on stream yeah

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:29.640
 so i don't know there you go turn in you don't know where to turn in but you turn in

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:40.600
 this is fun what is going on twitter i don't think anything it's been kind of boring oh good

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.680
 i like to hear that when i'm not on twitter i like to hear that nothing is happening i probably

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:49.880
 peeked to twitter at least once every day and if i can't see something in that amount of time

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:58.200
 uh like in a very short amount of time then i just move on and on when when there's a lot

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.440
 going on on twitter i feel like even if i just peek at it once a day i kind of catch on that

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:06.360
 there's a lot going on there's like some people complain about testing or about whether you should

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:15.160
 i don't know there's something about that at all no thank you that conversation again yeah uh i did

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:22.520
 i did do the most brutal comment i think i maybe ever did oh no your most brutal comment what was

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:29.640
 this like i i think almost didn't post it okay so i posted a screenshot of our sot cloud flare

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:35.640
 stuff and i said this works now if you beg i'll release it tomorrow the first reply i got was

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:42.840
 from erin frances who said i'll wait thanks you know being sarcastic so i replied being like

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.640
 it's okay i figured you're tired of begging people to hire you

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:52.600
 jay with the red car yeah did you reply with the red car

01:09:52.600 --> 01:10:03.960
 that was good that was good oh man yeah i did type it out and i sat looking at it being like

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:11.160
 is this too far like i think erin knows i genuinely believe in him so yeah i don't think erin's gonna

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:15.720
 take that wrong that's so funny i'm just reading the replies to tweet

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:24.440
 okay that was good i'm glad i i'm glad you caught me up on that one at least yeah there's nothing

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:28.200
 over on that was probably the only thing that was the only thing that happened

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:36.440
 i just saw a uh a tweet from prime i don't even know that made me think of something

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.400
 he's talking about software devs i can only work six hours max farmers hour for 20 hours sometimes

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:47.400
 why is there uh like if a doctor like works really long hours it's like

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:56.120
 that's so noble but if a software dev works a lot of hours it's like oh you like start up bro you

01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:03.240
 toxic founder person or you're like i don't know it's such a negative thing if like you're really

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:09.080
 into your work and you're a software developer but like other jobs like they're the backbone of our

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:17.160
 civilization good job farmers the the doctor thing is crazy because like i can't believe we do

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:21.560
 like every doctor works especially on that career works like insane hours that are like

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.480
 inconsistent where like one day they'll be working at night the next day they're working on a day

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:31.080
 yeah and i'm like you're dealing with people's lives and like precise decisions like there's

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:37.160
 no way that this isn't probably have full mental capacities and be well rested and well fed yeah

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:43.560
 so if they can do it if they can do it at for what they're tasked with like i don't want to hear

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:49.800
 anyone complaining about yeah so our engineers are working long hours like just like i don't know

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:55.160
 people have gotten solved for the last couple years i don't think that i feel like this type of

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:59.560
 mindset is going away i think it was like kind of made up and people kind of live in this fantasy

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:04.120
 world and i feel like people are having to see reality a little bit more so i don't see it as much

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:09.480
 and i i think like two years ago if i said something like you got to work a lot of hours i think i've

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:13.880
 been afraid to say that i don't feel like i feel afraid to say that anymore yeah well i do feel like

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:21.480
 generally speaking the tides have shifted quite a bit in the software development zeitgeist

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:31.320
 with regards to softness versus hardness i guess is what i'll say yeah i don't know i'm going with

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:36.520
 that it's almost political like it feels like things have shifted from left to right a little bit

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:42.280
 yeah at least in the public discourse and like the amount of voices willing to speak up maybe

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:49.320
 nothing actually changed in terms of what people believe but the predominant voices in our very

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:55.880
 specific bubble of the world and the internet seem to have shifted towards like hey actually

01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.360
 maybe this stuff's ridiculous and i don't know some of it i feel like it's there's a weird vin diagram

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:05.960
 with elan musk and whether you love him or hate him there's like some weird stuff in there but like

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:11.720
 ultimately i do feel like there's been a shift do you sense that is that a thing that i made up i

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:17.720
 think so too like when i think about people that are looked at as role models and like you know

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:23.240
 people that have influence i am seeing that it's quite different than what the shape of that person

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:30.440
 looked like five five years ago yeah subjectively i feel like it's better now i feel like the values

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:35.000
 and stuff that they talk about are like more true to me it felt like the things that people were

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.240
 valuing five years ago it felt made up and it like didn't really make sense but we kind of all pretend

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:45.080
 like yeah it didn't make sense because we were in an environment where stuff that didn't make

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:51.000
 sense could survive for a long time so i think it's better i think we've corrected to like a pretty

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.400
 good place i think of course nothing ever corrects to the right spot i'm sure we're going to over

01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:03.000
 corrects over correct yeah yeah but overall like things seem much better than they used to be at

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.800
 least from my point of view yeah i should clarify when i said when i said left and right i meant

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.360
 a left and right politics in america which would be a very different thing i guess

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.840
 to people who listen to us from other places in the world i don't know they just call us all

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:24.200
 ultra right or something i don't know oh man speaking of though did you see this is a great

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.200
 thing to bring up you probably you probably miss it did you see the bill that was proposed in

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:35.320
 california no i don't think so there's a bill that was like if you are and like very specifically

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:42.120
 targets like a certain type of worker it's like targets like office software type of work yeah that

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:47.560
 if you're a boss you're not allowed to send email after 530 like a government law

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:56.840
 i'm sorry is this funny it's like it's california i'm trying to join the EU like what's going on

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:04.440
 oh that's just that's funny to me i don't know yeah it's just so like random and ridiculous

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:09.160
 so random and like just to think of email like them like defining email and some legislation

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.800
 like yeah i'm sure they have like long descriptions of like what qualifies like

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:18.120
 also slack messages also any kind of electronic communicator you know it's right like some weird

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.120
 legally yeah that's the main thing i thought of is like who sends emails anyway like they just

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:27.720
 go slack or whatever so but here's the funniest part i think people missed uh it was like

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:39.560
 each infraction will incur a fine of a hundred dollars so it's such like a small it's in so many

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:44.280
 ways it's just so random it's just a random thing to focus like you're a lawmaker you're like what

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:50.120
 do i focus on yeah oh i don't want people getting work emails messages from their boss like that's

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:54.280
 the thing i'm going to focus on super random and weird to even think the government should be involved

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:59.400
 in that in any form uh and then you're going to be like i'm going to charge them a hundred dollars

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:04.360
 for each one i really teach them a lesson and it just feels like it just feels like it feels like

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:10.680
 like it feels like so local it feels like some like like a local council type law yeah i can

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:17.320
 enjoy a type of thing this was the state of california like imagine like a worker like complaining to

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:23.400
 some agency and agency's studying like a hundred dollar fine till your boss your boss is like i'm just

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:33.240
 gonna fire you for tiling up oh man it's just so naive to think that i i'm like so obsessed with

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:38.840
 it it's like stupid to think that this makes sense in any form it's also so naive to think like

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:45.000
 passing this law wouldn't immediately have like really weird second order effects like you would

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.520
 not be able to enforce this in any way yeah you probably would get some like really weird

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:53.880
 side effect behavior from it yeah like what about all the employees that don't start until five

01:16:53.880 --> 01:17:00.680
 because they wake up at three yeah and it's like why are certain and i forgot how they

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:05.880
 describe like why is this only applied to like certain types of workers like it doesn't yeah

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:09.640
 like why are you like randomly focusing on them so clear like a weird signaling thing where they're

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:14.200
 like it's like a vendetta like we don't believe that something that like they're like clearly trying

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:19.560
 to understand that we don't believe something uh-huh and of course the guy paul graham at a

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:24.120
 funny tweet the guy that passed is like sponsoring a law i'm gonna have my fact trying maybe about

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:29.960
 someone else but again people in this like political circle yeah he's like this guy grew up richer

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:35.960
 than most of the people that he's trying to like fight against yeah of course yeah like there's a

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:42.840
 very wealthy like three phd type person yeah uh that is now in this in this role and just like

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:48.520
 man you were i feel like that person is so out of touch like i can see how that might have been a

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:52.840
 thing like a couple years ago like i could like give them the benefit of that okay like things

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:57.240
 are crazy like i see why i think this is a good idea but when things were nuts sure yeah that was

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:03.000
 really funny that that reminds me of we had some conversations about politicians just with work

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:09.720
 co-workers uh what how is it a thing in the in the united states of america that politicians are

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:14.760
 allowed to to trade on inside information no one else in the world is it's illegal if anyone does

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:20.600
 it but they do it constantly yeah and like paulosi there's like a fun loci tracks all over yeah like

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:24.920
 how insane is that actually and there's nothing anyone could do about it because i'm never gonna

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:30.200
 vote you know like make that legal because they're all getting rich from it she's so stupid it's just

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:34.680
 out in the open it's so blatant i know it's crazy because yeah it's been talked about forever and it's

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:40.680
 like they can just ignore it they can literally just ignore it yeah oh speaking of ignoring your

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:47.080
 friend last week your uh there's my friend your friend your your idol what's his name uh the guy

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:52.200
 that you get all your all your information about life from what what's his name what's his name

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:59.160
 the ice baths and the uh whim hoff no not whim hoff did whim hoff die ice bath and the sunning

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:04.440
 yourself oh you remember you remember yeah oh no i saw there was negative something about humor i

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:10.200
 thought dax is gonna love this i didn't even read what happened okay no it isn't one of those things

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:15.320
 were like i want there to be something negative so i can make fun of you but i haven't i have an

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:20.120
 underlying principle that's like overriding this i'm like god damn it okay what what what was the

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:25.080
 yeah i want to hear your principle too but what was your look into it too much but i think i think

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.880
 it was it was a bunch of stuff about his personal life and how he has like six girlfriends and

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:36.120
 like she was cheating on a bunch of people and was like behaving like really weird with all of these

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:41.000
 these people i'm gonna have to stop taking relationship advice from him oh wait that

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:50.520
 sorry yeah so my principal is like okay yeah that's if you like ask me like yeah that is weird and

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:55.880
 like could maybe form a judgment about it but like like do we really need to keep doing this where

01:19:55.880 --> 01:20:03.080
 we just like yeah dig through people's weird personal shit like like he is a really famous person

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:08.440
 in some weird position like they're all gonna be they're all doing weird shit like yeah it's not

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:13.640
 like i don't think i think it did was illegal there was probably some things you can consider like

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:19.320
 he was a bad person for doing certain things i'm sure i don't know all the all the details yeah

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:24.760
 but my only principle is like this is just weird gossip and we pretend like it's something like

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:31.480
 it matters yeah exactly uh but the reason i wanted to bring it up is because i think he did the most

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:37.400
 amazing thing ever so all this shit was blowing up right mm-hmm uh for a couple days everybody was

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:41.640
 talking about it i don't see anyone talking about it today you know what he did how did what do you

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:46.680
 do he just posted normally he just like he just ignored it he just ignored it and just posted one

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:51.320
 of his like the next thing he posted were just like a normal like one of his normal like videos

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:55.160
 about like you got this on your balls every two hours whatever shit that he talks about

01:20:55.160 --> 01:21:06.920
 something i'm so good it's on that far off i bet um not far yeah

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:13.240
 you gotta look up actually because he just posted this a like a normal thing and it just

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:18.280
 it's gone it's vanished just went away Nikita beer had this really funny tweet he's like i know

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:25.240
 a bunch of people that uh have been in like these pr nightmare scenarios and like he's like if you

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:29.720
 pay ten thousand dollars to a firm they'll like do this if you pay a hundred thousand dollars to

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:33.720
 the firm they'll like you know teach you how to like do a public apology blah blah if you pay a

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:38.440
 million dollars to a firm they just tell you to like ignore it and keep acting like nothing happened

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:42.840
 absolutely did and it worked and i think anything he would have done would have just prolonged it

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:47.960
 and i think it's yeah really interesting to see that so yeah i was very good with it because on one

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:52.520
 hand i'm like i want to go all it would be like he would have been sucked so i can like make fun

01:21:52.520 --> 01:22:00.440
 at him but it's like it to me it feels kind of like a like a cheap shot but i i don't like i don't care

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:06.520
 about heberman the human being at all i guess i just care about him delivering the the facts

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:12.440
 from science papers he's just like an aggregator for me i don't like look at him as like some lifestyle

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:17.800
 guru or like a person i want to aspire to be i it's transactional i like the information that he

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:24.040
 surfaces uh to the extent that he keeps digging through the papers and finding what science says

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:29.000
 the latest science says about certain personal health things but i'm going to keep following it you

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.080
 know i don't even listen to his podcast which is that's what i want to make fun that's what i want

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:37.400
 to make fun of you for i want to really just focus on that i want to have it pure like i don't want to

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:41.480
 i agree i i that's that's due relationship with it i don't think it's any more than that but i still

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:46.440
 want to make fun of that okay well you go ahead yeah make fun of it it's it's fine i'm just getting

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:53.880
 nor it you're a loser oh wow oh i didn't mean right now you know i'd become over someone's fault yeah

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:59.720
 yeah i think i don't know but you're a stereotype you're a you're a tech bros stereotype okay you get

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:04.760
 a little warmer in your life according to heberman's information you know i'm not uh you can't offend

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:09.000
 me i'm unoffendable somehow i have some maybe i'm a psychopath i know there's something about my

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.040
 personality that i literally have never been offended in my life clearly you haven't seen your nose

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:19.880
 what does that mean your nose looks ridiculous it's it's it's it's way too big for your face

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:23.000
 okay your face is too big for your nose at the same time

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:32.200
 if i've never been offended before i'm positive you won't do so with my physical appearance but

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:38.920
 that's not going to do it sorry i tried yeah so that was heberman last week it's funny because

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:42.840
 you remember like a while ago i asked if he was married because i was curious oh i think he did

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:47.160
 ask me that and he's not i guess i got the answer now multiple girlfriends is it even bad to have

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:52.120
 multiple girlfriends if they don't know about it yes it was weird because like he was like one of

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:57.000
 them was doing IVF and like it just i don't know it's definitely like definitely like a weird

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.960
 messed up scenario but again if if no one got hurt or if you didn't do anything illegal it's like

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:11.080
 you know personal life thing yeah what is that instinct in people to like look at people who are

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:16.120
 in the public eye and try to like tear them down does this make them feel better journalists man

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:20.200
 i just it's it's like the only way a journalist progresses in their career like the majority of

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:25.320
 journalists they can like tear down some public figure yeah come up with something dredged something

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:32.040
 up what a terrible existence i'm sorry if you're a journalist i know i i don't apologize i feel like

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:39.880
 it's uh to some degree yeah but i think we're also uh in the arena as we're in the arena trying

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:46.120
 stuff as uh which is face to moths says oh so we are journalists i need to know do i need to put

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:51.400
 this on my fingers i think there's journalistic aspects of what we do for sure on this podcast

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:57.880
 specifically or on twitter or else everything again could you say we can't wait these things we do

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:04.200
 yeah that's like that's a side thing like are we have like different primary incentives like

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:10.760
 humorman has his side side people i didn't want to say like something more derogatory i don't know

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:19.960
 it's just got his main his main woman and his side women sorry i took this way too far keep going

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:24.760
 so i saw memes about the humor and thing before i knew what people were actually talking about

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:31.320
 but the first one i went viral was like here's my routine wake up at five a.m go out and look at

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:37.160
 the sun have sex with girlfriend number one go have ice bath then like you know go do an ice bath

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.400
 have sex with girlfriend number two and he's like the like did a whole like human-type day

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:49.880
 yeah you know interjected with six partners yeah i do love memes people are funny i think like

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:56.360
 the collective humor of the internet is unmatched and if anything good has come out of the internet

01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:03.080
 forget whatever advances in human knowledge and research and whatever like the memes that the humor

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:11.080
 are incredible i do wonder like if ai was going to be like good at something why why like why have

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:17.880
 images generated by mid-journey not made it into the memes like nobody uses ai generated images for

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:23.160
 like a meme you know what i mean i feel like there's something uniquely human about meaning i think

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:28.120
 i think ken wheeler said bad he's like ai has no riz like to this day there's like no yeah i don't

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:33.800
 know what riz is but it doesn't have it yeah i see that word a lot lately what is rich literally

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:40.200
 i guess it like comes in the word charisma but like it just like just like that the x factor you know

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:44.520
 it's like when i was wearing that gold chain is that a little bit of i was a great demonstration of

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:52.760
 what not having riz looks like okay i gotta send that like damsar another way sorry you return it

01:26:52.760 --> 01:27:01.560
 you're reminded yeah you're trying like like 10 bucks i don't know i was like how much of that

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:05.720
 cost you're gonna bother returning that's funny i mean i just don't want to own it like i return

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.240
 things because i don't want them in my oh you how you're worried that someone's gonna let home

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:15.160
 you're gonna be like don't you see you with it no i just it's like we just have a lot of stuff

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:20.440
 would you have kids like there's just a certain amount of like we don't control how much stuff

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:25.800
 enters our home now because grandparents give them things every holiday every yeah it's just like

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:31.880
 the imports are ongoing so the exports are mostly stagnant and anytime i can get rid of something

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:36.280
 it's like i gotta get rid of this yeah this is a huge issue that i know me and liz are gonna have

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:44.200
 because we hate the aesthetic of most kids stuff yes colorful like uh-huh like those like saturated

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:50.520
 all garbage it's all just garbage plastic yeah so we're like we're never gonna buy that kind of

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:55.240
 thing there's nice wooden equivalents and you can get them but then people don't respect that and

01:27:55.240 --> 01:28:01.000
 they like your parents will get them all the garbage and then and then they get attached to the guard

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.800
 like they don't run it by you and then like suddenly they have this giant excavator toy and they can

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:10.040
 drive around in the driveway and you look like an idiot and they fell in love with it the moment

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:14.920
 they saw it and you don't have any choice but to keep it until eventually you leave it on the curb

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:19.880
 and spring cleanup day and it just gets taken away and they forget about it so that was a very

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:26.280
 specific story i think giant excavator could be okay i thought i could look nice no no it was not

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:31.400
 it didn't look like an excavator it looked like those uh you know those like giant cars we had as

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:35.720
 kids that you could walk around like Flintstones they like paddle with your feet it looked like that

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:40.680
 but they bolted on this arm that wouldn't even reach the ground so it moved but you couldn't

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:45.560
 actually dig with it so the kid is immediately pissed this is my now nine-year-old when he was

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:50.920
 four immediately it's like it won't dig i can't touch the ground with it so he's just pissed and

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:56.600
 it's like yeah it's a piece it's like it's garbage this thing is garbage and it weighs 70 pounds and

01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:01.480
 i hate it and it takes up so much room in our garage sorry this is really specific i should stop

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:06.840
 but that's basically life with kids yeah you just get all this stuff yeah looking forward to that

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:12.680
 yeah it's good time oh yeah i thought that when i was growing up i don't think i had a lot of that

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:19.320
 stuff really this wasn't a thing i hate this idea of producing something that just future

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:23.000
 garbage and i feel like a lot of the things that are obtained talking about that part of that

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.960
 and it just reminds me of like this thing like someone designed that and they knew that

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:34.280
 the end state of that thing is garbage very very quickly uh-huh and it still gets made yeah it's

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:40.120
 not good all the microplastics somebody said i just read something i don't know where i saw it that

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:47.080
 like the average it was the averages that some people ingest like a credit card's worth of plastic

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:52.440
 every week wow i'm holding a crack right now every week yeah every week that much plastic that much

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:58.040
 it's obviously like tiny little micro and nanoparticles but like if you bunch them all up yeah i mean

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:02.040
 that that's insane right microplastics are everywhere at this point they're like in our blood stream

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:05.880
 and stuff so yeah that's what they were saying like they found that all these places that there

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:10.920
 should not be plastic in our body there's plastic yeah i we should just hope that at this point it's

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:17.640
 let me can do it we're just hoping that it didn't matter there's quite this being a little tiny

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:21.400
 particle yeah it's like whatever it actually doesn't do anything it's like whatever it's kind of the

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:28.520
 case with like like electromagnetic radiation right it's like it's Wi-Fi and 4g and 5g everywhere

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:33.400
 but it's kind of like it doesn't do anything it's well it's called non what if it kills you after

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:38.840
 like 50 years and we still don't know yet well in 50 years i'll be dying anyway yeah but like think

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:43.880
 of the next generation backs what what do we do they're going to be in in VR they're going to be on

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:48.280
 apple vision 10 oh they're gonna their brains are gonna be in jars hopefully on my brain's in the

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:53.960
 persona that's actually how will exist the the apple vision pro personas that's just yeah they're

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:58.680
 gonna need to fix the hair but did you see the thing that they added now they had to fix the hair

01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:05.560
 well not for me yeah they added something to apple vision pro is everything yeah they'd added

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:12.440
 like this collaborative thing where uh you can be in your room with like a whiteboard or something

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:16.280
 in front of you and like other people show up and they're like in the room with you and it like

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:20.280
 looks like kind of looks like kind of good i don't think it looks horrible like great it looks kind

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:25.720
 of good so you're saying like they see what the inside of your room looks like it's like they're

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:29.720
 in your room with you yeah everyone's like in the same room there's there's like a host is the room

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:36.440
 like a physical room in your house or is it like a virtual room actually this is a good question

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:40.040
 maybe it's all virtual that actually makes more sense maybe i wonder if you could like map your

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:43.640
 room and like people could show up in your room with you yeah and then they see you wait from every

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:49.800
 angle oh yeah have you seen the uh there's gaussian splatting thing i don't know if you've seen this

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:56.440
 gaussian right gaussian gaussian i'm missing up i'm missing the gaussian apati algorithm

01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:03.720
 gaussian gaussian spot i think well actually that's when i'm not a hundred percent like i feel

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:08.440
 like i've only ever read it never heard anyone say it got like gaussian blur is that even blurry yeah

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:14.920
 yeah classic photoshop reference yeah of course of course isn't that gaussian blur i got to cancel

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:18.920
 my adobe creative cloud sorry dude but you're gonna get charged for the remainder of the year

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:24.600
 that was going around twitter i already yeah no i've had a i've had that exact thing play out

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:29.880
 it's a nightmare i'm so done with with adobe so anyway splatting have you seen what that is no

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:34.840
 i'm only familiar with the gaussian blurring not the gaussian splatting so the basically the

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:41.080
 technology for taking a video of something from every angle and then turning that into a 3D

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:46.520
 model has gotten insanely good and i didn't want to take needs to call a gaussian splatting i don't

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:53.800
 know how it works exactly but someone did it of the the bridge collapse um someone flew a drum all

01:32:53.800 --> 01:33:00.760
 around it and it looks insane like you can like see every angle it looks like so realistic yeah

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:07.880
 and it's pretty wild to think that so quickly we had like a real-time 3D immersive

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:14.840
 uh thing we could experience of that scenario yeah imagine if this stuff gets like even more

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:19.240
 and more real-time but that happened like within a couple days imagine if it happened like within

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:24.600
 day within an hour like real-time like are we gonna have like real-time just 3D maps of like every

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:31.400
 location and stuff like it's wild that'd be super cool that like 3D scanning technology used to be

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:36.600
 like a very specific thing and now just like phones can do it right yeah and video has that

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:42.920
 that uh app where you can and this is like this was made for use for professionals that are like

01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:47.320
 trying to make assets or video games and stuff where you can take an object and like they like guide

01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:52.200
 you through using your phone to capturing that object and you bring it into 3D and it looks

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:59.480
 very good oftentimes yeah i'm excited by that it's funny i i've always said this weird thing

01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:03.240
 where i'm like i want to live in a virtual virtual world but i want to look exactly like

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:13.640
 my actual world except like i can't die in it and stuff so i'm like really i can't die in it like

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:18.040
 i don't want some like crazy fantasy where not certainly i want like my exact house my exact

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:27.800
 office but like i have infinite money but what kind of money you want the sims but like virtual

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:33.720
 reality and you can live forever in your current environment and that way i feel like it's completely

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:38.680
 real yeah yeah so we just need those little tubes from the matrix where you just like live in this

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:47.880
 vata jelly and your body lives forever but like so into it take my mind i love so much tea would you

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:55.960
 know what you like but i thought if you really love your work you do it even without money

01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:00.680
 there's no people say that i'm just saying in a world where that technology exists i don't think

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:10.680
 helping people deploy stuff to the clouds yeah no i i wouldn't work on this i think i work on something

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:16.120
 but i i don't know what the thing we're we're doing soon that's what we'd work on well even that

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:21.000
 we've worked on a virtual version but it has meaning and purpose i think so i think some some

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:29.720
 form of that could continue to exist yeah so we do the sims over covid uh me and liz made we

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:35.000
 literally is when we live in new york we measured all of our walls and we recreated our apartment

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:41.480
 one-to-one in the sims in the sims and it was like i've definitely tried making our home in sims

01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:47.320
 years ago yeah i guess that would have been probably before so kasey my wife was super into

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:54.120
 sims like in college of course we all had that phase where we're like uh oh i forgot i'm a human

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:57.640
 being that's just watching this other human being live life i forgot to live my own life

01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:01.880
 i'm just the sitting in the corner all my bars should be at zero like i'm

01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:10.280
 red in all possible ways uh yeah always like had those week-long kicks with the sims but yeah i've

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:14.760
 definitely tried to recreate homes oh you know what it was a lego thing that's what i'm thinking

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:20.440
 of more recently we tried to build our home with lego oh did it work so there's that too no it didn't

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:25.720
 work legos are big and fat and dumb and you can't make precise things i mean if you had enough

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.480
 you should like a one-to-one scale then then you could just say you made the scale big enough

01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:37.320
 that's funny went to lego land this weekend sorry there's a lego land in

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:42.920
 in the middle of the city in the middle of nowhere really is that what you think of me

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:45.880
 where i live they have to import those legos really far

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:51.800
 those legos come from all of them just came here or wherever the hell legos were born

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:56.520
 yeah i want you to try and save the country because your your track record today was

01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:04.760
 get gajin and i didn't think yeah i said gajin gajin gajin yeah gajin

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:13.160
 uh lego land the netherlands i want to say which is a different place than holland no same place

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:19.560
 no it's the same it's which one thinks Dutch okay i'm gonna stop legos legos are cool company i

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:25.080
 think it's one of those companies that there's a few companies that are like this where the primitive

01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:32.680
 they made is perfect and then they just rode this like infinite merchandising wave that like just

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:37.800
 grows them infinitely which is like yeah there's some other company i saw recently that was that

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:42.920
 same thing what now they're just like every sports team every like disney thing like you know

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:50.200
 just what in the great thing but like the lego also with the details like two lego bricks connecting

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:55.160
 feels nothing like any other imitation all right brick like you take any of the other knock-off

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.640
 companies they don't feel the same they don't connect the same way they've figured out like

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:07.080
 the manufacturing precision and the exact shapes that just like satisfyingly pushed together you

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:11.320
 know what i mean yeah so they're like really into those little details that they nailed like the

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:16.760
 exact way play bricks should work and then they keep coming out with new pieces like for new sets

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:21.480
 they'll invent new pieces and they all fit together so well like they all like are on this scale that

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:25.560
 they work together they combine in so many different weird ways backwards compatible with every other

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:30.840
 brick before yeah yeah it's really incredible actually yeah i love like i step on one like nothing

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:38.920
 delivers pain like oh yeah that's ultimate pain yeah i step on them often it's always wild to me

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:43.480
 where when there's things like that that have been around for so long that like nobody has

01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:49.160
 copied perfectly it's always it's always like it's interesting to see that i think some of this stuff

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:54.760
 in an iphone is kind of like that too where like the touch even just if the even even even just a

01:38:54.760 --> 01:39:01.000
 pure software stuff like mmm which theoretically i don't see why this can't be copied uh but like

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.840
 yeah that's just like eludes it's like whatever magic that comes together is like much more than

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:12.520
 the code or like the physical thing it's like the organization yeah we see that a bunch where

01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:19.640
 we we're talking about lego oh i went to legoland uh we went twice and because the first time we went

01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:26.040
 we went on a friday and i thought because we're going to be there friday saturday sunday

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:30.440
 in can't city and i thought like oh we go on friday everybody's working everybody's in school there's

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:36.440
 going to be no way there turns out friday was a special friday it was a good friday if you will

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:44.920
 stir yeah and i have never seen more people packed into one building it was oh my god nuts and wait

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:51.640
 legoland is a building yeah it's an indoor thing it's like yeah it's not like Disneyland

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:57.240
 it's like uh it's just all kinds of lego stuff i don't know there's places these things you can

01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:04.600
 build and race lego cars and there's some rides oh it's pretty fun uh but it was insane and both my

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:10.040
 boys have just never been like in huge crowds all that much and they were just at one point one of

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:13.560
 them in tears just over how many people there were it was just like i want to leave this is

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:17.640
 overwhelming like there's just people everywhere and like kids screaming and just like running

01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:22.680
 over each other and it's just a nightmare so we went back uh sunday morning when everyone else is

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:29.480
 at church Easter sunday morning there's nobody i'm telling you we had the place for ourselves it was

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:34.600
 amazing so they're just a little like heathen tip for people who really want to go somewhere

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:40.200
 go Easter sunday morning because everybody is in church in the united states especially in the

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:46.520
 midwest that's really funny yeah let's woke up at five a.m to go to mass with her family actually

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:50.600
 that i saw pictures looked amazing because it was outdoor and like the sun they like watched the

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:54.760
 sunrise as part of it and it looked really insane yeah and i'm sure when when you're hearing all

01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:59.720
 this like religious stuff like being around that like actually works well like you feel like oh yeah

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:07.240
 like amplified feelings nature yeah you know yeah but yeah i was like asleep like i was like in

01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:14.360
 summer there's no way i'm doing that seeing the sunrise no thanks that's funny just all the

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:24.680
 sinners at legoland yeah yeah when you did see anybody there it's kind of like yeah that's funny

01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:30.520
 that's funny have they been to disneyland no they've not been hmm they've not been to an amusement park

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:34.600
 are they interested uh i don't know if they know they exist that's the funny thing about having

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:38.120
 kids that aren't in public school there's a lot of parts of the world they just don't know exist

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:42.520
 a lot of things concepts they've never been introduced to and it's our fault like any knowledge

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:48.200
 gaps they have are gonna fall squarely on me and my wife like oops you got to tell you those things

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:54.520
 exist sorry uh yeah no i don't think they know that like amusement parks are a thing that's funny

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:59.960
 we went to like six flags a lot growing up me too we had six flags in new jersey i went i went to

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:04.120
 disney world in orlando when i was like three i don't remember much of it i was just take the

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:09.640
 kids to disney world yeah disney world yeah yeah because disney world just keeps getting better and

01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:15.080
 better and better and better like it's so real now like some of this stuff is just like oh i'm

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:19.720
 like in the star wars like it's it's real like it's like you see some of the technology that's like

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:24.920
 in front of your eyes and those things and you just can't figure out how it works at all like some

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:29.880
 of the riser just like i don't understand what's happening like i feel like i'm in this and i don't

01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:34.200
 think i'm looking at a screen i don't know what trick they're doing and yeah it's it's really wild

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:37.800
 oh yeah i want to i want to see it for myself now you've got me convinced i thought i was doing

01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:44.360
 for the kids but no no no even as an adult like you yeah like i'm sure i'm sure in a couple years

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:49.240
 both your kids will be able to go on mostly everything so that would probably be more fun but

01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:53.480
 yeah yeah i should wait till archer's a little older because he's he's going to miss out on some of it

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:58.120
 yeah yeah yeah we're doing it but then if i wait too long the oldest one's too old and he's wearing

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:02.360
 a house with dumb no i guess there's stuff for everybody it's it's cool i mean he might think it's

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:07.400
 dumb when you decide to go but then i think you'll enjoy it like you know enjoy it when we're there yeah

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:12.280
 classic situation but yeah like some of the new harry potter stuff i mean i haven't been there since

01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:15.880
 oh harry potter stuff yeah i haven't been there since like 2016 maybe if i have

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:19.880
 wait disney world has harry potter stuff are you sure is that not universal i mean they're all

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:22.440
 universal i mean they're all but universes in florida they're all like they're all right next

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:27.480
 to each other yeah yeah yeah like that stuff uh some of the rides oh man they have like so

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:35.880
 one of the rides escape from green gods i think it is or maybe two other one um the line you go

01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:42.600
 through the hogwarts castle and they like rebuild they built all like the iconic spots in it and

01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:49.240
 they have they have the portraits that are like alive and like saying shit and stuff yeah it looks

01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:52.840
 way better than what you would imagine which is like oh yeah they just put like a screen in a picture

01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:58.360
 frame yeah they did way more than that and it looks like it looks like way better than it should

01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:03.080
 uh like that set design stuff that they do i think they just get like the best set design

01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:07.720
 people in the world to come yeah build that stuff like they built like diagon alley with all the

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:11.560
 stores and you can like get butter beer and all that stuff and now i want to go to universal

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:18.040
 yeah this sounds amazing yeah then then they added pandora like from avatar like the the blue

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:22.520
 people oh yeah that's supposed to be really crazy like there's a ride there that everyone

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:27.160
 said like goes crazy about they added a bunch of new star wars everything big because aren't the

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:35.320
 avatar things like bigger they're like that's true yeah maybe yeah um maybe yeah i imagine

01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:42.680
 i imagine working on that like it's so fun oh yeah like if that's your job yeah but is it like a

01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:46.760
 construction crew you come in you do it and then you kind of leave and you're done it's like an

01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:52.920
 ongoing job no so someone was telling me oh so Stefan uh he he's from Orlando and he would tell me

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:57.560
 there's like a lot of software engineers that live there because they all work at disney hmm

01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:05.080
 interesting so there's a lot to do i guess across the board there um yeah that's just fun like you

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:11.240
 just try to make fun stuff for people yeah okay i'm i'm making a we're gonna make a trip yeah tour

01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:17.240

01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:23.240
 a lot if we throw a two it's been two hours an hour and fifty something and i feel like if the

01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:27.240
 it's a podcast was two hours long but people are going to nope out real quick they're like you know

01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:33.240
 what i'm gonna skip this one i see what you're saying when i see the length yeah yeah but if it's

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:38.360
 an hour 51 it's that old bike sales trick you know $1.99 we'll never know the difference we're gonna

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:44.040
 trojan horse our two hour conversation in there okay if you're listening to this if you've been
