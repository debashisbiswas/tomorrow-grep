WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 - I might be a little sick.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.400
 - Oh man.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.620
 - I was trying so hard.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.460
 - Ooh.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.300
 - You don't sound good.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.140
 - Yeah.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.300
 (laughing)

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.160
 - I was trying so hard to deny it.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.540
 - Good luck.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.120
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:40.440
 - Casey, she has this thing with like,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.200
 how powerful your mind is, you know,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.680
 and like she thinks I have an especially powerful mind.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.240
 I convinced myself I'm sick.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.960
 So she has this whole routine she goes through

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.880
 when she starts feeling symptoms

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.520
 and like telling yourself, it's just,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.020
 it's allergies, it's fine.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.960
 So I did the whole routine for a couple of days

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.080
 and I thought it went away.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.880
 And then I was like so psyched that I used the power

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.160
 of my mind to not be sick.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.480
 And then I woke up this morning

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.000
 and my throat feels awful and I can't talk.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.660
 - So I do believe in that stuff, if I'm being honest.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.500
 - Yeah.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.280
 - Okay, so I'm gonna say a bunch of stuff.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.540
 I'm sure someone will listen to and be like,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.040
 that's not accurate, but whatever,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.520
 I'm just gonna say it anyway.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.520
 I have heard that paramedics are trained

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.060
 when they're like, let's say that someone's in an accident

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.400
 and they're like hurt and maybe unconscious,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.200
 when they're moving them into the ambulance

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 and like around them, not to say stuff like,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.680
 this person's fucked or like,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.920
 they're definitely not gonna make it.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.400
 - Well, yeah, that would be bad, if so.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.560
 - Because I think I've heard that there's research

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.200
 that shows that subconsciously, if you hear that,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.800
 that actually has a good impact on your outcome.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.640
 - Wow.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.480
 - 'Cause at the end of the day, like your body,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.360
 it's not like external stuff that's healing your body.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.080
 It's your body healing your own body.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.920
 - Yeah.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.880
 - And some part of that is controlled by,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.240
 I mean, it's like a complex emergency system, of course,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.960
 but like, yeah, part of me like believes there's some,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.040
 some tie with like the conscious

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.240
 and not conscious part of you.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.200
 - It's kind of wild when you think about your body,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.280
 like all the things that your active brain don't control.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.120
 - Oh yeah.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120
 - Doesn't control.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.960
 - Yeah.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.600
 - Like just all the autonomous systems and things happening.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.400
 And like how, like, what, there's like in your gut, even,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.200
 is there something about like--

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200
 - Like a bacteria?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.000
 - Well, like, there's the bacteria,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.400
 but then there's also this idea that like,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.760
 it's not just, what is it that's in your brain,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.840
 it sounds only in your brain, neurons, is that what it is?

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.680
 - 'Cause I--

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.400
 - There's like a cluster of them,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.380
 like the second largest cluster is like in your gut

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.220
 or something like that.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.060
 - Is that what it is?

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.600
 - I don't know, I'm making stuff up.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 (laughing)

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.400
 It's this idea that not all like messages come from your brain.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.600
 I used to think like everything in your body

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.680
 is being controlled by signals from your brain,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.400
 but like lots of different parts of your body

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.800
 actually make their own decisions

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.440
 and kind of like act on their own.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.280
 Is that true?

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.080
 - The other thing with that is like the gut bacteria also,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.560
 like that's also communicating to your brain

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.680
 and asking for things.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.760
 And that's like not you technically, but it is.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.600
 - It is.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.400
 - Like I mean, the thing with sugar,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.600
 like people talk about sugar,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.680
 I mean I've experienced it myself,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.680
 like if you start eating a bunch of sugar,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.640
 your like sugar addiction like really starts going up.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.480
 - Yeah.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.760
 - And I think that just from the bacteria in your gut

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.160
 that's like demanding more and more of it.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.240
 And if you stop eating sugar cold turkey for like three days,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.480
 it just all goes away.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.240
 So it's so weird that this conscious part of your brain,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.360
 like sometimes I'll just be like zoning out

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.840
 and walking around my house.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.120
 Next thing I know, like there's something sweet in my hand

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.000
 that I'm eating and I don't really remember like me doing that.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.640
 And yeah, something like mind controlled me from my gut.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.480
 Really weird.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.520
 - We're not really one living organism, are we?

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.640
 We're like a legion of living organisms.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.760
 We're like a host to all of these things

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.400
 that like the gut microbiome is nuts.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.440
 I want to talk about the food psychology thing.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.400
 You saying that reminded me.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.120
 There was like, I don't know, three, four months ago,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.080
 I tweeted something about like struggling with food psychology

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.440
 and just that my wife and I feel like half of our daily struggle

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.680
 is just food and having to...

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.960
 I mean, there's like the logistics of it that are painful,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.840
 having to make it clean it up, whatever.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.280
 All the preparing and being in the kitchen and doing all that.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.760
 But just the food psychology part

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.240
 where we feel like we've constantly battled

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.760
 just like eating for fun or boredom or stress

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.280
 or whatever we're dealing with.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.680
 And I tweeted something about like,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.080
 hey, anybody have solutions?

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.520
 And everybody's like, what are you talking about?

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.960
 Food's easy, what, huh?

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.840
 And I felt so alone.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.680
 (laughing)

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.080
 I felt like I'm crying.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.840
 Oh, this is bad.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.880
 This may or may not make it under our podcast feed.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.480
 No, it's definitely got to make it, this hilarious.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.480
 Okay.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.600
 Yeah, I just remember like,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.280
 not a lot of people seem to resonate with this idea

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.680
 of like the difficulty of food psychology

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.160
 and just like eating the things you need

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.640
 and not just for funsies.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.280
 'Cause I feel like so much of my eating

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.080
 is probably unnecessary.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.240
 And that's been a constant struggle.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.880
 Do you feel, is that a struggle?

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.760
 Like the sugar addiction thing is what made me think of this

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.800
 'cause we definitely struggle with getting into sugar.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.560
 I can definitely relate to some of it.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.720
 I don't think it manifests for me the exact same way.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.720
 I think I'm not someone that has a habit

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.600
 of just eating all the time.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.160
 Like if anything, I forget to eat all the time.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.600
 Like I've eaten anything today.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.760
 Yeah, when I'm working, I do, yeah.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.600
 Exactly.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.680
 So I don't think I have that habit of eating

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.040
 but I'll go through periods of time

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.720
 where I'm like, it always starts out the same

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.880
 where like we'll have, you know what?

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.920
 I think we're starting it.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.600
 I think the period is starting right now.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.360
 'Cause Liz was like, I'm gonna make a cake.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.200
 She made a cake and it's a big cake.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.160
 It's a big chocolate cake and it's really good.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.200
 And I literally had it for breakfast yesterday.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.840
 It starts off with something like that

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.360
 and then I just start eating it every day

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.160
 and then I just get used to like pretty much having access

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.280
 as something sweet like whenever I need it.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.120
 Yeah.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.520
 So for me, it's always like at the end of every day for me,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.040
 it's like I have to end on like a sweet something.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.040
 Yeah, sweet.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.960
 But like that, it's not like it stays like flat.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.000
 Like I just start doing more and more and more

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.120
 and then it gets to the kind of like a weird place

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.360
 but the fix is so easy for me, I just discovered it.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.360
 Like it's very easy for me to just go cold turkey

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.320
 for three or four days

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.120
 and then I just go back to normal.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.480
 So that part I can relate to the,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.800
 okay, I'm like not really in control

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.160
 of what's happening in relation to food.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.400
 And I'm sure that like manifests for you

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.280
 in like a different way.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.080
 I don't know, I feel like it's first world problems.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.960
 It's like the abundance of food that we have

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.960
 in our society creates all these different struggles.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.440
 I feel like if I just talk like this,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.360
 if I just talk in this register,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.840
 you can't really tell that I'm sick.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.120
 I'm gonna try to maintain.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.480
 I feel there's some cod podcast

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.320
 so it's a talk about on purpose all the time.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.040
 Yeah, just monotone like this, just all love.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.920
 Is it monotone?

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.760
 It's like a whisper.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.760
 It's like a crime podcast where they're like talking

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.360
 about this file that they dug up from the local.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.240
 Yeah, I think that's what it is.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.760
 Sharest apartment.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.480
 And you would not believe what,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.440
 that's still a lot of true crime podcasts.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.120
 (laughing)

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.800
 I haven't listened to any.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.320
 Don't you guys get like really scared?

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.160
 Like, doesn't that like work up your paranoia at all?

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.600
 Me and who's you guys?

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.880
 Just all the people that listen to true crime stuff.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.520
 I don't really get it.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.120
 So it's, for me, it started with cereal.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.960
 Yeah.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.920
 And I've just been chasing that experience.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.760
 It's like meth.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.600
 It's like the first time you do it.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.120
 It's the highest high

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.040
 and then you're just chasing that for the rest of your life.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.320
 I'm just chasing the cereal experience.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.080
 I'll never get there again.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.080
 But it made me think maybe it's a genre.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.840
 Maybe I just need to listen to more true crime stuff

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.200
 and I'll find something that engages me like cereal did.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.320
 Nope, it's, it's Sarah Koenig.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.360
 It's her storytelling.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.440
 I don't know if I've talked about this

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.280
 on the podcast before

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.160
 but it's just anything she does I think

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.840
 is what I really am into.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.240
 But yeah, I've listened to much of true crime.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.400
 Don't get scared, I guess.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.160
 Nothing about cereal scared me

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.860
 about a high school drama turned murder.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.080
 I don't know.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.840
 Yeah, I don't get scared about true crime stuff.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.680
 Yeah.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.280
 I can see why the cereal story maybe isn't necessarily scary

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.280
 but hound visited me a few weeks ago.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.200
 And we were talking about how he goes on these

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.720
 like really crazy rabbit holes with true crimes.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.760
 The one listening to true crime stuff

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.520
 but also it's like reading like.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.880
 Oh, the Wikipedia stuff.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.800
 Yeah, I forgot what he was describing

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.480
 but it was always like, it was like, yeah,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.840
 I was on Wikipedia and I was reading about this serial killer

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.320
 and he did all this crazy stuff

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.280
 but then there was a link on the Wikipedia article

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.200
 to this other guy who actually even more crazy stuff.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.840
 And I clicked on that and then he just kept going

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.520
 and going and then like, you know, he's out.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.920
 He's like mostly from the city

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.920
 but like, you know, when he's visiting,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.800
 he's in Maine now, he's in the middle of nowhere

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.600
 and it can be kind of creepy.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.200
 So like, yeah, like I'm not surprised that he's like,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.760
 you know, imagining all this crazy stuff happening to him

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.640
 when he'll read all that stuff.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.840
 Yeah, I just finished a podcast actually.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.200
 I think I know, I didn't get scared

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.440
 but when you listen to some of this stuff,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.440
 it's alarming that there are people

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.040
 that their brain works this way.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.480
 So like it was about a serial killer.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.440
 I can't remember now what it's called.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.240
 It's about the serial killer from like the 70s, I think

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.800
 but he had like a whole family and they had no idea

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.000
 but he was like killing all these people, what was it called?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.160
 A podcast, true crime.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.300
 Why am I doing this?

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.600
 I'm trying to find it, not bear brook.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.920
 I did listen to some of that.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.360
 I mean, some of these podcasts really do have

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.120
 the most monotone voice ever.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.040
 - It's a serious topic.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.040
 - Yeah, I guess so.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.200
 - You're gonna be like, I'm next.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.880
 - You stabbed them six times in the story, yeah.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.160
 - But it takes away when like they just sound so boring.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
 Like you sound like a very boring person, you know?

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.240
 - It was about this guy that they just went

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.640
 into some of the stories of like the murders

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.920
 and just how cold and how like, how could his brain

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.880
 just like be that way?

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.280
 How is that another human being?

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.440
 I don't know that part.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.840
 It's not scary, it's just kind of like very dark

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.920
 to think about psychopaths and all this.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.320
 - Have you killed any people?

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.680
 - Have I killed any people?

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.560
 Like listening to that, does it make you wanna,

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.900
 you know, is it making you curious?

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.280
 (laughing)

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.960
 - I don't know why that's so funny to me.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.040
 Is it making me curious about killing people?

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.000
 (laughing)

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.900
 - Listen, okay, let me just explain the thought process here.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.840
 At some point, I'm assuming you came across Elon Musk

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.640
 and Mark Zuckerberg with their whole like Jiu-Jitsu fight.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.120
 And then you saw people like, you know, doing Jiu-Jitsu.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.360
 - They didn't do it though, did they?

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.200
 - No, they didn't.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.160
 But I'm assuming that was like some thing

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.680
 that caught your attention.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.800
 And then you probably started watching

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.560
 some people do Jiu-Jitsu.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.200
 And then now you're like really into it

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.640
 and doing it like crazy.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.400
 (laughing)

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.440
 - It's not unreasonable for me to ask.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.640
 - For me to get curious,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.680
 just 'cause I got into true crime podcasts.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.980
 - Like, no, you're like, I wanna be the number one serial killer.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.960
 I wanna be a world-class serial killer

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.840
 that's killed more people than anyone.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.240
 - Oh man, it's too good.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.600
 'Cause I see the connection.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.760
 I see how you got there.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.800
 I do get curious about things and then,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.420
 yeah, I wanna conquer them.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.640
 This is not one though.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.680
 I've not got curious about a life of crime.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.320
 - Okay, well, thought I'd ask.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.280
 So speaking of people dying,

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.460
 do you see my poll the other day about people being born?

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.720
 - Yeah, the five billion people.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.800
 I wanna ask you about that.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.920
 I mean, I know the right answer.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.240
 - I don't know if there's a right or wrong answer,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.320
 but I do feel there's a right perspective.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.320
 And I posted that, so the poll was,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.840
 and I kind of fudged the numbers a little bit,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.040
 but when I was born,

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.560
 there was roughly five billion people on the earth.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.840
 And now there's like almost double.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.280
 When you hear that,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.400
 do you immediately feel like that's exciting,

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.520
 so much more opportunity?

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.360
 Or do you feel like,

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.320
 oh no, like so much less opportunity,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.560
 so many more people I'm competing with?

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.880
 And I was curious to see what the split was.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.600
 And I think it was like 60/40.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.480
 It was technically,

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.120
 most people did feel like a positive way about that.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.880
 But 40% of people felt negative.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.280
 And to me, I would kind of hope being it would be

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.400
 like an 80/20 split or something.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.920
 Like more negative.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.960
 - No, I was hoping that most people would feel more positive.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.240
 Like I think it should be like,

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.760
 I feel like that split.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.600
 - Yeah, I gotcha.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.440
 - Yeah, and it's like,

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.680
 I think I had this thought like a long time ago.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.680
 I was like, man, there's always like

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.200
 the richest guy in the world.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.760
 And then somehow like someone surpasses them.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.880
 And it's like, how does it always happen?

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.720
 Like how did Bill Gates become the rich?

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.240
 I mean, I think he's like in and out now,

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.080
 but there was a time where Bill Gates

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.080
 was the richest like forever,

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.520
 like ever since I could recall

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.320
 that he was the richest guy.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.720
 And then at some point, Jeff Bezos,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.560
 like passive and I was like,

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.640
 whoa, how do you pass a richest guy?

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.800
 And at some point I realized like,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.720
 oh, Jeff Bezos, this company is serving like,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.680
 there's more people on the planet to like serve

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.920
 and do a service for.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.520
 So yeah, like when the population doubles,

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.560
 like it's going to be even easier for someone

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.440
 to like surpass whatever, whatever that is.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.200
 And that's like the most naive way of looking at it.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.680
 Like every person is like a little bit.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.960
 It's like more people in the world

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.120
 that like whatever service you're offering

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.760
 is more people you can offer that service.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.600
 Whatever you need done,

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.640
 there's more people that are capable of doing it for you.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.040
 And all like the interconnectivity,

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.080
 like that's all exponential as well.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.920
 - Yeah.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.200
 - So to me, I feel like very positive about that stuff.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.480
 And I love population growth.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.280
 And I like want to like see there

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.280
 being more and more and more and more and more people.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.840
 But I think a lot of people feel negative about it.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.280
 And they see like a lot of problems in the world.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.600
 And they're like, this wouldn't be a problem

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.440
 if we only had half as many people.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.200
 - Is it like mostly like climate concerns

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.000
 that the most vocal groups?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.360
 - Yeah, it's stuff like that.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.520
 But like you see it everywhere, like, you know,

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.200
 people are like, oh, there's not enough housing,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.040
 which is fair.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.720
 Like the housing has not kept up with population growth.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.280
 But they like look at it as we need to like curb population.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.120
 - Yeah.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.560
 - But like it's, it's just crazy.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.920
 Cause like with more people that exist,

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.560
 like the better quality of life that goes up

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.360
 cause we're just outputting more in net.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.880
 - Yeah.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.600
 - So like your life would just be a lot worse

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.380
 if there were, you know, less people in the world.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.160
 But yeah, I was curious to see what the response was.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.960
 And yeah, I think they almost have people

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.880
 feel kind of negative about population.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.440
 - Yeah, I wonder, I do wonder how many of like,

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.920
 I would love to know the breakdown of why people feel that way.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.920
 The people who feel negatively about like is it,

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.600
 is it a huge chunk of them or concerned about housing

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.200
 or the climate or is it other stuff?

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.280
 Is it competition?

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.320
 Like you feel like there's more people competing

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.000
 for the same resources or something?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.760
 - Yeah, I think that definitely can be stressful.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.120
 Like sometimes they look at the stats

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.400
 and the number of software engineers there are.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.160
 And like I can like kind of feel that way too.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.320
 I'm like, holy shit, they're like millions of,

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.680
 these are pretty million I think.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.520
 Yeah.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.080
 - Yeah, it's cause I definitely was not that high

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.520
 when I was first starting.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.240
 - When you were starting, there was only five developers.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.120
 When you were born, there's only five developers.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.040
 Five billion people on earth and five developers.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.040
 - There's five developers.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.400
 I was born, it was, it was, my dad was one,

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.760
 Bill Gates was the other one.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.600
 - Yeah.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.200
 I was the other one.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.120
 (laughing)

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.120
 - Oh man.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.560
 - I get the immediate feeling of being negative,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.840
 but I think overall it's always been positive.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.080
 - Yeah, I just, I remember seeing yesterday

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.320
 a tweet from John Carmack.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.000
 I just, every time he tweets, I just love it.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.080
 But it was something about his like visual studio IDE

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.360
 and debugging processors.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.000
 - Yeah, the history of like of what he used

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.920
 and like what he was working on

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.520
 and what tools made sense for that, yeah.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.640
 - Yeah, it's just so funny that like,

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.240
 he is like the granddaddy of us all.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.200
 He's like, does everybody look up to John Carmack?

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.760
 I feel like he's your programmer.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.840
 Yeah, he's amazing.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.760
 And he uses visual studio and I feel like

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.600
 that should just make it,

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.800
 we should all just be using visual studio

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.480
 because we look up to John Carmack,

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.480
 but we don't.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.680
 (laughing)

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.640
 Somehow he doesn't have that pull that inch left.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.480
 (laughing)

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.600
 I guess game dev is different,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.120
 game dev is different than,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.800
 it's really interesting how those two worlds

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.920
 live separately, like game developers

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.680
 and like software developers.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.520
 - Yeah.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.920
 - Like the ecosystem completely evolved separately.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.720
 Like, do you know what I'm talking about?

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.280
 There's not a lot of crossover.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.120
 - Yeah.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.800
 - It feels like our like cousins or something

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.240
 that we never see except Thanksgiving or whatever.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.480
 - Yeah, did you, did I already talk about

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.200
 that Stardew Valley game on here?

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.800
 - Would you say Stardew?

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.080
 - It's called Stardew Valley.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:40.920
 - No.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.680
 - If you look it up, you might never heard those words.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.320
 - Yeah, I mean, okay, so it's a game made by one guy, okay?

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.480
 - Like Rollercoaster Tycoon?

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.560
 - Yeah, exactly similar.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.480
 So he had the concept for the game.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.480
 He programs it, he makes all the artwork,

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.600
 he even makes all the music, he does everything.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.480
 It's a one person company.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.880
 I think it's sold like $400 million worth.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.720
 - Wow.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.040
 - So imagine being this person

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.880
 and you can do everything, you can do the whole,

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.880
 talk about full stack, you can do it all.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.720
 - Yeah.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.880
 - Every day you wake up,

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.520
 you literally have no one to report to.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.200
 - You don't have like-- - Oh man, yeah.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.760
 - Customers in a traditional sense.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.760
 No like overhead employee, like nothing,

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.760
 you're just there and you just have like $400 million

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.680
 sitting in your bank account.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.680
 You have like generational wealth.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.520
 - Yeah.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.520
 - And I mean, again, the numbers might be wrong,

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.560
 but it's like some insane number like that.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.520
 And it's like, wow, that is really impressive.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.920
 Like game devs are super impressive.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.200
 Like I can definitely nail some parts of that game myself,

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.560
 but like I couldn't do the music

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.360
 and I couldn't really do the arts.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.400
 But yeah, they're like really multi-talented.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.840
 Are people gonna, are there gonna be developers

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.600
 that are like us, they're just normal developers

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.560
 and then they become game devs because of AI?

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.280
 Like they start generating assets with AI stuff.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.120
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.240
 That's like the biggest bottleneck for me.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.320
 Like I'm not, I don't have that skill

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.080
 and I don't really think my,

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.160
 I don't think I can get that good at it either.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.440
 It's like try it. - Yeah, right.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.280
 - But yeah, I think yeah.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.640
 It definitely lowers the bar for people like me.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.480
 - Yeah.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.240
 I'm feeling very uninteresting today, I'm sorry.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.320
 They took like all these vials on my blood, I'm sick.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.360
 - Wait, did they take your blood because you were sick?

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.680
 - No, no, no, no, it was unrelated.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.660
 It's that Brian Johnson- - That's a blueprint.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.120
 - Yeah, they're doing like baseline, which I'm sick.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.200
 So all my numbers are gonna be weird of it.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.040
 - That's why, you know, it's a large study.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.560
 - Yeah, there's 5,000 people.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.720
 I'm terrible at it.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.400
 I've done none of the checklist stuff.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.480
 We're supposed to like be ordering,

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.760
 Casey's like done all her stuff.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.880
 And she's like, have you signed up for an account blueprint?

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.400
 I'm like, no, you have to order your blueprint stack.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.800
 I'm like, what is a blueprint stack?

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.800
 There's all these steps and I've done none of them.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.120
 I'm terrible, I might not even do it, I don't know.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.160
 - Did you see that clip of his

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.120
 where he was talking about haters?

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.040
 - No.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.320
 - Oh man, it was so good.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.440
 He was like, the more and more as he is a guy,

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.360
 the more and more I like him.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.120
 Like you just, I just think he's likable.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.960
 - Yeah, he's figuring out the internet too.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.160
 - It's actually more than that.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.120
 I actually think if you see him and you don't find him likable,

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.480
 it actually means that you're unlikable.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.560
 That's like the, I think I had to feel strong enough

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.400
 about this.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.120
 If you don't find him like interesting and entertaining

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.880
 and you don't like him, like I don't like you probably.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.400
 - There's a lot of people that don't like him.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.240
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.080
 You don't like, yeah.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.680
 - I like that 'cause it's like a very good filter.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.920
 It's a very clear filter.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.760
 - Interesting.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.280
 - He was like very calmly talking about haters

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.240
 and like, it's not really genuine, really passionate.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.640
 He was like, I love haters.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.760
 Like if you don't have haters, you're not going hard enough.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.760
 And I was like, I love the perspective they bring.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.080
 Like it's, you know, sparring with them all this stuff.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.760
 Like he was just really like talking like passionately

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.880
 about the concept of haters.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.560
 And I was like, you know what?

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.280
 That's a good perspective.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.040
 - Yeah, I feel like you have haters for sure, right?

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.260
 - And I think I need more.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.640
 I feel like he's right that.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.640
 - Can I have some of yours?

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.960
 I don't think I have any.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.040
 Do I have any haters?

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.000
 Does anybody hate me?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 - I feel like you've gotten more haters than I have, I think.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.000
 - Okay, here's what it is.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.840
 - Excuse me.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.760
 - I can just slam haters every single day, for sure.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.280
 But you have had a cute moment of intense hate.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.320
 Like when you posted that coffee thing.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.160
 - Oh, what?

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.400
 - The caffeine thing.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.800
 When you were like...

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.880
 - That's a moment though.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.320
 They forgot about me the next day.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.320
 Like they don't hate, they're not a hater.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.400
 Like there's people that probably see your tweets

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.600
 and they get all riled up every single day.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.240
 Like they follow you, just they hate follow you.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.080
 - That's true.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.160
 I'm just saying that you have the capacity for that as well

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.760
 as you can demonstrate that in the past.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.640
 - I can be really annoying in short bursts.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.480
 - Yeah.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.160
 - And you apologize three times.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.040
 (laughing)

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.440
 Go watch the brand jobs in the video and you wanna pause.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.480
 - I'm like more of an acquired taste.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.840
 I feel like that you have to kind of like sit with me

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.400
 for hours and then you start to appreciate my personality.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.800
 - I've been listening to...

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.360
 (laughing)

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.920
 I can't talk.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.160
 I've been listening to our...

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.640
 (laughing)

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.920
 To our little social clips,

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.920
 or we're making little clips for social stuff.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.880
 It's so hard to find one where I am coherent at all.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.080
 Like it'll be a 30 second clip

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.760
 and I can't figure out what I'm even talking about

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.800
 and I said it, I'm like 20 seconds in

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.800
 and I don't know what I'm saying.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.920
 And you have this like very deliberate,

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.960
 like laid out logical path to everything you say.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.880
 And I'm just like,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.120
 (laughing)

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.440
 (laughing)

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.240
 - This is gonna be a great clip right here.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, so what I can't figure out is

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.560
 why do people listen to our podcast?

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.120
 And I start to think maybe they listen to a lot more

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:34.960
 if it was just you.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.880
 (laughing)

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.000
 - But would I be talking dude?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.080
 This is just the wall?

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.160
 - I don't just talk to yourself.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.080
 Yeah, just read your own tweets, you know?

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.520
 - No, okay, here's the thing.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.640
 We've been getting really good feedback from people

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.400
 and our numbers are looking good.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.240
 - Yeah.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.080
 - Don't, don't introspect it.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:49.920
 (laughing)

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.760
 It's just...

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.600
 - Okay, don't try.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.420
 - It's working.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.520
 People like it for whatever reason.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.360
 - Okay.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.200
 - I don't know why.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.640
 It doesn't feel like we're doing anything on purpose

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.640
 if it feels like all accidental but...

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.480
 - We'll take it.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.160
 - Half the people that hate Dax hate him

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.960
 because of that Rich Harris video.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.840
 So this is also an interesting concept.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.120
 Did you see the screenshot I posted?

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:08.960
 - Yeah.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.860
 - Yeah, someone replied to me being like,

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.080
 hey, what was up with that video of you and Rich Harris?

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.920
 Like it was really awkward and like you're really mean

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.400
 and he seemed really upset when he left.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.680
 And I found this so fascinating 'cause I was like,

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.800
 wow, this really reflects how subjective

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.000
 everyone's experience of like the universes.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.680
 Imagine ever watching that video

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.280
 and thinking it was anything else in the joke.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.280
 It seems impossible.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.040
 It seems like there's no way.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.800
 There's no way I could ever mistake that.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.720
 But there's some percentage of people out there

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.680
 that see it and have a completely different experience

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.960
 and maybe wherever they're from like that type of sarcasm

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.040
 or that type of humor isn't really a thing.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.080
 So it just seems like awkward and like maybe even like

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.680
 cringy to them to watch.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.080
 But for us, it's not.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.880
 - No, yeah.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.760
 - I had never heard for what it's worth,

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.680
 I'd never heard of between two ferns.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.440
 So I obviously knew you were joking 'cause I know you

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.640
 but I could see a world where I don't know you

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.320
 or Rich Harris or what you like do in life.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.480
 And I see that video and maybe don't know,

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.840
 but it's, but I don't know.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.680
 Somebody wouldn't put it on YouTube if it was that bad.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.440
 Like you gotta just understand that this is not a real,

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.880
 this is staged.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.720
 - Yeah.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.200
 Have you seen that, what's her name?

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.320
 I think her name is Bobby.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.360
 She does like, everyone thinks she's some kind

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.280
 of like industry plant 'cause she gets all these crazy

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.840
 interviews with like the most famous people,

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.920
 but she does the same thing where it's like a super awkward

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.520
 interview and she gets like the funniest close possible.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.640
 And to be honest, like I think like some of those are real.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.480
 Like I think some of those are just like real interactions.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.320
 - Yeah.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.520
 - I saw one yesterday after I heard she was interviewing,

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.240
 but the interviewer described it.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.160
 She's like, oh, you're a musician.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.600
 And the person gets really upset.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.400
 She's like, I'm not a musician.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.480
 Like why do you keep calling a musician?

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.440
 Like you think, like I'm doing magic.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.680
 They just go back and forth with this woman thing.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.920
 She's saying magician and not musician.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.440
 And then she's like, they're getting into a fight.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.160
 She's like, I'm not a magician.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.760
 Like I'm a musician, I'm not a musician.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.760
 I do music.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.600
 I do acting.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.840
 And she's like, wait, but you said you do music.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.840
 So you are a musician.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.160
 And they were just like, it was so good.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.000
 It was so funny.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.880
 And I'm just like, I guess someone, I did watch a video

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.680
 about a little bit of the history of, I guess humor

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.360
 that we find very normal, but it's like somewhat recent

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.480
 and like the introduction of some of this type of humor.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.560
 - Yeah.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.560
 - And this like whole like awkward moment thing

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.440
 that we're all super into.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.280
 And like I think a lot of humor is in that format.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.120
 - Yeah.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.280
 - It's actually like somewhat new.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.200
 It's not like it's been around forever.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.840
 Like like the office kind of humor

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.440
 where someone's doing really something really like weird

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.120
 and everyone else is uncomfortable about it.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.240
 Yeah, that just wasn't a thing for a long time.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.080
 - That's a pretty recent phenomenon.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:51.920
 Yeah.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.920
 It makes me want to have people on the show

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.000
 that I think would make really awkward situations

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.240
 'cause I do feel like there's something funny.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.920
 It's probably, you're inspiring me

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.640
 with your between two ferns videos.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.320
 There's just something so funny about like,

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.720
 this is a train wreck and I hate it

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.960
 and I want to be gone.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.000
 Something about that's enjoyable to me, I don't know.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.760
 - It is extremely hard.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.560
 So now that I've like made, I'm able to make two of them,

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.960
 but having gotten the process of making them

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.640
 and then I watch these like professional people do it,

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.880
 I'm just like, again, with the same person, Bobbie Lee,

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.200
 maybe I'm mixing up her name and his name, whatever.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.280
 But he's like a hilarious comedian,

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.080
 has been one for decades now.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.520
 And their interactions are so, so funny,

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.120
 like a hundred times funnier than anything that I've done.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.360
 And I think they're completely unscripted too.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.920
 And I'm like, these people are so much better than me at this.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.120
 Like they're so, so talented.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.000
 And I really appreciate it now, having done it.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.600
 Like all of the things that I've made heavily, heavily edited,

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.160
 all of my lines are scripted.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.600
 I refilm stuff after to like insert lines

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.240
 that I thought of later.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.840
 But the things that, you know,

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.640
 the things that I'm talking about is professionally made ones

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.480
 are not like that.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.240
 They just have like one hour to capture the footage

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.360
 and they just roll with it and it's really amazing.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.960
 - Is it mostly acting or are they just that good

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.640
 at just being awkward?

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.160
 Is that part of their personality?

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.320
 Like, yeah, I think one, whoever's a host

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.400
 doesn't need to be really strong

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.000
 'cause they need to be a hundred percent in character

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.120
 and not break it and make the other person really feel

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.800
 like you're in this antagonistic situation.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.360
 And then the other person has like play off of it really well.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.520
 And yeah, when you see like professionals do it

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.800
 versus like, let's say like the interviewer does it

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.080
 with like an athlete or something, it's still good.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.200
 But you can see that there's a massive gap

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.680
 between these two types of people.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.280
 - Keep trying, you'll get better decks.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.800
 - You'll never get out of it yet, but.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.000
 - And then Parkis, I couldn't think of earlier,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.080
 it was called The Clearing.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.120
 It's about Edward Wayne, Edward's serial killer.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.080
 Sorry, I had to say that 'cause I remembered it.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.120
 - Great, so if you guys wanna watch or listen to stuff

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.760
 about people getting killed,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.600
 if you're maybe curious about killing yourself like Adam is.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.120
 - Oh my word, you can't say stuff like that, Dex.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:03.960
 - Why?

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.880
 - You just can't, I don't know.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.040
 It's like touchy.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.320
 - What does touchy say so?

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.320
 I thought this was America.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.840
 I thought we could say whatever we wanted.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.880
 - What do you mean I can't say stuff?

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.080
 - I was trying to be so serious and make you feel bad

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.920
 and I'm just bad at that too.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.320
 - Has that ever worked?

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.160
 - No.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.000
 - Making me feel bad.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:19.840
 - You ever felt bad about anything?

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.680
 - I don't think so.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.520
 - Never in your life.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.360
 - I just never done anything bad, so.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.200
 - It's really bad.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.040
 - Ever.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.880
 - I think once.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.460
 (upbeat music)

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.360
 - I have tweets of yours I wanna ask you questions about,

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.200
 for sure.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.880
 - This is a section of a podcast where you're like,

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.440
 who are you sub-tweeting in this one?

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.880
 Who are you sub-tweeting in that one?

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.720
 - Yeah.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.960
 - Yeah, 'cause I can tell, I know it's a sub-tweet

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.400
 and I just can't figure out, who is it?

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.920
 I'm gonna read one of your tweets.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.320
 Everyone I meet that works on a top 1% web app

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.280
 finds all the latest web dev tech in quotes,

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.440
 completely irrelevant.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.080
 They do enjoy making fun of it though.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.640
 I have, I feel like I've experienced

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.280
 the making fun of latest web dev stuff

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.480
 from people who like know what they're doing,

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.480
 but I can't think of it, buddy.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.000
 Were you thinking of me?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.080
 Is that what you're just me?

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.160
 Am I on a top one? - Yeah, I think so.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.000
 I mean, I've got to ask you this.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:11.980
 I wasn't making any of you.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.040
 - Yeah, no, I didn't say so.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:14.880
 - It's fine.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.720
 No, let's make it awkward.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.640
 No, I feel really bad.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.680
 You made me feel bad decks.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:22.680
 - I just, I said top 1% and I think people didn't understand

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.200
 or like people.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.120
 - Yeah, is that by like traffic?

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:25.960
 What is that?

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.280
 - No, I wasn't talking about traffic at all.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.440
 I was just talking about like-

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.280
 - Quality.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.960
 - These are high quality, like really impressive things.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.280
 - Like linear.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.480
 - Yeah, you would need to be in the top 1% of developers

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.600
 to like execute.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.280
 Not just developers, just product people

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.960
 in general, to execute something like this.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.640
 Yeah, and I've been talking to the people behind Fay.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.280
 - Is that the finance one?

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.360
 - Yeah, their long-term goal to compete

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.360
 with Bloomberg Terminal.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.200
 - Oh, right, right.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.120
 - That's Fayapp.com, F-E-Yapp.com.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.120
 That thing is beautiful.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.920
 It is super well made, so many little details.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:56.760
 - Fayapp.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.840
 - So many little details, like just really well executed.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.400
 The team is also constantly posting like pretty much

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.040
 like every day or every other day.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.280
 They like zoom in a little detail.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.960
 They just built and like talk about how they built it.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.760
 And it's always like crazy attention and detail.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.680
 So well done.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.120
 I've been talking to them a little bit more.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.160
 And they're like, they're all, one, they're crazy.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.160
 They're like, they're all super funny and like weird.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.640
 And they just don't give a shit about any of the Twitter

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.200
 discourse on like, here's like the future of Web Dev.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.400
 And like, we're betting everything on PPR

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.920
 and this shit like that.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.760
 - Yep.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.600
 - It's just not relevant to that.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.360
 - PPR, wait, is that a real one?

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.240
 - Yeah, that's a fancy little thing.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.080
 Oh, it's a real one.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:34.920
 Okay, I'm sorry.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.040
 - At this point, any three letters you arrange,

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.040
 it's probably a real thing.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.480
 (laughing)

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.600
 - Sorry, I had that well moment because it says,

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.360
 press T anytime to start your trial.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.840
 And it was just a cool experience.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.680
 - Oh, yeah.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.520
 - Like it drops down and yeah.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.840
 - It's just like, you can just feel the quality.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.360
 Whenever I describe things in this way,

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.180
 like the best apps or like the top one percent of whatever,

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:02.160
 people ask me to like explain it or like drill

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.360
 into what I mean by that.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.200
 - Yeah.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.520
 - So look at this, you just go to the site and you know,

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.320
 you just know that these people are like next level, right?

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.720
 It's just a feeling you get right away.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.760
 - There's not really any specifics.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.320
 Yeah, and they both, there's a very different

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.440
 than how I build our stuff and so it is interesting

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.280
 from that angle too.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.760
 - Oh, you followed up with that one an hour later.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.760
 This was a bit unclear.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.480
 They're using cutting edge techniques and tools,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.680
 just not the ones you're told matter.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.800
 Yeah, we gotta have Guillermo on the podcast now.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.800
 I feel like it has to happen.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.240
 - There's just enough like stuff that you've said,

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.040
 slander towards the tribal company.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.040
 (laughing)

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.960
 I just would love to see you two in a room together.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.800
 I don't know.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.400
 - I was actually just slandering them before you got on.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.240
 - Oh really?

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.080
 - Yeah, I was a-

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:44.920
 - On Twitch, yeah.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.720
 - I was reading, they posted and I find this so funny.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.240
 I think it's like perfectly symbolic of everything

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.240
 that we talk about.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.320
 I saw an article from them the other day being,

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.160
 Marcel expands like PCI compliance or something.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.880
 It's some title like that and I was like,

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.920
 this is really weird.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.240
 Like they like, I don't even think they signed BAA's

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.840
 or they're not like HIPAA compliant or anything last I checked.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.440
 Like why are they like PCI compliant?

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.960
 That's so specific and really intense to get PCI certified.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.600
 Like who is using for sell for like payments infrastructure?

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.440
 - Yeah.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.520
 - So then I go into the article and the whole article

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.520
 is about how to use an iframe to not send stuff to Marcel.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.880
 They're like, if you wanna be PCI compliant,

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.640
 here's how you take all your PCI compliant stuff,

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.720
 put in an iframe and like don't send it to Marcel.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.000
 - I facilitate it from Marcel, yeah.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.200
 - Yeah, but then like they posted it in this way

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.600
 of being like, we're expanding our PCI compliant.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.200
 And I'm just like, man, what is this?

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.080
 - I got two tweets of yours,

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.760
 they'll get us into some tech stuff.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:53.240
 One, you're gonna use button in ION stuff.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.760
 So where is button at on the scale of maturity?

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.360
 - So I have now either moved over

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.120
 in the process of moving over to use button

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.880
 for all my tool chain needs.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.720
 If that makes sense.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.120
 - So just like local dev stuff and build process.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.560
 - So Liz is getting more hands on

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.160
 in front end engineering stuff.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.160
 And I was getting her set up and I was explaining to her

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.120
 like, okay, this is what Node.js is.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.400
 This is, you know, people wanna run JavaScript outside

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.240
 of the browser.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.440
 So it's not giving her all history.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.400
 And then I was like, how the hell do I explain

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.920
 what PNPM is?

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.520
 Like, like, why is this?

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.720
 I was like trying to explain to her.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.040
 And I was just like, there's actually no,

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.280
 I couldn't think of like a clean model of like,

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.640
 this is Node.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.720
 And then this is other random thing you use with Node

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.120
 so that you can use Node.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.560
 And I was just like, something clicked for me

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.680
 where I was like, button just makes all this stuff

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.960
 easy to understand.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.920
 You use button to run your stuff.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.800
 You use button to install your packages.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.840
 Any step you do as part of local development,

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.680
 you use button for.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.120
 Very clean, very understandable.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.720
 And now that like, it sold me.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.360
 So I moved all my local development stuff to there.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.680
 But still not using it in like production or anything.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.680
 - Like run time, yeah.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.080
 Not using it in the critical path of like users

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.760
 making requests and then serving stuff from BUN.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.120
 - The reason we're using BUN in SST now,

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.320
 we're actually shipping BUN with SST

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.640
 in case you don't have it installed.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.760
 - Oh, interesting.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.640
 How big is it?

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.960
 - So it's 90 megabytes.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.800
 - 90 megabytes?

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.160
 - But I did some performance like measurements yesterday

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.480
 where so we are like really trying to hide the concept

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.400
 of Node modules for SST.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.160
 Like your application on Node modules

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.000
 and like you don't, like we don't want you to like

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.560
 additionally think about like SST related Node modules

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.680
 that are kind of internal details.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.360
 Like the whole thing before of like SST two,

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.280
 we have to like update your CDK package

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.920
 and there's created a ton of mess.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.760
 - Right, yeah.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.880
 - We want to hide, we are using Node modules

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.720
 in the background minimally.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.360
 We want to hide them as much as possible.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:59.120
 So when you install SST, which is now like a Go based CLI,

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.160
 we do need to pull some Node modules down.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.280
 And I was pulling them with NPM and man, it was slow.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.520
 For like 300 megabytes of NPM modules,

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.760
 like it was taking like close to a minute.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.400
 This is a terrible experience.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.720
 Literally downloading BUN and having BUN do the install

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.680
 is like so much faster.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.520
 So I like tried it and I was like, this is really weird,

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.080
 but you know what, there's actually no problem

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.040
 with doing this, it's just a works.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.520
 If you have BUN install already, we'll use it.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.880
 Otherwise we install like like a localized version

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.000
 to SST version of BUN.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:34.920
 And yeah, we're using it.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.640
 And I think over time, we'll be able to use it

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.040
 for more and more and more.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.240
 We're just using it for the install now,

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.680
 but it's good to know that it's there

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.280
 for other stuff that we wouldn't use it for.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.640
 - Interesting.

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.120
 So yeah, fantastic.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.720
 - The other tweet was your live Lambda change.

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.920
 You made a change to how like SST for those who don't know

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.840
 is like, that was the first thing

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.960
 that kind of put you on the map, right?

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.840
 It was live Lambda reloads.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.920
 Like you change the file and then you can hit your API

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.800
 and it's hitting AWS infrastructure,

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.080
 but then it's like routing back to your local machine

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.320
 to run your code and then going back.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.040
 So you changed, you did something

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.600
 and you made it 10 times faster.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.600
 I want to say it 10 times.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.840
 - 100 times? - 100 times faster.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.920
 - I don't know.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.920
 Okay.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.880
 It's already so fast that like,

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.120
 I don't think making it faster really is noticeable.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.800
 - Yeah, I wonder, I want to ask you that.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.200
 Like what is faster?

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.360
 Like when I saved the file.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.480
 - Yeah, I had to re-implement it 'cause we're for ion.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.200
 Like I, there was a task of re-implementing it

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.840
 'cause, you know, it's a brand new CLI.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.680
 So I had to re-implement it.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.360
 It's like my third time implementing it.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.560
 So given it's my third time, it's just going to come out better.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.400
 - Yeah.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.240
 - So it did just come out better.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.120
 It handles like all these different edge cases better.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.560
 Like scenarios like you hit save and that starts a rebuild

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.760
 but in the middle of a rebuild, like a request comes in

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.760
 like we'll like block that request, the build's done

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.960
 and then like then pipe it through and handling like errors

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.160
 and crashes and like there's a lot of like edge cases

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.200
 that we didn't handle before.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.520
 So I think with this implementation, the speed,

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.520
 it is faster.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.120
 Like I'm actually streaming raw like HTTP requests

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.840
 and responses over IOT implementation is simpler.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.480
 We can swap out IOT with like a container

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.840
 that just uses a proxy kind of like NGRAC as well

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.840
 for people that like can't use IOT

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.960
 or like, you know, are in some kind of corporate environment

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.560
 where they need to do it differently.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.200
 So overall implementation, everything is better.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.440
 And yeah, it did result in things being faster

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.320
 but the thing that I'm more interested in is like,

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.840
 there's just so many edge cases

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:42.120
 and I've kind of flipped my way of working on this.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.840
 So typically I will try to get something

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.600
 to be as complete as possible as soon as possible.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.040
 And then people will report errors

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.480
 and I'll fix them over time.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.320
 - Yeah.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.000
 - But especially with something like this

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.200
 where I know like it's not like a random new feature

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.520
 like it's the same feature trying to fix every possible

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.760
 edge case I know of can think about upfront.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.240
 I think is working better because I'm like in it right now

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.880
 and I have all the context.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.640
 And if we ship this and release it in a month later,

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.840
 someone tells me like, oh, you know,

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.320
 when I get a burst of 50 requests

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.200
 like my computer crashes is gonna try to do too much work.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.840
 It's like harder for me to get back into the design of it

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.160
 and I figure out what needs to be changed.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.440
 So yeah, I think for quality, it's really,

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.480
 if we've been doing this thing

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.720
 when we do like this really intense polishing phase

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.360
 like a week or two before we ship anything

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.520
 and we end up having like a list of like 100 items

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.200
 just kind of cranking through every single thing.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.680
 Yeah, we're doing that upfront more than trying to like

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.880
 get to it later because I think it just doesn't happen later.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.680
 - Yeah, I have no follow up questions.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.400
 I didn't have any follow up questions for your last thing

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.240
 either.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.080
 I'm just like, I'm throwing stuff at you.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:49.920
 Hey, talk about this.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.040
 - Well, your voice is gone.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.720
 So I got a, I feel like my voice is going out too.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.480
 - Oh no, it's contagious.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.600
 - Yeah, you got me sick through Riverside.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.720
 Is that new feature?

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.560
 - Through Riverside, new feature.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.080
 - Let's talk about her guests.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.960
 So I posted yesterday because we're talking about

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.600
 having more guests on, which is always fun.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.680
 And asked who people wanted to see.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.960
 Unsurprisingly, Ken Wheeler had like a crazy number

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.640
 of replies and likes and he himself tagged himself.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.160
 So he also wants to come on.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.800
 And so it's definitely do that.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.400
 I think Ryan Florence also tagged himself

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.720
 and that also got a bunch of replies.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.280
 So I think those will be fun.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.000
 Both of them are really funny people.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.160
 - Yeah, I've got to spend some time with Ken.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.320
 I'm only just getting to know Ryan just through Twitter.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.880
 I want to go snowboard with him.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.240
 I almost snowboarded once.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.320
 So now I feel like I could bond with somebody

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.880
 in the mountains on a snowboard.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.880
 - Wait, I thought you said you were going snowboarding.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:49.720
 - I was and then my knee was too swollen and painful.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.200
 I don't know if this is, I'm going to say,

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.000
 I'm not going to say who, but someone,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.440
 someone hurt themselves on the mountain.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.080
 Someone with me, I'm going to stop now

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.680
 because I just don't want to share information.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.400
 It's like medical information, I don't know.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.040
 I don't want to share that on the internet.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.280
 - Someone on the mountain that was with you.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.440
 - That was just a terrible teaser.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.800
 - You don't know anyone except your immediate family.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.400
 So I don't know how big that would be.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:19.160
 - Never mind, it's not for me to say,

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.880
 but it was an eventful trip on the mountain.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.720
 - I see.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.960
 - Anyway, I'm going to stop now.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.000
 That sounded, I've been talking about serial killers.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.360
 I just, now I tease somebody got hurt on a mountain.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.680
 You guys are all going to think I killed somebody.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.640
 - You're smiling the whole time you're saying that.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.200
 - Was it an accident, Adam, or were you?

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.000
 - It wasn't an accident.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.140
 - Taking a step down a path that you can't return from.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.720
 (upbeat music)

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:51.760
 - I'm really, I'm really tired, like not tired, like sleepy.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.760
 Like, there is so much going on.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:58.360
 Do you feel like that ever?

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.080
 No, you, 'cause you have what I want,

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.720
 which is like you have one thing.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.760
 It's like you're one thing that everything you do

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.360
 is like towards that thing.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.640
 And I have like a dozen things and they're all like

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.240
 in different directions and they have nothing to do

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.240
 with each other, and I'm so tired

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.000
 of having so many different things going on.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.240
 Do you ever feel that way?

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.360
 - I think, I do feel that.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.640
 I don't think it's the same extreme as you,

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.600
 but we've got, so we've got SST, got SST.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.200
 We've got our secret project that no one knows about.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.880
 Me and Liz have stuff that we work on.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.840
 So I also feel like very split.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.680
 - Yeah.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.520
 - But not to the same degree as you.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.160
 I think all of my things have synergy with each other.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.200
 So like working on any one of those

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.800
 like moves them all forward in a way.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.480
 - Yeah, there's no synergy.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.080
 All of mine are completely disparate.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:45.920
 - I mean, I actually feel that way

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.800
 when I was like consulting and I had a bunch of clients

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.600
 that were unrelated, but even there somehow like

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.160
 they would even line up sometimes.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.760
 - Yeah, it's not even like, it's not even work things.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.200
 'Cause I do just kind of have like one work focus,

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.680
 but it's just like, so I'm getting an assistant up to speed.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.880
 She used to work for us.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.760
 She says a house assistant and then she had a baby

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.040
 and we lost her.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.120
 She's very detailed oriented.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:10.960
 It's very hard to find people.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.240
 - Oh my God, don't say we lost her.

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.240
 - Well, we lost her to the other hood.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.880
 - She had a baby and then we lost her.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.960
 - Yeah, you know what I mean.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.800
 No, I didn't kill her.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.640
 - Would you kill her?

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.240
 (laughing)

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.040
 - So she, but now the baby's old enough

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.520
 that she can kind of like help again.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.440
 So she's helping me with just my digital life.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.280
 I had this folder, like a shared drive

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.600
 that I'm organizing at like the top level.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.800
 There's like top level folders

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.920
 for kind of all these different areas I'm talking about

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.240
 that are making me so stressed.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.840
 And it started and I was like,

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.960
 there's like three top level folders.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.200
 And it's like, these are the three things

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.160
 that I'm doing right now that matter.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.720
 And then I was like, oh no, I forgot.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.040
 Now there's seven.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.280
 There's seven of them.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.560
 There's seven top level folders.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.680
 I just added one this morning.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.240
 I was like, I can't believe I forgot that.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:58.840
 There's like too many things going on.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.480
 And that's like high level,

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.200
 like high level buckets that matter to me right now.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.480
 It's not even like seven different tasks.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.720
 It's like each one of those like a whole umbrella

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:13.720
 of crazy things, it's just too much.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.560
 But like I don't,

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.160
 and when I think about like,

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.640
 maybe I need to drop something.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.360
 Maybe I need to stop doing some of these things.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.320
 There's not one of them that I want to stop doing.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.520
 It's like, I want to do them all.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.520
 I just have a thirst for life decks.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.040
 I don't know what to tell you.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.000
 I just, I want to do it all.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.240
 - This funny thought where you were like,

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.080
 I want to drop something.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.520
 I was like, I'm going to leave this family.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.840
 That's the one you choose.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.040
 You're like the family folder, dull eats.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.280
 (laughing)

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.480
 Oh man.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.560
 Oh, that's funny.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.200
 Everyone thinks I'm on drugs and Twitch chat.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.480
 I'm not on drugs.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.320
 I am sick.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.320
 So my voice sounds very weird

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.640
 and it's very hard for me to deliver a sentence.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.840
 I'm not, no, what did I say?

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.840
 Did I sound drunk?

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.280
 Even you looked at me funny decks.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.980
 What did I, I did just lose a lot of blood.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.920
 - Someone said you were a drug when you were,

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.600
 when you made that funny noise about how you feel

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.600
 when you hear yourself when you're looking for clips.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.800
 I weren't saying that you're on steroids

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.120
 that you, you know, you have to like stop.

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.560
 - My, my, no joke, my jujitsu coach.

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.120
 First time he's known to like, like he said in the past,

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.480
 like, oh yeah, have you seen Jamie over at that gym?

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.520
 He's totally on Royds.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.560
 Like he's always talking about people being on the juice.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.440
 And the first time in my six months of doing jujitsu

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:29.240
 at this gym, he asked me last time I saw him on Sunday,

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.520
 what, am I hitting the juice?

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.840
 He asked me if I was hitting the juice.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.200
 I mean, so I'm getting big.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.400
 - That's a compliment, I guess.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.240
 - I know.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.080
 - You look good, yeah.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:36.920
 - 'Cause this is all natural.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.960
 This is plant-based, you know what I'm saying?

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.120
 - Yeah, sounds great.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:40.960
 - It's all hard work.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.800
 - Looks fantastic.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.640
 Looks and sounds fantastic.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.480
 - All right.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.280
 - Now's all the time to be flexing that.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.400
 (laughing)

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.080
 - Oh man.

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.840
 If I start losing my hair, you guys can,

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.400
 you can drag test me for Royds.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.440
 But I'm not on the juice.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.920
 - Wait, you lose hair when you take steroids?

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.240
 - Isn't that like a symptom?

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.560
 I think you like to lose hair.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.880
 - Oh, because our phones higher?

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:01.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.560
 That makes sense.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.520
 - That is, yeah, maybe.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.360
 I don't know the mechanism, but I think you lose hair.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.200
 - That's what happened to me.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.040
 - You get all ragey.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.840
 Oh, that's what happened, it's the Royds.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.840
 (laughing)

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.680
 - Yeah.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.800
 They're not working for my muscles,

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.880
 but they're helping me lose hair.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.600
 - Bertrand says it increases DHT,

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.400
 which causes hair loss, I think.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.520
 He thinks though.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.120
 He knows these very specific details,

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.280
 but he just thinks.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.160
 He's not sure.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.360
 - I'm very confused,

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.160
 'cause that's like the first serious message

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:28.440
 I've ever seen from him in a year of seeing him in chat.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.480
 - Paul, you know a lot about steroids there.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.320
 I'm just saying.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.320
 - He like has an aiming serious for a legit year,

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.040
 and then he chimes in for one steroid fact.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.560
 (laughing)

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.480
 - He knows a lot about hair loss.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.800
 - That's funny.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.840
 - I'm gonna put a bow on this.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.600
 Just my little rant, because I'm not depressed.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.560
 - I'm really not.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.080
 - But it feels like the beginning

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.200
 of what leads to depression,

00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.200
 which is the more I think about working years,

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.120
 these are the years of our prime

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:06.000
 where we're really producing and whatever.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.520
 We're a cog in the machine, right?

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.760
 We're creating or whatever.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.440
 We're working all these years,

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.720
 and it's our prime physical years too.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.840
 And so when I think about like,

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.520
 maybe I need to stop with the jujitsu

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.080
 and the trying to be like,

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.800
 I'm trying to push so hard physically

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.120
 and do all these things.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.480
 And maybe that's just too much time.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.480
 I can't devote that right now,

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.080
 and I'll do it later in life.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.200
 And it's like, no, I don't wanna do it when I'm 55.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.600
 Like I wish I would have been doing jujitsu in my 20s.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.880
 I was running a startup, you know?

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:34.200
 Like I was doing the work stuff.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.640
 It's, it makes me so mad

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.920
 that like there's three very important things in life.

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.920
 And not that like you have to have a family,

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.200
 but that's the other important thing.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.360
 It's like I'm raising my family

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.080
 that my kids are young.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.680
 And like all of them overlap.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.400
 It's like literally you have kids

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.320
 when you're also in your working prime

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.000
 and also in your physical prime.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.760
 Oh, you want to do physical activity?

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.480
 Yeah, juggle that with your family and your work.

00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.360
 It sucks.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.920
 I don't know, there's no answer.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.720
 And every time I come back to it,

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.720
 I just get sad and then I move on,

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.200
 but it just sucks.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.040
 I hate it.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.320
 - Have you considered doing cocaine?

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.560
 - No, that's a great idea.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.560
 (laughing)

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.400
 - I feel like--

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.320
 - Speed through it all.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.160
 - Speed through it all.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.320
 - That was very like serious thing.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.160
 And I was like.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.000
 (laughing)

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.640
 - I'm just gonna go for the cocaine.

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.400
 - Comedic relief, yeah, cocaine, okay.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.440
 So maybe I could just like--

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.360
 - I mean, have you?

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.720
 Like I think that would, you know--

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.480
 - I've never done cocaine, no.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.320
 I don't even know where you get cocaine.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.200
 Like I have a guy for some things,

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.240
 but I don't know where he,

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.520
 I don't think he does cocaine.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.520
 - I literally started, I was gonna make fun of you,

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.680
 but then I started laughing

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.560
 and then I started choking.

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.680
 And I'm gonna ignore all of that.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.520
 Is there any cocaine in the Ozarks?

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.400
 Is there like one gram of cocaine in the Ozarks somewhere?

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.240
 - I'm sure, but like I think people prefer meth here.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.440
 It's like every region has their cuisine, you know?

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.840
 Like you go, you get gumbo in the south.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:00.880
 Like here, meth is the choice, a drug of choice.

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.840
 - Is it, is meth productive?

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.160
 Like can you be, 'cause cocaine's very productive.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:09.440
 - I think it's similar, similar, like it's an upper.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.280
 - Upper, yeah.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.320
 - I don't know if that's the right term,

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.720
 but I think people like go bananas, like very energetic,

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:20.520
 but also they don't eat and your teeth fall out

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.760
 and you get big sores on your face.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.720
 It's like cocaine for poor people.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.560
 - I see.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.560
 - That's what meth is.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.280
 - 'Cause I feel like,

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:31.400
 I know people that do cocaine and have very normal lives,

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.480
 like do it like a lot.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.320
 Like do it like.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.320
 - Like you and Liz?

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.040
 Or, do I seem like I'm on a cocaine,

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.120
 I don't think I have that energy.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.080
 - No, you've got a very chill vibe now.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.160
 Same with Liz.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.320
 - Yeah, maybe Zuko though.

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.040
 I don't know, I'm not sure about Zuko.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:45.880
 He's a little amped up.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.280
 - He's actually really calm, for the most part.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.520
 He is a dog, you know.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.600
 But yes, I do live in Miami.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.440
 - So cocaine can be,

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.680
 it can fit into a balanced life is what you're saying.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:57.280
 Cocaine doesn't, it gets the wrong reputation.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.280
 - I mean, I don't know if it's the wrong reputation,

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.560
 but like I've seen people,

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.560
 what's it called like a functional addict or whatever,

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.400
 they call it?

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.520
 Like I've seen people do that with cocaine.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.360
 - A cocaine.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.680
 - And man, does it make you productive?

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.320
 - Do they sleep less?

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.160
 - I'm sure, I'm sure.

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.360
 - Or they give the work done during the hours.

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.640
 - Yeah, all of that.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.480
 Yeah.

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.520
 So that's always an option, you know,

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.360
 if you feel like you have a lot to do

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.040
 and you can't fit it all in one day.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.120
 - Just cocaine.

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.760
 I was thinking a little more socially acceptable

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.400
 and just like starting caffeine again.

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.840
 That seems like maybe a shorter path, I don't know,

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.960
 than getting into cocaine.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.640
 - You just seem like the kind of guy

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.800
 that would like go for the best.

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.680
 The thing that's the most effective.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:39.800
 Kind of the best, yeah.

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.120
 But it's not good for your heart.

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.640
 You said like, I'm also trying,

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.720
 I'm really considering this.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.360
 So we got to have this conversation.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.840
 I'm really trying to be healthy as well.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.640
 - Okay, I'm 100% joking, so.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.240
 - Okay, yeah, yeah, me.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.480
 Totally joking.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.760
 - I mean, okay, I'm like 80% joking.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.640
 Maybe it would help you.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:55.480
 I don't know.

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.760
 - Uh-huh, 100% over here.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.040
 I was 100% joking.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:58.880
 - Whatever I say.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.800
 I know this idea is not gonna get passed through your wife,

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.880
 so it's.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:02.880
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.640
 - That's gonna be the filter.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.880
 So I can say whatever.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.000
 - But maybe caffeine.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.240
 - Maybe. I just, it hurts your sleep.

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.080
 It affects your sleep.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.520
 I'm trying to get like good sleep scores every night.

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.440
 I'm basically trying to be Brian Johnson.

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.320
 But like, I don't care about my skin.

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.160
 - That's all.

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.000
 (laughs)

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.200
 - I was like, dude, Brian Johnson, mine is the skincare.

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:22.800
 (upbeat music)

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:28.920
 - I'm trying to move.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.520
 - You're moving out of your house?

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.000
 - But I'm trying to move next door.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.080
 - Wait, what?

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.320
 - I don't know if it's gonna work out.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.960
 Okay, so the house next to mine is owned by my landlord,

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.360
 like he owns both.

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:44.200
 And it's his wife's grandparents are visiting,

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.040
 so they've been staying there.

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.340
 But it's bigger and it has like a bigger backyard.

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:52.180
 - Is it real grass?

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.420
 - It seems nicer.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:54.260
 No, it's not.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.760
 My landlord loves ripping out the real grass

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.680
 and putting fake grass.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.240
 I get why from landlord point of view,

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.640
 that's like a good investment.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.800
 'Cause you don't have to take care of it.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.800
 - Yeah, and the demand for like rent demand has gone down.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.760
 - Oh, really?

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.120
 - At least a little bit.

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.200
 So that house is cheaper than what it was last time.

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.440
 It was available for at least.

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:21.000
 And now it's very close to the same price as our place.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.960
 So I'm kind of like, that would be a nice upgrade.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.960
 Moving is annoying.

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.400
 Moving next door plus annoying than like moving moving.

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.320
 - Oh, that's way better.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.160
 Yeah, you could do it.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.280
 Could you do it over time even?

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.120
 Would they let you like?

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:33.960
 - Yeah, for sure.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.060
 I could do like.

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:37.520
 - I'd have a moving day where you get people

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:38.680
 that will gradually help you.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:39.960
 - Yeah, and I've had done this before.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.760
 I've moved within the same building in New York.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.320
 I've moved up a couple floors.

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:46.880
 - What about moving up a couple floors

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.360
 was worth the trade off of having to move all your stuff?

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.160
 - It was, I went from a studio to a one bedroom.

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.160
 I was moving up in life.

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.320
 I was moving up and out to you.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.160
 - You're moving up.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.000
 - Moving up in life, you know.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:55.840
 - Is that how it works in New York?

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.200
 The higher, how the penthouse?

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.640
 - Actually, now that I think about it,

00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.480
 did I go lower?

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.280
 I think I might've went lower.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.920
 I don't remember, but it was bigger.

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.200
 - I think it'd be more desirable to be closer to the ground.

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.280
 Like less elevator time.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.760
 - No, no, higher is better.

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.080
 'Cause yeah, you're right.

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:10.920
 You're right.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.640
 The elevator time is a thing, but you get in the elevator

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.800
 with someone else in the elevator.

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.160
 They punch nine.

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.960
 You punch 24.

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.000
 - And you just feel better?

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:20.840
 'Cause your number is bigger.

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:23.760
 - You know who's on top, literally.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.160
 - Wow. - That's why.

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.400
 - Humans are simple.

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.000
 We're a pretty simple organism when you think about it.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.840
 - Yeah, bigger number better.

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:33.160
 - Bigger number better, yeah.

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.040
 - Yeah, so I don't know if we're gonna be able to do

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.600
 'cause I think I talked in this morning

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.320
 and he said that somebody noticed under contract then.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.840
 - Wait, somebody, he's under contract with somebody else

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.120
 and you're not sure if you'll be able to do it?

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.360
 - I messaged him yesterday 'cause we had the idea

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.160
 that I taught, he was walking by my house this morning,

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.680
 so I taught him real quick and he said,

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.920
 somebody sent the contract then.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.920
 I don't know if that means that it's finalized or anything, but.

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.440
 - Can I ask, I've heard about your morning routine

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.520
 of going out in your boxers and walking Zuko

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.920
 around your AstroTurf.

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.120
 Were you in your boxers

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:03.120
 when you had this conversation with your landlord?

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.480
 No other clothes.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.960
 - No, I had a shirt on today.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:06.800
 - Oh, okay.

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.640
 - Sometimes I don't like it.

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.760
 - No, it's been cold here for like, it's been so long.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.880
 - No, 65, yeah, we'll do on the ground.

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.840
 - Okay, let me try to defend myself.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.120
 Let me try to explain why I'm gonna complain about this.

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:18.960
 - Good luck.

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.800
 - I'll preface it with acknowledging,

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.480
 yes, everyone has it worse than me,

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:29.040
 but here's the thing, I moved here to not worry

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.280
 about temperature.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:35.280
 The mornings, it's been around like 50 to 60, okay?

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.560
 When I wake up.

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.400
 - Yeah.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.760
 - So I can't do the thing which I love more

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.640
 than anything in the world, which is roll out of bed

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.560
 and walk outside in whatever I'm wearing.

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:47.240
 I have to put on a shirt or like put on something.

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.160
 I think it's like one layer, or like one long sleeve layer.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.160
 - Yeah.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:53.120
 - And that just ruins my morning.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.240
 That ruins my routine.

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.040
 That ruins like a big part of what's great here.

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:57.960
 Yeah, and it's cold.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:00.560
 I think, you know, later in the day it gets to 70s,

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:04.680
 which is fantastic, but yeah.

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.920
 Look, what I'm saying is I'm basically the same as you.

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.240
 You have to, you have to wake up.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.800
 If you have to go outside, you have to like get dressed

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.400
 and you know, that whole routine.

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.600
 - Yeah, I'd love for you to come visit Niosarks.

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.800
 Like when it's, you know, the polar vortex is here

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.720
 and it's taking it for 15.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.560
 - What the hell is that?

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:22.160
 - And we're trying to get our two kids

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.640
 to the grocery store and it's minus 15 degrees

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.660
 and everyone has to wear like six layers.

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:28.400
 - Yeah, I'd love for you to come visit.

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.240
 We'll have a good time.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.040
 And you can appreciate what you really got, Dax.

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.480
 That you had to slip on a t-shirt

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:34.280
 before you walked outside in your underwear.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.120
 You poor thing.

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.520
 (laughing)

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.360
 - Yeah, but it's hard.

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.480
 (laughing)

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.320
 - Yeah, but hard, but it's a good one.

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.480
 Good comeback.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.520
 (laughing)

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:50.240
 - I'm curious, aren't you rich enough to buy a house

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.080
 while you're renting?

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.720
 I can understand this as European.

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.740
 So I still own an apartment in New York

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:58.760
 and I don't think I can buy two houses realistically.

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:01.500
 So I need to sell that one before I can buy another one.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.340
 - Are you ever gonna sell it?

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.680
 Are you still trying to sell it?

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.080
 Did people in New York just decide that?

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.840
 - Yeah, we got a tenant in there ever since we left.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:11.040
 So her, she's gonna be out this,

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:11.840
 something I'm gonna be able to ask

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.080
 'cause she wants a renew, but assuming she doesn't,

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.000
 we're gonna try to list it this summer.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.240
 I don't know if anyone's gonna buy it.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.760
 Like it's, I just can't,

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.160
 I don't know why someone would go take out

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.920
 a 7% mortgage right now to buy my apartment.

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.480
 It just doesn't have any sense at it.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.800
 - Is it 7%?

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:28.880
 - Something like that.

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.360
 - That's so rough.

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.200
 - Wow.

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.040
 - So yeah, I don't know.

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.360
 For the price that I would need to sell it at,

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.560
 like I'm very skeptical.

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.160
 So we're like in this weird trap situation,

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:40.640
 I'm okay renting the only pain point with it is

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.760
 we can't fix stuff in the house.

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.480
 We can, but it feels dumb.

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.080
 And it's just like, you know,

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.120
 it's like a little bit more overhead

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.240
 like asking the landlord for permission.

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:53.080
 - Yeah. So yeah, I'm fine with the setup for now,

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:57.000
 but P version offered me 50K for the New York department.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.240
 (laughing)

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:03.240
 If it gets to that, I'm gonna have a problem.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.080
 - Yeah.

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.840
 - Did I ever tell you about our,

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.320
 if I've already told you, please just stop me,

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.280
 but they ever tell you about our moving to Florida

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.640
 and then moving back financial situation?

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.240
 - Because you sold the house for a loss

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.720
 and that person sold it again for a profit.

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.720
 - And it was like probably like a 30% loss

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.680
 and they sold it for like a 30% increase.

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.880
 It was like the same amount we lost on it.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:23.720
 - I hate that.

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.020
 (laughing)

00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:26.280
 - They're just people in life

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.640
 where like just tiny is beautiful for them.

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:28.840
 - Yeah, but they just time everything.

00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.280
 Yeah. Or are they just patient?

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.840
 Am I just so impatient that I'm always on the wrong end

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.080
 of timing because I just can't wait.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.760
 - I'm just, I'm convinced that there's no controlling this

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:39.000
 'cause it's just so, it's just so random.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.920
 Like all the people that bought places

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.880
 towards the beginning of COVID, like damn.

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:48.440
 Prices were low and the interest rates were super low.

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:50.960
 - Yeah, life was good. - Yeah, time it.

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.240
 How are you gonna predict?

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.080
 - I did, I guess I timed my mortgage here

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.160
 like at the 2.5% or whatever.

00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.000
 - Yeah, my New York apartment is similar

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.520
 but yeah, we're stuck with it for now.

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.280
 - I just had this thought of you being my landlord

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.720
 and wow, it's your somebody's landlord

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.120
 and that's hilarious to me.

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.760
 - Just like, you know what's back.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.080
 Yeah, it's been interesting having this experience

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:16.440
 because I lived in that apartment.

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.920
 Okay, I lived in it.

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:22.280
 And like any place that's not brand new,

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.080
 there's some things that are a little wrong with it.

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:26.260
 Like one of the windows isn't open properly.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.580
 - Yeah.

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:29.680
 - But again, you're like on the eighth floor,

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.680
 you're not in New York,

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.400
 you're not like opening your window all the time

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.520
 but other windows open fine.

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.400
 We actually did try to get it fixed

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:40.520
 and the company like, we paid them to fix it

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.920
 and they like didn't, they fixed half of it

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:45.400
 and they didn't have, wasn't really fixed.

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.440
 But I'm like, you know, it's not the biggest deal in the world.

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.280
 I'm not gonna pay thousands

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.220
 to get this window fixed and not a big deal.

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:53.720
 But you know, for our tenant, she's like,

00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.240
 hey, I need this window fixed.

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.120
 And I'm like, oh, this is why landlords are the way they are

00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.200
 'cause I'm like, it doesn't fucking matter.

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.120
 I'm not gonna spend $1,000 on fixing this window.

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.200
 You can just use the other fucking window, you know?

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.640
 But I'm like, okay, I get it.

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:08.840
 I have a little bit of empathy

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:11.600
 for how annoying landlords are.

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.560
 I'm definitely not as annoying as the typical landlord

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:17.680
 who's like deep in them and has had that mindset

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:20.360
 for like decades, but it's weird.

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.800
 - Yeah, you're not totally calloused yet and hardened.

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:23.640
 - Yeah.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.120
 - You are from other things, but not being a landlord.

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.360
 (laughing)

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.840
 - Bieber dropped his offer to 48K.

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.120
 (laughing)

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.880
 - Oh man, so good.

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.560
 - Also being a tenant like remotely from another state

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:43.000
 is like also a whole thing 'cause you can't just go.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.280
 - Oh yeah, that's tough.

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.440
 - Do they follow you on Twitter?

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.080
 Does your tenant follow you?

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.560
 That'd be hilarious to me.

00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.920
 - She moved in there 'cause her two daughters

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.760
 are now in college and she was like downsized

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.880
 and they'll live just by herself.

00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.640
 I don't think she follows me on Twitter.

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.720
 (laughing)

00:57:58.720 --> 00:57:59.560
 - That'd be really weird.

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:00.640
 - 'Cause I think that'd be hilarious.

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.360
 If she knew your online presence,

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.560
 like just like your personality on the internet,

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.760
 if that would change her as a tenant

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.000
 and her relationship with you.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:09.840
 - I wonder.

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.680
 - People find their online personalities weird

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.880
 and so our secret project.

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.720
 - Yes, I'm so excited.

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:19.560
 - The other person we're working with on our secret project

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:21.200
 that's not from our bubble.

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.040
 - Yes.

00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.240
 - So I know him, this is gonna be so big and so funny.

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.280
 - Let's call him D.

00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.760
 - D, what?

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.720
 That may sound like that's me.

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:30.880
 (laughing)

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.440
 - Oh yeah, your name's like the D, okay, nevermind.

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:34.800
 - I don't remember your name in anything.

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.840
 - That person, yeah, yeah.

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:39.120
 - Okay, so he's obviously not from our,

00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:41.240
 wait no, not that person, not D.

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.200
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:47.920
 The person who we're buying this stuff from.

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.720
 - Oh, gotcha, okay, yeah.

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:52.640
 - Okay, that person, that person.

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:53.720
 - Buying what stuff?

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.520
 Everyone's so curious now, they can't handle it.

00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:57.720
 - Yeah, the secret project.

00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:00.280
 So the person we're buying this stuff from

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.800
 for the thing that we're trying to do,

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.560
 he's a friend of a friend.

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:09.080
 And my friend was saying that he was looking us up

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.360
 'cause for the stuff that we do.

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:14.160
 And obviously one, we're like this weird space

00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.680
 where we're using all these technical terms

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.200
 that nobody uses, that's outer space.

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.040
 - Yeah.

00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.560
 - But two, he just could not tell what was serious

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.720
 and what was like a joke in all position posts.

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.920
 And I realized like, wow, we probably come across

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.040
 really, really weird.

00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:29.640
 - Yeah, for like people who, yeah, just to imagine

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.560
 someone who has no technical base,

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.520
 like they have no knowledge on that front.

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:37.320
 And then trying to parse what you say on Twitter,

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.160
 that would be tough.

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.760
 - It's like, I make a sarcastic joke

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:42.200
 about something technical.

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.000
 And they're like, there's no way for them

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:44.840
 to understand that. - They're so hard

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:45.680
 to unfurl that.

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.760
 - But then like all these people liking it

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.400
 and retweeting it and it's like, what?

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.440
 - It's super confusing.

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:52.960
 Yeah, it's really weird. - It's like an alien.

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:56.120
 - I want to find this equivalent in another bubble

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.540
 so I can experience it.

00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:01.360
 Like architecture is Twitter.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.000
 There's some, something like that.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.200
 - 'Cause when I think of Twitter,

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.120
 I do think like the tech presence is huge on Twitter.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.080
 Is there other communities that that's

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.120
 their primary outlet is Twitter?

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:12.960
 I'm sure.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.120
 I just do know anything. - Well, FinTech

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.960
 Twitter is kind of on there.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.040
 But I feel like they're so similar to tech Twitter

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.320
 and like there's so much overlap that I can like

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.440
 understand what they're talking about.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.600
 I've interested in what they're talking about

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.440
 and they're-- - Okay.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.000
 - Divide the similar to ours.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:26.920
 But I've seen that one.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.200
 - Yeah, what about like doctors?

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.640
 I want to like a trade that's like totally disconnected

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.160
 but they all hang out on Twitter.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.880
 Like they're not an internet profession.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.480
 - I would love to see doctors being like--

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.560
 - Is there such a thing?

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.240
 - LOL, actually killed my patient today.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.600
 Happens to all of us.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.480
 That one's quote treating it.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.400
 Oh, that sucks.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.240
 But like, you know, that happens to me too.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:52.640
 - Yeah, I need to find, I need to be exposed

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.960
 'cause you can't really like the way social graphs work.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.080
 You can't just like be dropped into the middle of like--

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.720
 - Yeah, I know. - That, you know what I mean?

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.960
 You could see like a straight tweet here and there

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.360
 and you could see the people interacting with it

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.600
 but you can't experience a timeline like someone in that.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.400
 Unless you're looking over someone's shoulder.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.600
 You got to know somebody.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.880
 - This is a feature I've wanted

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.600
 where I could pick someone on Twitter

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.480
 and see their timeline.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.920
 - It's like they allow you to?

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.200
 - No, 'cause you can see all their follow.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:22.240
 You like, you know who they're following, that's public.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.960
 So I want to just have something that generates a feed

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:28.080
 so I can like view through their eyes, you know?

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.440
 - Isn't there like some algorithmic magic happening though?

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.160
 It's not just like every tweet from all the people

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.120
 you follow. - It's not just that.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.840
 But I feel like that would get close.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.240
 - Yeah, I guess so.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.240
 Like the non for you tab, what are the other ones called?

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.840
 - Yeah, I've always wanted that 'cause I'm like,

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.960
 I do wonder what that how this person sees.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.480
 - Yeah, we need to see life from their eyes.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.640
 - Yeah, that would be a great feature.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.840
 Elon, if you're listening to this podcast.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.920
 - Why'd you stop and say podcast?

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.240
 - 'Cause I forgot what it was called.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.680
 (laughing)

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.520
 I forgot the word.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.040
 - Elon, if you're listening to this podcast,

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.880
 it was like on an automated phone system.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.280
 When they like, it's like they've recorded

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.840
 a little like natural sentences

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.440
 and they drop in the word that's like dynamic.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.160
 (laughing)

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.000
 - That's really funny.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.840
 - So that's it.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.320
 - Our rhythm is so different when you make fun of me.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.400
 It like feels like we're entering a different dimension.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.200
 - 'Cause it takes me so long to get there.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.040
 - No, it's not that.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:23.880
 It's just like.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.240
 - Oh, just I don't make funny you much.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:28.240
 - Just like the vibe is, yeah, just like totally shifts.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.040
 (laughing)

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:30.920
 - Oh, it's funny.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.000
 I wish I wasn't sick.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.760
 I hate being sick.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.680
 - I mean, it's allergies probably, but.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.840
 - What do you, is that serious?

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.480
 I don't think it's allergies.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.520
 Art, is it the middle of winter?

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.800
 Like what allergies?

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.640
 Isn't everything dead?

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.480
 - I don't know.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.640
 I mean, it's been getting warmer.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:49.720
 I do feel like every year I start getting this like allergy

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.400
 and then this isn't, this is something else.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.080
 But I start getting allergies when it starts to warm up.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.720
 Like when the weather changes drastically,

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.880
 we went from like super cold to pretty nice.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.160
 And I think that's when it is.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.440
 Man, there's so many things I wanna say on our podcast

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.800
 that I can't because I don't wanna offend people.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:06.920
 - What?

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.760
 What are you talking about?

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.040
 - No, you have to say it now.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.680
 - You know, and there's like people in our little sphere

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.560
 that are kind of in our sphere, but like,

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.560
 I'm not really like friendly with them.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.600
 And there's just things I wanna say,

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.240
 but I'm not gonna say it 'cause it's like a podcast.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.560
 Like people listen to it, you know?

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.880
 People listen.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.560
 - Hey, Brian Johnson says you need more haters.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.880
 If you don't have haters, you're not going hard on that.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.600
 - But I don't wanna create like riffs

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.440
 in our little community, you know?

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.760
 - Maybe you're being a narcissist

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.080
 'cause you think that you're so important

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.360
 that you could create a rift.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.840
 - No, I just, (laughs)

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.720
 I gotta try a different angle.

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.560
 I'm just trying to feel what you're saying.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.040
 - Yeah, and I'm not gonna say it.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.080
 It was like multiple things came to mind.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.840
 I just looked at something on my computer

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.320
 and like more than one person,

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.760
 I just wanna say something, but I'm not gonna say it.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.360
 And you know, it's tough filtering yourself

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.200
 for the internet.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.120
 - Can you tell me after?

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.120
 - Oh sure, yeah.

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.880
 Of course, part of our phone calls

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.840
 that we don't record or stream.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.680
 - Yeah.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.080
 - I don't know, I feel like I have a pretty measured take

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.600
 on people, I feel like I have a pretty good read

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.600
 'cause I don't know if I've said this before.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.200
 I generally like people.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.880
 Like my default is I really like people.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.800
 Even people, like my wife doesn't like a lot of people.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.240
 She has like, what is she like warm up to?

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:14.920
 - And she's like, what is that?

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:18.720
 You were like, I generally like people, even my wife.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.560
 (laughs)

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.480
 - No, no, no, no.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.720
 My wife, her default is not to like people.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.000
 It's like they have to earn it, you know what I mean?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.120
 For me, like, I'm like a puppy

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.960
 and I come into any new encounter with somebody

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.840
 and I just immediately like them.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.640
 And they have to really like make me not like them,

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.880
 like shake me off with a stick.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.320
 Kind of, this is that thing

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.080
 where I take forever to get to a point.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:43.040
 - Well, I say, oh yeah, so I generally like people.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.600
 So when I don't like somebody

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.600
 for specific reasons, am I right?

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.600
 - It's a big deal.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.320
 - I feel like there's a reason.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.880
 It's not like I'm saying that person is bad

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.560
 or that they're universally,

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.680
 just that like, I have a pretty good read on people.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.320
 I don't know.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.640
 I know that because I don't know why I wouldn't like them.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.480
 - I agree with you.

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:04.840
 I think having seen you,

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.440
 if you don't like someone, that's like a big signal.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.040
 If I don't like someone, not very surprising,

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.600
 but if you don't like someone, it's like, you know.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.120
 - I think there's something there,

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.200
 something they could work on.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.080
 And I should just be a good communicator

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.680
 and take it to them and say, hey, listen.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.520
 There's something about it.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.440
 - It would be so funny.

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:24.720
 (laughs)

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.920
 It would be so funny if you gave this exact speech to them.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.240
 Like, hey, I'm someone that generally really likes people.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.520
 For you, for whatever reason, I don't like you.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.600
 You might wanna think about that.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.440
 And that's all you said.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.280
 - I would never say that.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.960
 I'm too non-confrontational.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.240
 I'm too Midwestern.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.600
 I'm not an East Coaster, like, I don't just say stuff.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.640
 - Midwesterners are fake.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.880
 - It's true.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.760
 I mean, it really is.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.360
 It's a big glossy LinkedIn layer of fake.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.360
 - LinkedIn layer.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.360
 (laughs)

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.920
 - LinkedIn wasn't invented in the Midwest.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.080
 - It probably was.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.240
 I wouldn't be surprised.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.360
 - Okay, well, I wanna get off now so you can tell me what--

01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.200
 - Okay, yeah.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.040
 - What you should probably get off anyway, yeah.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.040
 - Yeah, I'll tell you what I saw.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.040
 It feels like when I have these thoughts, it just feels mean.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.040
 But it's not mean, it's just like--

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.200
 - I have a thought on this concept.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.040
 - Yeah.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.840
 - Do you notice, and maybe this is a me thing,

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.880
 but a lot of people relate to this.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.480
 If you're out and you're listening to any two people talking,

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.720
 you're like, they sound like a bunch of idiots.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.480
 They're like, "It sounds so stupid."

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.680
 You drop on the thing, it just sounds so dumb.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.520
 - Yeah.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.560
 - And I bet people listening to you,

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.040
 it just sounds so stupid.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:33.880
 - It's true.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.120
 - For every reason, when people aren't in your circle,

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.320
 they just sound dumb and you're just like,

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.160
 this person sucks.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.200
 - Yeah, yeah, for sure.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.040
 I think about that all the time,

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.800
 like if my wife ever listened to our podcast,

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.800
 she's just gonna think I'm an idiot.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.440
 - Well, that's a different problem, but--

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.520
 - Well, yeah, it's true.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.120
 (laughs)

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.600
 - No, I'm just kidding.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.040
 So I think that's what it is, you know?

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.800
 It's not me, it's just the reality of--

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.560
 - Well, but these are people in my circle.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.640
 They're not outside my circle, that's the problem.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.480
 - Like in your circle?

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.560
 - Yeah, like in-ish.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.400
 And you know how like--

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.000
 - In, but not in, but in-ish.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.360
 - But this is, like, I think this is an important distinction

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.080
 because it is interesting, like,

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.880
 there's your immediate circle.

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.680
 There's like, they have very close friends.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:20.520
 And then there's like, this broader weird amoeba

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:24.200
 that is like, we all kind of belong to the same crowd

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.240
 'cause we're all on Twitter and we're all devs or whatever.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.120
 But like, I don't know,

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.040
 I wouldn't choose to hang out with a lot of them.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.240
 But like, how do I say this?

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.520
 I can't, never mind.

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.360
 I can't go any further.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.000
 - Yeah, this also I'm writing you another thing.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.080
 So do you know what the, like the graph partitioning problem is?

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.920
 - This is exactly, I don't know what it is.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:48.040
 But you just nailed the words, yes, go ahead.

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.640
 - So like if you have a bunch of nodes

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.480
 and they're interconnected, let's say it's like,

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:56.120
 like a literal example could be like a social network,

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.960
 like friends of friends and like you draw a graph

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.960
 and you connect anything and you have to draw a line

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.720
 that cleanly splits the graph in half.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.280
 And it's like, you can do it maybe decently,

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.960
 but you're gonna like, cross.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.120
 - There's gonna be stragglers or there's gonna be some.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:09.960
 - Yeah, there's gonna be some.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:10.800
 - That you shouldn't cut out.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.640
 - Yeah, exactly.

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.240
 And it's like, it's an NP hard problem, right?

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.480
 It's like something that's not,

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.400
 you can't really do it effectively.

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.760
 And this is why you had to get technical graph databases

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.760
 and never took off that much

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.760
 'cause you can't partition them

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.560
 across multiple servers easily.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:24.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.320
 - But you can get close.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.960
 And this is what that is.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.960
 - It's exactly what it is.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.800
 And when they're the few moments

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.160
 when we all get together in person,

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.520
 it makes those things stand out.

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.440
 And again, not like there's bad people

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.600
 that shouldn't be in this group.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.680
 It's that like, you just, as a person,

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.360
 you're never gonna vibe with everybody.

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:43.200
 - Yeah.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.960
 - I hate saying the word vibe 'cause I feel so Gen Z.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.000
 But like, you're never gonna connect

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.760
 and really resonate with every single person that you should.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.800
 Maybe you should in the sense that like,

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.200
 they have similar interests, they have similar whatever.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.600
 You're similar stages of life.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.280
 You're in a group that all shares a lot in common.

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.880
 You're not gonna connect with all of them in the same way.

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.960
 So when you do all get together,

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:08.180
 it just makes for like some awkward,

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.480
 you're gonna end up with people

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.120
 that you just don't really connect with that well.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.520
 Anyway, I'm gonna stop.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.360
 - It's so complicated.

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:16.920
 Like two people can get along well,

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.000
 but then like that person might not get along nicely

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.120
 with another person.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:20.960
 - Yeah.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.040
 - And it is very complex.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.280
 And the other funny thing is even in a group

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.360
 where it's working well, let's say it's a group

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.200
 of like five people and you always hang out

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.080
 and it's always a great time.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.080
 There's also situations where like, for whatever reason,

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.080
 like three of them left the room.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.560
 And then you're with the person that you realize

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.960
 you never wanna interact with.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.120
 And you never know, the years, you would never notice this.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.920
 And then you're in that situation and you're like,

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.160
 this is really weird.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.360
 - I'm extremely uncomfortable.

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:51.640
 - Yeah, yeah, it's like every person brings out

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:52.480
 different parts of you.

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.320
 And when you're in a group and you're always together

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.280
 in that group, you're a different person

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.680
 than when you're with one of them alone

01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.960
 or any one of them.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.640
 So yeah, it's interesting, the graph thing.

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.720
 As soon as you said that graph partitioning

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.600
 or whatever you said, it's like that is the problem.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.640
 It's exactly a problem.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.560
 All these interconnected nodes,

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.160
 everybody has relationships with everybody in different ways.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.680
 And then you try to all get together

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:17.720
 and then parts of it splits off.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.080
 And then you end up, yeah, I mean,

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.960
 you should just tough it out and be like, whatever.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:24.760
 I can learn to enjoy being around anybody,

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.560
 but you can't, you just can't.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.600
 Some people just kind of get on their own side.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:33.960
 - We're gonna experience this at React Miami

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.760
 'cause everyone's gonna be over in my house.

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:39.280
 And I think that one should be fine, but yeah, we'll see.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.120
 You never know.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.200
 - So you do have like a very strict invite thing you're doing.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.400
 I had to like fill out a form.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.480
 It was like, what's your name?

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.800
 And I'm like, oh, I just want to put something stupid here.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.360
 Name and email address.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:51.200
 - You did put something stupid.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.560
 You put Adam Elmore in there.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.080
 - Oh, stop it.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.740
 It's not stupid to name that stupid.

01:10:56.740 --> 01:11:00.800
 I mean, I just don't want to like sign up my address

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.040
 to a bunch of random people.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.160
 - Yeah, no, it's a good idea.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.320
 I think putting a little barrier there is good.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.640
 - Everyone at your house is chat invited.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.480
 - Is it gonna be at your car house?

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:10.320
 - Well, that's what I was thinking of.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.080
 - As if I move around to update the invite

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.400
 and like bump it up by two numbers.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.800
 (laughing)

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.360
 Guys, major change in venue.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.560
 It's now like 50 feet to the left.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.200
 (laughing)

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.120
 - That's funny.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:23.960
 - Okay.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:24.880
 - All right.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.120
 - Let's go.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.160
 Let's end it abruptly and awkwardly.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.160
 - All right. - Goodbye.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.000
 - See ya.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.580
 (upbeat music)

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.660
 (upbeat music)
