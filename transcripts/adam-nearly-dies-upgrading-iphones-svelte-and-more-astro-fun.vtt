00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 People are using morphine so wrong.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:28.400
 Let's share with the audience some context.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.200
 So yesterday, I'm usually at my computer all the time,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.760
 but I stepped away for a bad thing.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.640
 I was having dinner and I came back and then I see a bunch of messages from Adam.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.800
 The first message is a selfie from a hospital bed in like full hospital outfit.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.840
 And you're not like smiling.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.960
 It's like you look really miserable.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.320
 I felt awful at that moment.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.160
 That's why I took the picture.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.320
 You look like really depressed and my fear.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.000
 And then I see like a like a bunch of like long messages.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.600
 I'm like, oh, shit, Adam, try to kill himself.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.800
 My first thought I said that I swear, but here's the thing.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.680
 It's not, but it wasn't that I'm like, oh, Adam,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.520
 something that would kill himself.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.720
 My thought was, oh, Adam, try to kill himself.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.720
 That's really crazy.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.920
 I would have never expected that.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.360
 That was my first immediate thought when I saw that because of my facial expression,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.000
 your facial expression, the hospital, then like the text.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.240
 Oh, yeah, I guess what I said to you.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.120
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.080
 Well, it was just like I skimmed it real quick and it just sounded really serious.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.000
 So like where I was like, I tried to kill myself.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.640
 But that part made you think maybe.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.160
 No, you just had like a bunch of like very serious things about like what to do

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.680
 if you die and I'm just like, what the fuck?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.720
 And then you didn't tell me anything else, nothing.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.520
 And I was like, I don't even remember what I said.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.640
 No, you didn't say anything about what happened.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.760
 You were just like, I don't think I'm going to die.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.440
 But in case I do, like, well, here's X, Y, Z, instructions.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.600
 I was like, I was like, OK, I'm going to just try to go back to work.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.120
 And then I did.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.160
 I did go back to work, but I felt weird the whole time.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.040
 And then, OK, well, that's good at least.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.720
 Yeah, then, and I was like, well, I was like, let me just like reset for a second

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.920
 before I decide what to do.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.920
 Then I met texting your wife.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.280
 And then I told her like Adam sent me this photo and didn't tell me anything else.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.840
 And the first thing she says is, oh, he would.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.240
 I really wasn't trying to be dramatic.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.120
 I just I know it was a serious situation, but I didn't know where I was.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.400
 At that point, they hadn't gotten the results back from the CT scan and all that.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.440
 Like, yeah, so, you know, I've said it before, I think on stream once that I get

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.440
 that issue with my, I think it's like a diaphragm hernia where it locks up.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.680
 And I like have to lay on my back.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.800
 I think it's a hernia because if I lay on my back, it feels better.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.880
 And I hear that's I don't know, that's hernia stuff.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.480
 OK, but it's always in this left side kind of just next to my belly button.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.240
 And last night, I was yesterday afternoon, I started having what just felt like

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.800
 bloating.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.360
 I just felt like, oh, I just ate something.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.120
 I don't know, ate too much, something just kind of felt like uncomfortable, but

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.240
 then it progressively was getting more uncomfortable.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.560
 And then eventually, like I was just in our living room for writhing around in pain.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.800
 And I couldn't talk.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.280
 I couldn't think Casey's like trying to ask me, like, do we need to go to the hospital?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.480
 I have no idea what's going on.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.920
 I was just in so much pain.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.640
 Wow.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.000
 It was, it was intense.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.840
 So she drove me into the hospital.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.960
 So that basically they ended up doing like cat scan, figured out like it's not, it wasn't.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.600
 My fear at the moment was that that hernia, it can lead to strangulation of the intestines.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.080
 Like if your intestine gets up through there, it can strangulate and eventually it can

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.200
 like burst and then it's like life threatening, like the toxins and your body and all that stuff.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.120
 So that was my fear.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.520
 And I think that was the last thing I told Casey before I couldn't really communicate.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.920
 Was like, if it's, if it's actually, if it's strangulated, like that's really bad.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.800
 So anyway, they did a cat scan.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.000
 It was just my intestine.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.640
 My fallen testins were very inflamed.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.600
 They think it's viral, no hernia issue, no anything else.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.640
 It was just really, really painful for a couple of hours.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.720
 They put me on morphine and then I calmed down.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.560
 I couldn't breathe.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.760
 Like I, just the way I was breathing, I wasn't trying to, but I was just like hyperventilating myself.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.160
 Yeah.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.200
 Like I was completely, it was bizarre.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.560
 I was like very dehydrated for some reason.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.720
 All my muscles were cramping.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.040
 And I was just like trying to get into a position on the hotel on the hospital bed that didn't hurt.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.440
 And it was awful.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.840
 But I'm alive.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.360
 And I'm fine.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.080
 Today, I feel great.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.560
 Are you on any medication today?

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.080
 Uh, I mean, just Ivy Pro, but they've given, they prescribed me some like narcotics.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.600
 Yeah.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.200
 Uh, but I'm not taking them.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.040
 I don't think I need to.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.360
 I, I slept really good.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.400
 So they gave me another random morphine before I went to bed.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.440
 And I slept with it and I thought I would.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.840
 And then this morning I was expecting to wake up in pain and I didn't.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.800
 So I just got done working out.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.760
 Really?

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.960
 Drinks, I don't have a liquid diet for a couple of days.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.840
 Uh, but like planning on business as usual at this point, that's crazy.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.440
 Considering I thought you were dead yesterday.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.160
 Yeah.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.320
 I thought like I thought it was, I really did think it was the hernia or something.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.640
 I thought it was going to be something serious.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.040
 And then I was going to not be able to compete.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.400
 Like I've got this tournament.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400
 I'm that's what I was thinking too.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.600
 I was like, he's definitely not doing that.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.040
 Yeah, no, I'm doing it.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.840
 I'm doing it.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.680
 I'm playing it too.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.520
 Um, yeah, no, I'm alive.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.360
 I feel good.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.760
 Have you, uh, have you been on morphine before?

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.680
 Is that your first time?

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.600
 That was my first time.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.120
 Yeah.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.480
 So how good does it feel?

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.000
 You know, they told me like all these things to expect.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.880
 Like you might feel nauseated and I felt warm or cold.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.480
 I don't remember.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.160
 I didn't really feel anything.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.920
 It's just the pain, the relief from the pain was all that I cared about.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.200
 Like I fell asleep at some point because I was just like the first time I'd been

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.320
 able to stop breathing really, it was like not deep breathing.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.640
 It was like a shallow kind of in the middle of my breath range.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.080
 Cause if I exhale completely, I hurt really bad and if I inhaled completely.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.600
 So it was like, I was kind of bouncing my breath in there and making these weird

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.000
 grounds, man, I was, I wish you could have seen me, the people at the hospital.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.480
 I don't even know who all experienced it, but, uh, they, they realized, even

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.440
 though I wasn't bleeding or whatever, that it was pretty serious.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.400
 They were rushing me around.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.120
 Cause I was, it was just like been over.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.080
 I could not move.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.680
 I couldn't think I couldn't communicate.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.080
 It was awful.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.400
 Yeah.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.960
 It's crazy that like in certain parts of your body, if something happens, it's

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.320
 just like instantly goes to max pain.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.280
 And it might not even be related to how serious it is.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.000
 It's just a type of thing.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.120
 Oh, yeah, it was.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.200
 It was 10 out of 10 for me.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.920
 That was as much pain as I can imagine being in, which is weird for it to just be like,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.880
 you're fine.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.840
 I mean, it just, it felt like someone was just inflating my intestines and they were

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.040
 going to explode at some point.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.720
 Oh my God.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.680
 And like they did nothing I could do about it.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.560
 It was just, it was right in the middle there.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.280
 It sucked.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.840
 Yeah.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.840
 It's a, I remember.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.520
 So Alan had like a minor surgery, but he had like a pancreatitis, uh, that

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.640
 effect from her, something like that.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.480
 And I remember him describing.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.000
 So he was stuck in the hospital for a long time.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.080
 I think it was like over a week, maybe two weeks or something, but they gave him that

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:22.840
 button that like adds more morphine to whatever you can give it yourself.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.160
 Yeah.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.720
 And he was like, he was like, I totally get addiction now because one, he said, it felt

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.440
 like so good.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.920
 I think just yeah.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.400
 I mean, he could just press a button and like feel really good.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.240
 Like the most direct form of just like whatever that, like psychology thing.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.440
 You're just like training yourself to.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.080
 Yeah.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.600
 Yeah.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.320
 That loves dog.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.600
 Yeah.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.120
 Exactly.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.400
 So he was just like, I totally get this.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.600
 Like this just felt, he just felt so good.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.520
 Um, I have an issue where most painkillers give me crazy amounts of nausea.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.880
 Um, and some people are like that.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.360
 Yeah.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.240
 So they, they prescribed these, these painkillers.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.960
 And they also prescribed zofram, which is like a nausea medicine.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.480
 Yeah.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.520
 Because I guess it causes a lot of that.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.800
 I just don't, I don't like nausea.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.200
 I don't want to mess around with nausea.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.720
 So if as long as I be prophin keeps, yeah, I feel pretty good today.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.160
 Like I expected, I'm not going to eat any food for a while just because I don't want

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.960
 to take a chance at passing through there and really hurting.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.520
 But I expected to be in, in a bad situation today.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.480
 Like they told me the doctor first said, I think he said like seven days.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.880
 It takes to clear up these viral infections.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.400
 He said most of the pain should be like 48 hours.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.640
 So I was expecting today to be pretty awful, but it's been, it's been good.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.240
 Was there like, like gas involved?

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.640
 Like, was that why a lot of the pain?

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.680
 Was there a pain from that?

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.680
 I don't know.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.280
 There hasn't been gas involved that I'm aware of.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.880
 Like that's what it felt like.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.400
 Kind of like the most extreme gas pains in your intestines.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.040
 You can imagine.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.240
 Yeah, but there was like no up or down signs of it, if that makes sense.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.160
 Yeah, gas pains are crazy because it's just like that could be some of the worst pain

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.840
 you experienced, but it's from something like so trivial and stupid.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.600
 It's just like something is pushed like gas is pushing a part of your body

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.560
 against something that it shouldn't be touching.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.720
 That's like some of the worst pain you can possibly get.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.080
 Yeah.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.960
 So I think last night, I, when they sent me home after the second

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.120
 anamorphine, I didn't feel nauseated, but I threw up a lot on the way home.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.960
 I think that probably helped me because whatever I had eaten that I was throwing

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.320
 up wasn't going to go through my small intestines and it wasn't going to, like that area.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.240
 They said it was like a specific area that was so inflamed and it was on my left side.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:41.360
 So it's like when the food gets to that part of your intestines, that's when the pain hits, I guess.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.200
 So I threw up a lot and I don't think there's any food left in my system.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.120
 And I think that helped.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.960
 I think that's why I'm not really dealing with anything today.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.720
 That makes sense.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.160
 What would happen if you had like hot sauce right now?

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.920
 Or like some kind of.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.960
 Oh, man, yeah, I have no idea.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.360
 I don't want to, I don't want to find out.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.400
 I don't have any, I don't have any Indian food for like the next week.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.120
 Yeah, no, I probably won't.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.800
 Yeah.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.480
 I wanted to.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.120
 So he said clear liquids today.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.960
 I guess this thing clear, this is dandy blend.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.040
 It's very black, but I was thinking like, Oh, cool.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.280
 I love like watermelon juice.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.320
 I've been drinking a lot of those melod drinks in case it's like no fruit juice.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.760
 I know if I have to go a whole day without eating food.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.160
 I can't even have stuff I want.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.080
 So that sucks.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.240
 I love soups.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.120
 Like I love like, like a lot of Asian soups are clear.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.960
 I think like, uh, or I don't know if that's something I've asked you.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.360
 She's making me a bunch of broths.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:34.920
 Yeah.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.320
 Nice.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.680
 Yeah, I actually don't mind that at all.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.840
 It's a one I genuinely like them.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.240
 And two, it just reminds me of being home sick from school, which is like, oh, yeah.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:43.920
 Kind of a nice man.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.640
 Whenever you're sick.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.040
 Yeah.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.200
 Yeah.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.040
 I remember like noodle soup and crackers and yeah.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.320
 Yeah, that's a good time.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:49.920
 Yeah.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.720
 And then ginger ale for some reasons.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.600
 It's like if you're sick, drink a ginger ale.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.120
 Why do it?

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:54.440
 Yeah.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.640
 I think ginger is supposed to be good for your for your stomach.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.000
 Maybe.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.200
 Yeah.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:57.440
 Yeah.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.080
 But I'm pretty sure that the process of making ginger ale like gets rid of all the ginger.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.760
 Mm.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.760
 They like boil it or something.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.280
 I forgot what it is.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.600
 Yeah, that makes sense.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:05.800
 Yeah.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.600
 The so I keep bringing it back to jujitsu, but the the competition Saturday, the thing

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.520
 that sucks the most is well, I mean, maybe it won't be a big deal.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.840
 But I was originally I cut down from a hundred or two hundred and eight pounds.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.360
 I was down to one ninety one because the division, you have to weigh in your

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.800
 G you have to weigh a hundred ninety five or less.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.560
 So I'm trying to compete in that division.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.680
 But the whole time I'm cutting down and I eventually get to that weight, there's

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.920
 nobody else in my bracket.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.200
 So my age and my weight, I was like in a single bracket, eventually someone did

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.560
 join the bracket, but I don't want to compete with one other person.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.240
 I just can't stomach the idea of like losing my only match and standing on

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.400
 the podium in second place.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.120
 You just can't do it.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.840
 So I really didn't want to compete in just just with one other person.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.280
 So then I had to move up and wait to get into a division that has four or five

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.960
 people, which is two oh eight.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.400
 So then I go from one ninety one and I climb back up to one ninety nine because

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.920
 I don't want to be at the bottom of my division.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.520
 Right.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.080
 So I've put on like six, seven pounds over the last few weeks.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.640
 And now I'm probably going to lose five pounds and just not eating for two days.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.480
 It's like I can't get my weight where I want it to be.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:20.000
 Wait, but if you're, can you not compete in a division if you're too light?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.760
 Oh, no, I can.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.920
 Yeah, I can be in the two eight.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.880
 It could be a hundred ninety pounds.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.480
 This can just be 10 pounds lighter.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.680
 And everybody, I don't want that.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.920
 I don't know.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.040
 It's stupid because it's white belt.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.320
 And I feel like all the people who really do jiu-jitsu and actually no jiu-jitsu

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.040
 are probably like chuckling at me.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.120
 Like I'm cutting weight for a white belt tournament.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.560
 But I take everything I do very seriously.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.440
 You know this about me.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.080
 I don't, I don't mess around.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.760
 So yeah, well, I'm glad you're alive and I'm shocked that you're just as good as you are today.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.520
 I am too.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.320
 I couldn't believe I didn't wake up in the night.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.560
 Like I thought the first round of morphine only lasted like an hour.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.520
 I don't know if they didn't do very much, but I started having pretty serious pain

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.440
 after an hour, hour and a half, something like that.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.920
 So when they gave it to me last night, I mean, we came straight home and I went to bed,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.960
 trying to go to bed while I still had it in my system.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.760
 I, but I expected I'd wake up in the night with serious pain and just have a rough night.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.800
 I slept so good.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.240
 It's probably the best I've slept in a while.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.600
 I don't know what that's about morphine.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.120
 I don't know.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.960
 Yeah, I just eat morphine every night.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.520
 That's all you're doing.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.840
 You should be sleeping.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.400
 You should make a threat on morphine.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.240
 Oh, Jesus.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.800
 People are using morphine so wrong.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.040
 Oh, man, I won't, I won't do that.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.320
 Do you ever in situations like this, do you ever think about how all these painkillers

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.400
 are like somewhat of a recent invention and then you imagine people in the Civil War

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.040
 like getting their leg amputated and they're like, here's some whiskey

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:47.880
 and like a belt to bite on and just like how like we are not the same species as

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.840
 those people, like the things they went through.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.040
 That is just crazy.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.720
 And then the other side of it is I also think about if I like play back my life

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.200
 without like any kind of modern medicine, I would have died like eight times already.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.400
 Oh, for real, you've had some like close calls or I guess I don't think about

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.680
 modern medicine and what all it's just just think about like food poisoning.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.200
 I don't think I've ever had food poisoning.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:08.520
 Really?

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.000
 You've never like gotten sick and thrown up or I've gotten sick and thrown up.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.640
 I guess maybe it was food poisoning or anything that lasted like more than a

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.560
 couple day like like a two day food poisoning.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.160
 Maybe that's when I get sick that often.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.720
 I remember having the flu a lot growing up or like even that that probably would

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.240
 have killed you.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.120
 Yeah, I guess.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:25.480
 Yeah.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.840
 A lot of people died from the flu like beyond just the illness itself.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.920
 It's like, imagine, okay, so I think about the food poisoning thing, right?

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.400
 I at least have constant access to water and like other stuff that I can eat

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.000
 that I can stomach and like keep in my stomach.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 If I didn't have access to that, I think I would have just died of dehydration or something.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.680
 Yeah, no, yeah, that makes sense.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.240
 It's crazy.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.200
 Like I would have, yeah, I wouldn't have made it.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.840
 I'm like the people that made it back then.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.800
 Man, they must have been like just a lot of bullets.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.360
 Yeah, the interesting.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.720
 Yeah, did they just never get sick or they just had really good immune systems?

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.920
 Yeah, I guess maybe society was also simpler in a way where like I'm getting

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.720
 illnesses carried over from China.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.600
 Like there's like, you know, oh yeah, the globalization of like how much we're

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.320
 spreading stuff.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.120
 That's a good point too.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.000
 We need all the modern medicine.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.800
 Yeah, so it probably is a good simplicity to it stuff back then.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.400
 But even then it's just like even like high site, I say it's another big one.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.200
 Like if you had bad eyesight, you were just a useless person.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.040
 And like there's no room for that really.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:32.360
 So I saw this thing about it's like an anti-aging expert doctor guy.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:37.320
 But he they're working in some university lab and they've they've like been

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.840
 regenerating site in mice, which is like a first.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.440
 Oh, wow.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.760
 They've no one's ever been able to like repair.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.560
 I stem cell or I what are they called the nerve?

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.040
 Yeah.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.720
 The ocular nerves, yeah.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.960
 Yeah, nobody's ever been able to repair that, but they've got some treatment

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.040
 that's working in mice or like turning blind mice to where they can

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.240
 see, but it all came out of this research around like making cells reverse

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.080
 aging and like these things that happen inside of cells.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.400
 Man, you learn anything about like cellular biology.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.520
 That'll blow your mind just like what's going on inside our body.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.720
 And these trillions of cell, it's just nuts.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.960
 Yeah, but there's like hope for that.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.320
 I guess people who are blind being able to see maybe someday.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.000
 I know it's not a hundred percent situations, but yeah, they have the site

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.480
 and the the hearing restoration stuff.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.240
 Like they've made a lot of progress on that.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.120
 And I think it leads to so many unique opportunities to understand things.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.360
 I do remember watching this thing about people that had their site

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:35.200
 restored after they were like already like five or six, you can like watch

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.240
 them learn how to see and understand a lot about how the brain works.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.360
 They can kind of communicate and you can talk to them and you can teach them.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.040
 Yeah.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:47.400
 But yeah, like I think initially it's just a bunch of noise, like the

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.320
 ability to see a face or a shape.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.240
 And so in the, in the thing, the way they would train the kids is they would

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.040
 have a bunch of overlapping shapes, like a triangle, a square, whatever.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.480
 And they have to like trace with their finger, the outline of the triangle,

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.200
 trace of their fingers outside, outline of a square.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:02.520
 Yeah.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.400
 So even though they can physically like they were getting the data into their eyes,

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.600
 the ability to like recognize that shape as a distinct thing, that's like the

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.480
 learning part of it.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.360
 Interesting.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.320
 And yeah, I think that it like teaches you a lot about how we learn to see

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.240
 and how you can like teach a computer to see and kind of things like that.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.760
 Yeah, it's really crazy.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.360
 Like, imagine like babies are probably just like, what the hell?

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:31.320
 Like the information is just like raw, like so raw pixel thing.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.560
 You can't like make any sense of it.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.040
 I imagine it's probably like, you know, those, uh, these were big in the 90s.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.240
 You remember those like images that were like, I think they're called stereo

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.240
 gram images or something.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.040
 Oh, like magic.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.920
 Matt, yeah, exactly, it just looked like a bunch of noise.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.440
 But then if you stared at it and like focused in the right way, you would see the image.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.200
 What was that?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.080
 How did that work?

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.520
 What were we doing with our eyes?

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.480
 There was this weird thing you had to kind of cross them a little bit or something.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:56.840
 Yeah.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.200
 Like kind of focus.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.800
 You had to like adjust the focal, what you were focused on.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.520
 And then somehow that would, I don't know how it worked, but I, I bet that's how it

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.600
 probably feels.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.200
 Yeah, as a baby, what if we could remember everything like going all the way back?

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.800
 I wonder what kind of memories that we can't.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.480
 Yeah, probably.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.520
 There's some traumatic stuff when you're a baby.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.400
 Yeah.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.360
 No, site is like the most impressive of the senses, right?

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.080
 Like in terms of brain processing power, everything I've heard.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.640
 Like art, the fact that we can see.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:28.840
 Yeah.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.480
 And I think like other animals don't, of course, animals can see is a big part of it.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:39.840
 But I feel like like my cats and my dog, I feel like they wait a site less than some

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.480
 of their other senses where they're like, it's a lot more smell or sound based.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:43.760
 Yeah.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.480
 So I think humans are pretty different in that way.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.040
 Yeah.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.480
 I listened to, I don't remember.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:57.120
 It was Carpathi talking about the Tesla autopilot 2.0 stuff or I don't know if it's

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:03.160
 2.0, but when they move to like raw photon data, they're training models off that stuff

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.440
 instead of like actually turning it in an image and then training models.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.680
 It's just wild.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.960
 It's like basically making it a human brain at this point.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.600
 Yeah.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.680
 It's a, I mean, their approach has always been interesting.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.680
 It's like a, it's like a complete gamble.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.920
 But if they're right, they just crush everyone else and the fact that they're.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.560
 So their whole thing is they don't use Lidar.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.640
 So they only use cameras only site, right?

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.800
 Yeah, which is obvious a lot harder theoretically possible because humans rely on just

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:38.960
 site and it basically knocks a cost down by like, like $10,000 of the car or something

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.000
 when you don't have those things.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.640
 Right.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.240
 And Lidar has gotten cheaper.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:48.000
 But if they do pull it off, then suddenly every other approach is just too expensive.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.160
 They just have like a, I don't know, like a 30% margin benefit of every other approach.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:52.800
 Yeah.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.320
 So that is like an interesting gamble and it makes sense because it's one of those things.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:02.560
 I mean, I think Elon Musk companies tend to go for the, the all or nothing thing.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.200
 And if they win, then it's just like, oh, we're now like 100 times better.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.520
 Yeah.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.880
 Walter Isaacson's book, Elon's biography came out.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.400
 I'm going to listen to it.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.000
 I don't know if that makes me something.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.560
 I don't know.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.480
 People, people get so offended if you.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:16.720
 Yeah.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.320
 I feel like mentioned Elon Musk, but I, I've listened to like every Walter Isaacson book.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.880
 Like literally he's my favorite.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.360
 Yeah, he's great.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.560
 I've only ever listened to Steve.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:28.560
 So Steve Jobs book by him was the first audio book I ever listened to.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.680
 And I was like, this was cool.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.560
 I like audio books.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.760
 Yeah.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.200
 But I haven't listened to anything else.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:33.920
 I did find it.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.000
 Let's just listen to Walter Isaacson, the Steve Jobs one.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.320
 Yeah.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.640
 So we were like kind of reminiscing on some of the Steve Jobs stuff.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.680
 It's crazy to me.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:50.960
 The thing I kept bringing it up was he's probably the first person at my age where I like remember

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.360
 him existing in real life interacting with stuff that was happening.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.080
 And then he like became like a myth or like a legend.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:58.320
 Yeah.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.720
 And it's, it's interesting to be able to like relate those two things.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.280
 I definitely like miss him a lot.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.840
 I feel like he would with the loss of this happening now.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.720
 Like I would have loved to have his energy around.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.000
 Yeah, same.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.600
 Yeah, I can't like hear new Apple releases or then talk about products and not wonder like

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.280
 where he would be at on all of it.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.000
 Oh, yeah, of course.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.080
 Just like the the thing that's coming in January, the vision.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:24.640
 Yeah.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.280
 Just have to wonder like how things would be different if you were still around.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.720
 Are you getting the new iPhone?

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.280
 I don't think so. I'm selling like a, I heard the announcement.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.120
 It's like iPhone 15 is the new one.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.400
 Yeah, 15 and 15.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.520
 I'm on 12.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.880
 That's how out of touch I am.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.400
 Like I didn't realize how it is.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.600
 I thought I was like one behind.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.280
 I'm three behind.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.760
 This has got a 14.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.560
 I just don't even know at this point what I get from getting a new one.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:50.960
 Nothing.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.920
 It's just okay.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.480
 Nothing.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.200
 I switched to iPhone what I think maybe the end of the year.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.960
 Yeah, it wasn't that long ago.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.080
 But I am going to get the new one.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.120
 I'm just going to trade mine in.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:05.280
 I realized like I was just kind of doing all the math and I figure they must do it this way.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.000
 I think I'm just going to end up paying a monthly fee for the rest of my life to just have a phone.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.520
 Oh, maybe that's better.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.400
 That's just the way I look at it.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.520
 I think it simplifies things because.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.800
 Yeah, then you don't feel bad getting the new one because it's just like just.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.440
 Yeah, when they give it back to them,

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.080
 I know they're going to do the most efficient thing possible.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.160
 Whereas previously I just have like a stack of phones that are like kind of collecting.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.760
 I just look at it and I feel bad about just having those waste.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.920
 Yeah, we always say we're going to like sell ours and we never do.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.440
 Yeah, because it's too much work.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.520
 So the easiest way to sell it is to trade it in as soon as you can.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.720
 Yeah, that makes sense.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.800
 So you just trade in the new and you take good care of it.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.920
 You trade it in.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.360
 So that's going to be my approach.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:48.400
 I think I want those new ones specifically for the USB-C thing I've been complaining about.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.280
 Oh, USB-C.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.720
 Okay, so that's what you get.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.520
 Yeah.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.680
 So now I want to get both of us iPhones.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.320
 Exactly.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.320
 Yeah, I'm like I'm making both of us upgrade.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.040
 So then we can just have only USB-C cables everywhere.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:22:59.920
 The AirPod Pro.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.960
 I think they have a new.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.680
 That's the issue.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.640
 Yeah, that's the issue.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.760
 You're going to have to do that too.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.680
 I was so excited that yesterday I was looking.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.440
 I was like in my kitchen and then I saw it was the AirPods plugged in and I was like,

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.160
 "We're so good at this."

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.520
 "We're so good at this."

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.160
 But just a one.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.720
 Just one.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.080
 That's the only one.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:21.120
 My mouse is officially USB-C now charging, my keyboard, USB-C, everything.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.880
 No more lightning cables.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.920
 Yeah, sounds nice.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.200
 The iPhone thing, I do feel bad taking pictures of our kids with my 12,

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.400
 knowing how much better the cameras probably are, three phones later.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.840
 Like Casey's is newer.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.240
 I feel like her photos are probably better than the ones I take.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.880
 So that's the one, the camera thing usually is the thing that I get

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.000
 suckered into buying a new phone.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.800
 Yeah, the camera thing's interesting for me because I feel like at this point,

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.440
 and this is maybe completely made up and someone can tell me I'm wrong,

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:55.200
 but to me, I feel like the raw hardware is like incremental or marginal.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.480
 And every version, it's just that they're doing like different processing

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.960
 or like they're making, because it's like, it is very stylistically.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.000
 When you take a picture on your iPhone, it's not like a raw picture.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.480
 It's a raw picture plus like the Apple filters or like whatever they're doing to process it.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.520
 They do a lot of stuff.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.520
 Yeah, so it's like, it's like a style thing in a lot of ways.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.600
 So yeah, like her phone might take better pictures,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.240
 but it might like the hardware might not be that much.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.320
 It's more than she's better at taking pictures.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.440
 That's another thing.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.200
 I take them from like my face up here and it's like down on a 45 degree angle.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.560
 I'm really bad at pictures too.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.160
 I barely ever take pictures on my phone.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.680
 Also like I just don't, I just have pictures of Zuko on my phone and nothing else.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.400
 So that's it.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.960
 So my photo reel is so embarrassing right now, because my three-year-old

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.960
 and Asa went through this a bit too.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.600
 He's going through the phase where the phrase he says like 150 times a day is,

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.560
 take a picture, take a picture, like if he builds something, if he eats something,

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.440
 take a picture of it.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.000
 He wants to remember that for some reason, that thing or if he's getting ready to take a bite,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.400
 like he won't take a bite of his suit until you take a picture of it.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.120
 So it like he gets a picture and it's pristine for him and then he takes a bite

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.400
 and then it'll be like, take another picture.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.880
 He's just, it's all day long.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.600
 We're taking pictures.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.000
 So my photo reel is just the most random stuff.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.360
 I don't take real photos anymore.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.040
 I just take photos from my three-year-old.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.160
 Sometimes I pretend, if I'm being honest, I just like, got it.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.920
 Because he doesn't always ask the look.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.200
 What a betrayal.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.560
 Yeah, I know.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.840
 Sometimes he calls me on it though.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.800
 He'll be like, I'm going to see, I'm going to see the picture.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.920
 Like hang on, let me do this.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.760
 It's really annoying.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.280
 Well, he's like right for Instagram.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.480
 I'd be saying pictures of his food.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.520
 Oh yeah, there you go.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.040
 I mean, sometimes I think about it like, oh, he's savoring life.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.400
 He's capturing every moment.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.000
 And like, maybe we should be more like that.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.120
 But like, I don't know.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.760
 Here's my food and here's my food after a bite.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.880
 That's a little much for me.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.960
 I always forget to take pictures.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.840
 Not a habit I have.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.240
 I'm just like, I'm just like doing stuff.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.120
 And I'm like, I did it.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.200
 And then later, I'm like, oh, I should have taken a picture.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.720
 So it's just not a thing.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.400
 But yeah, I never really got into the camera stuff.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.600
 I use my phone.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.080
 This is such like an advanced piece of technology.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.680
 It's like so advanced, so crazy.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.560
 So many thousands of engineers and hours and whatever.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.400
 And yeah, billions of dollars.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.920
 And I just use it for Twitter.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.600
 It's like, I just scroll Twitter.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.440
 I check Discord.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.400
 And that's it.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.280
 There's so many advanced features in it that I just,

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.720
 I'm just like, I don't really understand.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.680
 The notifications work.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.240
 I don't understand all these like different modes.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.240
 You can put it in and I just, I don't know, I don't use it.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.160
 Yeah, tons of stuff I won't ever get to.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.080
 I do use it pretty simply.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.680
 It's like, I check email.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.200
 Do you actually use email?

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.960
 Oh, I'm an inbox zero person.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.080
 I'm always every morning.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:38.080
 Oh, you are.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:38.400
 Yeah.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.000
 Oh, okay.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.280
 Yeah, you're super human.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:41.920
 I pay.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.600
 Well, I don't even know how much.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.720
 Too much per month.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.280
 You pay for email?

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.240
 Yeah, I pay for my email client.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.760
 Oh, for your email client.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.040
 It's even crazier.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:51.520
 Yeah.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.160
 Man, I am not an inbox zero person.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.920
 I am an inbox infinity person, which means I just skim.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.720
 I look through all the emails and if I find a good one, I open it.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.200
 Nice.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.440
 But the rest of it just builds to infinity.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.760
 To me, it's not rational.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.680
 Like, I don't think my life is materially different than what you're doing.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.200
 But to me, it's like a measure of how like every morning if I'm able to do that,

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.840
 I feel like, okay, my life, I got a handle on my life.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.640
 Like, I'm at least doing this ritual every morning.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.840
 I'm on top of this thing.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.080
 Yeah.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.160
 And I don't, I don't have a handle on my life.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.880
 And I think part of the problem is, what I don't like about email is it's,

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.200
 I can't control who sends me emails.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:31.520
 Okay.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.400
 Yeah.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.360
 So I get a lot of garbage and I'm bad about staying on top of it.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.640
 I don't, I'm subscribed.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.960
 I, every time I buy a new thing, I start getting their newsletter

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.560
 and I never unsubscribe.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.760
 So it's like my inbox is not a thing I can control.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.760
 I just, well, I gave up on controlling a long time ago.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.800
 And now it just feels like it'll never be recovered.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.120
 Okay.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.520
 So here is a thing that I've wanted to build forever and never have.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.880
 So if you're out there, you people are out there always talking about,

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.160
 here's my favorite tech stack.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.760
 Here's a chance to actually use it.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.720
 Hey, use it.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.200
 Yes.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.600
 Here's an idea for you.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.360
 I want you to integrate with Gmail.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.600
 So like connect my Gmail, every email that comes in,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.320
 move it out of my inbox, put it somewhere else.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.160
 At the end of every day, then meet one email

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.960
 with the list of all the new senders that sent me stuff.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:26.480
 Then I can approve, like, yes, I'm down to get emails from this person,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.720
 not down for this one, down for this one after this one.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.600
 I love this.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.160
 My inbox is only going to have stuff.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.120
 It's like a front request.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.120
 The first email you sent me is a friend request.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.320
 I accept this.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.160
 And then from then on, I get yourself to my inbox.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.040
 Otherwise it's just good.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:39.920
 It's just like DMs.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.640
 It's like, I want people to build the same email DM,

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.560
 if I don't know who they are, but I want to filter it.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.360
 I want to look through.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.120
 And that way, I'll never miss an important cold email from someone

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.560
 because they'll come through.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.520
 Yeah.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.080
 Other services have this built in, like hay.com,

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.840
 they call it the screener or whatever.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.040
 Yeah, whitelisting, exactly.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.000
 It's a whitelisting app.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.680
 It's built into hay.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.560
 It's like a screener.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.000
 It works this way.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:02.800
 But I don't want to switch.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.600
 Has that built in?

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.280
 Yeah, I don't want to switch to a different email.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.920
 I think you can build this on top of Gmail where you just,

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.720
 if you get an email from someone that I haven't seen before,

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.240
 don't put it in my inbox.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.760
 People that are whitelisted, let it go through.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.280
 Is that simple?

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.160
 I love it.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.800
 I love it.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.560
 It seems like it should exist.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:18.800
 Yeah.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.720
 Because a lot of people use Gmail.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.080
 I will build it and I'll build it.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.120
 Someone else build it.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.240
 I will pay for it.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.680
 You have one user right here.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.240
 Oh, for sure.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.360
 Two users right here.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:27.920
 Right here.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.560
 Two users.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.240
 We'll sign up for the podcast account.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.040
 It can have one too.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:31.600
 There's three.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:31.840
 Yeah.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.560
 People always, yeah.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.960
 So if people are saying, can you do this with filters

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.600
 and views in Gmail?

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.320
 I have tried using all the features in Gmail,

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.160
 like using the important thing, all that stuff.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.960
 I don't want something like machine learning AI-based.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.240
 I just want an explicit whitelist.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.240
 Nothing is really going to be that.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.960
 Like you said, every other platform, DMs work that way.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.760
 Yeah.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.200
 Who's going to do it?

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.240
 Someone do it.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.760
 The Gmail stars and important, all of that stuff.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.280
 I don't use that either.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.360
 I used to have a big list of star emails

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.880
 and then I realized I never went back and looked at it.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.080
 It's like bookmarks on Twitter.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.240
 It was like, I never looked at it again.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.920
 Yeah.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.360
 So that would just fix email, I think, for a lot of people.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:11.760
 I think so.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.200
 There you go.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:13.520
 Yeah.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.240
 I tried to get adam@hay.com when that wasn't available.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.040
 I was out on hay.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.880
 Just signed up.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.840
 Got it really fast.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.080
 Was Adam tailwind Adam?

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.560
 Got it.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.280
 I don't think so.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:23.600
 Maybe.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.960
 I don't know.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.720
 Great question, actually.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.040
 If we have to rank all the atoms on tech Twitter,

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.080
 like, what's your ranking?

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:30.240
 Aww.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.240
 I'm last.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.080
 Well, I don't know.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.480
 There might be other atoms I don't know about on tech Twitter.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.680
 There are other atoms.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.640
 But, like, obviously, Wath and his number one.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.880
 Rakis is two.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.840
 You think he's out of you?

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.280
 Oh, for sure.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.960
 He's been around a long time, right?

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.400
 He's like, he's a guy.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.440
 You're calling him old?

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:49.680
 No.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.400
 I'm just saying, like, Rakis has me on seniority by a lot.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.400
 And just on interesting tweets.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.280
 I don't tweet anymore.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.200
 So, like, I can't be a figure on tech Twitter if I'm not on Twitter.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.120
 Your ranking is going down by your peak.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.560
 I think you were number three, maybe.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.400
 Yeah, probably.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.920
 I can't think of another prominent atom.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.920
 There probably are some, and I'm just forgetting.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.520
 But I'll take number three.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.560
 Hey, I'm on the podium.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:12.880
 Yeah.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.160
 That's that meme.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.480
 It's that meme with a guy by in the metal.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:16.720
 Yeah.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.440
 That's strange, though.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:25.200
 Turk just asked if you got me on blue sky.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.160
 Remember blue sky?

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:26.800
 That was fun.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.360
 Blue ski?

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.640
 Blue ski?

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.920
 Blue ski and threads.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.200
 How's blue ski doing?

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.560
 Actually, I saw an email that I was accepted to do it.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.520
 I tried that too.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.880
 What was up with that?

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.600
 I don't know.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.200
 I've been on there for months.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.120
 Yeah, I got the same email address.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:41.440
 Yeah.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.280
 I hadn't checked blue sky forever, but it was just threads.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.160
 Anybody use threads?

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.280
 I just opened threads.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.440
 And I'm curious to see who's posting on it.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.240
 So, I see, hang on.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.440
 They did add a way to see only your following.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.640
 But it's like, I always like, I'll get to the home button twice.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.720
 And you go to following.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.760
 There we go.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.120
 Hit the home button twice.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.800
 That's not very obvious.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.160
 Or something like that.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.120
 It's just not obvious.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.560
 So, Jason is still posting on there.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.040
 Wait, did I have a stroke yesterday?

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.160
 Jason.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.360
 Jason.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.480
 Jason, like sort?

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.440
 Oh, yeah, okay.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.200
 I just didn't know you knew Jason.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.480
 Are you and Jason?

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.920
 Are you close to Jason?

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.520
 Not really, but we've interacted.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.320
 Okay, you've interacted.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.400
 Hey, there's a new next chance comp coming.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.120
 Yeah.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.000
 That's what you missed.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.440
 Yes, you're while you were dying.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.800
 That's what I was like.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.920
 That's what we started.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.600
 This first episode of this podcast was next year's comp recap.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.000
 Wouldn't it?

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 I think so.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.800
 Yeah, it was definitely clear.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.200
 I remember we did that terrible stream together,

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:49.280
 where you kept putting the overlay on top of the place.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:49.840
 It was bad.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.560
 Yeah, it was really bad.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.200
 Yeah, next year's comp 2022 recap.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:53.920
 Look at that.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.400
 Wow, that feels like forever ago.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.760
 It does feel like forever ago.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.120
 That was like in the zero interest days.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.400
 Because remember that crazy...

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:02.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.720
 Remember how like insane that party was?

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.560
 Or like just seemed to seem like everybody.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.320
 Everybody was there.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.320
 Yeah, no, that was October 22nd or 27th.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.360
 So they're having next year's comp win,

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.720
 October 26th, one year later.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.120
 That's probably one year to the day.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:21.920
 Knowing Guillermo.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.280
 Yeah, it was like, yeah.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.240
 I got to say, the past two weeks, Guillermo

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.000
 has gotten a lot better at Twitter.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:28.400
 Yes.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:28.800
 Oh, yeah?

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.760
 I got to give him to him.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.520
 I didn't think he was bad at Twitter, I guess.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.720
 No, there was a few phases.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.840
 The first phase was him just getting really aggro and upset.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.360
 And like, it was just weird.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:37.920
 Yeah.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:38.880
 Because he's like...

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.560
 I think at that point,

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.200
 they didn't realize that they were like the incumbent now.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.800
 They were kind of still acting like the underdog,

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.240
 but they're bigger than everyone.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.360
 Yeah.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.760
 Then there was a phase where he was just posting like

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.840
 deep founder, deep founder insights.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.360
 But they were like, just not very good.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.160
 It was just like really basic trivial things.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.720
 In the past two weeks, I'm like, oh, run out of money.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.480
 It's like, ship fast.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.720
 It's important to ship fast.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.680
 You know how to ship like that.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.920
 But in the last two weeks,

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.000
 I have liked a lot of his tweets.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.560
 Like they've been funny, a lot of them have been funny.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.320
 I feel like, oh, okay.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.240
 Like, I think he's learning to be himself.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.520
 And he actually has a personality.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.600
 Because prior to that, I was like, he's just some kind of robot.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.000
 Yeah.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.680
 He seems very like ascended.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.520
 Like he seems like a better human than me.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.200
 And I don't mean that condescendingly.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.720
 Just like, I couldn't be as good as Guillermo at life.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.160
 Like he's just seems very particular and regimented.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.200
 Yeah, no, he definitely is.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.800
 But you know, it's good to see he's got a persona.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.120
 Yeah, I got to check out Twitter and see his personality.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:43.840
 That sounds fun.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.440
 Yeah, because they launched that V zero thing.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.320
 Have you seen that?

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.760
 Oh, yeah, I did see that.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.960
 I mean, I haven't played with it really.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.760
 Is it good?

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.880
 No, we're all on the wait list.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.760
 We're all pretending like we got in, but we're on the wait list.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.960
 Oh, I think I am on the wait list.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.600
 That's what it was.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.640
 I thought I was going to play with it.

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.080
 And then I had to get on the wait list.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.000
 Yeah, I'm sure I could DM someone.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.520
 But I don't want to come off desperate, you know?

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.600
 I don't really care.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.560
 Just give me that one every one.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.040
 No big deal.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:07.520
 No big deal.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.240
 Just like, yeah.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.560
 Yeah, but people are playing with it.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.680
 So what do you have like a sense of like you saw it?

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.200
 Does it feel relevant to you?

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.120
 Does it feel like the step in the right way?

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.000
 I mean, I guess like if AI could help me

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.360
 never have to like write a form from scratch,

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.120
 I feel like you're good at front end.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:33.600
 Like you're actually good at like you can whip up front ends

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.120
 without just wanting to end up in a hospital.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:41.760
 But like every time I have to do something on the front end,

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.520
 I just swear I'm never doing it again.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.280
 Like actually like making a form that does stuff

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.800
 and validation and busy states and all that stuff.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.440
 I hate it.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.440
 I feel like you've gotten like a groove

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.240
 and I feel like your console, the code looks really nice.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:56.880
 You know what you're doing.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.720
 I don't feel like I know what I'm doing.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.640
 So if it could help me do that, then yeah, I'm in.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.160
 Yeah, I think there's like a somewhat popular stack

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.040
 they're optimizing for like React and actually I just tailwind

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:07.920
 like a bunch of those things.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.880
 So I can see how if you're using that setup.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.560
 Oh, and also the shad's the end stuff, like it's component library.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.120
 Yeah, so the thing I've been thinking about,

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:22.160
 and I think a lot of this AI stuff has really made me understand this,

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.440
 which is how much aesthetics are like relative to their scarcity.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.480
 So there's been like so many phases of this, right?

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.640
 Do you remember when like Bootstrap first came out?

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.160
 Like Twitter Bootstrap.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:34.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.280
 The day it came out, it looked insanely good.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.720
 Like so good, so modern.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.800
 And it got really popular.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.640
 And at some point you look, you started looking at Bootstrap

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.920
 so they started looking terrible.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.680
 They looked exactly the same as they looked.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.080
 Yeah.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.080
 Two years ago, but they just started looking bad.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.600
 Even though that they looked fantastic, they came out.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.480
 Yep, they came out mid journey, right?

00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.160
 All those like crazy mid journey images that are like super realistic and stuff.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.400
 I initially was like, wow, it's all looks good.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.400
 It's definitely for me gone to a point where I'm like,

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.720
 these look really like cheesy now or like kind of corny.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.600
 A lot of these images.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.480
 Yeah, I don't know what you mean.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:12.000
 So it's like, it's so clear to me that everything,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.520
 no matter how good it is in the moment,

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.600
 just hard to look terrible when it becomes like extremely available to everyone.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.080
 So when I see this stuff in V zero, I'm like,

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.640
 okay, Shatsun is still new.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.600
 And it looks really good.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.280
 Interesting.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.040
 But now I'm seeing all these designs and I'm like,

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.600
 okay, now it has this like underlying air of like being generated or like,

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.040
 what I just, it just does look cliche.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:41.040
 And I think the thing with design is it is a way to signal high effort.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:46.080
 And I think once that kind of goes away, you kind of lose that part of it.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.600
 Yeah, no, that's a great point.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.120
 Like you're not actually putting in the effort and the truth will eventually find you.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.400
 And people aren't even, people aren't even,

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.360
 might not even be aware of it.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.160
 But subconsciously, I think that really is is the key,

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.320
 the reasonest spend effort on design.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:04.320
 It makes sense that like aesthetic things like you think of clothing like style with clothes.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.200
 You think of like home decor, like all that stuff is so like,

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.960
 it's fast moving.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.920
 It's cyclical.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.200
 It's the thing that looks good today will not look good in 10 years.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.160
 And you can kind of bank on it.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.320
 So it makes sense that there's something about aesthetics that don't stay.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:25.120
 There's not just a best is it's always sort of like in the context of the current setting.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:25.600
 Yeah.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.080
 Yeah, like the like the like the linear homepage.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.440
 Like when that came out, that was amazing.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.000
 But not everyone has that like dark thing with the,

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.040
 with the window that pops up like this and like unblurs.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:35.360
 Yeah.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.280
 Everyone has that now and it just starts to look a little bit weird.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.320
 The other thing though is on the flip side, there are things that are timeless.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.920
 I mean, I just realized that when you said like home furniture,

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.720
 I think there is like an underlying thing of like there's certain things that are just

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.080
 always going to look really good.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.400
 Like the freaking Eames chair that everybody has.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.640
 I bet you had that.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.400
 Do you know anybody that has one?

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.360
 No, I'd like to go and Casey would not let me spend $5,000 on a chair.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.960
 Yeah, but like everyone just gets replicas.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.000
 Like no one gets.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.880
 Oh, really?

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.080
 Who do you know that has one?

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.400
 Because he said everyone, I've never seen one in the flesh.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.680
 Just like in movies and stuff.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.800
 Have you ever sat in one?

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.600
 I never sat in one.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.320
 Yeah, a bunch of time.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:14.480
 Okay.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.600
 So here's a crazy thing.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.080
 We have this is the most random thing.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:21.600
 One time we were like rerouted through like some airport in Texas,

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.320
 because we got like our flights got massive or whatever.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:28.960
 The lounge there had like a stupid amount of Eames chairs like what?

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.440
 And they were like scattered.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.640
 Like people have moved them around.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.640
 They were kind of just like scattered all over the place.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.080
 And they're clearly replicas.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.880
 Like very few people really get like a legit room.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.240
 The real one, the real one.

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:44.720
 Yeah, but it's like for that replica is still like,

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.920
 you know, a thousand plus dollars.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.480
 So it's still like a very high quality piece of furniture.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:48.880
 Yeah.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.400
 And yeah, it's not it just looks good.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.000
 It looks good and it's always going to look good.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.360
 No, it's a good looking chair.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.080
 Yeah.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.000
 I'm definitely considered it at times.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.040
 Just put one in my corner.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.680
 I'm off. I just say, I feel like you would definitely have one.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.520
 That seems as heavy as you would have.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.080
 Things that people spend money on just for the sake of it.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.520
 Yeah, no, but I was saying it's like a timeless piece of whatever.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.480
 Yeah, no, that's a good point.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.640
 So what is the equivalent of that in the digital world?

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.600
 I don't know if there is.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.000
 Like I'm wondering if it is there.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.200
 Digital could be different.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.200
 It might be something really unexpected.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.440
 Like it might be like Craigslist or like Reddit.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:23.200
 What about like Apple day?

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.720
 I mean, they haven't really changed their design aesthetic.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.640
 Well, they used to be crazy skeu morphic, remember?

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.240
 Oh, well, yeah, like so in their apps.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.040
 I'm just thinking like the Apple digital like web properties.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.000
 Like the white background, like they're kind of always

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.280
 they've been like this for a long time.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.880
 Yeah, yeah, I think they're stuff is pretty simple.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.920
 Bordering on timeless.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.880
 The skeu morphism one of those is interesting

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.320
 because I remember at the time,

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.040
 I was really into like getting better design

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.920
 and like nothing looked worse than something more fit.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.480
 Yeah.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.200
 And then someone posted a bunch of pictures recently and I was like,

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.520
 oh man, that looks kind of good.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.040
 Yeah, where are we at on that?

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.320
 Because I feel like it's cyclical.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.240
 People are like skeu morphisms, the worst.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.080
 And then they're like, oh, it's actually kind of nice.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:04.960
 Where are we at on that side?

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.320
 Yeah, like I'm feeling it.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.360
 I'm feeling it come back.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.320
 So I'm looking at it.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.920
 I'm like, okay, I know what's happening, but I can't help it.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.080
 Like it just looks, it looks good to me.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:14.880
 There's something nice.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.520
 Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.280
 Like the, if an Apple icon has like a nice like felt look to it.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.240
 I'm like, yeah, the old textures.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.480
 I remember just like looking through so many textures making websites at one point,

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.960
 just like the whole background be like that little like,

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.720
 you go like almost feel it just by looking at it.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:37.680
 Can I shift gears like a lot?

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:37.920
 Yes.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:43.760
 Just I can't not say something, which I don't want to, I don't want to be negative.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.960
 But if you ever played with Svelte.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.800
 No, but they're doing their big announcement.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.760
 Well, yes, I have played with it.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.040
 And they're doing their big announcement today.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.200
 What's their big announcement today?

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:51.920
 Nobody knows.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.640
 Oh, for real? What timing?

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.760
 Exciting announcement.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.840
 So tell us your take on Svelte.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.080
 Just for them to like, yeah, make it irrelevant.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.920
 Well, look, I mean, this week is the first I've played with Svelte.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.720
 So I have literally like days of experience with Svelte.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.720
 So you can just ignore everything I say.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:08.960
 Okay.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.600
 And I know people are really passionate about Svelte.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:15.760
 So like, as soon as I say anything negative, I'm going to get attacked.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.400
 But this is just a little thing.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.880
 I just feel like I'm getting hit in the head with transitions and animations

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.000
 everywhere I turn in the docs.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.960
 Svelte, it's good at animation.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.680
 Motion, transitions.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:33.840
 This is constantly, I'm like trying to learn how to do basic state stuff.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.640
 And it's like, oh, did you know you can use this animation thing?

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.120
 It's pretty cool.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.840
 Like the advanced felt go to the docs.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.480
 Advanced felt the first like three sections are about animation.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.600
 I'm not even kidding you.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.560
 Yeah, apparently.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:48.720
 That's funny, but I was going to say there's an explanation for that.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.520
 Like, do you remember those crazy things that the team would build?

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.320
 The visualizations.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.520
 Yeah, like those articles were insanely, yeah, insanely impressive.

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.160
 So I get why that there's an obsession with that.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.840
 Yes, Scott.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.560
 Now I was going to say I think to think today is they're making it more like solid.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.960
 And they're adding like signals and stuff.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:05.600
 Yeah.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:06.640
 Okay, cool.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:14.080
 So the reason I used Svelte is so we're rebuilding this huge site that's like

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.520
 very page driven.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.520
 Just lots of it's very multi page.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.760
 Okay, I don't care if multi pages and a thing.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.720
 It's very multi page.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.320
 So there's just lots of pages, very little interactivity.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.240
 But the bits of interactivity that there are,

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.800
 it feels real bad just writing vanilla JS.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.760
 Like that's what we started doing and we've still got a lot of it.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:36.160
 But at some point it starts to feel like, man, it'd be really nice to use

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.120
 a little more modern front-endy JavaScript stuff here.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.080
 And I felt like Svelte, Svelte.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:50.000
 I felt like it spiritually aligns with our like just progressively enhancing little bits

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.800
 of the page because it's compiled, right?

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.320
 There's no runtime, I think.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:54.480
 Yeah.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:59.520
 It just seems like to me, if I like throw solid in there or worst or react in there,

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.800
 it just feels like such overkill for like an avatar menu.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.760
 Like I don't feel like we need this very big runtime framework.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:08.160
 Yeah.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.600
 But then I don't, I don't actually know how much I'm gaining using

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.560
 something like Svelte versus solid in terms of bundle sizes, in terms of

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.920
 this spiritual alignment that I feel.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.880
 Do you think Svelte is a good use case for that or is it no?

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.640
 Like just you felt if you're using Svelte kit and it's not a sprinkle in kind of thing.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:24.880
 Yeah.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:29.200
 I think with these frameworks, you should just go with the API that you feel

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.560
 makes sense to you.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:35.600
 So because the reason I say that is if you look at, so yes, Svelte,

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.040
 they like the premise of Svelte is a compiler can figure out

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:43.120
 all the when this happens to do this other thing at real time.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:47.360
 So that there's no, there's no, there's no like reactive runtime that needs to exist.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:53.360
 But at a certain size, you end up duplicating a lot of stuff where a

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.280
 reactive runtime would actually end up being smaller.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:00.240
 So it's kind of like, yeah, both of these, I mean, realistically,

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:04.000
 the comparisons between Svelte and Svelte, I think the other ones are not really relevant.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:09.920
 Guys for the type of thing, like they're both written by such like good authors.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.480
 Like they're both like so optimized and so excellent that I feel like

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.440
 from that angle, like you're not going to go wrong.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.480
 So it just comes down to like which model clicks for you better.

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.640
 So I will say getting into Svelte, it feels so foreign to me.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:29.200
 Having come from like a react background, I feel like solid would feel much more natural,

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.360
 just like to write a solid component.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.800
 Is there something about, so I keep saying progressive enhancement.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.480
 Is that even a thing anyone should care about?

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.800
 Should I just forget about caring about that?

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:43.840
 Like we have some very simple like forms on the page.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.800
 And right now we're just posting, like it just really,

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.600
 because it's not even like staying on that page when you post.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.920
 So for like off flows, it's going to end up redirecting.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:52.400
 Yeah.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.840
 I don't care if it's just a form and it has a post action and whatever.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.840
 But then if I want to sprinkle in like some validation and I want to come in and say,

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.560
 well, which JavaScript I can make this experience a little better,

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.480
 is that like a thing that I should actually care about?

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.640
 Or should I just make the form in JavaScript prevent default and just like do the thing

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.320
 on click or on submit?

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:16.000
 Like do you have opinions on progressive enhancement as a concept?

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:16.240
 Yeah.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.880
 I think I tend to go to kind of what you said.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.400
 I tend to go to both extremes.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.080
 So it's actually the exact same situation.

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.000
 So we're using the same off thing.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.560
 For the login form or the console, it's just a form post and a post,

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:31.440
 some release and redirects.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:33.200
 I don't even bother doing any JavaScript stuff.

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.160
 I did throw in some validation in there, but it's not.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.480
 It's just the HTML like input attributes.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.800
 Yeah, that's what I use like the email, the built in.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.840
 Yeah, exactly.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.520
 So I'm like, that's good enough for this.

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:50.080
 And then because I'm just using like barebone solid,

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:54.720
 I don't have like a really solid framework to do real progressive enhancement.

00:46:54.720 --> 00:47:00.320
 But there's like a nice unified API, nice form component that like can switch between both modes.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.160
 So I just go to the other extreme where I'm just like,

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.600
 I still use like form data and I try to like use all the native stuff.

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.400
 Yeah.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.480
 But realistically, it's not going to work.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.680
 JavaScript interaction.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.880
 Yeah, it's going to be JavaScript.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.120
 So I think for me, that's fine.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.800
 Part of me does wish that I had some of those things in there.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.040
 But I don't think it's rational.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.320
 I think it's just like, I just know that I'm technically doing something wrong.

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.360
 So I feel bad about it, but it's not really going to make a difference for anyone.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:25.840
 Exactly.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.600
 Everyone's got JavaScript running.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.240
 I don't know.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.840
 That's safe to say, right?

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:37.040
 Well, the argument is that until your JavaScript loads, everyone is a no JavaScript user.

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:42.880
 So again, for us behind like a B2B app behind the login,

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.560
 like we don't really have to worry about that.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:47.520
 Like nothing is going to work until the JavaScript loads.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.360
 So there's no progressiveness there to begin with.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:56.000
 But yeah, for you guys, like let's say there's like a button and it takes five seconds to become

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:56.560
 interactive.

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.280
 Like how?

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:58.640
 I gotcha.

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.440
 But then again, you're using Astro.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:07.280
 So yeah, I guess, yeah, I guess it still won't work until the JavaScript loads.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.880
 That might matter for you.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:13.440
 No, yeah, I'm just thinking like what's so you were talking about like the avatar menu.

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.400
 So like when you're logged in, you hit the button and then like some kind of drop down.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.400
 Well, that's like more of a good CSS thing, isn't it?

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.960
 I mean, yeah, you could do it like with checkbox and CSS states.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:30.080
 It's just that there are some benefits, I think, to dipping into JavaScript for accessibility.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.640
 It's just like, I don't want to build all that by hand.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.040
 And there's like vanilla JavaScript turns out there's not vanilla JavaScript component libraries.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.640
 There's not vanilla JavaScript anything.

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.280
 Yeah.

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:42.640
 It everything assumes you're using a framework or like even a meta framework.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.120
 Yeah.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.240
 So it's very difficult to find like, I just need good.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.360
 Like I want Radix.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.680
 I want it for vanilla JavaScript so bad.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.560
 I just want to build like maybe that's dumb though.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.160
 Maybe I feel like the infatuation with vanilla JavaScript is maybe my problem.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:00.560
 I should just like forget that and say, but if you saw our use case, I feel like our use case,

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:06.160
 we really don't need a client side like full framework because we just do so little.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.360
 There's literally like three little things on the page that have any JavaScript involved.

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:09.840
 Yeah.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:14.880
 I do think you might be a little biased in that your framework experiences react,

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:18.720
 which is very heavy because I think both with solid and spelt.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:23.520
 I find the framework kind of disappears like with solid oftentimes I'm just like

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:28.640
 document query selector things and like doing like very vanilla JavaScript.

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:31.280
 The only part time I dip into solid is for the templating.

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:36.160
 So I might want to use JSX and for like, okay, if I do need some reactive state,

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.600
 which again, oftentimes like the stages lives in the DOM.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.520
 So I don't really need to do that.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:48.640
 Like I built like combo boxes or like our command bar, very little solid involved.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:53.040
 Like the solid builds, I use the JSX part to build a template, but then from there,

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.720
 like moving stuff around, I'm just querying the DOM and like activating things and adding

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.280
 attributes and stuff that we used to do in jQuery.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:06.160
 It is an Astro makes it so easy to just like load a component from one of these client libraries,

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.200
 hydrate it like that experience with Astro is really great.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.600
 Yeah, so I think you should use one and you shouldn't feel too bad because it's not,

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.320
 like I said, both these options are like so optimized.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:19.600
 I don't think that it's really going to create any kind of burden.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.160
 So let me throw another very esoteric, I don't know.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.880
 I forgot we're on a podcast here, but now I'm just asking you questions.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:30.320
 But I was talking with an engineer on my team yesterday about the situation where we're

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:36.320
 on the client, where we need to fetch session information to do some stuff with it on the client.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:39.120
 But there's like multiple components now that need that.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.200
 Well, there's just two, but there's two components that need it.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.800
 And it's like, whoa, global state in an app without like a framework.

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.600
 What do you do?

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:52.960
 Yeah, no, that's, I mean, that's, I think the limitations of at least Astro as it existed

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.960
 until this new stuff.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.000
 Oh, wait, in the new stuff.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:56.640
 What do I do?

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.280
 Is there something I'm not thinking about?

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:03.680
 Yeah, so if you, if you have global state on a single page, like they have the whole

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.560
 nano store thing, right? Oh, what is this?

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:07.840
 This sounds perfect.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:08.720
 Nano store.

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.800
 Thank you for saying those words.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.080
 There's a qualifier here though.

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:12.240
 Okay.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:16.960
 So nano store is how you, you can just create little pieces of shares tape between islands.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:17.840
 This is exactly what I need.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:18.320
 Yes.

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.680
 So that's what you, that's what you would do.

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.320
 Thank you.

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:25.840
 But if you're using solid, if solid is the component, the framework you choose for your

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.760
 components, it makes no sense.

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.200
 Use nano store because solid chips with their own primitives that work better.

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.720
 Like they have their own store concept.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.360
 But the same thing.

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:37.040
 But yeah, for, for, if you have these components, you need to sync data.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.320
 Yeah, the nano source thing is.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.200
 This is awesome.

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.520
 How do I stay on top of all the cool stuff?

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.840
 I just found that from the Ashrow docs.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.880
 Like when you were looking in the Ashrow docs just for funsies?

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.520
 No, I built, I built something with Ashrow like our.

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.040
 Oh, okay.

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.000
 I forget.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.040
 This is, this is a while ago.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:53.200
 Okay.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.400
 I don't know if you reached for Ashrow.

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.320
 I thought you were never going to be a multi-pager.

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.960
 No, because we, we have our little small business, right?

00:51:58.960 --> 00:51:59.680
 Please.

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.640
 Oh, that's right.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:00.880
 Okay.

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:01.440
 I'm sorry.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.240
 I'm blanking.

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.440
 I, I knew this.

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:03.920
 I knew this.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.240
 Yeah.

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:09.360
 So we had the, some, something similar where like, like a cart, like the cart status of

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.720
 your cart, the state of the cart needs to be visible in multiple components.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.720
 We just threw that in there.

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:18.080
 But the issue is when you navigate, that gets blown away.

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.400
 Because it's a full page refresh.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.600
 So, yeah.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:25.520
 So we could store it in local storage or, like, we could like, yeah.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.880
 Or you can use Ashrow's like new SPA type stuff, but.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.880
 So how, yeah. So we played with the view transition stuff.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.840
 That's where you're talking about, right?

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:38.400
 There's view transitions, but there's also, like, SPA mode, where, like, now getting

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.800
 the 22 pages doesn't do a page refresh.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.680
 What?

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.800
 How am I not?

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:47.760
 I feel like I'm an Astro power user, and I don't know half the things you can do.

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.360
 Astro, what'd you say?

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.120
 What are the words that you said?

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:51.680
 I don't know what they call it.

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:52.640
 I mean, just bomb mode.

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.200
 Did you go check the blog post for 3.0?

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:58.880
 If you just read that, it has, like, it mentions all of these things.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.800
 Yeah, I'll do that.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.520
 Yeah.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.320
 Huh.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:05.360
 Sorry, when I said I'll do that, I literally started doing that.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.280
 I should probably not do that right now.

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:10.080
 We do need to get off to some point.

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:10.720
 Just hear free.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.040
 Yeah.

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:16.480
 But yeah, again, like, I don't, that stuff is kind of, like,

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.880
 got too complicated for me to, like, stay on top of, like,

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.800
 the 3.0 is a lot of cool stuff in there.

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.400
 But I'm just like, this is a lot.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.560
 Like, I don't think I can digest this right now.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.720
 You're going to stick with your, your spas.

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:30.080
 My spas, and then I'm still really liking the direction

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.120
 solid start is going.

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:35.920
 It's taking a while before it's going to, like, really come out and impact the industry.

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:41.840
 But what I love about it is you have these two extremes on the team, right?

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:47.920
 You have Ryan, who is very, you know, the classic, like, framework creator,

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.960
 like super into, like, all these little micro things.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:57.680
 And you have Dave, who, uh, he is, like, the perfect person to build the last mile.

00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.280
 Like, he has a consulting company.

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:03.760
 He does real projects for real clients, really focus on enterprise things,

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:06.160
 like really tries to get all the things that you need.

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.520
 Like, he has a clear vision, all the things that you need to have.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:13.440
 Some of this actually go big beyond just, like, a little bubble.

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:19.120
 So there's like this great balancing force of the two of them where Ryan likes that

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.000
 because Dave does all the work that Ryan is not interested in.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.480
 But yeah, I'm like, again, it's an uphill battle and there's a lot of things in the way.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:32.640
 But when I see that team, I'm like, oh, that actually reflects what I,

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.680
 if I, if I could, like, create a team that, like, is building in front of a family,

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:36.880
 that's, like, what they would look like.

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:37.600
 That's what they would look like.

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.000
 Yeah.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 Because some of these other teams, like, they're all, like,

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.960
 obviously impressive people across the board and all these places.

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:48.000
 But, uh, I definitely am missing that, like,

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:53.680
 oh, as boring as it sounds, like, building for enterprise, enterprise-type use keys.

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:53.680
 Yeah.

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.160
 So that's kind of--

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:54.800
 Got context.

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.160
 Yeah.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.360
 Forming the decision-making.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.080
 Yeah.

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.320
 I have more questions now about Solid Start.

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:00.560
 Yeah.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.600
 I'm a little out of the loop.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.440
 You know what I mean?

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.400
 No one else will know what I mean.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.920
 It's fine.

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.720
 I'm a little out of the loop.

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:14.080
 Uh, is Solid Start still doing anything with Astro or is Tanner doing anything with Astro?

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:14.720
 What's that story?

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:19.920
 Okay, so, uh, there was-- the history of Solid Start was they built it on feet.

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:24.480
 Then they were, like, we're wasting so much time with, like, adapters for, like,

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.160
 Vercel and SST and Netlify and, like, why are we doing that work?

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.400
 Let's just try to build on top of someone else.

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.560
 So initially, they were exploring doing it on top of Astro.

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:37.600
 They did get a prototype working, um, but then they chose to go with Nitro,

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.000
 which is the-- from the next community.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:40.640
 I'm sorry, what?

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:41.200
 You know what I mean?

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:41.520
 Nitro?

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:46.960
 Nitro, no, the world is just, like, like, layers on top of layers on top of layers,

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.640
 but I imagine that's probably what it felt like.

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.000
 Yeah, but similarly, like, is it similarly on top of feet?

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.680
 Yeah, so, V is the core.

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:58.400
 The Nitro adds a bunch of useful things on top of V, like, all the adapters,

00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.760
 deploy different places.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:04.000
 They also have, like, like, the storage engine to, like, store data and cache stuff.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.160
 So, kind of, like, the bare things that a lot of these frameworks do have in common.

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:13.280
 And it allows Solid Start to go back to being more of, like,

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.160
 a minimal thing than a meta framework.

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.720
 It's just, like, a thing that sits on top of Nitro.

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:22.160
 So, next three is also built on top of Nitro.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.000
 Next is the view thing.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:24.800
 The view version.

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.880
 The view meta framework does have a Nitro.

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:30.560
 So, they built it for Tanner is still doing his thing,

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.280
 his React-based meta framework on top of--

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:33.680
 Bling?

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.080
 Is it called Bling?

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.600
 Like, something else entirely.

00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.560
 Oh!

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.720
 Bling is just a way to, like, statically extract some stuff.

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:43.680
 So, it's an actual project that's, like, still has a future?

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.440
 Bling should be invisible to anyone.

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.960
 Like, no one really should really know what that is.

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.000
 Okay.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.640
 It should just show up in places that you don't really know is powered by.

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:56.000
 So, he's doing his own thing, which is going to be a combination of React,

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.160
 a React meta framework on top of Nitro.

00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:58.720
 Okay.

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:03.520
 So, I'm excited about this because, again, then we can just support Nitro really,

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.560
 really well, and then we support both Nux and Solid.

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:10.400
 I'm still waiting for someone to do a--

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.440
 I mean, it might be Tanner.

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.600
 I don't know how much he's going to do the RSC stuff,

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:18.400
 but I'm waiting for someone to do, like, a V-based React meta framework.

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:23.040
 So, Remix is also doing an RSC thing.

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.400
 And I actually-- I'm really excited for their take.

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.440
 Ryan Florence explained to me, like,

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:33.920
 it's actually-- he's, like, the way it's positioned now is--

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.680
 it's really a replacement for Express, but it can do, like, the front-end stuff

00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.360
 really, really well.

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.440
 And I kind of like that thinking, like, it's--

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:41.840
 Yeah.

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:42.880
 That makes a lot of sense.

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.000
 Like, a lot of people use Express.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.080
 Like, there's no reason not to use this in the same way.

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:50.000
 And you just get, like, a much better front-end experience.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.560
 But they're not-- they're, like, going the other way of, like,

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:56.000
 trying to make it really, really low-tooling.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.120
 So, they're, like, just--

00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:58.720
 they're not even requiring a bundler anymore.

00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:02.000
 Like, you can just do raw Remix code, and you don't even need to bundle it.

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.840
 You can't use a bundler.

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:06.800
 But so, they're not building on top of V or anything like that.

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:07.680
 They're going the other way.

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.840
 But you want to see-- you want to see a react

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.920
 meta framework built on top of V.

00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:13.920
 It's not too late for next, right?

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.400
 Let's just--

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.600
 No, it is too late for next.

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.240
 They're making it good.

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.200
 It's just a band-- no.

00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.760
 Just a band and all the way back stuff, the turbo pack stuff.

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.920
 Just breaking change for everyone.

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:25.200
 Oh, they're so big, man.

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:25.920
 Like--

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.480
 They are.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.160
 They're always going to be so big.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.440
 Yeah, I think so.

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.640
 Like, that size of--

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.920
 Just when you achieve default status,

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.520
 well, you're the default for something.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.280
 It's just impossible to compete with.

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.720
 It's, like, so annoying for everyone.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.400
 I'll think about how annoying it is for Remix.

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:43.920
 Like, they can do everything 10 times better, it will not.

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:45.680
 Just so hard to displace them.

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:46.880
 Yeah, and I didn't even mean that, like,

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.320
 Vercel was doing anything wrong.

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:51.680
 I just wondered, like, from the zero interest rate phenomenon standpoint,

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:55.600
 like, will all organizations get smaller, or is this sustainable?

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:56.400
 Maybe it's fine.

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.120
 I mean, in terms of--

00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.880
 Well, when I say big, I spent terms of usage.

00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:00.320
 Oh, I was talking, like,

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:03.840
 how big of an organization, and just how big the production is,

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.960
 and how big everything.

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.840
 Yeah, I don't know about that.

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.200
 I think that can probably shrink.

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.800
 But, yeah, usage-wise, it's just like, look at the numbers.

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.640
 It's like, they're still growing.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.360
 What numbers?

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.320
 What numbers do you--

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:15.840
 We always look at MPM trends,

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.680
 which is the delos per week.

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.680
 So next year, specifically, you're talking?

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:22.240
 Yeah, it's like, every chart of front-end frameworks

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.400
 doesn't include Next.js, because then it just--

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.960
 Because everyone's like, one single one at the bottom.

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.040
 And then on top of that, like,

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.800
 Vercel, you can deploy AstroSight.

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.600
 You can deploy all these other frameworks.

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.960
 You can deploy to Vercel.

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.480
 I wonder, are there any numbers on that?

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:36.800
 Like--

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.200
 I think-- OK, so more-- and this is crazy,

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.200
 but I guess this is a crazy founder type of thing

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.560
 I finally have tapped into.

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.240
 I think we can beat Vercel in terms of number of deployments.

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.680
 Deploying stuff, yeah.

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:49.520
 I think it's a hard--

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.280
 it's very low probably succeeding,

00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.280
 but there is-- I do see a path to--

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:53.920
 There's a path.

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.880
 --having more Next.js deployments

00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.560
 outside of Vercel than inside Vercel.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.200
 I wouldn't be surprised if that wasn't already true,

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.840
 because all these big companies use Next.js,

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:04.400
 a lot of them do.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.480
 A lot of them don't deploy on Vercel.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.880
 They're probably deploying some kind of shitty container

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.760
 in their infrastructure.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.400
 Yeah.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.920
 So I don't know what the actual numbers are,

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:16.400
 but I think if we can get to parity on--

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.880
 we can get to parity on some of the quality of life things

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:24.080
 that Vercel has, we can beat them in other places

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.400
 that are kind of important.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.760
 Like, already on the performance side,

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.200
 like, it's weird.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.880
 I don't understand why this is the case,

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:35.200
 but OpenX deployment is faster than a standard Vercel

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.160
 in Next.js deployment.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.400
 And I don't understand why, but I did the benchmarks.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:38.880
 Yeah.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.160
 And it's significantly different.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:40.960
 So--

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.280
 Yeah, I feel like the enterprise angle too,

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.280
 like, I feel like people are much more likely

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.560
 to deploy into their own AWS account at certain scale

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.840
 than use Vercel.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.280
 So that's why I think already there

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.480
 might be more deployments out of Vercel than inside Vercel.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.120
 And yeah, we just don't have information on that data.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.880
 And then there's the other side of things where--

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.880
 it's just hard for them when they have to host everyone's sites,

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:05.120
 whereas, like, if you think about us,

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.240
 we technically get--

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.640
 for everyone that deploys Next.js site through us,

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.120
 we leverage AWS as free tier.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.480
 We're not paying for the fact that you're deploying through us.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.800
 If we want to implement, like,

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.920
 something that's kind of compute-intensive,

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.360
 that's fine.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.560
 They're just paying for it.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.160
 Each user opts into that feature.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.640
 We're not responsible for the cost across our whole--

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.640
 like, the warmer thing we built for Next.js,

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.720
 which a few people got upset about,

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.120
 Vercel could never implement a warmer,

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.680
 because they have to pay the cost for that.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.000
 But then, for us, it's different.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.080
 So I think we can beat them in some of those situations.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.840
 And mixing in--

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.360
 like, we are starting to steal a lot of people

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.520
 mixing other constructs with their Next.js,

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.000
 like, adding in a queue, adding a database, all these things.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.120
 So they're, like, the whole picture of app development.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.280
 Like, all the other things you need.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:53.840
 Yeah.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.840
 And, again, Vercel is adding those things.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:56.880
 They're adding a database.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.360
 Yeah.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.480
 But it's, like, it's a very different type of experience.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.120
 And, again, they're liable for the free tier

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.160
 on each one of those things.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:04.640
 So--

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.960
 I mean, startups build on AWS.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:07.920
 It's just what they do.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.880
 It feels weird to me to think that there's some world

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.240
 where they want, like, I just--

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.520
 if I were betting on things,

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.000
 I'm betting on startups continuing to build on AWS.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.520
 There's this overwhelming force you have to work against,

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:24.320
 which is every startup that, like, is somewhat competent

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.920
 has access to, like, $50,000 free, or whatever the--

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.240
 Yeah.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:28.800
 I forgot what--

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.760
 Activated or whatever.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.880
 All those things.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.080
 So your thing has to either be billable through AWS,

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.840
 or it has to be, like, so much better

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.800
 that you're willing to pay outside of it.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.840
 Which happens sometimes.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.080
 Like, I saw someone from Railway Tweet today that

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.480
 they had a customer that just turned down,

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.040
 like, thousands of dollars from Azure to deploy through them,

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.520
 which is, you know, good for them for pulling that off.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.120
 But also, it's Azure.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.800
 I would turn down millions of dollars from Azure as well.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.760
 But it's just hard to compete with that.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.320
 So that's why I'm, like, I'm not saying we're guaranteed,

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:06.240
 but I see a path that if we can make some of the infrastructure,

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.800
 like, 10 times better just by moving off of CloudFormation

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.920
 and then CDK and all that stuff that we were expecting to create.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.760
 You are moving off of it?

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.920
 Still planning?

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.880
 We probably will be the next big effort

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:21.440
 that if we're able to kick off another big effort

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.880
 the next couple of months, it'll probably be figuring out

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.040
 what our angle on that is, whether it's

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.080
 supporting a different deployment engine, what we currently have,

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.160
 whether it's, like, targeting a whole new market,

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.120
 with, like, a new product.

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.600
 Like, we don't know what it's going to be.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.000
 But if I think about just the next year as a user,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.600
 how good can I make that experience?

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.760
 It's that there's nothing to go 10x gap

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.800
 from where it is today to where it could be.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.800
 I think if we close that, you know, we could see a lot more usage.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.920
 Yeah, that's awesome.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.200
 I realize now we're at the point of the podcast

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.560
 where I'm trying to do other things.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.640
 So we should probably--

01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:00.320
 The things that I'm trying to do are for the podcast.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.560
 I just realized I didn't tweet out that we have new episodes.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.760
 I think I've missed, like, the last two.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.920
 You're going to fire me at some point.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.680
 You're going to find an actual--

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.600
 Well, I thought you were just going to die yesterday.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.920
 So I was like, OK, I guess I got to take it to my own.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:12.720
 Would you have carried on?

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.720
 If I died, would you have carried on with the podcast?

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.240
 Just, like, guests?

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.600
 Well, I would have definitely, like,

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.560
 tried to create a ton of attention using your desk.

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.200
 Oh, yeah.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.240
 You should.

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.360
 You're out of my permission.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:23.840
 Yeah.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.120
 I know you'd appreciate that.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.560
 A Farewell episode where you, like, become a memorial.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:28.960
 Yeah, yeah.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.320
 You know what a montage is.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.360
 I feel like, before 100 episodes,

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:34.640
 I feel like that'd be over the top.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.680
 Once we've got 100 episodes in, I feel like then--

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.440
 I mean, there's, like, a bond.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.400
 Not people know who you are.

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.880
 Like, outside of the podcast, like, you know,

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.920
 you've been around for a while.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.320
 So I think you've been around for a while.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.840
 I'm not as long as I'm Raka, so I'm better at it alone.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.520
 Yeah.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.800
 I was like, I have to find a new host or a new host.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:54.960
 Yeah.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.440
 Yeah.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.680
 Who, let's-- real quick, last thing.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.120
 Who would your new host be?

01:04:59.120 --> 01:04:59.840
 I don't know.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.560
 Another Adam?

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:00.880
 I think--

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.000
 Oh, here's a Raka?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:02.720
 You know what we would do?

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.760
 We would have, like, an American Idol-style competition

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.560
 to figure out.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.920
 Oh, yes.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.920
 The next host of tomorrow.fm.

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.520
 I love it.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.760
 Oh, man.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.080
 Yeah, I'm trying to think of who good candidates.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.600
 There's probably-- oh, no, I don't want to think about this,

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.280
 because there's probably people that would be way better at this.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.400
 Can you actually just die?

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.920
 Like, this sounds a good idea.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.120
 Hey, Robert.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.920
 Yesterday, there was a moment in the middle of the extreme pain

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.720
 where I was like, if I die, at least I won't hurt right now.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.520
 This--

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.000
 I know.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.040
 I would have done anything.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.440
 It, like, literally anything to get rid of that pain

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.080
 in that moment.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:36.640
 It was so bad.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.040
 Yeah.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.280
 Isn't it crazy to-- like, in that moment, you're probably like,

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.480
 oh, OK, I'm, like, learning.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.440
 This is how I die.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.880
 Like, I was curious about how I'm going to die.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.080
 And, like, this is how it's going to be.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.000
 Like, I didn't expect this, you know?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.120
 Yeah, no, that's a good point.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.720
 I guess I didn't have any thoughts like that.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.760
 OK, one next time.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.040
 I was sobbing.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.840
 I was, like, just literally uncontrollably sobbing

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.120
 in a chair in the hospital.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.480
 And I'm like, can I lay down?

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:57.520
 Someone give me a bed.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.280
 Aren't there beds in hospitals?

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.280
 Sucked.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:01.840
 Cry, baby.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.600
 And on that note, stop it.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.400
 I was a little like--

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.200
 I realized my boys, like, Casey had to drive me,

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.120
 which we should have gotten.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.480
 I should have just done the ambulance thing,

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:15.200
 because it took so long, and every time she accelerated,

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:15.760
 it was just like--

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.720
 Oh, no.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.840
 It was awful.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.600
 But the boys, like, we just had to, like,

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.040
 everybody jump in the car and go.

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:21.600
 But they scared?

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.120
 And they, I thought--

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.400
 I thought, like, they're going to be terrified.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.840
 Just seeing me in so much pain.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.000
 I've never, like, been like that.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.160
 Or just, I felt like I was dying.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.520
 And they were fine.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.560
 [LAUGHTER]

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.000
 They were, like, totally fine.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.280
 Artie's, like, in the hospital.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.720
 He's like, oh, look at this thing.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.760
 [LAUGHTER]

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.280
 I'm, like, dying in a chair.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.520
 And he's just, like, amazed at what's in the room.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.000
 Yeah.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.120
 So yeah, now they were good.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.600
 Today, they woke up, didn't, like, no special attention.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.200
 Not like, oh, we almost saw our dad.

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:47.920
 He's here.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.360
 Just like, hey, dad.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:49.920
 [LAUGHTER]

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.640
 OK.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.040
 One, so one last story before we end it.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:53.680
 Yeah.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.680
 So I think this, this fear, this certain type of fear,

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.840
 just, like, sets in at a certain age,

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.000
 where, like, obviously it was way scarier for your wife

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.520
 than it was for your kids.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.400
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:04.960
 Sure.

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.720
 But there's this funny thing that happened recently where--

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:12.880
 So Zuko, he's, like, one and a half now.

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:13.520
 Wow.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.120
 Never been afraid of thunder.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.560
 Never been afraid of fireworks.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.440
 Nothing.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.000
 Yeah.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.920
 Completely randomly.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.920
 Last week, thunderstorm.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.920
 Super scared, started shaking.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.440
 Like, and Mike was just really scared,

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.160
 like, following me around.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.360
 And now, now, whenever there's thunder,

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.560
 like, he's, like, he's kind of stressed.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.120
 And I'm like, I remember this happening to me.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:34.080
 I remember feeling, like, not afraid of anything.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.600
 That's randomly just having fear of, like, mortality.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.920
 And, like, he's kind of afraid of, like, going fast

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.520
 in a car and, like, all these, like, things

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.120
 I just never thought about before.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.680
 Yeah, it's funny the things that we develop.

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:46.720
 But it's kids.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.000
 They're just oblivious to the world.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.280
 They don't have anything to fear.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.240
 It's pretty awesome.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.760
 You have a hat, Zuko, for a year and a half, right?

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.040
 With how old was he when you got him?

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.760
 I've had him for a-- it'll be a year in October.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.120
 Are you kidding me?

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.160
 I got him right when--

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.080
 I got him right when the podcast started or so.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.120
 I can still-- yeah.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.520
 I can still picture that picture of him, like,

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.280
 laying in the floorboard of the car or whatever.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.000
 It was a plane.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:06.560
 I don't remember.

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:07.360
 It's a car, yeah.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.160
 I still remember the tweet.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.560
 Yeah.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:10.360
 Huh.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.360
 What would we do with our Twitter?

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.760
 All my memories are on Twitter.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.160
 Exactly.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:13.920
 Not all of them.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.640
 Just the ones.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.960
 Just a good one to you guys.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.480
 Yeah, just the good ones.

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:19.280
 I mean, my family, I have lots of good memories.

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.200
 You should see my photo reel.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:22.680
 All right.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.120
 All right.

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.360
 This is a long one.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:27.360
 Turns out I almost die and, like, we just go--

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.160
 Come back to life.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.360
 Yeah, you know, you really appreciate life.

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.120
 Life to life.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.600
 All right.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:33.200
 All right.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:33.760
 See you next.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:34.260
 Yeah.

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.600
