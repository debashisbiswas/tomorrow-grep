WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
 Oh, are we team versatile now do we love to herself that's what you're doing you're shifting

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.820
 I'll just follow you we're talking about how like we would definitely take a if they want to pay us will do it

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.720
 Yeah, let's do it

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.660
 Yeah, we had a joke that we would take a sponsorship from them for terminal to do their conference and we would just send a cardboard cutouts

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:46.560
 How are you not great, I think I'm sick. Is that why you went home early? No

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.960
 Sorry, my brain is a my brain flow. Okay

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.440
 Lizzie sister was watching Zuko and she had to go home a day early, so gotcha. I had to go home a day early

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.520
 But I think I was sick the whole time I was there pretty much cuz as soon as I got to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.200
 Dallas I felt kind of off and then

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.640
 From Tuesday, I was like, I don't know. I felt this weird phase where I was like I could be sick

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.680
 But I could also just not be sick. Yeah, my throat was sore

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.840
 That first morning after we went and kind of hung out with a layer of ill people. I think that was just it's the bar thing

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.440
 It's like it's smoky. It's loud. You're yelling at each other

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.840
 But then it does make you question the whole time like am I actually sick. It's possible. Yeah, I was confused by that

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.180
 But I think I definitely am sick cuz I there's a good taste. I get my mouth in the morning. Yeah

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.080
 So

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.000
 Yeah, yep, so that's that sucks, but a successful trip to Dallas. What'd you say?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.800
 It was fun. Yeah, it went really well. Everything went

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.120
 Really smoothly really as far as I know I wasn't too involved in saying the stream

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.960
 So I don't know if there was like chaos there, but it came out good

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.880
 It was yeah, the the color temperature and all that like I just it drives me crazy when like yeah

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.240
 I don't get it all right and it was like trying to warm up but also get the stream going

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.200
 I would like to not do camera stuff anymore. I think I want to retire from knowing knowing anything about cameras

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.600
 Yeah, the next thing that just let's just write everything. Yeah, that'd be great. Just seeing all those professional crews walking around and thinking like

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.400
 they're gonna do a better job and

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.280
 They're probably not that expensive. I don't know. I mean carrying my bag full of equipment around the airport was brutal

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.640
 I literally have calluses on my fingers just from like a day of carrying that bag around

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.240
 Yeah, it's insane. It's heavy. Yeah, I guess when we rent the person to do it

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.400
 It's not like we're renting the equipment separately. So it's probably pretty cheap overall. Yeah, I would think so

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.920
 Yeah, did we give any context? We streamed a basketball game in Dallas normal work activities just things, you know

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.920
 basketball players

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.360
 Hey, we won too. How about that? Yeah, we're we're winning professional basketball players

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.120
 Yeah, I feel like we just retire now one and oh on our

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.680
 Our basketball career like the terminal team never lost and never will lose because we will never play again

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.840
 I just like this idea that will like

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.160
 Accept the challenge for any sport from anyone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We just do a tour of all of them

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.240
 That'd be amazing. You guys want to play us in where we're down to try it

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.080
 Yeah, I feel like we'd be pretty good at other things

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.320
 It worked out perfectly that there's five of us and basketball requires five people

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.040
 How fun was that though? Like just the collection of people on the court. It was just pretty crazy

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.960
 Like all these people you know from twitter

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.800
 All their faces are very familiar and you're running around like banging into each other playing basketball

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.880
 It's just a different experience

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.520
 Won't have that one again, probably

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.560
 Yeah, it was funny because we had a uh, uh, so we used transistor for all our podcast stuff and

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.880
 Yeah, and uh jack was there

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.640
 Hasn't name right Justin your class. Justin. Sorry. Justin. Justin Jackson. Yeah. Yeah. So the jack

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.240
 Justin was there

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.600
 Uh, he scored a point under team, which was great. Yep

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.400
 Yeah, so it's just funny to see everyone in these situations that they

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.920
 A lot of them were like I haven't played basketball in in 20 years

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.080
 So just put them in the situation

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.520
 I thought they never heard there's somebody on the other team that they were having that like that had never played

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.040
 They were having to explain that you dribble. You can't take steps that dribbling like they had never played

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.480
 Oh really? Wow, it's pretty crazy. But then there was the guy on their team

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:30.160
 Uh, I'm blanking on his name. CO Laravel. Whatever. I'm blanking, but he played college football. Tom. He was clearly

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
 I can tell he wasn't trying he wasn't

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.040
 what it felt like to me was

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.320
 He was holding back the first half because

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.800
 It maybe would be like a little unsportsman or maybe he felt like it would be like unsportsman like

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.120
 Go hard in the last like four minutes. He scored like every point for them. Yeah. Yeah. It kind of took over. I was like

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.000
 Yeah, I was like okay. That competitive if you've played competitive basketball like especially in college. I feel like

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.640
 Yeah, something's gonna kick in and you're gonna be like screw this

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.760
 Yeah, it was 99 though. Like he hasn't played since 99 college basketball

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.200
 Are you serious like nine like 1999? Isn't that crazy?

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.320
 I mean, he said he had played like five years ago. Maybe but like

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.200
 College for that. Yeah, I thought so. I didn't think it was that long ago. I know

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.880
 It's crazy. We're all getting so old. He's like 45. Wow. Okay. He was really good. All the gray beards

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.120
 We're all just aging. It is kind of random that everyone on our everyone on the terminal team like is

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.080
 Base level pretty athletic. It's like pretty random. Yeah for a group of random software engineers

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.800
 Yeah, what's that about? I did feel like we are like kind of like good at this

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.560
 We could probably like play sports as like a side thing

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.000
 For a while and yeah, we still got some legs on us

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.800
 Yeah, it was surprising

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.200
 Like teaj clearly plays a lot of morning basketball

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.080
 Prime just throws his body at everything. It's like a stream like prime stream is such a perfect embodiment of like

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.920
 Right his his personality and how he plays sports as well. It turns out

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.240
 And it's also just good hanging out like we don't get to do that a whole lot in person

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.800
 Yeah, I thought it was cool because you know, no one

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.760
 I don't think anything remotely like this gets done in conferences

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.840
 so definitely first of its kind and

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.200
 Yeah, it'd be cool to see what else we can uh

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.680
 Whip up for the stuff coming up the rest of the year

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.920
 We've just been throwing ideas around for how do we top the basketball game?

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.720
 There's lots of cool ideas floating around. Well, not just a basketball game. Then we all all the lambos stuff

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.880
 Oh, yeah, we said we rented a lambo

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.000
 I forgot

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.800
 Uh, we spent like a few hours with a lambo and took all kinds of funny videos

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.000
 I can't wait for those to start coming out. What does somebody have all the footage now?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.360
 Are people editing? I think I think tj uploaded it

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.320
 Into the slack. I think I didn't check because I was I was flying when he did that but uh

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.280
 Yeah, we got to get those out. It's uh

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.480
 Yeah, and that also we have the top like we've got to keep surprising people which is which is hard

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.880
 But yeah, it's really fun

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.960
 How about vegan bot? I love that guy. I didn't know really much about him

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.440
 Oh my god, he's the best like the first when he walked in the room like first meeting him

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.200
 I'm like, I don't know. I don't know if I'm gonna get along with this guy like it just he was a lot

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.480
 Uh, but then you just appreciate him more and more. I feel like as you spend time with him. I love that guy

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.240
 Yeah, he's like with you on everything. So yeah, he was just so helpful and yeah

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.800
 Love that guy and then you learn that like he sends so many tweets satige and prime

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:30.400
 He's like a ghost writer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I gotta get on that. Uh, yeah, no kidding. I'm gonna get in the loop

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.640
 I think he's got enough ideas for more than just he's in prime

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:41.920
 Yeah, and what's also cool is uh, he's so I have a few friends that are in this specific space as well like that art and tech intersection

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.640
 Um, it was really big in like the 20

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.680
 mid 2010s

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.600
 Uh, especially in New York like giant dedicated companies where all they would do is

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.760
 Do one off crazy like tech installations

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.680
 Different different different clients. Yep. He's super into that world and yeah

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.080
 It's obviously way crazier now than it was back then but he's got just so many ideas

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.720
 that we could just take and do for our stuff because uh, like

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.080
 You just know stuff that's happened in like other spaces and we can like map that to ours. Yep

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.200
 Um, so I'm like just send me all of your ideas. Like I will just build every single one. Yeah. I love it

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.000
 Yeah, he's cool. He's great. It was great. Yeah. It was a it was a good conference. I felt like

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.200
 My twitter timeline. I haven't been on twitter as much lately, but opening it at the conference

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.920
 It was just it was taken over by

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.720
 All these things going on. Yeah

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.280
 So I remember lerecon last year and

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.000
 It definitely wasn't this noisy like I remember like a few pictures of erin floating around

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.520
 It seemed pretty quick, but this year it seemed like yeah, do you think we did?

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.840
 Did we do our part here? Did we help boost?

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.840
 Awareness with our shenanigans. Yeah, I mean I saw at least several tweets

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.760
 We're like do I need to start learning PHP now and that's like the the metric for me

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.840
 If like random people are just like having fomo if we're giving random like react influencers fomo

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.360
 That's that's the goal. Yeah, so I think we did our job cool

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.440
 Yeah, what's next what's next for terminal? Oh, we also saw coffee by the way if you're interested in some terminal coffee

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.600
 Let's throw to our sponsors. I'm just gonna say stuff like that because criss that's fun stuff

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.000
 When I say things like that

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.120
 This episode of how about tomorrow is brought to you by Dax getting stuffed in the basketball game

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:40.880
 And also by terminal coffee

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:47.840
 Which you can order at terminal dot shop and while we cannot confirm nor deny that the coffee contains the sweat of prime

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:54.400
 We can confirm that it does contain the tears of Dax as evidence by him getting stuffed in the basketball game

00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:01.440
 Be sure to get amazing tasting coffee. That's ethically sourced through your command line at terminal dot shop now back to the show

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:09.520
 Terminal coffee though. We sold a bunch of artists in coffee online some in person

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:15.120
 I feel very low energy. Do you feel very low? I mean you're sick. I'm yeah, this one's gonna be tough

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.840
 I feel like we're both just kind of like reeling from the last two days

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:26.880
 What else we met bash in person. That's the first time for me. Oh, really? Oh, I met her at twitch con twitch con are you?

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.160
 I thought I was going to but I feel like and I even bought a ticket

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:39.040
 I just I feel like I should reserve all my travel for terminal things terminal stuff. Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna be going to stuff enough that like

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.640
 I can't throw in extra stuff. That doesn't really add to that. Yeah. Yeah, I feel the same way

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.720
 Yeah, so we're trying to play another one for terminal in november

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.680
 Is that secret? Can we say where it is or is it wish lightweight?

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:57.120
 I just don't know it like was just not confirmed yet. So I don't want to say it's it's gonna be in New York, which

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.120
 Yeah, let's keep pushing me to make that one happen

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.120
 Just to go to New York. So go hang out. I want to go. Let me see

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.800
 Um

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.360
 Are there tech conferences in southern california? I do I haven't been l.a. And forever in california in a while

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.280
 So I would I would enjoy that. It's like I would too. Is it because like

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.920
 There's tech stuff going on in california all the time that they don't do conferences there because like there are conferences like

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.360
 I guess in sf. I hate saying sf

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.400
 like I think so there's

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:35.120
 Well, you know, it's been a while. I know like when like Theo living there and people would be going to his apartment stuff

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.840
 Because they're going to some tech conference. That was next conf. Was it just next conf? Oh, maybe it is just next conf

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.720
 Yeah, maybe I think they're having another conference. I don't know. I heard maybe something about it

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.760
 Sorry

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.640
 Nice. Oh, are we team versell now do we love to versell? That's what you're doing. You're shifting

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.280
 I'll just follow you. We're talking about how like we would definitely take if they want to pay us. We'll do it

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:03.440
 Yeah, let's do it. We had a joke that uh, we would take a sponsorship from them for terminal to do their conference and we would just

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.760
 Send cardboard cutouts

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.680
 Oh, that's good

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.560
 Uh

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.360
 Yeah, I guess maybe there aren't a lot of tech conferences in sepsis go

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.720
 But definitely not in like southern california, which is where I'd rather go. I don't want to go to the bay area

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.120
 And the place sucks

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.800
 Uh, the place sucks l.a. I mean, I just don't like it. I don't know

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:33.680
 There's just like it's not very clean and there's like oh the city. Yes city is yeah the city itself is just where it is

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.760
 Now it is yeah

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.320
 I mean, it's it's so it's like a beautiful place, you know

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.760
 Yeah, I guess geographically. I like to go to the ferry building

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:48.400
 And uh, there's this place called mary poses. This is bakery and I have these vegan pop tarts. They're like plum flavored. They're so good

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.880
 I call them pop tarts. They're like a

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.120
 What would that be called a strudel? Yeah

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.000
 Pop tarts. I mean come on

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.280
 It's like whenever you travel anywhere you just get some vegan. I really do vegan pastries

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:07.040
 It's kind of like my weakness. I just traveled to get vegan pastries. Yeah, there's a lot of vegan pastries in my neighborhood too. Yeah

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:15.520
 Tell me more. Okay. Anyway. Oh, we might come to Miami by the way. Really? Uh, kacie. There's a volleyball camp. Uh, I don't remember

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.120
 December, I think December. Oh, you guys should do it. That'll be really fun

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.720
 Yeah, it's like she there's these camps they have all over the country and it's like

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.480
 When one intersects with something that would be like hey, we could go see Daxon Liz

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.560
 It's like it's a good reason to pick that one. So yeah, I'll let you know

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.120
 But we hope you do it. We'll have to do that. Yeah, that'd be great. It's actually in south beach, but

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.040
 It's gonna be fun. Yeah, you guys don't you guys won't stay there, but yeah, no

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.800
 We'd stay closer to you and then we could just drive across the bridge or whatever

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.840
 Which you know is not gonna have a lot of traffic this time because

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.280
 I know it was crazy during react Miami

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:55.280
 Was that just special circumstances that react Miami lined up with something where traffic was really bad or just time of year?

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.280
 It must have been the conference because I literally

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:03.600
 Like I live here and I consider myself close to the beach over there like yeah, usually like a 15 minute drive

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.280
 Yeah

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.000
 That was was it the e-merge america's the linkedin

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.480
 So whatever the hell that is

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.480
 The e-merge america's conference just like blows my mind because it really does

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.960
 It's so big and then you see

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:24.240
 Everyone there and you're like who are these people and like yeah, they're all in suits and like tom brady like somehow spoke there

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.360
 like they're big enough to get tom brady to speak there but like

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.800
 And it's like in Miami of all places like I just don't get it at all. I don't get it

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.800
 Yeah

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.840
 What's been going on in tech what else did we miss while we were doing real life stuff?

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.560
 It's so funny to say like iRL like oh, that's my iRL friend like tea just came with sam

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.680
 It's like this my iRL friends like we're all real life friends just not like in-person friends

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.640
 But not enough

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.480
 What is going on in tech is anything going on or in life?

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.080
 Forget about tech who cares anymore. I just don't care anymore

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.160
 I think the more people talk on twitter like technical topics the less I care

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.760
 I care nothing about anyone's technical takes. I just don't

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.560
 Like i'm sure someone cares. I just I can't even anymore. I can't pretend

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.760
 Like your technical takes on twitter or just I don't know one cares. No one cares

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:23.280
 Oh, there's been so much stuff going on. You seen has been like attacking. Oh, yeah

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:30.320
 All the people that we associate with and they've been attacking back. Wait, what do you mean attacking all the people?

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.640
 I mean like going after

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.080
 Uh, just like it was just you seen a Theo fighting. Was it just you seen Theo?

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.240
 I thought there were other people. What depth Cody also was in there. What depth Cody. I don't really know him. I guess

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.160
 Uh, then there's like DHA topping in and being like, haha told you complexity sucks

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.600
 It's been it's been a lot of twitter drama

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.040
 That's definitely a good example of a conversation where I generally just felt like I don't

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.480
 I actually just don't want to even get involved in this at all. Yeah, I really don't like talking to each other

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.800
 It keeps coming up like this this yeah complexity versus

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:11.360
 Like vps's or whatever. I'm just yeah, I don't care either side sounds and nobody's ever shipping anything exactly

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.160
 Are they I don't know I saw you say something about that and I had to think about it deeply for a moment like

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.960
 Are there a lot of people shipping? They just don't talk

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:24.960
 So the people who are talking these people that are always like arguing about you should be a vp as there should be whatever

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:31.680
 It's like I have never used your product. Yeah, like I I've never used any of your what is like one notable product

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.320
 That is like shipped on a vps. I mean, I'm sure there are it's just that uh

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:43.360
 Like for the volume of people talking about it. I would expect a proportion of volume of products and there is not

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:49.440
 So okay, so let's define vps because I feel like lots of large companies manage their own infrastructure

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.920
 Like they don't use I mean ec2 is a vps. Okay. Right. So like there's this association though with vps

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.640
 There's kind of a connotation that it's like a digital ocean droplet is cheap and it's whatever

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.720
 It's not using one of the major cloud providers. Don't you think there's there's it's like I know

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:11.680
 I think the application is that you just they highlight how cheap it could all be and obviously ec2 is not cheap in terms of compute

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.440
 Yeah on its own and it's but it's an AWS thing

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:21.600
 So like you're not spiritually aligned with the crowd. That's like the five dollar vps crowd, right?

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:27.680
 Yeah, but I think at this point the war has gotten so large that they're like recruiting everyone they can so they're like

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.120
 I got like included because that because now I do see people say like just get a server on

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:40.240
 Petzner or AWS or whatever. I see that get included. Okay, so they include AWS. Yeah, they're just opposed to

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:49.120
 Well, that's the thing like the five dollar vps crowd is sort of like really angry at the versell and like netlify layer of

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:55.840
 cloud abstraction which I also think is stupid and won't exist in five years or if it does it'll look very different

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.800
 But that's not where we live. We talked about this at least offline. No, yeah, but that's what I'm saying

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.040
 I just feel like this group doesn't ship anything because so someone asked me the other day

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.680
 Uh, I was talking

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.360
 No, and that joke post that made where I was like for cell rules because I was wanting to flip sides

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.520
 Yeah, because everyone is on the anti-versal side

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:21.280
 Which is like mostly a joke but a part of me is like so tuned to just do the opposite that I'm just like maybe I should be pro

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:28.160
 Someone replied being like hey, what's your recommendation for

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.360
 I'm if I'm building something that is not going to go viral

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.640
 Like how would you think about whether I use a vps or serverless or something, right?

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.600
 And I replied being like I just don't work on anything that I don't think will go viral

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.520
 Like what's the point? Yeah, why work on something that yeah, yeah, so I'm like I

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.080
 That like I don't know what perspective you have at all for that kind of thing

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.440
 So like I don't know what it says do but they pressed me on it and I was like

00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:01.360
 Here's actually what it comes down to like good whenever this stuff comes up people like design an architecture from scratch

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:08.400
 They're like you should buy a vps and then spin this up and do it as though. This is like the only thing you're ever gonna work on

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.840
 Yeah, I could do all that. I know how to do all that

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.600
 I've done all that in the past

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.920
 But I don't want one thing I'm working on to look radically different than another thing

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.440
 I'm working on just because it like was smaller at this point

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:27.520
 Like I just pick a capable platform that works whether I'm making something really simple or making something really complicated

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.600
 That way all my apps look similar and work in the same way because

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.120
 Especially when you're working on a lot of things the context switching of technologies is sucks

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.960
 And I think people can feel this when like they maybe tried out like

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.200
 Solid on some project and then all our projects still in react and then switching with you

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.600
 Now that also on the infrastructure layer

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.760
 So for me like yeah, I don't I don't really consider those other options because

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.880
 I do have big things that I'm managing that do need a WS so everything else might as well be there

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.200
 Yeah, and it doesn't feel like

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:04.960
 And I'm sure people have said this before but it doesn't feel like extra work once you not extra work once you know

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.920
 Yeah, it's like I hate the idea that like just ship a thing that's as fast as you possibly can

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.240
 It could be a piece of junk but like ship it so you can move on and make money or whatever

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.680
 It's like

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.880
 It doesn't take me more time to ship something with this stack that works for anything than it does

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.120
 Like I don't know what shortcuts I would take that actually saved me time

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.680
 By using some other stack or some simpler thing and a bunch of other stuff comes up

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.200
 It's like okay now it's in production

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:37.280
 I guess because the server I do need to monitor stuff and add the ghost setup data dog and have to do all these things

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.800
 I'm just I've done these all the stuff in the past and I just don't want to do that again

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.760
 So

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.160
 That's what I'm saying like I don't know these people are actually building

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.880
 Anything like see how my answer was very scoped to other stuff. I'm doing and like my life and stuff

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:57.280
 I can't like I can't speak without that context and a lot of these people make these recommendations without that stuff

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.200
 So I'm like, yeah, I don't know. I don't think they're actually building anything

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.480
 Yeah, what about on the other side? Do you think anyone's building anything with bracelle slop?

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.760
 No, I don't think so either

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.960
 I mean there are actually no to be fair there are companies. There are products I use that I go

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:18.720
 Like cal.com. That's that's a big one or did they move off herself? I don't use cal.com, but I use a I use type fully

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.240
 Which is like oh, that's a twitter thing

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.200
 Yeah, I just use a friend of the mix because they have like the best looking analytics page for that

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.080
 You don't you don't use it to write your your thread boy threads

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:38.800
 And I did see them in this conversation arguing why they use whatever, but just like

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:44.720
 I just don't I don't know. I just really don't care and I think what's been really freeing for me. I don't know if I says already

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.160
 Just a shift that SST's taken

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.720
 I feel so not pinned to any kind of way of building

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.560
 Yeah, so even more so I like don't care at all

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.680
 because like I'm not biased anymore about wanting people to build a certain way because it lines up with

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.600
 SST primitive SST primitives now cover everything so yeah

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.320
 Yeah, I'm just like whatever just tell me what you want to do and I'll do it. I have no opinion on

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.680
 Yeah, whatever sucks or not, you know kind of just say when you're sick

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.440
 You have like the deepest

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.920
 Richest voice for a podcast ever. I need you to be sick more. It just sounds really nice than add funds

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:27.520
 I'm sure the listeners will agree. I know I I've had this thought before and I think I can maybe fake it when I uh, oh

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.440
 There you go. I don't know. He's the paid attention

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.520
 Began has a really great voice too. Oh, he does that like voice. Yeah

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:38.320
 Newscaster voice or whatever. Uh-huh. I just want to I want to do stuff with Began now

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.080
 Like whatever his little brain comes up with his big brain comes up with

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.520
 His weird brain comes up with yeah

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.160
 He's so into like some very specific things and like

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.880
 I can't imagine anyone knows more. You know what he reminds me of? I meant to say this to him in

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.560
 Dallas

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.960
 In the booby-doon or the books whatever the guys that can calculate what are those called?

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:09.120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's like that, but with like with like internet lore. Yeah with like memes and lore

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.360
 Like you can just tell you anything. Yeah, let's go try because I can't think of the name of it

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:20.240
 Here's the other thing that we also found. So that for you left, uh, you know how whenever any kind of drama happens and he gets deleted

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.520
 Someone's order of always posting screenshots of it. Yeah. Yeah, he's a guy. That's just always to get a screenshot right away

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.520
 He's just like he's like he's an archivist. He's got just screenshots of everything

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.720
 Yeah, I can see his reaction when you see something like that. Oh, hang on

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.440
 Yeah, exactly

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.440
 Okay, got it

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.520
 He's a person that's just yeah, he just has everything saved from like any like drama

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.680
 You can query him about he'll like produce the the artifacts for you

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.160
 I have I have I have wondered that before like who are these people that take screenshots

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.360
 I also wonder like when you see really funny memes like who are the people that make these things and it's also vegan

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.320
 It's people like vegan like this. They just have that brain

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.960
 you can like show him any random like

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:08.320
 You know like these like cartoon images people post of like a certain face. Yeah, like the wojack or there was one

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.000
 I can't remember it. Uh, it was one of the you've seen responses

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.400
 I think it's like this kind of black and white drawing of a guy. Yeah, I think it was his response to adam rakus

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.840
 Uh

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.920
 And like I just knew when I saw it like be gonna know what that's called. He knew immediately and like I didn't even show to him

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.320
 I just described it to him. He's like, oh, yeah, no, no, no

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.680
 He's he really is like one of those things in dude. Yeah, he just I think he thinks physically lives on the internet

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.120
 It's what feels like real. Yeah, because it dresses the internet

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:43.760
 There was some tech stuff that happened this week. So it was refreshing my memory on hacker new stuff instant db

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.760
 Which has been like announced for a while and like kind of in

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.600
 Being worked on I think it's like officially public now

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:59.760
 Instant what'd you call it instant db.com. It's another entrance in the local first category

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.320
 Okay

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.320
 And is it is it good?

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:09.920
 I feel like you're you're good. I haven't been able to dig into it too much. I think my initial look at it

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.000
 it looks very similar to

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.320
 Replicash plus the replicash back in that they're now deprecating

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.840
 Okay, so yeah, it's it's kind of like a fun

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:25.760
 I think I I still put there's just it's funny how crazy influential firebase is like I realize there's so many companies where I

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:31.120
 Describe them as oh, they're trying to be like a firebase, but this can mean like so many different things

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.760
 Uh, so this is like a firebase in that

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.680
 it is a client side library that can like talk to a

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.560
 Back end that you don't need to build

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:46.960
 Um, but they went really hard on all the local first stuff. So being able to like sync all data locally

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:53.040
 Create queries that are live updated like all of those things. But just like I guess taking a step back. It's just

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.440
 It's pretty wild to see how much more attention this space

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.000
 Is getting like there's more and more entrance. Like these are like legit efforts

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.880
 They're not like one off little things. Uh, like the people behind this have worked pretty hard on all of this and it seems

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:13.680
 Pretty polished and pretty deeply integrated with uh, the things I mean that obviously focus on react. Yeah, but then zero

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.680
 is like

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:23.440
 A new way of doing all this. I really want to understand better zeros. Yeah, so so I think the replicash team have have experimented with a

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.440
 Few different extremes and they're kind of like trying different

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.560
 Approaches on this. So first was a client side only library. So this is just something that

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:40.240
 Exists on the front end you implement a back end point that I can sync with and that's what I'm using currently with all of my projects

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.640
 Yeah, and they went to the extreme of

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:48.480
 Okay, obviously setting up that back at end point yourself is complicated. So let's build a full back end of the service

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.880
 Uh thing that like fully owns all of your data

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.440
 And you can just plug any replicash front end into it and that was called a

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.480
 Reflect

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.800
 They ultimately decided not to continue with that and they're like a sudden setting at some point

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.640
 Now they're trying a different angle, which is kind of in between of the two

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:13.760
 They give you uh, basically a container that can sit in front of your database and serve a replicash application

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:19.280
 A replicash front end, but you still have your own back end like a very normal looking back end that has like

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.840
 conserve other things like

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.800
 You know, just it's like for like a more like realistic app. That's not just replicash

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.600
 Yeah, like you own your database. You own yeah

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.840
 All of that. Does it work with any database or how? Yeah, what does it work with?

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.120
 It will but right now it's the first version is going to be postgres specific

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.520
 But the underlying architecture is pretty simple like the only database specific part is

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:47.600
 The replication layer between the database and their server. Mm-hmm. Um, so that they'll implement that for every uh

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.280
 Database that they want to support and that's what zero is this

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:57.680
 We're talking about zero. Okay. Yeah. What's cool about that is because so I built our endpoint thing for

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.480
 Boomi for sst for uh

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:07.840
 For radiance. I can spend like a year on that if I wanted just to make an endpoint better faster like more teachers, etc

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.880
 But they're basically doing that uh, so it allows for so many cool things where you can just like

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:18.960
 Drop components on a page and it knows what queries that component needs

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.480
 And if you're running this through srs, it'll actually fetch it all

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:29.040
 Uh server side rendered so zero includes front end components that you're saying it includes in a gray

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.400
 Or it's planned to include like integrations with front end frameworks

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.920
 Right. So if you you basically can um

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:42.640
 And it's if you've ever looked at graph ql relay. It's kind of similar. Yeah. Yeah, if you like batches up the queries and yeah

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.960
 Exactly. So if you have a component it's like user component. You can say like what data you need from the

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:52.320
 Your data store to fill this user component then on s there's like an srs hook

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.960
 So when it's srs, it'll resolve all of those

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.120
 From like this replica layer. Mm-hmm. So it'll actually get srs

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.840
 But what's on the front end this data starts getting synced locally and saved

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.240
 Uh, if there are components you have not visited for a while

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.800
 They start expiring out of the cache

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:16.000
 So if it's like save the data for a component for your user profile because I looked at it

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.680
 Yep, and I haven't looked at it again in a week. It'll like rotate out and that's a

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:26.160
 Historically, that's been like really manual to configure rules on. Yeah. Yeah, how long to keep data how like move this slide this window around

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:31.840
 Um, so they've just built a way to do this all completely automatically. So it'll be pretty nice

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.440
 Pretty cool. And they just sent me like their reference architecture on how

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:42.560
 Uh, you would deploy this into your AWS account or wherever it is like a little complicated

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.120
 There's like simple versions of it. There's more complicated versions of it

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:49.040
 But it's not bad like self-hosting. This is like not going to be too hard

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.280
 Yeah, I wonder like if it's a container is it pretty like does it match with sst's

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:58.320
 Like yep cluster thing. Yeah, but we're actually gonna build a component for it

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.760
 Oh nice. So just drop in to an sst at that. So cool

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.920
 I love that sst you guys have the ability to to go that level of abstraction like

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:10.640
 Here is a replica zero component and everything is done

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:16.640
 Yep, and it works with your infrastructure. It creates your infrastructure. Yeah, like front end frameworks can't do that

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.200
 They don't have that power. Yeah

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.480
 So

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.000
 By the way, the thing that the reason I brought this up in the first place is instant DB thing

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:24.960
 Uh

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.880
 This is the first time my career where I can finally check the box if I was early to something

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.960
 Um, oh, because I remember the first time you were early. I feel like that's not true

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.240
 No, I think it's true. I think to like pass a threshold of being like

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.640
 It's funny because sort of if I was really early on it, I would have built it

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.360
 So I wasn't that early

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.720
 But I would say this is the earliest I've ever been to something because I've seen

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:52.640
 I remember talking about this like years ago when like sst was a thing I was talking about and nobody was like

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.720
 Nobody knew what I was talking about and now I see tweets every week where someone's like

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.440
 Wait, I tried this local first thing like whoa

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.240
 How is this not like the future of everything?

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.200
 Yeah, like people we know too. So I'm like, oh, yeah, I finally feel like

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.960
 I like witnessed that shift and it feels good. Yeah. Yeah, so the next next goal is to be early enough where

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.680
 You know, you like invent the thing. Yeah. Yeah, yeah

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:21.040
 Yeah, how long has rectal cash been like how long ago did he start that must be like five years now?

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:25.040
 Five years. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it does feel like the best applications

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:30.240
 In a browser are going to be local first. It's like any trade-offs

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.200
 That there are like oh you're not

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.080
 Like that just needs to be solved like you need to get the best of both worlds

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:40.720
 You need to if you need to serve a render stuff for whatever reasons seo or whatever else

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.840
 Like we got to just solve that problem, but there's no way like a a multi-page app like

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:50.080
 Using any one of the ssr frameworks is going to approach

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:57.840
 the quality of a local first app without I guess I guess anything could be done with just enough effort but like

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:04.240
 Local first gives you that like amazing application feeling everything's instant. Everything feels really good

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.640
 Feels like you can solve the ssr stuff and it sounds like it already is being solved

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.920
 More easily than like an ssr framework can figure out how to make

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.960
 Like the local first thing that make it feel local first. Yeah, it's a got a scope for them

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:22.560
 Yeah, exactly because I think about this all the time with stat news like oh, we don't have much inner activity

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:27.360
 But then we keep adding more it's like oh we need to sprinkle in this inner activity and it's like at the end of the day

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.480
 It doesn't feel very good because we don't have really good tools

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:36.560
 Uh to kind of like make that all feel instant and smooth. It's like we started with the ssr

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.280
 And that kind of constrains a lot of what we can do

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.640
 So yeah, I I do I think the future is like

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.120
 local first with

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.280
 Figuring out all the other things that you need to figure out

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:52.480
 But start from that foundation because it's just gonna feel better that thing that you guys went through is something that I feel like

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.880
 it shows up a lot where

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.680
 Early on a project you're like oh

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.720
 The shape of this project

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.720
 is pretty simple

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:08.240
 And because it's simple we can adopt this constraint that would like really simplify things for us across the board

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:14.560
 And then all the things you hope to never need you like eventually start slowly need. Yeah, yeah

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.160
 And it's similar to that like the vps conversation where it's like

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.280
 Like if you have any amount of experience you've just gone through

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.440
 That thing over and over. We just don't want to start from the simplest thing

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.240
 Yeah, and just like go through that pane of like rewriting over and over

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.120
 Um, and I think we see like a lot of where how st's positioned is like specifically around this

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.680
 Yeah, we have simplified components

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.880
 But

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:43.600
 We know that you're eventually gonna break out of those and need yeah weird configuration more. Yep

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:49.440
 Yeah, and more control design specifically around like our whole framework design around the idea of being able to do that

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:55.200
 uh, whereas a lot of these sass services are designed around the bet that you'll never need to

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.840
 You'll never do that because the sass there was a moment you need to break through to that stuff

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.920
 The product becomes extremely ugly

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.640
 It just like really breaks down and like kind of fits the purpose of using it in the first place

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.720
 Uh, but yeah, everyone eventually just always needs it like as it just always happens. Yeah

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.520
 Yeah, this goes to like the twitter drama

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.840
 You're seeing kind of like pointing out the thing that he's angry about

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.280
 Uh, being that it feels like the modern

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:26.880
 Uh, sass slop. I guess i'll call it in honor of his

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.800
 Coining at that slop. He just keeps saying the word slop

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.200
 Uh that he feels like they're like

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.240
 Trying to convince new engineers that they're too dumb. They'll never figure it out. I've heard you say similar things like

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.640
 Uh, not trying to lump you in with your scene that like you agree with everything he says

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.320
 uh

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.320
 Don't want to get you canceled, but

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:52.160
 The uh, the idea that there's this whole wave of like dev tools companies that are like

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:56.080
 Trying to simplify in a way that just like

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.200
 People aren't learning things. They should probably learn anymore

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.600
 Or new engineers that are coming into the field

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:05.760
 It's kind of like trying to shield them from something that would be valuable lessons to learn. Do you agree with all that?

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:10.080
 Yeah, I think this falls in the category of something that's very confusing for me, which is

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.960
 Yes, I agree with everything there

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:17.040
 But it also sounds a lot like what you always hear which is

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.160
 The kids these days don't even know how to do x

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.000
 Yeah, it's true

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.920
 And and you remember being a kid and you remember like quote-unquote kid and you remember like the grown-ups

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.920
 Saying stuff like that

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.120
 And you know, it may be a lot of it turned out to not matter

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.640
 So I think I

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.960
 Let that like kind of check myself to some degree

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:43.280
 But I also see this other thing where people like see a pattern and they apply it like way too aggressively

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.880
 Like yeah, this does look like that

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.640
 But it's also different like yeah, if I think about like our early career

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:54.320
 There could have been the generation before us looking at us writing our Java and our C# and whatever and being like

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.800
 This this generation hadn't even learned assembly or they're not even writing stuff and C anymore

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.520
 And I've gotten my whole career and hadn't had to do either of those things

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:09.120
 So like it's possible that this whole wave coming in now will never have to know how to manage a server or manage

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.480
 Uh lower level stuff like I don't know in gen X and whatever else

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.880
 Well, I think

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.840
 The thing that I think if I like draw a differentiation

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:26.720
 A lot of the simplification that happened in our era allowed for a lot more to be done

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:31.920
 Like a lot more software to be written because like it didn't really give up a lot of capabilities

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.040
 Right like if you think about something like garbage collected languages like

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.920
 That allowed for

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.280
 All sorts of things to be built where garbage collection was fine

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:45.520
 Um, whereas with this modern stuff, it feels more like

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.120
 They've defined a very very narrow kind of application

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:54.560
 And they've hyper optimized for it and I feel like I can't see like

00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:00.080
 Here's like why 10x or a hundred x amount of software will be written because of these tools

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.800
 I may be obvious. I've been like ahead of time, but

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.600
 I think looking back that's a difference like that's why like the quote-unquote old timers were wrong

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.040
 because

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:14.640
 These tools helped a lot more software be built. Yep. Yep. I don't know if that'll happen with this generation of stuff

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.680
 It feels like you'd actually here's here's what it feels like

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.480
 I think the difference between

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:26.320
 See and I garbage put the language is like a 10x improvement or like a hundred x improvements like a massive massive improvement

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.560
 Yeah, whereas this generation of stuff is positioned the same way, but I feel like it's like

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.320
 50% better. It's like it's like maybe two times better

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.800
 I mean like Vercel for me is like it's like cicd which just feels like

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:43.120
 A commodity at this point. I mean like people are that was the initial big thing

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.440
 It's like I can just push to get up and not think about it

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.840
 It's like yeah, you can do that with like 15 services now or like even the underlying stuff

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:55.200
 It's getting easier and easier to do that with do you agree with that? Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's like it doesn't feel

00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.640
 It's like a little bit better, you know, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is that the nature of

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:07.120
 Like diminishing returns or something with progress and technology? No, technology historically just goes up real big

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.640
 Yeah, it's like a curve that keeps getting more and impressive, right?

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.440
 No, I

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.040
 And this is like we'll see who ends up being right on all this but

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.400
 That from where i'm sitting. I feel like

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.080
 This world does it and understand

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.880
 What like venture?

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:30.000
 Yeah, is at all. I've been talking about it's a bunch of tests. Yeah, I've seen it on twitter. You've been saying stuff

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.920
 People will build something that is a little bit better

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.520
 And they'll think that this is a venture scale thing

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:43.520
 And it'll also be very non contrarian. It'll be following like the trend that everyone else is doing

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.360
 Or i'm like

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:51.840
 One as an investor like you know that all your returns are going to come from a single company that like goes huge

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.480
 And no company ever does that by like

00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:00.160
 Following the trend or making something incrementally better like it's so kind of like if you're just building a nice

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:05.680
 For yourself like that's fine, but these are all these companies are in the venture scale category

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:12.000
 I'm just like what is everyone doing like like we've all read the same books. We've all I mean j point out this this out the other day

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.680
 He's like yeah, we know power law exists within companies like a few companies end up really winning

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.480
 But it exists inside investors also

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:25.520
 Like only a few vcs really get it and only a few vcs really actually win

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.920
 Um, so that's probably what we're seeing like as weird as it is like I don't think a lot of these

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.440
 PCs understand this and like why are you betting on these like

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:39.280
 Incrementally better products like what whereas like the wild contrarian bets like it's just

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:46.000
 And that that's that to me. It feels it feels a weird like this is like the industry that's supposed to talk about that a lot

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.800
 Or the industry that where there's like so much reading material about thinking that way. Yeah, but everyone just like

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:57.680
 Oh, yeah, this seems like you know the next incremental step and incremental steps tend to work. It's not like they're like

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.680
 Oh, this is gonna like be a total bus. They tend to like at least work a little

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:07.840
 And we're just like down for that. They're not like no, we gotta like actually do something. That's crazy different

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.560
 Like i'm gonna make a hosted post-crest service. It's gonna be amazing

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:16.320
 like there's a trend of

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:20.080
 Databases then and now we're gonna like join that it's just like

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:25.760
 Everyone just everyone still thinks in terms of trends like there's and I said this thing the other day too where

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:31.680
 People talk about trends like it's the weather or like there's there's like wind blowing and they're like oh

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.840
 Like the wind is blowing. We are like put up our sail. Yeah, and they like see trends that way

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.640
 That's not what is a trend is a trend is

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:44.800
 Someone like dragging the world into like a new thing like you you're not there like capture the trend

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.880
 You're there to like make the trend and push it

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.800
 But vc is talking entirely in terms of trends because they're never the ones

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.560
 Making the trend. Yeah, so I can see how that affects founders

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.640
 Oh, it's like the dev tools wave. I mean just how much money was flowing into dev tools

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.440
 There's always some hot sector in vc world

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.880
 That just gets way too much money poured into it

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:09.200
 Yeah, and we're still we're gonna watch the unraveling of that in dev tools for a while

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:15.040
 Right. The thing i'm pointing out though is this way of think I get why vc's see it from this way because that's the only thing

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.320
 They can latch on to but I think it's infecting the founders too

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.960
 Who should like try to resist that like I keep I always think back to

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:27.760
 When the clerk CEO responded to you because you were like, oh, why like do you like make your pitch to me?

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.760
 Of why I should use clerk and he responded to you with an essay full of like

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:37.760
 graphs and charts and gartner research and trend and like he and he did this again recently last week

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.960
 Where they're like he's like here are the shifts in the market and here's how we're going to be positioned to take advantage

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.560
 It's just like yeah

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:50.080
 That shit does not go venture scale like that approach just does not it doesn't do it. Yeah. Yeah, but it's weird to me

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:56.640
 I'm like how is this is this is that thing? We're supposed to be doing like we all signed up to be a venture scale company

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.680
 This is the one thing we have to be doing wise. No one doing it

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:06.480
 So are there examples like I feel like you see so many examples on this the wrong side of this where they're not

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:15.120
 Taking big bets. Are there examples that you admire that did take big bets like that are active startups that you feel like actually

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:22.480
 Chose the right size kind of thing. Yeah, I mean, I think it's there's a very simple way to measure this right you

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.520
 I think people have a really tough time separating

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:30.240
 There's two dimensions. There's how likely are they to be right? Yes or no

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:35.680
 And the other dimension which is totally unrelated which is a part of people have trouble understanding is

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.640
 If they are right how big is the impact?

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:44.240
 So people tend a couple isn't the one dimension. So when they see that a company is likely to be right

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.320
 They just assume it's going to be big impact. Oh, when I see a company has low likelihood to be right

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.160
 They assume it's going to be low impact

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.400
 But really what you actually look for are companies that have a low likelihood of being right

00:42:54.400 --> 00:43:01.040
 But if they are right, it's going to be a massive massive impact. Yeah, um, so we were talking about replicas earlier, right?

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:05.040
 Their bet is the whole web is being built incorrectly

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:09.520
 And the right way to build it is this totally other architecture

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:15.200
 Is that actually going to happen? I don't know very low chance that it will but if it does like

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.200
 They're just going to win like yeah, like way more than anyone else, right?

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.040
 Yep

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:25.760
 And to me like nothing is worth working on in venture scale if you can't frame it in that way

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:32.000
 Uh, like yeah, so there are not a lot especially in dev tools and dev tools tends to be like pretty incremental

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.760
 Outside of dev tools. There's obviously a ton. Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, that is the state of our space

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.160
 Uh, we're quite boring. I think

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.680
 Fortunately, we are quite boring. Yeah, I'm quite bored. I'm bored with much of the discourse

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:50.800
 And it's that helped me kind of get off of twitter and not be that active right now

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:56.880
 I which I I get like there's a lot of other benefits twitter just the memes and the hanging out or whatever

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:02.800
 I am there's a fantasy football league. I mean, that's on twitter. So i'm excited for that. We're drafting tomorrow. Actually, I think

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:08.800
 Uh turns out turk listens are a podcast and he thinks I am cheating because I talked about my secret weapon last time

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.360
 Uh, so if you're still listening turk

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:16.960
 I love you. That's all. I just like you. You're the best. Thanks for running the league. Did you see how viral turquet

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.200
 This past week. Oh, no, did he? He had a tweet with like 150 000 likes

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.440
 Oh my god. It was so impactful that it showed up in google search trends

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:32.720
 What what was the tweet? I can't say it out loud because uh, oh, okay. He he translated computer science

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.960
 Into norwegian and it's quite a funny translation

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:43.200
 Okay, uh, I feel like i've seen more like mega viral tweets

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.240
 lately like I don't know if they're just showing up my feed more but like

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:52.560
 Numbers that I don't remember seeing like a year ago on a single tweet and it feels like it's happened within our little like

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:57.680
 Corner of twitter, you know what I mean? Like people we know. I know i've seen theo

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:04.160
 Has had at least one or two really giant thick had one recently vick. Yeah. Yeah, I saw that

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:08.080
 I've never been go that big. It's pretty wild when people pull that off. Oh, that's crazy

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.840
 I can't imagine what you're like

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.720
 Notific I guess you don't get notifications at that point like you're just

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:19.280
 Checked out when stuff leaves are bubble. It goes crazy. Mm-hmm. Oh speaking of going viral

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:25.680
 Um, I think you lon said that they are going to do a refresh of the twitter algorithm

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:32.320
 Like github repo. Oh, is it never changed? I hadn't checked back in. Has it never changed since the first time?

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.880
 So he said that he said that it's like

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.640
 The word 30,000 was there I don't have to say 30,000 lines or 30,000 changes

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.920
 I don't know what it is and they're gonna be they're gonna be updating it

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:48.560
 And they said they made like a lot of changes recently because they were talking about how they're trying to make it so

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:55.200
 It's fine. They were like we're trying to make it so banger tweets go big even if it's not from a big account and i'm like

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:59.040
 There's a funny way to phrase it, but like yeah, that's actually what you want

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:04.000
 You just want the best content to go big even if it's from a smaller account

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.120
 Which I see how that's challenging. Don't they say that about tiktok like tiktok has that going for it?

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:13.520
 The most customizable algorithm in the world tiktok. Yeah. Oh really? Their stuff is so wild

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.520
 I just I don't even understand how it's so good

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:20.560
 I don't use it at all, but like what people I see people describe it or I see people using tiktok. I'm just like

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:28.720
 How does it know this well? Yeah, is it scary to you? Like is there like a china thing?

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:36.080
 Scary or something. I don't know what it feels like to me is it feels like there's so much content being produced that it's almost

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.360
 It's hard to differentiate the

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:44.720
 The app knowing what you like and just like generating it for you in real time

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.600
 From like it just finding because there's so much content being generated constantly

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:55.520
 So there's like by accident enough content for you. Yeah being generated every single day. Yeah

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.600
 And it's so wild because it's just so obvious, but

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:03.920
 I it never clicked for me before like I don't use these apps much

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.000
 But like my instagram for example

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.120
 It shows me a bunch of doberman videos because I have one I love doberman's and that's that's what i'll watch

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:15.920
 Yeah, and I had this weird I realized already I had this weird perception of it where i'm like

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:22.480
 Oh, like i'm watching all these videos and i'm like running out of doberman videos to watch and like because i've seen so many of them already

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.920
 Yeah, and it didn't click for me that oh, but there's like always new videos being made of doberman's

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.880
 Because there's always more doberman puppies. There's always like yeah

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:35.280
 You know more situations and i'm like i'm really never going to run out of this

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:39.840
 They're like making more than i can consume and that was different from the wave that my head had understood it before

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.800
 I was like there's a fixed amount of videos out there and i'm like slowly

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:48.960
 Consuming them all and eventually i'm not really going to have any but yeah, yeah, it's just weird to understand that's infinite

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.680
 There's some infinite content. Yeah, I love to hear began talk about content

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.560
 I'll never hear the word content again without thinking of began now

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:02.160
 All right, well, I really have to pee and I feel like maybe this was just not going to be as long

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.560
 I feel like we're both like need a nap or something maybe

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:11.120
 This is like the lowest energy focus. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's great. It's my voice sounds for podcast. It sounds amazing

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.120
 But yeah, it's probably wearing it out too

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:20.080
 It's been fun as always. Okay, get well. Get well soon. See you. See you next
