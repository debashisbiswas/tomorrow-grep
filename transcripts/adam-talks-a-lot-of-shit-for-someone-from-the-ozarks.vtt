WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400
 Oh god. The couch is wet. Oh. Yeah, I can't be outside. Unfortunately. Okay. Well, it was a nice

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.200
 trap. I'm sure you're wondering why Dax's couch is too wet to record. But before we get to that,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.600
 Adam woke me up at 5am on a Saturday morning to ask me to tell you, if you'd like to support

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.720
 Adam and Dax and this very podcast, you can do so by subscribing to their new monthly box called

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.840
 CRON. You can open up your terminal and type SSH terminal dot shop. Find out all the details there.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.240
 It promises to be the most entertaining thing you get every month when it shows up at your door.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.240
 And hey, maybe you're like me and your client wakes you up at 5am on a Saturday task you do

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.240
 something. What better way to recover from that early morning wake up than to receive a special

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.520
 flavor of a month blend themed around the topics and memes that drive tech culture. So visit terminal

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.360
 dot shop in your web browser or open up a terminal window and type SSH terminal dot shop for more

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:22.560
 details. We're doing it. We're doing it. You are not in America. I'm not in America. It's fine.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.720
 This is technically international travel. Do you care to share? I'm in the Dominican Republic.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:35.840
 I got here on Wednesday. We're here till Sunday. We're doing a big family vacation with Elizabeth

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:44.400
 family. It's actually hilarious because we have like 20 something people here. Wow. And so it's

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.240
 kind of cool because it's a resort, but it's not like a giant resort, which means when we're all

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:58.640
 together, we're just like this giant mob just taking over the whole place. And it's a rowdy mob.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.680
 So it's been pretty funny. And slash funny. Yeah, I can imagine. There were some like stereotypes

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.880
 I want to go down, but I'm not going to go down. But I can imagine what? Well, like a lot of people.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.040
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can imagine. I miss I miss this. But Liz was describing the situation where

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.800
 they were waiting to get on one of those like golf cart trolley transport things or whatever.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.560
 Yeah. They always have these resorts. And it was like 20 of them. And they had a boombox playing

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.520
 like Lao Latin music and they were like just being super rowdy and like her dad was dancing with

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.720
 her mom and they think it was crazy like Latin stuff. And they like were at the stop. And then

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.240
 there was like this Asian family of like it was like to like the grandparents and like the parents

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.680
 and the kids. Yeah. And they were just like sitting and like slowly just like edging away and clearly

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.800
 like where they were really overwhelmed by everything that was going on. Yeah. And it was just like a

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.960
 funny juxtaposition of a, you know, two different cultures. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah. The funny

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.800
 thing also is when when you have this many people at a resort this size, you just randomly run into

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.920
 people over and over. Like we're just going out and we just you see like your family members everywhere.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.160
 Yeah. It really feels like we just took over this place. So it's a lot of fun.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.040
 Yeah. I didn't know you were going. This was like a surprise to me. Did you tell me and I forgot?

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.200
 No, I also it was just one of those things where we had the New York stuff. And then I just knew

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.200
 this was after but like in my head nothing existed until, you know, like after that point in time.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.840
 Because there was so much focus and work. So yeah, I kind of forgot too. I want to talk. This is I

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.760
 feel like you'll never have a problem with this talk. I want to talk about SST because I've been

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.280
 using SST a lot and I have questions about like all of your plans because I'm just really how much

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.560
 I rely on it for like everything I do. The console super good better all the time. It's so cool to

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.240
 just have like all of my work is in the console at this point being able to find logs being able

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.960
 to find live stuff that's happening. Like I've got external parties testing stuff and just being

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.320
 able to watch the logs. It's so it's so nice. Everything is so nice. The auto deploys now.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.480
 Are you guys ever going to add? And this is this is where I don't know like where SST wants to focus

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.120
 where you three care about focusing because this is like one specific thing you deploy which is like

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.120
 web products. Do you ever plan to add like analytics stuff where I could just never use another

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.200
 external analytics party again and just have it in the console? Yeah, so I guess I'll give you like

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:51.120
 quick like overview where our heads at with a bunch of things. So the console itself the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.040
 for us spending time the console is always tricky because it is like the bottom

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.560
 thing in our funnel, right? There's like people out here best to if they're using the console they're

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.080
 like all the way towards the end. They're probably something like already deployed a production. Yeah,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.840
 and we need to have something there because that's like, you know, important. But

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.600
 it's hard like when you're like at the phase we are, we like it feels like we have to like

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.840
 work on the console again. I'd rather focus on like getting two times as many users at the top.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.160
 Yeah, it's like you already have us like us people using the console. You already sold us. So like,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.760
 yeah, focusing your three people effort towards growing that big number at the top of the funnel,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.560
 that makes sense. I think I've seen you tweet things like this and I wasn't smart enough at

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.120
 the time to know what you meant. Yeah, so it's like it's I think the thing that balances it out

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.880
 though is I'm an ST user. So when I can't do things on the console, I'm annoyed. You want to fix it?

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.720
 Yeah. Yeah, we improved it a lot over the past couple of months. I still feel like I want to

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.720
 improve it a lot more. But yeah, it's just like there's always attention. So the second thing is

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.800
 we obviously widen our scope a ton because with V3, you know, we support all different types of

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.960
 providers, et cetera. But we are kind of, I wouldn't say done, but it's just like we had a phase where

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.920
 we were like expanding wide just to make sure our stuff could work really well in all kinds of

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.400
 scenarios, test it all. But the next couple weeks, months are going to be back to focusing on AWS

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.920
 and making sure that there's lots of that's not very polished there as well. So we want to make

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.160
 sure we lock down the idea of this is going to be the best way to do AWS. We want to make sure that

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.000
 we don't like lose that as we kind of widen our focus a bit. Yeah, it's a good timing to shift over

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.480
 with all the new stuff too. There might be things that that changes or components you want to add

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:51.680
 stuff like I'd love the scale to zero config. And yep, like I've got databases, I just randomly like

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:58.320
 had this $200 AWS bill every month for like my personal account where I was doing, it's like

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.640
 where I was in pro AWS stuff. And then also it's like my stream overlays. There's like no traffic

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.960
 to any of that. And I realized like, Oh, it's because I have these databases spun up in every

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.360
 account. And then it's also the NAT gateways. I think the cluster I just saw in the, in your

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.840
 guy's little note on the cluster thing, it doesn't use NAT gateway in the new version or something.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.320
 I've got to update all my stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be with that. We found a nice upgrade path with the

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.720
 the NAT gateway stuff where you don't have to use it at all if you don't want to any kind of

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.720
 progressively add it in if you if you need it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that's actually one of the

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.160
 reasons we are shifting back to Polish and AWS stuff with all the cloud front, not really all

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.920
 the cloud front changes with that one big cloud front change of functions being able to change

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.440
 origins, the router stuff. Yeah. So like that just deserves us to go and look to see what this

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.880
 enables like such a wide range of things like all those weird astral limitations with the 25

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.960
 behavior stuff. Obviously that that could all be fixed, but also stuff like sharing a single CDN

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.960
 across multiple stages. So you deploy cloud front once and you can have like a sub domain for every

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.640
 PR like that type of thing. So yeah, I think we were doing another pass on all of our SSR sites

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.360
 with this new capability to see like how much better can we make things and what promises itself.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:17.040
 So yeah, that's like our current focus. But the thing you brought up of like the analytics thing.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.680
 So yes, that is falls, probably falls under a scope of stuff that we would want to do. If you

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.400
 look at what I'm working on with open auth right now, it's kind of in that category. It's taking

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.600
 something that typically is delivered as a host service and delivering it again as a host of

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:39.120
 services inside your account. So you spin it up and you get like dedicated endpoints for it and it

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.680
 looks the integration with it looks very similar to an integration you would do with Auth0,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.960
 but it's an on your infrastructure and integrates with the rest of our stuff. Analytics is obviously

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:57.120
 another thing like that. And we try to like find ways to do it that's a little bit unique since we

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.520
 can spin up any infrastructure we want in your account. And I think our equivalent for analytics

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.960
 would be so typically analytics is delivered as like a JavaScript tracking thing on the front end.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:16.080
 But because we have access to all of your infrastructure logs and everything, we can probably also

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:22.160
 source data that most analytics solutions can't. But like for you specifically, like what were you

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.200
 when you're having analytics like what are you what are you imagining? Yeah, just like I use

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:34.480
 I'm not going to name them because I don't want to I don't I use like Google analytics alternatives

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.200
 in the community. Yeah. Right now I don't know why I don't want to name I don't want to

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.880
 I don't want to come up and I'm like just moving off of them I guess because I like the people.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:49.360
 But just like having to have another thing outside of me is what I'm just laughing because

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.480
 there's like literally two options and I'm pretty sure like when you said I like that and I'm like

00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.560
 there's probably only one of these people you personally know. So it's obviously yeah. It's like

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:09.440
 I am I'm not going to want to name this PHP based analytics tool who I really like by the way they

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:18.080
 also do this a lot. Yeah. Anyway, no, I do like them. I just just like help you feel better about

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:23.920
 this. Yeah. A lot of our set is geared towards not being better than these products. It's just

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.360
 nice when they're kind of in the same place. So consolidated. Yeah. And all in my AWS account.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.840
 Yeah, exactly. So we build like a worse we will build a verse version of whatever you're using.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:41.680
 But like you might still use it just because it's adjacent. Yeah. Right. So just like high level.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.920
 This is not like I'm not even for stat news. I'm not even thinking for that use case because we

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.040
 have all kinds of custom stuff we do for analytics that I just don't imagine like a box off the

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:57.920
 box off the shelf box solution would work anyway. This is just like high level like what you get

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.200
 in Cloudflare. I think Cloudflare has like a basic analytics for web properties just to like know.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.240
 Oh, people actually hit this. That's basically it. Yeah. So I yeah, I think our approach is always

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.800
 hoping and this doesn't work out too much. But I think it could work out for this.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:19.920
 Hoping there is an open source effort in building something like this and just wrapping it in a

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.400
 really slick component that just you drop it and you just get it at an endpoint. And so Drizzle

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.240
 released their $1 stats thing. I don't know if you saw that. I don't even know if they announced

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.920
 it because I saw some like random account posting it but they didn't mention to me they were working

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.840
 on it. It's exactly that. It's like just a high overview of whatever at the end cost of $1 a

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.800
 month or something. I don't know if that's open source is probably not but there's probably some

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.680
 open source efforts around this. Yeah. So just wrapping that into your account and you just get it at

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:56.400
 analytics.mydomain.com or whatever. Yeah. I mean, that makes a lot of sense and

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:03.040
 it's nice for us because it's like pretty much every single company needs it. It's like so

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:10.640
 general. Yep. I will say you just a little word of advice. If this is helpful, this might be

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:17.200
 context I have server side versus like browser analytics are so wildly different. Maybe it's

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.880
 unique to stat means because we get a lot of like bots a lot of scraping our site but like our

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.680
 server side numbers if we go off our cloud front logs are so much larger than like actual browser

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.880
 sessions from something like I see Google analytics. Like when you narrow it to things that actually

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.600
 execute JavaScript, it's just a huge it's like half. I mean, it's a huge discrepancy. And again,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.280
 that might be just stat means is unique because we do again have a lot of that people trying to

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.400
 get our data and stuff. So I don't know if that colors. No, I think that make that, but I think

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.040
 that makes sense. I think it probably is good to do it from the browser. We could probably just

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.200
 put a flag on our SSR site. So you say analytics true and then we could just inject the

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.680
 JavaScript. Yeah, just inject in there. That's so cool. You guys can do like anything like that,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.440
 which is super cool. Yeah, we have a nice entry point to all this stuff. Like other people,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.520
 what's cool about it? And maybe this is just infrastructure nerd stuff that no one cares about.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:16.480
 But it's cool because if you did that, you decided I want to inject like actual JavaScript into your

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.000
 sites, there might be like infrastructure level things that still have to be done to like allow

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.880
 that traffic or something. And you guys can do that too. Like you can also modify cloud front

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:33.280
 behaviors or something to like you can work front to back in a way that if you're not doing what

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.120
 SSC is doing, which is like the whole thing, all the infrastructure deployment, all that stuff,

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.160
 you can't do that. Like someone who just hands you a JavaScript library, they're kind of the like

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.120
 whims, they're the holding to your infrastructure and how you deploy and all that. Anyway,

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.720
 yeah, exactly. That's cool. Historically, if you wanted to distribute something open source,

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.880
 you can only distribute a library and then that kind of limits the type of stuff you can distribute

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.280
 or you have to like give them crazy instructions on like, right, you got to have instructions per

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.200
 like place that can put their thing. And you guys don't have that problem.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:12.160
 Yeah. So if you look at open off, so the way we set it up is we still expect most you to like

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.200
 own most of your data in your main database, but we needed some amount of state, just so like a

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.840
 basic key values or type of things or store like refresh tokens and things like that.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.480
 You don't need access to that. It can just basically be a black box. Yep. If it was just a

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.640
 library, we would have to make an adapter for use an adapter for Redis and for my

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:38.960
 SQL and for both your database. But then for us, we're like, if you're on AWS, it's just going

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.080
 to be a DynamoDB table. It's never something you have to ever look into. So it's kind of invisible

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.760
 to you. If you're on Cloudflare, just Cloudflare, KV. So we need to implement those too. And then

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:54.240
 we're good because we can ship the infrastructure with a library, basically. So yeah, we haven't

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.880
 taken advantage of it too much, but that's kind of like the grand vision of like what we can

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.840
 eventually do. Yeah, more random, just like questions for you. One, have you ever considered,

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.560
 maybe this is a huge hurdle, but like billing through our AWS account, I feel like some third

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.520
 parties have done that, but it'd be cool if the console could just, yeah, that would be even better,

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:18.000
 because then it really is like, we just pay our AWS bill every month. And we can imagine all these

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.960
 things coming under the fold of SST, like analytics and all that, and it's just like one bill. That

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.880
 would be awesome. Well, our create, okay, so not only is that good for you guys, we are highly

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:34.880
 motivated to do that because of the way that AWS Negotiates contracts, it's now like committed

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:41.040
 spend, right? So if you committed spend a million dollars a year with them, us being part of that

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.880
 bill counts to that. So going through the procurement process for these giant enterprise companies,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.920
 there's basically no procurement process. They don't have to go like do any of that typical

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.680
 stuff, which could take like six months to a year. So that AWS marketplace thing is like,

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.840
 is very, very, very cool, because it kind of solves the enterprise sales problem.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:10.240
 The other thing we really want to do is, okay, so it's not easy to get that set up. We should,

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.880
 because we're, you know, there's we have such a good reason to. Once we have that set up,

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:21.440
 we might as well have our own marketplace on there as well. So if somebody distributes apps

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:27.360
 using SST, so there's a few apps out there that are like kind of the type of things that we build,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.480
 but other people have built them where it's open source or like maybe you even pay for it,

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.040
 and I guess you've distributed to your account. Yeah, I would love to just see an app store one

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:43.040
 day in the SC console that's like installing. Yes, like if someone else built open auth,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.440
 like that someone else could have built an auth solution, and that's like in your marketplace,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.120
 you can turn that on. Oh, that's a great point. And we'd all just get built through the same

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.440
 if if there is building associated with it, it can just get built to the same. Yeah, kind of

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:01.840
 interface. So it would be an app store that would be multi cloud, which I think is a pretty

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:09.200
 like unique. Oh, yeah, this is cool. What if like, yeah, what if the incumbents had motivation,

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.040
 like, well, why wouldn't clerk want to have an auth thing that you could deploy into your AWS

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.960
 account through SST like, yeah, exactly. Just like they view SST users as this whole other bucket of

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.880
 sales potential. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it's like, it should, I mean, in the most extreme view,

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.760
 like, why wouldn't that just be the default? Because you eventually have to build that anyway,

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:35.200
 because as soon as you hit enterprise, they're going to want the stuff in their account. So you

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.680
 might as well start with the platform that's you'd do that from day one, and we can build then like

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:45.280
 SDKs for all kinds of things like, I mean, billing for one, but like, just all sort of common

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.800
 problems when you're deploying some into other people's accounts, like monitoring it, doing updates,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:56.320
 like all kinds of stuff. Yeah, this is a great idea. SST was a good idea. Good job, guys.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:03.040
 Like, I can see the future for like, that everything before this, it's like the whole

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:08.880
 generation of dev tool companies before this was so like, agnostic to infrastructure.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.280
 And this just seems like the most obvious, well, what if we weren't, what if we weren't

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.960
 agnostic? What if we also included your infrastructure in the thing? Is that kind of the bet? I mean,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.720
 that's the like thing that is unique. Yeah, I think we basically are most extreme bet is that

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.480
 delivering software as a service is not like a permanent long term thing. And we're betting that

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.480
 we can make that change or think of that change happens. And if it does,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.520
 obviously massive win would show up if you do that. The other thing that changed a lot,

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.160
 which makes us possible is if you think about why you were paying for a SaaS before, it was a

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.840
 combination of two things. They wrote a bunch of code that you don't have. It's like close source,

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.480
 and they wrote it, they put in the time and effort investment to write it. But once it's written,

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:59.280
 like, obviously there's updates, but roughly like once it's written, it can be deployed a

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.360
 billion times over like it's, it's no more investment needs to go into it. But the reason you pay them

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:12.240
 monthly is because they also deal with the operations of running that code. So spinning up the database,

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.440
 like all that economics of scale, you're just renting a small portion of whatever infrastructure

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.800
 that they have. So that's why software service made sense. It wasn't just for the software,

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:27.280
 it was also for like the operations of running it. But if cloud primitives become more and more

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:34.080
 self-running, where like AWS is basically can do all that for you, you start to pay companies

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:39.760
 just for their code, right? Like a lot of modern companies have, they're not managing infrastructure

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:45.440
 at all, they're just using managed infrastructure themselves. So you're only paying for code now.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.320
 So that means anyone that can produce the code can produce a competitor. So I think

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:57.200
 that that should has also happened where, yeah, like the miles around us have to change because

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.360
 the moment something open source clones you, and it's just easy to self-host it because the

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:08.480
 operations are basically the same, you're not a problem. Yeah, elastic. Yeah, there's probably a

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.520
 dozen examples. Is that fit what you're saying? Oh, yeah, for sure. Like anytime like something

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:19.040
 gets cloned by a big cloud, it's, it's that it's just, there's already like the biggest company in

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:27.520
 the world offering here we deal with operations for you. Yeah, as a service. So it's hard to also

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.520
 sell product being like, oh yeah, and then we deal with the operations for you. Yep, makes sense.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:38.080
 I just thought of another random idea. This was one while we've been talking of things I want in

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:46.080
 this SST marketplace, or maybe I want you guys to build it. Like a simple cost explorer, a simple

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:54.000
 like AWS spend diagnostics. Oh man, if you guys do that, and you just do the like SST version that's

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.720
 super simple and very easy to parse, because like I've spent a decade in the AWS billing and

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.800
 management console or whatever. So I have like some experience, but it's still overwhelming.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.440
 And I spill, I still spend way more time just for some basic information I want, like a top down,

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:15.600
 like single page overview of my AWS spend. Oh man, I'm getting really excited about SST.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.880
 Can I invest, you guys are going to do another round, right? Can we talk about that on a podcast?

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.920
 Is that a thing that could be talked about? We might do another round in January. Yeah.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.960
 Oh, I just realized I said you guys are. I don't know if that's something I can say.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:35.760
 Maybe you say the thing about Chris. Okay. Because if I say it, it's fine. I mean,

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.960
 nothing where it's like very early. We're just exploring. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.600
 Or options, but. Wink, Wink, let me know. I might want to. That'd be weird if I was one of your

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:51.440
 investors. I'd be an annoying investors. Is that a conflict of interest? No, I don't know.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:22:01.120
 I don't know anything about this. Yeah, that's right. I knew that. I mean,

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.720
 I would be like a needy investor. I would not be like them money. I would be like,

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.400
 I'd be checking in all the time. I'd be super annoying. Like, where's the quarterly update?

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:14.400
 I need a quarterly update. We actually do monthly updates, so you'd be free. Look at you guys.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.760
 I'm going to write like a $10,000 check and I'm going to be the most needy person on the cap table.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:23.360
 Just watch me. The thing is like, I don't think it would be worth the investment because we're just

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.840
 a little bit further along for like it to make sense for individual investments, you know?

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.840
 Sure. Yeah. This is where the big money, the institutions come in.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:38.000
 Big boys with their spenders. If you're saying that you're going to invest in it and be annoying,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.560
 then clearly you're getting an ROI there that's not like monetary related. So it's about the

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:52.000
 relationship. I want to be close to the SST people. That's all. But anyway, all this stuff,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.040
 again, sounds really good, but yeah, we're still like a long ways off from seeing if it's actually

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.160
 going to work out or like, there's like a lot that still needs to be put into place. Yeah.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.800
 Yeah, the stuff just takes forever. It's like building anything takes such a long time.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.600
 Yeah. Well, yeah. And there's just three of you. Do you guys feel like it'll always just be the

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.960
 three of you? Do you ever think about like, we're definitely hitting our limits in terms of what

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.480
 we can do is three. I'm really proud of how much we've done as three. And I think it's really good

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.840
 to like just push ourselves. Can I say I'm very proud of what you guys, yeah, like when I see like

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.160
 blog posts and stuff that are so well done and like the fact that you guys have time to do that

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.720
 kind of stuff and build all this, it's kind of insane. Sorry, I cut you off. Yeah, no, I think it's

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.760
 like it's, I've always wanted to be able to say like, oh yeah, well, I'm on a team where everyone

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.960
 looks at it and they're like, how the hell are they doing all this stuff? And I feel like we've hit

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:50.400
 that bar. But there's just like a ceiling, like I was terms of, I'm sure there's another team of

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:55.520
 three that can do more than we can. But in terms of where we are, I feel like we've been as clever

00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.160
 as we can and found the leverage and did all that stuff. And we're definitely at our limits of how

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.280
 much we can do. And I think our ambition is like, it's like hitting up against our vision of what we

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:11.360
 want to do. I think the thing that suffers is, I don't think you just cannot do with a small team

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:17.760
 is polish. Like, I'm pretty proud of how much polish we do given our size. But I mean, the console

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.280
 feels polished to me. That's because we just did a round of polish on it. It was kind of been like

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:29.600
 not a great state for a little bit. Yeah. So, but like other other companies that are a lot bigger.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:34.480
 Yes, when I look at them, like there's they have like a whole team for something that is should not

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:41.280
 even be like a one full time role. But upside from that is you never get something that feels like

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.920
 unpolished. So like, obviously we don't want to rotate to that extreme, but you know, adding one

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.400
 more person. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, but would yeah, would it be weird to like,

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.840
 have a non founder involved at this point? Like, would it feel weird for you guys?

00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:01.680
 I'm technically not a founder. So, it's, yeah, yeah, bigger, like, you've been there a long time.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.960
 Yeah. And that's, I mean, it's more like a me personality thing. I've been there for a long time.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.160
 And when I work on something, I like, I'm going to treat it the same

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.640
 wave as I'm technically a founder or not. And obviously, I was like, they're super early. So,

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.960
 it's a little bit different. So yeah, it is going to be weird when we add someone, like,

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:22.080
 like that dynamic, like just having like a new employee is weird on its own.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.720
 You'll have to start wearing a shirt on the calls. I mean,

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:31.440
 yeah. That would hurt. That's actually what I was going to bring up. Like, we have such a

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:37.680
 tight dynamic that it's just so, it feels just so scary adding a fourth person,

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:42.240
 because it's going to like reset our dynamic a little bit for a while. Just like, as we,

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.800
 like, suss everything out and like fall into a new flow. And so, it's always scary and feels like

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:54.560
 you might, you might lose something. So, yeah. And that's what's also slowed down us ever,

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.240
 bringing out another person we just want to like, I just want to bring on something that I already

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.400
 know. Like, if you join the team, that would be great. I was just like, no worry about that.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:07.920
 All that stuff. When can I start? I'll build the analytics and the billing thing.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.680
 Yeah, perfect. Things I want.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:17.840
 I mean, I just work on things I want to. That's really all that happens. It's like,

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.080
 isn't it so weird that our roadmap and things I want just happen to always coincide? Like,

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:30.080
 what a weird, fun coincidence. I just, I want to say, I ask you a lot of questions and then I

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.960
 interrupt you immediately. And I just remembered some comment I read across one of our platforms,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:40.240
 maybe YouTube, where someone was like, bro, stop cutting DAX off, like chill. And it's in my head.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.800
 Every time I cut you off, it's in my head. I do all the time. I'm sorry.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.480
 No, but the thing is, you cut me off because I'm long winded. It's like, it's fine. Don't worry

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.200
 about that. It's just me both. It's like immediately. It's like immediately after ash. I'll be like,

00:26:53.200 --> 00:27:01.520
 so DAX, what do you think about this? But then, I don't let you actually ignore that comment.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.240
 Okay. You heard it here. DAX gave me permission to interrupt him all I want.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.760
 SSC is great. That's all. That's what the segment was. I'm a big fan. And it's so cool to look at the

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.880
 little workspace drop down in the console. And it's like, stat news, terminal. And then like,

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.120
 my personal stuff is just cool. That's like my whole world digitally. And it's all here in the

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.400
 console now. And I can go to logs and I can, I don't have to think about like, just launching

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.440
 something new. I just did a little side project at stat news the other day. And it's so nice to

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.920
 like hook it up in the console and just know like, I never have to open the cloudwatch thing to try

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.560
 and figure out like, is this getting activity? I can just go to the log thing. I can watch the live

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.120
 log. It's so nice. And you guys aren't doing a whole lot yet. Like, you're still early in the

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:51.680
 console. And it's still so useful. So keep doing stuff. It's nice. I just I just keep track of one

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.320
 night and open AWS console, because I still end up having to go other a bunch. The billing thing is

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:01.040
 is a big one. I'm always in there to like figure out cost stuff. So obviously, if I'm in there a

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:08.080
 bunch, we need to do a feature for that. Our log stuff, I've always been like, it's an okay

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.320
 thing right now. I think it's particularly useful for what you're talking about where you're building

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.600
 something new. And it's like not fully in production yet. And you're just trying to like good stuff.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.640
 It's not very good when you have like production traffic, because there's no like search and stuff

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:25.520
 that you kind of expect from a login tool. So we need to add that stuff. We are like constrained

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:31.440
 by, because we don't we try to just build on top of what AWS gives you. CloudWatch insights,

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:37.360
 obviously, is constrained to, you know, certain capabilities. That said, they haven't announced

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.160
 anything with this yet, but they did one small announcement where before when you wanted to search

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.000
 across your logs, you're limited to 50 log groups at once, which always sucks. You have to like

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.640
 click them all. Yeah, just like all of them. You can search across at like all of them, which is

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:56.240
 great. And I noticed this and later Frank bought brought it up independently. So I think it might

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:01.680
 be true. I'm like, these results are coming back a lot faster. It feels like, because it was kind

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.080
 of slow before. And it feels like I'm getting like search results pretty quickly. And the reason we

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:11.040
 never wrapped it, that search functionality was because it felt like kind of slow and not great.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:16.560
 Too slow. Yeah. Yeah. But now it's kind of good. So maybe it's worth like doing another

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:22.080
 pass it and seeing if we can expose the search functionality. The thing for me is,

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:29.840
 okay, so if I search for a log, let's say I'm looking for, I log out event dot user created,

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:36.000
 when a user is created or something like that. I search it and I get a bunch of results.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.400
 Every single time it sees that. But I don't care about a bunch of results.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.720
 I like want to find one I'm looking for and then immediately see the logs above and below it.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:51.280
 Yeah. And CloudWatch makes that kind of annoying to do. So if we just nail that flow, I think then

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.080
 it's pretty good as like a general purpose logging thing. Yeah. Maybe you don't need to ship it to

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:02.160
 somewhere else. Yeah, we'll say I don't really use the logs feature at Stat Muse so much like on

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:08.480
 our website. But I do like, I know that the issues will show all the function failures. That's huge.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.000
 And that kind of like, circumvents my like, I don't even know what I would look for in the logs.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.200
 I'm just looking for like where our scale is stuff breaking. We also hit that limit a lot,

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:22.240
 though, where I have to like, click the button to refresh because we have too much going on.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.840
 Yeah. Well, okay. So the other thing is we're going to move issue processing into your own

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.560
 account, at which point there's going to be no limits. Oh, so right now it's in your account.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.960
 Yeah. So that's the one thing we did. Nice. More in a traditional SaaS way. Yeah.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.960
 The log subscriber goes to our account. That's where a lot of our bills come from. So well,

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.600
 I just put it in the user's account. Oh, yeah. So every time I click that button to re-enable,

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.840
 I'm like costing you money. I'm sorry. No, no, it's like a feature you're paying for. So,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.760
 yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. But if you could move into our account, that'd be great to not

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.880
 have to click that button because I don't even know what that means. I just click it every time I see

00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:00.640
 it. Yeah. We hit some threshold and like, I'm like, I want all the logs. So I click it. Yeah.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:05.280
 So, but see, these are just things that come up from a traditional SaaS thing. It's like,

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.760
 okay, I have a centralized service with all my customers. But then like, I have this one

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.000
 customer that sends me a ton of stuff and they're kind of breaking our pricing model and this other

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.600
 customer is somehow like under our threshold, but they're like traffic patterns are weird. So like,

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.720
 they're kind of breaking our pricing model in another way. And how do we juggle free tier?

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.920
 Yeah. Yeah. All those problems go away. We just put that shit into your account.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:30.720
 And it's yeah, no limits. Whatever you use, you pay for at the literally the cheapest possible rate

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.800
 because you're paying directly to the infrastructure provider. Yeah. It's just makes a lot of sense.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.240
 I'm remembering, like, I'm remembering times now when we first turned on some of the Stephanie

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.880
 stuff where you'd be like, Hey, we're getting this error like 10,000 times. Do you like want to

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.280
 have that error? Like, and it's stuff that we just we just ignore it. Like, we're pretty small team

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.960
 too. So there's stuff that like, we could fix it in like 10 minutes, but we don't. And I just think

00:31:52.960 --> 00:32:00.160
 now, like, is that costing you guys money? That's what's flawed about this model, right? It's just like,

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:05.600
 you are you effectively just become like a dumb compute storage provider at the end of the day.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.240
 Issue detecting part is not where energy goes to. Like, we're not spending our time making

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.320
 that stuff better. It can be way better. We're spending our time like looking at our kinesis

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:19.280
 situation and figuring out how to optimize it. So again, last generation of companies,

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:25.760
 that's how they all got big. Right. But I don't know if replaying that is so gonna work out nowadays.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:32.880
 Anyways, trying to transition into anything else. I don't know. We could talk about us to see the

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:38.640
 hubs out. I don't care. No, this is a good, good summary of what's going on. Have you been to

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:45.120
 the making republic? You haven't been to Caribbean. I've been I've been to the Baja Peninsula, Mexico

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:51.840
 for a week. That's my international exposure in that Gulf area. Yeah, like south of San Diego,

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:58.560
 not golf, sorry, like the Pacific side. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You should go to Caribbean. It's great.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.800
 I should. Yeah. Oh, well, you know what? Never mind. I've been to the Bahamas. Is that international?

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:08.560
 I think so. It's in the Caribbean, right? Yeah. I mean, it's like it's confusing because Puerto Rico

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:16.560
 is not international, technically. Oh, Puerto Rico is like a US country. We flew first class.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:22.560
 And I was horizontal the whole time, because it was an international flight. So it was like,

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:28.080
 and it was actually one of those like it lays down. Yeah. Yeah. So it was like had the reclining

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.480
 thing. And then we got to blank it. And it was great. Because our flight was at a, we have to

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:37.680
 get to airport like five a.m. or four a.m. So we just didn't sleep. That sucks. Yeah. How long

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:42.480
 of a flight is that? I wouldn't have thought to the well, what's stuck? I want this flight to

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.840
 never end because I want to milk this first class experience for as much as I can because like first

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:53.520
 class, I'm I mostly fight domestic and I'm just like, yeah, I'll get like the nicer seat, like the

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:58.640
 seat that has a more legroom. And I'm like sitting right behind first class. And it's like, to me,

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:05.520
 that feels like like a 20% gap, I would say for like twice. Yeah, it's not a huge like the comfort

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.360
 plus versus first class. Yeah, it's not a huge difference. Yeah, it's like they treat you a little

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:14.400
 bit nicer. Like it's about it. Yeah, they serve food, I guess, like I never take any of the food or

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:19.120
 drink. So like, I don't get that benefit. But this was an international life. That's different.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:25.680
 Those Caribbean and it was like giant, like a massive difference. Like it was so nice. And the

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.200
 people were the staff was really great. So it was definitely worth it. I think the only time I've had

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:34.000
 a plane. Is it just the size of the plane that makes for that first class experience? It was an

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.960
 it was an LA to New York. That's the only time I've seen those like lay down seats. And they're

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.520
 like all individual. It's like you have a little cockpit you're in. Yeah, is that the kind of was?

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:49.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those are so great. Yeah. And then it was, uh, yeah, they just had,

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:54.640
 it was great. I think I barely got any sleep that night. And I was like, this is perfect. So I was

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.680
 only at two and a half flight and I was like, I wish it was like a five or flight so I could

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:04.000
 put it in. It would have been more expensive. So it makes sense. Yeah. So I hate not flying first

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.240
 class and I'll tell you why. I'm mostly fly first class because not because I'm bougie,

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:15.920
 which I am too, but I have broad shoulders. I mean, I'm a big guy. Oh, yeah, big. That's true. Yeah,

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.160
 I always think about that. It's not the knee. Everyone always thinks like, oh, you're hitting

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.800
 your knees on the seat and coach. No, it's the shoulder to shoulder. I'm always with some other

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:30.160
 giant male and like we're both one of us has to like, yeah, from exactly we're flying from the

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:34.880
 Midwest. I have to like either lean forward or he has to lean forward. Like one of us, we can't

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.600
 step side to side. Like we're shoving each other this way. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.160
 That's why I fly first class because the width of the seats is so much better. It's not about the

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.480
 depth. I don't care about who's in front of me. You can lay your seat back in my lap. There's only

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:55.840
 two seats per column or whatever. There's so much wider. And I always like, feel like I could

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.200
 actually get my laptop out. And sometimes I do. I get my laptop out and I can actually do something

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:04.000
 in first class. In the back, there's no way it's impossible. That's crazy because I work. So it's

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.480
 an ROI. I work on my lots of all the time in the normal seats. So it's a huge difference. I think

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:19.280
 most of the time, because I'm like, if you're huge, like this is impossible. Like I'm like just barely okay. So I'm not I'm like a normal

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.760
 sized person. If you're bigger than me, like, that sucks. And it doubles us because it's not like

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:29.600
 your income correlates to your height. You can just still not have a lot of money.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:35.360
 No, right. This is a big tax. Yeah. It's just like so arbitrary. It was in some like crazy car

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.960
 the other day. And I was just imagining like Shaquille O'Neal being in this car. I'm like, oh,

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:45.200
 just literally would not be able to do it. Thank God. It's a super rich basketball player, you know.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.680
 Yeah. Think if you're like, if you're an NBA player, you're this giant person, and you're really in the

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.880
 cars, you can't just like do the J Leno thing and own all these tiny cars. You just wouldn't fit and

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.640
 suck. No, it sucks. I guess you could own them just to look at them like matchbox cars.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:07.040
 Collect them. Yeah. You probably need to get custom cars, like even if it's not like a even

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:11.520
 just like an SUV is probably not enough for him. Like, and almost you'd be probably so wouldn't fit.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.920
 Yeah. For someone that's seven foot two or whatever. Yeah. It's impossible. Like, did he ever

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.800
 fly a car? Is he like allowed to fly economy? Oh, maybe not weight and balance. Like, if you like

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.920
 want to move from one side of the plane to the other, they're like, hang on, we'll have to check

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.400
 with the pilots because weight and balance is like, I'm 200 pounds. Like, what is the plane that

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:33.280
 delicate? Oh, I've never heard that. You never heard that? That sounds like an excuse, they say.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:37.840
 It probably is, but they like, they'll say when someone wants to move because it's like not a full

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.840
 flight and then want to move to the other side to be in the aisle or whatever, just because there's

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.440
 like two people on one side and there's nobody on there. So it's like, I want to switch. If they've

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.960
 already done the weight and balance, like the pilots have already like done that whatever step

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.280
 it is, they're like, we'll have to check because, I don't know, the plane's going to crash.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:58.000
 You should ask your brother if it's real. I'm going to ask him because that's scary if it's that

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.080
 sensitive, like the one person moving across the aisle would like throw the plane into a

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:09.440
 tailspin or something. I wasn't even thinking about that. I was just saying like, is it,

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:15.680
 if Shaquille knows, buys a single economy seat, he probably is not going to physically fit and

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:21.600
 whoever would see next to him is just completely screwed. Oh, maybe he could probably buy two seats.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.040
 Yeah, he can, but do they force you to? That's my question. I think they might force you to.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.000
 They have to have a policy there. How would they know, like they could book the full flight,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.560
 like, they don't ask your height and wait when you buy a ticket, right?

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.640
 That'd take you off. Basically, they're like, you're too large. We can't fly you. And I'm sure

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.880
 they're allowed to do that. Yeah. I mean, now he probably like flies private every time he flies.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.040
 But there was a point in Shaq's life when he was seven foot two and he was young and he didn't have

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:53.360
 money and he probably had to fly. I'd like to know this story everywhere. Maybe like John Madden.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.000
 Do you ever heard the story of John Madden? No, what is that?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.720
 I'm just bouncing all over the question. John Madden was like, do you know who he was?

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:06.880
 He was a football coach. Yeah. Yeah. He refused to fly. He was terrified of flying. Like, would

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.760
 not get in a plane. So he had the Madden is like this giant bus that I can't remember the name of,

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:16.480
 the man mobile. I don't know. I just say they drove everywhere. He, I mean, he was a commentator.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.840
 He was going to every like city in America every week and they drove a bus all over the country

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:27.680
 for him to do. That's so crazy. Yeah. Yeah. I think Travis Barker, who's a drummer,

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:34.480
 he was in some crazy plane crash. I think he was like a, it was like a commercial

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.400
 point. It wasn't like a problem. Oh, geez. And like all this skin burns. There's something

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.720
 crazy like brutal thing and he just never flies ever anymore. Yeah. He drives everyone.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.800
 It always is weird when you hear of a plane crash where people survive. You just assume

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:52.960
 a plane crash dead. Like everyone dies. Every time I imagine a plane crash, I'm going to survive it.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:58.560
 Really? I'm going to survive. I'm going to clench my abs at the right moment and it's not saving me.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:10.320
 That's hilarious. There's that woman that fell. What was it? It's this crazy. Have you heard this?

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.000
 It was on Twitter at some point falling out of a plane. Yeah. She was like tied to,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.040
 she was strapped her seat and her seat fell 30,000 feet and she lived. Like what in the world?

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.600
 And then she had to like survive in the Amazon for like, how long do you know what I'm talking

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:31.200
 about this specific person on the Amazon? Damn. It was like a jungle. I don't don't quote me on

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:37.920
 Amazon. Okay. But she fell in like the trees, they think like broke or fall or something. I don't know.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:43.120
 I don't know how you call 30,000 feet and live, but you could see it, huh?

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:49.120
 I could see it. But then she like lived with some tribe and like it's this crazy story.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:55.760
 Yes. Who is this person? Oh, I feel bad. She was like a god because she like fell.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:01.840
 Yeah. No, seriously, she was like praise. Hang on. Woman falls from plane and lives.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.840
 Oh, here we go. Here we go.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:15.760
 Vezna volofa chick. 510 aborted. We flight attendant. I'm guessing January 1970.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:20.000
 Hang on. Hang on. Yes. The classic Russian plane flying over the Amazon. It wasn't the Amazon.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.240
 I'm sorry. I screwed that part up. Is this the one I'm thinking of?

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:34.080
 I'm sorry. This is not the one. This lady like survived in a jungle. Was she pregnant?

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.680
 Choose. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. This story are there. Here we go. Yes.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:44.000
 Juliane Copka. This is one of the most wild things I've ever in my life. German Peruvian

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 man, I'm going to survive the plane crash. Peruvian Peruvian Amazon rainforest in 1971.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.200
 Soul survivor of lands of flight 508, which disintegrated in mid-air after being struck by

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:58.720
 lightning. Oh, yeah. New fear unlocked, by the way, apparently lightning disintegrated.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:05.120
 What do we disintegrated? That is the word they used. Well, Gemini used it. Maybe Gemini's wrong.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:10.000
 She fell 10,000 feet while strapped to her seat in the jungle, survived 11 days in the jungle,

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.880
 eating sweets from the wreckage and using survival skills she learned from her zoologist parents.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:20.960
 What are the odds? The soul survivor of a plane crash over the Amazon had zoologist parents.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.240
 Actually, maybe pretty high because if you're flying over the Amazon, maybe it's because you

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:29.120
 live near the Amazon, your parents, zoologists. I don't know. Risked by local lumberjacks after

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:34.720
 finding their camp, recovered in a Peru hospital later. Okay, wait, such is more to this story.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.560
 I feel like there is. That's crazy. That's crazy. I don't need any more than that.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:43.600
 Okay. She might have been pregnant and there may have been something about worshiping her or

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:51.760
 something. I don't know. Look it up. The lumberjacks worshiped her. Yeah. That's crazy. But yeah,

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:56.400
 I would survive. I would also survive. You totally would, little bro. If anyone would survive,

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:02.800
 it would be little bro himself. I knew you changed your name to that. I saw it,

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:11.840
 but I just saw this morning why you changed it. So funny. I know. It's a, that was a funny

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.280
 situation yesterday. I was a little surprised that he called you little bro. I feel like,

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:21.040
 that was, was it aggressive or was it in context not so aggressive? I would say it is aggressive,

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:26.560
 but it's just mostly the thing he does where he tries to like just do internet talk. You know,

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.640
 he does a lot. Like he was just putting the word cracked into everything like a few months ago.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:36.640
 Hello fellow kids. He's just trying so hard to fit in. Anyway, the one thing I'll say is,

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:42.880
 you guys all know how good I am in talking shit. It took a lot of mercy in me to not

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:48.560
 say anything back to him because when someone that's four feet tall calls you little bro,

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:56.560
 there's a lot of things you can say back to. Oh, wow. Well, you just did it in the mercy that you had.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:01.200
 No, I didn't. I said I didn't do that, but you did just now on the podcast.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.920
 This is I didn't. I didn't. I said I didn't do that.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:11.360
 I don't think that's how it works. I did. You're lucky. I didn't call you a

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:18.640
 shithead. You're lucky. I didn't. It's funny. I'm getting more comfortable with saying shit

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:23.360
 apparently. That's like the second time on this podcast that I said it if it doesn't get edited

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:29.360
 out. I'm confused because I like, I'm pretty sure you curse. Yeah, no, I do. You're not someone

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.080
 that doesn't curse. So is it something you like withhold when you're in public or like,

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.840
 what is the deal here? What's like your rubric for it? You know, I'm learning about my a lot

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:44.320
 about myself. Uh, I'm still not the same person with every person I interact with. Does that make

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:51.920
 sense? Yeah. Then it's probably normalish. Yeah. Uh, so I think I like there's a public persona of

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:59.280
 me that doesn't curse maybe. Even when I do curse though, it does sound unnatural. I'll say that.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.440
 I spent most of my life not cursing. I'm one of those people that like grew up in a very conservative

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:09.440
 home and, and then like graduated high school and it's like, oh, I can say words. I'm going to say

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:14.640
 them. You know what I mean? Like it just sounds so forced when I do curse. I think I type curse a

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:20.960
 lot more than I speak. Does that make sense? I see. Yeah. Uh, like it's in me. It wants to come out,

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:26.240
 but my lips just don't have a lot of practice. So it sounds like it just sounds weird when it

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.640
 comes out. I don't know. It's funny. I have the opposite problem where like, I really like the idea

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:37.520
 of being someone that doesn't, that doesn't curse. Yeah. But I literally don't know how to punctuate

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:43.200
 certain things without doing it. Like it's just so, it's just dramatic effect. It really adds

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:50.000
 something to language. Yeah. It does. I can't make jokes and I can't do like certain jokey tones

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.480
 without like throwing that in there. Yeah. I can just look at Northeast thing like it's

00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:00.240
 it's impossible. So yeah, I don't think I can stop. No, it's hard. There's, there's no other,

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:05.680
 yeah, there's no other way to land certain points or to like dramatic effect emphasis.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.920
 It's usually humor. It's not it's just not. Yeah. For me, it's like, if I don't curse,

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.080
 I don't have a sense of humor. So it's, it's hard. Yeah. I get it.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:19.680
 No, it's something that Casey and I, I think started doing together in the last few years,

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:24.960
 where we will just like, it's just like parenting. There's stuff that just, you just need to curse

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:31.360
 sometimes. And it, we always say like, after a good one lands, it's like, man, that added a lot

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:35.680
 to our life. Like just reintroducing cursing. I think I did in high school and then like,

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:40.720
 didn't for a while again, and then we're back at it. I don't know. It's an interesting phenomenon,

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.240
 but it still sounds weird on the podcast. Cause I think on the podcast, I'm, I'm kind of the

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:49.920
 part of me that doesn't curse. If that makes sense, I don't know why I'm just talking to you. I kind

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:57.280
 of care, but there's people to listen. That's why I just remembered. Yeah. Like I don't curse on my

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:02.960
 stream either. I kind of have like a persona in, in certain contexts where I'm like the Midwestern

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:09.520
 guy that is a certain way. I don't know. That is who you are. So I'd like to just be the one person.

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:14.320
 That'd be nice. It feels very nice to just be one person. You know, you're just a little Midwestern

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:21.840
 bitch. Hmm. Is that my persona? I'll take it. Okay. I'm just kidding. I don't know how to make a

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:32.800
 joke without cursing. There's also like kids around like, I don't want my kids to just start.

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:38.080
 I don't know why though. I don't know if I don't want my kids to say words that are offensive to

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:43.520
 like their teachers. That would be bad. Yeah. I talked to Elizabeth about this a lot because both

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:47.520
 of us curse and we're like, okay, how are we going to, we have this guy's in conversation.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:52.400
 Like our kids, we need to modify what we say so they don't pick up on that stuff. And obviously,

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:57.760
 the next question is like, why does it matter? It's just a word. Yeah. And ultimately, the explanation

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.680
 is like not satisfying to me. It's the point where like, I don't know if I buy it. It's just,

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:07.360
 there's a social norm and it's embarrassing when your kid curses and the norm is kids don't do that.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:12.640
 It's that simple. It's so funny when they curse. It's so funny. It's really funny curses.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:19.920
 So how am I not going to laugh? Yeah. So my five year old, he is not the clearest of speakers.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.920
 Like Asa at his age was way clearer. Like everything he said sounded like an adult. Archie has a bit

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:32.480
 of a like, I don't know, baby is unto his speak. And there's sometimes where he's saying a different

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:38.400
 word, but it comes out as a curse word. And it is hilarious. Yeah. Like that is the peak of our week.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:43.840
 So yeah, it is funny that it's this thing that's like, you don't want your kid to curse to somebody

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:49.120
 that just feels awkward and embarrassing. But when they do it at home, it is the funniest thing.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:56.400
 And yeah, why is it's funny? Like, I can go to the root of it. Like, why does it matter what words

00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:01.760
 we say? And then I know, I know there are people that are very offended when they hear certain words.

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.920
 And I guess that's why. That's why we don't just all curse all the time, because

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.520
 some people are offended by it. Is that how it works? Or but there's other things people do that

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:14.800
 there's someone offended by like everything. So you have to draw a line somewhere where like,

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:19.280
 I'm not going to not step on a crack on the sidewalk because somebody's offended by it. Like, that's

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:24.880
 an extreme. But yeah, like, there has to be some line. What is the line? And I think it's just

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:29.440
 even if collectively it feels like the average person finds out outside the range of normal.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:35.840
 Like, if I just walked out with this completely naked. Yeah, that would be offensive. I think

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:42.640
 the word of yeah, is maybe sound more extreme than it is. Yeah, that word has a lot of like,

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:47.600
 weight today, I think. Yeah, maybe. So I wouldn't be naked because, you know, I would make a bunch

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.560
 of people uncomfortable. Yeah, I'm talking about too. But then it's context specific too, right?

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:58.160
 Like in New York, there's probably more like social acceptance to just drop in F bombs because

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:03.920
 it's just how you speak. Is that right? Yeah, I'm sure kids like, it's like a totally different

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:13.120
 thing there. Yeah. I feel like I've heard kids recently drop the F bomb and it was kind of

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:17.840
 surprising, but like nobody like really thought much of it. So I don't know, maybe things are shifted.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:23.920
 I have no idea. Oh, maybe get across ages. It's different too. Like once once the generation above

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:28.640
 us passes and we're the oldest, we're probably not going to care as much, right? Yeah, it's true.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.320
 I feel like we'll be old people that are like, but they'll come up with new words that we do feel

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:38.480
 uncomfortable. They'll just have like new slang that's like, ew, don't say that. Don't just.

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:44.320
 I mean, I don't want to feel that way. I like hate almost all of the Zoomer,

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:51.120
 yeah, slang that they use. I have a role. I'm pretty generous with this, I think.

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:56.000
 I'll give you till age of 30, okay? I think it should be a lot younger, but

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.680
 after the age of 30, just don't add new phrases into your vocabulary. You don't need it. Just

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:06.000
 you do. Do I do this? I feel like I kind of do this. You do? There's words I say that

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.880
 maybe just on Twitter, I feel like on Twitter, I say words that I didn't say

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:15.680
 ever before. I've probably added words in my 30s. I'll give small allowances, but broadly,

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:21.360
 you don't need to add new phrases. You know how to express everything you can express by that age?

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:26.640
 Yeah. You don't need it. Don't need to. I think it was when I started streaming on Twitch,

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:31.920
 that people in Twitch say so many words, and I'm like, I don't know, I started introducing,

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.360
 I can't even think of one right now, actually. I think mostly when I say words like that,

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:40.640
 I'm joking. It's like a joke to use a word that's way below you, way younger than you.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:48.400
 I think that's my problem, too. When I go to say it, to me, it sounds so

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:53.120
 forced, and I'm like super aware of what I'm doing, that I'm like,

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:59.840
 this just doesn't make any sense for me to say this, so I can always say in a satirical context.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:06.400
 I think there's also this confusing thing where there's internet language versus what is young

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:13.280
 people language, because the internet is skews very young, but there's also just language that's

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:18.560
 kind of in our circles that I don't know, maybe it's because we hang out with younger people.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.280
 I don't know, some of our friends are still in their late 20s.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:26.560
 It's hard, it's hard. I don't know what's, maybe there's just a taste factor that goes in,

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.560
 there's just stuff that you like and stuff that you don't. The whole crack engineer shit,

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:35.360
 I hate that. I hate when that one's like, "Oh, he's cracked." You got a higher crack engineer.

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.360
 Yeah, the younger generation, that's the rock star. Our generation was like,

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.880
 "He's a rock star programmer." That was kind of like, too, though.

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:46.560
 I know we hated that, because it was like the LinkedIn recruiters that said that stuff,

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:53.520
 but like, I see LinkedIn cracked. It's like the same thing, it's like, "Oh, that's so funny."

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:59.200
 It was like some, some like tech CEO said crack the other day.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:05.360
 Was it right Armstrong, the Coinbase guy? It was somebody. I was just like, "Dude, like, come on."

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:11.120
 You don't need to be saying this. You don't need to be saying cracked.

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.960
 Okay, the reason it extra bothers me, and it's the same problem with the rock star engineer,

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.880
 it becomes a thing. People sort of just self-prescribe to them. Everyone wants to be a cracked engineer,

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:25.360
 so they're saying the things that they think crack, quote unquote, "cracked engineers."

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.640
 It just becomes like this hard to watch thing, you know?

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:35.680
 I want to say something about the whole levels of programmers, like 10x engineers or whatever.

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:40.320
 Or I want to just have a conversation. I have a lot of thoughts here that have made me think

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.200
 about this recently. Are you in a rush? Because I don't want to start a conversation.

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:48.960
 You can't. I don't want a vacation. You're on vacation, yeah. So, so many thoughts. One,

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:56.800
 I had the thought that like so many people, like people who aren't engineers that hire

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:02.640
 engineers will never know how good an engineer is because they could be an amazing engineer, like

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:07.840
 literally get anything done in short amount of time, but like they won't give you all their time.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:12.560
 They'll just like spread their time across other things. You know what I mean? I've hired people

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:17.120
 like this who were incredible and they could turn something around very quickly when they needed to

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:21.360
 to just appease you. But you knew they had like four other gigs going on and they were just like,

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:27.680
 that's just they're good enough to balance all that and it's just kind of life. So like to even

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:32.240
 ever be able to assess someone you hire from like a hiring standpoint, how good they are or how

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:36.080
 efficient they are or how smart they are, it's going to be hard because the smarter they are,

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.200
 the less likely they're giving you all of them. Does that make sense?

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.880
 Yeah, no, it's 100% accurate. I think this is the kind of thing I bring up a lot where I feel like

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:51.680
 when it comes to questions about hiring, people are so like there's so much anxiety around it

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:57.120
 that we can't ever have a conversation about how it actually works and what the actual dynamics are

00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:02.320
 because people get like upset about it and they like want the world to work in a certain way.

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.440
 Yeah. And they never hear about this stuff and it's actually useful to hear about because you

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:11.680
 understand how it works and you can kind of align yourself with it. Yeah. Like people are always

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:16.400
 like, oh, yeah, like, you know, this is how you hire great engineers, this interview process is

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:21.440
 used for great engineers. That's to hire like a really great person, the thing you're talking about,

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:24.960
 it has an interview process. The problem is they never even showed up to an interview process because

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:31.600
 like they're not in you or like it's just the root problem of hiring great people is to like

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:36.560
 be someone that attracts great people. It's not your stupid process, you know? Yeah, all the,

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:41.520
 all like most all of our hires were like, hey, you worked with somebody that was awesome,

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.360
 they're hired. I don't care. Like we just hired people that other people had worked with.

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:49.520
 It's like, if you have one good person to start with and they worked with somebody they knew

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:54.800
 was awesome, it just kind of like trails out from there. And maybe that has its own issues, but

00:55:54.800 --> 00:56:00.320
 I don't know. Yeah, we never really like did a lot of the post-a-job and get a hire that way.

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:03.920
 Like through interviewing. Yeah. So more things I want to say about this.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:12.960
 So first of all, yeah, there's like, how good is somebody and how much of your focus are they

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:16.560
 getting or their focus? Are you getting? Well, there was one, another thing I thought about this

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:21.920
 recently was just watching you at the terminal few thing and like, what are you like a 1000x

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:26.320
 engineer? Because that was insane. Just the amount, I'm just like puffing you up and blowing your head

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:34.240
 up at this point. But just like people don't understand how much was going on. And it's like

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.960
 a dumb thing, the terminal if you think, well, it wasn't dumb. It was super cool, actually,

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:41.520
 that we did that and very newly appreciating it this morning after watching some of it.

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:49.760
 Just like the ability to juggle across so many vectors of things. I don't know. You're definitely

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:53.200
 one of those people. So you've earned the right. I think I said this to you that day. You've earned

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.600
 the right to like talk all the shit on Twitter that you talk through shit in again. I'm just

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:01.200
 gonna say that a lot. Something was shit in it. I know Chris.

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:08.720
 Because I like spent a lot of time in front of a laptop like on that Sunday and Monday,

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:15.040
 just like pumping stuff out. And I haven't done that in a really long time. And to be honest,

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:20.560
 I was like, this felt it was good to like do that again and know that I can still do that. But like,

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:25.600
 I don't want to do that anymore. Yeah. Well, that's the other thing is who old for this.

00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:33.440
 There's the aging process of like, you just like your 20s, you kind of use up a lot of your cares.

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:38.080
 And like how much you're willing to just like throw yourself, but you get more efficient too.

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:41.440
 I mean, we've talked about that before. Like as you age, you're getting faster.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:46.320
 That's why I felt that it felt so, it felt so low leverage to like,

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:51.600
 just be like exerting my like, it's effectively manual labor. Like I'm exerting my raw, whatever.

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:58.000
 And it's like, I have gotten to a point of life where I rarely, that's like really the

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.760
 thing I need to do, you know. So it feels bad from that point of view. Yeah.

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:05.760
 I feel like this is a really hard conversation. I'm just having a hard time like vocalizing all

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:11.440
 the feelings I have around this. It does tie in. I think you kind of hit on like from the hiring

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:17.760
 standpoint and just like how people view labor, I guess, there's like the return to office stuff,

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:23.040
 the like fear of like, it's just like, how do you control how much people are giving you or

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:27.680
 what they're giving you or like, there's this dated thing and I don't know what to replace it with.

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:32.080
 What is like the modern, because not every company can be SST where it's like three people

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:37.360
 highly aligned, highly incentivized to make this thing work in the long run.

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:43.280
 How does someone who like does need to hire people ever feel good about hiring people?

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:49.920
 What is the metric? The thing is, I think that people are turning the wrong lever

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:53.680
 and they're like, okay, I'm working on this thing, which needs a lot of people.

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:58.240
 So how do I like deal with all this annoying stuff? That's a side effect of it.

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:03.920
 And like people endlessly discuss how that's a case. You could also choose just to work on

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:07.760
 something else, you know? You choose to work on something that doesn't need a lot of people

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:11.440
 and like can live up to the ideals that you imagine you use the other people doing.

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:19.200
 So a lot of the times were like, I brought up the other day, like I think the further you get in

00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:25.840
 like business stuff, the more your obstacles look, like in the beginning, it's like, how do I even

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:30.240
 make a dollar? Like it's impossible. How the hell do like, I don't know if anyone making any money,

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:34.640
 just getting something working at all is so hard. But then I think as you get better at it,

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:40.560
 all of your thoughts are around, wait, I can make money this way, I can make money that way,

00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:46.000
 I can make money this way. How do I avoid the nine out of 10 situations that lead me to a bad place?

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.840
 The all of them will make you money, a lot of money, but you spend all this time like trying

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:56.400
 to avoid being put in situations like that where you're like, well, that seems like a miserable

00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.960
 type of company, even though it's successful. So yeah, so for me, my focus is entirely on like,

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:07.360
 how do I build something big without doing this other stuff? And the solution isn't to like,

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:11.600
 find some way to avoid that, find some way to like do that better than anywhere else,

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:16.400
 just like find a version of your business that doesn't need any of that.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.880
 Oh, people. So it's big. Yeah. So but yeah, so I just don't try to help solve that problem,

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.040
 or think about it at all. Like I don't think there's a solution, like stuff just sucks

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:30.960
 after serving size stuff just sucks. I just I have so many like tangential thoughts

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.560
 shoving into my brain. And I feel like the dumbest human being on earth trying to vocalize any of

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.360
 it. Like I just started going into my brain into the birth rate problem and like population

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.720
 of dwindling, but maybe that's good because we're gonna have technology and we don't need as many

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.520
 people in the workforce. I just there's so many of these like thoughts that are all kind of related

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:53.680
 small teams, big teams. I'm just gonna stop. This is just like the dumbest version of some

01:00:53.680 --> 01:01:00.160
 business podcasts. You're saying some intelligent things and I'm like, but also, I don't know,

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.560
 I'm just gonna stop. Hey, people like this dynamic. It's a I think Liz said that we've

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:12.560
 accidentally landed on a very, very good format for our show and that you represent the audience.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:17.280
 Yeah, yeah. So the dumb people like vocalize. Sorry.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.400
 I would say you tend to vocalize questions. You know, yeah, right now I'm having a hard time

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:29.280
 just even getting the questions out that are coherent. I have all these thoughts around this

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.680
 problem. It ties into stuff I've talked about the past with like the fake jobs, like the economy's

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:42.640
 half made up and and like I've hired people and been on the employing end. I've been on the employer

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:47.040
 and and it all just is very confusing to me. I don't know what my question is.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:51.600
 Can I bring up something that's related to this that we never talked about but it upset a lot of

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:57.680
 people. I love it a couple months ago. Keith Reboi, it got summarized in a really stupid way.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.680
 It was like there's some headline like Keith Reboi says never hire anyone under 30 years old.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.880
 Did you say Keith Reboi? What did you say? Keith Reboi, I don't know how to say his name.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.400
 Is it a name? Okay, I just want to make sure it's a name. Okay, that's fine.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.640
 Yeah, he's like a audience for the best the same question. I just needed to ask

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:19.680
 whatever. He's extremely annoying. He's extremely extremely annoying person but you know occasionally

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:24.800
 he has something interesting to say. Could you restate his question? I was I was so busy trying

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:29.840
 to figure out if you said Kiefer, like the dairy product, I was so confused. Please do it.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:35.440
 Yeah, I think that's why it's Kefir. Oh, Kefir? Of course. Yeah. Okay. Say it again.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:45.280
 So Keith Reboi, Keith Reboi. He had this longer discussion on some panel and it got summarized as

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:50.640
 he says to never hire anyone under the age of 30. This like pissed everyone off. Of course,

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.240
 because it's a great end to your headline. But if you look at and this is exactly a

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:59.200
 demonstration of what I mean by we are so afraid to like talk about this stuff because it

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:04.160
 upsets people so much they miss out on understanding how the world works and like taking some

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:09.120
 advantage. Like you getting upset by this is not helping you get rich. Like it's just not.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:15.440
 Right. Yeah. So what he describes is a really true thing which is his point isn't people above

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:21.760
 30 have no value or like whatever. He's like generally by the time you're 30 years old,

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:28.080
 the market has fairly assessed you. Like you as an individual are probably not like

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:34.160
 getting into situations where you're like, oh, this is I deserve more than this. Like there's

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.560
 enough in your career, there's enough data points that there's probably plenty of bidders in the

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:44.400
 market to like get you a great outcome or like the correct outcome. And he's saying when we're

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:50.880
 in a startup, you can't play that game because there are always bigger bidders than you. So if

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.760
 you want to find and people don't understand what fun alpha, what that means is like something

01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:01.040
 in the market is missing above what the average return is. Yeah. You have to go for people that

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:06.720
 are not being correctly evaluated by the market. And you know, that makes the time. Typically,

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.760
 when someone's younger, they don't have a lot of data points. So they might be punching above

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:13.600
 their weight and you don't know. So some people try to explain this and then people are upset

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:18.480
 from another angle. They're like, oh, so you're just not paying people what they're worth. You

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.200
 want to like, you know, whatever. Yeah. But the point here is is you are a startup with a fixed

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.080
 amount of resources to spend on something. Yeah. And you are connecting with someone that is not

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:35.520
 able to find a job, right? Or not able to find a thing. And you identify that the market is

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.760
 ignoring this currently very valuable person and you like, you know, we work with them. That's how

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:45.520
 my career started. Like it was all situations like that. Yeah. And it technically is in line with

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.600
 what people say they care about, right? Like you want people say they want diversity. Well,

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.400
 it's what diversity looks like. You go find areas that everyone else thinks are useless and you

01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:00.080
 actually find talent there. That's how you do it. And yeah, they work for you for a little bit.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:05.280
 And that's going to like springboard them into being someone older that now is properly, you know,

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:13.200
 valued. And the other thing I found funny was like, people on both sides are like, oh, no,

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:19.360
 it means you were like underpaying people. Those are more. But then I'm like, don't people also

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:23.120
 argue that the older you are, the more you should get paid? So like, yeah, the younger person should

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:27.360
 get paid. Like it just doesn't, it doesn't all make sense. So like, this is a type of thing. Well,

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:32.880
 like if you understand the world in this way, yeah, like you can benefit from that. You like,

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.080
 no, this is how people are going to hire is how you can find like these, these like,

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:40.240
 Adam just got up and ran away. So I don't know what happened. I'm so sorry.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:45.680
 What happened? Do you know what happened? Did someone fall down the stairs?

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:50.960
 No, I said P. And I didn't, I didn't want you to stop. I wanted to let you cook.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:58.480
 That was so weird that you just, you just, you like sprinted out. I've had to be for five minutes.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:05.200
 No, I just have had to pee so bad. And it was like, I cannot wait any longer. And, but I didn't

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.760
 want to stop you. You're, you're going. Did you keep going? I did. I did stop because you left.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:16.240
 Oh man. That made no sense. It was just jarring the way you left. Okay. I forgot what I was talking

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.720
 about too. If ever I just take off in the middle again, just keep going. That means I just want

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:29.920
 you to finish your thought and not kill the train that happened at him. I guess it doesn't make

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:35.200
 sense. You're literally talking to me. Why would you keep talking if I'm not here? Yeah. Sorry.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:44.720
 Anyway, just to summarize my point, yes, this headline is upsetting. But it's worth, like,

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:50.240
 understanding it beyond just getting upset about it. Because like, yeah, yeah, the world

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:55.120
 does work in certain ways. And like, it's not this idealized form of hiring you have in your head.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:00.160
 And most idealized forms of hiring people have on their head is like, I should walk in and people

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.880
 just hand me a job and it should pay like a million dollars. And like, that's how everyone should get.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:08.160
 That they just have this like unrealistic way of the world working. So it's worth.

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.560
 And then realistic. Some of these situations. On the other side too. Like on the employer side,

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.560
 this unrealistic expectation that you should hire every person. They should be amazing. And

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:20.320
 you should pay them next to nothing. Like, there's just, there's that competing

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:26.640
 worldview on both sides. That's not accurate. Yeah. And to me, it's always like people are like,

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:33.440
 well, this number is fair. Like, there's no such thing as fair. Like, this is just a very basic

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:39.200
 transaction between two parties where both sides are trying to get as most as they can without

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.880
 giving up as much as they can. And given all the leverage that exists in the world,

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.280
 it lands on a specific price. And that's where it is. If you're being quote unquote underpaid,

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:54.000
 it's not because your boss is evil, your employer is evil. It's that there aren't enough opportunities

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.640
 for you to like negotiate a better situation. And that's what you need to fix. Not like

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:04.000
 being like, you should pay more for no reason. It just doesn't give people more power. If they're

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.240
 just getting paid more because the employer is being nice. Like, that doesn't actually give you

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:12.480
 any amount of freedom. Give me taking away any point. Yeah. I'm glad you hit on the

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:17.920
 not the way the world works. Because I do feel like all of my confusion and

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:23.680
 struggle to even voice coherent questions, all of that aside, I just want to know what the

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:27.520
 reality is. Like, I know there's some reality to all this stuff. And maybe it's just too complex

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:35.200
 for there to be simple answers. But there's something about the way businesses and hiring

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:39.680
 and all that works that just still feels so messed up in my head. And I can't sort it out.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:43.920
 Yeah. There's a lot of games that I played. Yeah, sorry.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:48.880
 Yeah. The other thing that comes up a lot is, people are always like, I just want to program

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:54.000
 for my whole life. Like, why is there always an opportunity to advance, you know, to go into

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.880
 management or whatever? Everyone sees this as like a fundamentally wrong thing, the world shouldn't

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:04.480
 work this way. But the actual dynamics, I think that lead to this are, it's not what people want

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:10.000
 to hear, but I think it is a truth. When you are hiring someone, again, you're always looking for

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.320
 that like, oh, this person clearly is going to be like incredible in a couple years. So if we like,

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.800
 you know, get them in now, we get to benefit from this obvious growth they're going to have.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.560
 So a lot of people when they're interviewing you, yeah, they care about your current state,

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:32.880
 but they really look for your like growth potential. And like your own energy around that. And the

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:40.160
 reality is the more experience you have, the less that becomes, the less you can like convey

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:46.640
 that, right? Like for me, when I was half the experience I do now, like where I might end up

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:51.680
 landing was like so undefined, like I could end up like being like amazing. Like it was just like

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:56.800
 so I could see how when someone was talking to me, they would be like really excited by that aspect.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:01.040
 Whereas now like they kind of know, like I kind of know where I am and I kind of like know where I'm

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:08.480
 going. So like, yeah, I need to like be advancing in some place. So that's why a lot of people end up

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:14.160
 going into managing people. And like the reality is, is if you're a programmer with 30 years of

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:19.280
 experience versus 20, it's really hard to get that much more excited about the person with 30,

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:26.080
 the person with 20 versus 10, that makes sense. And there's only so much work that really needs

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:31.680
 30 years versus 10. And yeah, it's not we want to hear because we want to like, we like programming,

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:36.080
 we want to do that forever and we want to like be able to have a nice life by just doing that stuff

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:42.880
 forever. But this is just how, it's just how the world is. And I don't know, like you have to understand

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:46.640
 that and position your life properly. So you heard it here first, Zach says AI is going to take your

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:56.560
 job. Basically, basically just said, that's what I heard. I do have to get off here because my kids

01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:03.840
 want to come in my office and do something. So what destroy it? No, they actually want to clean it up.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:08.480
 They destroyed it yesterday. They want to clean it up. Well, they have to clean it up before they

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:13.760
 can do something that Casey has said a stipulation. Yeah, yeah. I see. It's how it's how the world

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:18.240
 works right here. If we want something done, we have to incentivize. It's kind of like employing

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:23.840
 people. And if your kids had other opportunities, they would pursue that would not be your office.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:31.600
 It's a lot of alpha right now at their ages, at nine and five, you know. Yeah, it's funny.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.680
 All right, well, this was good. Thanks for taking a break from your vacation to record.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.160
 Yeah, it was fun. It was fun. All right, see you. See you.
