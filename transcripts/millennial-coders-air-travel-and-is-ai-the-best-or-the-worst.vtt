00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
 How funny if they like just like randomly stumbled onto this podcast and then heard a bad episode. That'd be cool.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.400
 Look how bright is in my room. Why is it so bright? Why is it so bright? Are you white?

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:49.280
 I think I hit my limit for how much I can sit in the dark and work all day. Really? I feel like my room's darker than ever. It's so funny.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.600
 We're switching. Even wearing a white shirt.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:09.340
 It's a new era, new pope, a new me. It's kind of nice. I'm not going to lie. There's a new pope. It's kind of a I just learned there's a new pope this morning. That just happened or am I behind that happened yesterday and I have a fun fact.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.460
 I want to hear the fun fact. You know him. He's an American, right? Sort of. Just give me the fact. This is exciting.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:45.660
 So Liz's grandpa in Cuba is. If I remember correctly, he's like pretty involved in his local church. And at one point, the man that is now the pope visited and slept over my or Liz's grandpa's house. Wow. So crazy. Yeah, that's so crazy. You're basically like related to God. Now, I was going to say I think I feel some powers coming on. That's why my room is so much brighter now. It just.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:02:04.300
 It's so perfect. The room looks so different. You look like you're glowing like an angel. Yeah. That's awesome. All I know is new pope American. That's all I know, by the way, he's American, which is kind of crazy. But OK, so one. I didn't know the previous pope was Argentinian.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:18.940
 You know, I feel like where did I? Yeah, I feel like when I see an old man that with light skin, he just looks European to me. And like, you know, he's always in the Vatican doing stuff. So I'm like, Oh, that's like an Italian guy. You know, yeah, I would have thought Italian. Yeah.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:31.100
 I think they speak Italian and that's that they're like default language in the Vatican or something. But yeah, he was Argentinian. He spoke Spanish. I'm like, Oh, that's pretty crazy. And the other thing that's confusing is they just pick a new name when they're.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:43.860
 Oh, they just like, my name was Robert and now I'm Leo. Yeah. So his name wasn't Leo. I saw Leo. That was that's his new name. It's like Robert's name, like something very American.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:03:02.060
 Yeah, Bob. I don't want to say it's Robert, but he just went by Bob. Bob is now the pope. I saw a clip of there were some like CNN Catholic or Catholic analysts who is a priest or something who was like, you know, talking about.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:13.980
 The news and like, you know, the new pope and everything. And he accidentally called him Bob because he like knew him from college or whatever. Like, they went to or something. So they have some like, yeah, personal connection. So he called him Bob.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.340
 That's awesome. New pope. Not the pope, Bob from America. Yeah, exactly. It's amazing.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:30.940
 I just got sick of sitting in the dark. I think I hit my limit for how long I could just sit in the dark. And I realized I was feeling kind of negative being in his room.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:41.300
 Are you going to be positive now? I'm going to be better at being negative. Like I was in a potential, you know? Sure. That makes sense.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:57.540
 Yeah. So I opened my window and I have like, I have a really nice view. It's like so green and lush and nice. And I just been sacrificing all that for consistent lighting, which I don't really need anymore. So yeah, I guess if you're not like doing the video stuff all the time.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:14.340
 Like I moved across the house from my amazing office that I loved to a hole in the ground because I was going to record like the big, the course stuff, which I think I'm not really doing anytime soon, if ever I was going to be doing that.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:25.580
 It was like this room is it's got an exterior door on it. It's like connected to our unfinished face. So it's very sound isolated. And I thought like, Oh, the kids running around. I won't hear it. It'll be so much better for consistency, whatever.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:38.460
 And I'm not recording anything. And I just hate it. I just if I don't hate it, but it just feels so much worse than my old office, which was bright and had a window and I could see outside. Yeah. And yeah, I think it really impacts your work.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:48.620
 I think I just need to get electric fades for this room, which I looked into before. But that would let me at least easily, you know, switch was into two modes.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.380
 Right now, my windows are behind my desk. So like climbing around and flipping it back and forth as a pain. So I kind of to commit to one or the other.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:11.620
 I've done, I've done the electric shade thing. And I'll tell you what a disaster of a market. It's either literal pieces of shit or like lutron, like you go, like, yeah, yeah, when I looked into it, it was so expensive.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.340
 Yeah. And I was like, how is it this expensive for one small window?

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:31.260
 You're either going with like a whole like integrator company that's like that, that world just it's or they're just terrible. So good luck with that. There's no like prosumer version. It's like nice.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:39.100
 And you can spend more on it and you don't have to talk to some sales guy. There's nothing like that that I found. Maybe someone could correct me. That was like five years ago.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.660
 I'm pretty sure my neighbor's daughter works for Crestron. Maybe I can get some kind of makeup.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.580
 Yeah, there you go. I just need one window.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:57.140
 She's actually a CEO of Crestron. Oh, well, it's CEO. It's like executive level. And maybe I have a chance.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:04.420
 I did like a huge custom like centralized lighting and all that stuff in one of the homes we built.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:11.740
 And we spent so much money on like home theater, centralized lighting, security, all this stuff. It was a disaster.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:21.260
 And just this is warning to anybody who does this. Those companies, you can't just like, like, Hey, the fire alarms don't work anymore. Well, I say they don't work.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.380
 We came home from vacation and they were just going off and we couldn't get them to turn off.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:33.980
 You can't just like do stuff yourself. They have to like come out and like a programmer comes out and like reprogram your house and like everything you ever want to do.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:40.980
 It's like we can't get these lights to come on. Oh, we'll be out like next week. Like it's just it was terrible. So don't don't do that.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.540
 I don't recommend it. It's like hue lights or whatever. Just get some cheap Zigbee stuff.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:55.740
 And that stuff has gotten a lot better and a lot of it has become open source. So it like really covers a lot of stuff now. So yeah, it's still not amazing.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:04.500
 Like I always I always in this constant loop of I'll spend a bunch of time, set it up properly, but like not fully properly.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.860
 Like I'll miss like 5% of something and somehow that just erodes over time and then I'm just like not using it at all.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.460
 Yeah, yeah, so it's always never land on anything great.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:21.660
 Maybe when I have like a more modern house, I can like do it right, but yeah, still having maybe someday.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.500
 It plays with it someday when we're billionaires.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.940
 We can pay people to put the lights for us. Yeah.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.900
 How are you? I feel like we haven't talked a little bit.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.940
 We've done like one episode in like a month. I feel like we just had random stuff because I was traveling.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.580
 I had quite a travel experience. I don't know if you followed along over the past week.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:53.380
 I followed along New Jersey. Well, more than New Jersey because my parents were throwing a baby shower for Liz.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:08:00.460
 So we went there, then we went to New York for a wedding. Then I flew to Toronto.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:09.020
 How many weddings have you been doing the last two years? Not a lot. I feel like I feel like I feel like I feel like generally

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.420
 I am lower on the number of weddings that I've had to go to.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.180
 OK, because I've gone to none to see now.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.420
 I guess maybe I'm an extreme example.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.460
 It lets you remarry, like if you don't let's get married again.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:30.140
 Yeah, so I think for me, all of my friends did really small weddings, including myself.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.900
 Like it was just a courthouse thing plus a little event after like a bunch of my friends.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.780
 The same thing. But yeah, it's pretty much just like Liz's friends that we've gone to weddings for.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.420
 And even then, I think I've escaped it. Usually it's pretty bad.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.020
 I guess we're hitting her family. Her cousins are getting married.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:50.700
 So I guess I'm like now getting deeper into that. I have gone to a few in the past year.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.940
 All of my current friends have been married since long before I was friends with them.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.220
 So there's just literally no reason I would have gone to a wedding, I guess.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.460
 Yeah. Exactly. It happened like a little bit right out of college, I guess.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.900
 But I am like five years older than you. So maybe that's just the difference here.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:12.220
 I'm definitely like in the zone where everyone is pretty much wrapping up getting married.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:19.660
 I think that weddings are funny in that they can be really enjoyable if you are like deep

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.340
 in the front group and like you know the majority of the people that are there.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.260
 Yeah. And if you're not that, they're just kind of awkward.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:33.500
 Because the one we went to, it was kind of in between. Like it was Liz's roommate

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.300
 that I hung out with the bunch so I know her and I know her now husband.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:43.580
 Oh, her husband knows Rich Harris, which is a funny point of coincidence.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.900
 Like he works on that team at New York Times that makes a lot of data visualizations.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.620
 Oh, nice.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.860
 Which is where he's not an engineer. He's a journalist. He's more on the

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.980
 infographic side, like the non engineering side.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.780
 But yeah, I think Rich was on that team. That's like where he made spelt and everything.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.940
 So it was like, wow, someone from like outside my world entirely.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.740
 Finally, there's like some kind of tie-in to my world.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.820
 Usually when people ask what I do, I'm just like, yeah, I like it's not worth getting into.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.220
 Yeah.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.740
 So this was like a little bit in between.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:23.740
 But there was one wedding I went to where Liz was invited.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:29.740
 And as once we got to the wedding, it was clear that it was like a polite invite.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.220
 And it wasn't like you definitely have to go.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.260
 Because she was like more on the edge of the guest list.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.380
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:44.220
 And what that means is that makes me like on the other side of the earth.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.420
 I'm trying to get on the edge because I'm just some random person there.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.340
 And it's not that big of a wedding and we go to the ceremony.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.660
 And I see these two people who I've never seen my whole life and probably will never see again.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:02.620
 Walked on the aisle, then deeply talk about their love for each other and their history

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.420
 and their future.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.860
 And it's this crazy intimate moment.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.220
 And it's being witnessed by this random ass person, me,

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.380
 that's there for some reason witnessing this event.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.740
 Like why is this a feature of weddings?

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.020
 Like I guess it's unavoidable.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.340
 Like, eventually you invite someone and then there plus one has to just be the most random

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:21.340
 person.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:27.820
 So I was just part of one of the most important days of these people's lives.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.340
 And I'm never going to see them again.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.460
 They're never going to think about me.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.940
 I think about them all the time because I'm like, why was I there?

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.980
 Oh, it's so funny.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:39.500
 How funny if they like just like randomly stumbled onto this podcast and then heard that episode.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:39.980
 That'd be cool.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.740
 They probably, this is so random.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.980
 They probably wouldn't even put it together that I'm talking about them.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:49.020
 Well, the one thing maybe that I'll make it more clear is it was in Connecticut and I got COVID after.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.980
 Oh no, did everyone get COVID after?

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.740
 Yes, the whole like the whole wedding got COVID.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.700
 Oh geez.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.820
 So I had to go the random wedding that made no sense and then I got to get COVID.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.100
 Well, I guess like that's one way to remember your wedding.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.460
 Everybody got COVID.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:04.940
 That's fun.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.220
 The other thing that I think about and I really hope life doesn't go this way.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.700
 I feel like the older you get, like as you approach death,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.220
 you just invite it to more and more and more weddings.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:22.140
 And you're just like the old person at the wedding because it's like your grandkids cousin is getting

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.740
 married and then they invite you, you know?

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.900
 So you're just like every week, just another wedding.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.660
 There's different phases of it in life.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:32.940
 Like when you're the generation above and you're going to kids and their friends' weddings or whatever.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.340
 Huh?

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:33.820
 Yeah.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.300
 So there's another phase coming and then you die.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.180
 And then you die.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:37.660
 It's true.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:37.980
 Yeah.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:43.340
 I actually just had thoughts a couple of days ago of like hitting 40 soon.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.540
 Like I'll be 30 and I'll be, I'll be 39 this summer.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.540
 And then then it's my last year until I'm on my 40th year.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.620
 Just had thoughts of like, wow, like average lifespan in America, it's like 80.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.660
 It's like I'm halfway.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.380
 This is midlife.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.740
 And then I started thinking about midlife crisis.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.020
 And I was like, I kind of get it.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.260
 I kind of get where like you hit a point and you're like, wow, I'm on the downhill.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.820
 Like this, I'm over halfway there and it's gone so fast and like mortality.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.700
 I don't know.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.380
 Maybe Brian Johnson's on to something.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.180
 Maybe I need to, to health max.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.100
 Live to be 120.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.300
 That's some of the 40 years.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.740
 I just refuse to talk about this topic.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.020
 So okay.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.580
 Yeah.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.780
 I wonder why you brought it up.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.420
 Cause I feel like every time we ever touch, like I'll jump into it.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.100
 But I feel like every time we touch on anything.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:25.660
 Yeah.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.740
 Like this, you're like, I don't want to talk about it.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.940
 No, we're not talking about it.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:29.820
 Okay.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.620
 Let's not talk about it.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.100
 It was always me.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.220
 I told you, I've got a wedding anniversary this month.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.140
 Have I told you how we got married?

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:36.620
 No.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.060
 Like we just stood on a beach and my brother held a Mac book.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.500
 And the pastor was in Missouri.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.220
 Oh, like a zoom.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.780
 And we stood on the beach in Florida.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:45.020
 Yeah.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:45.900
 And did it over Jim.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.620
 He was like over video.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.780
 It was awesome because that's not good.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.140
 Cause we're standing out on the beach on this hotel wifi.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:54.540
 Yeah.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:59.820
 And right as he like asks, if one of us says I do,

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.620
 his signal cuts out and you just hear him go, no.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:07.500
 So we're not sure if we're actually legally married.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.620
 Like it's possible that that was not a legal situation.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.620
 But yeah, we ran with it.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.100
 We actually did the courthouse thing before we left.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.540
 So like we had officially already been married, I guess, just to say.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.740
 How many was it just your brother?

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.100
 Was there anyone else there?

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.980
 My parents and Casey's mom came as well.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:30.460
 So our situation was we were in New York and we wanted to get married.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.980
 And we were looking at the one, the price of a wedding.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.660
 And also like just the effort it goes into putting on like a big wedding,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.860
 especially if it was a big family.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.220
 And we were like, there's no way we can squeeze into our life right now.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:49.660
 Like we were kind of starting businesses and it just didn't make sense to like spend the money

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.300
 on a wedding.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:55.340
 So our mindset was, okay, let's just do a smallish thing and then we'll do a bigger wedding later.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.300
 But our smallish thing ended up being really, really nice.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:04.140
 Like we did a, we had this photographer that just specializes in New York courthouse weddings.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.700
 And she basically took us on like this nice walk from our apartment

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.100
 to the courthouse, we took a bunch of pictures and we did a bunch of nice things.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:18.700
 We had like this nice private situation in the courthouse where just me and Liz got married

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.700
 and we came out and then like our family was there to like throw flowers on us and stuff.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:28.540
 And then we walked down to, we were like another 15 minutes to this bar.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.500
 We rented out and then like a bunch, all of our friends were there and we did.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.220
 Oh, that's awesome.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.020
 Like a, like a nice thing with food, food and all that.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:35.580
 Yeah, it was right.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:41.500
 It was like all of our friends and it was really great and all the emotions were like maximized.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:46.140
 And after that, we're like, oh, that was like a real wedding.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.220
 Like we're not going to do another bigger one later.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.500
 It feels, it feels stupid.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.500
 Like all the emotions like went out in that thing.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.140
 I've been to a lot of weddings since then with other people.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.500
 And I'm like, man, I still really liked ours the best.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.700
 So if you're thinking about getting married, like consider that small one.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.980
 It's actually pretty nice.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:08.460
 Yeah, and then you didn't, you know, feel like there's so much pressure on it to be exactly what

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.740
 you imagined because you spent so much money and like, I don't know, I didn't.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.260
 I haven't done that either, but I would imagine that's, it's expensive.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:15.740
 I don't know.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.620
 Yeah, it's expensive.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.020
 And like the actual process of a big wedding is like, not really fun for the bride and groom

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.060
 because they're like doing.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.020
 It's like a lot of stress.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:23.340
 Yeah.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.420
 And they're doing all the guitar stuff that like stand and take a picture with every single person

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.700
 and like, you know, and all that.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:34.220
 And so on one hand, it is nice, but I don't know, I think I'm glad I did the small thing.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.900
 Maximize your enjoyment.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.260
 It is your day.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.140
 Yeah.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.220
 Okay, let's talk about other stuff.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.980
 Wait, let me tell you one more thing.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.260
 Oh, yeah, sure.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.540
 I went to Toronto and I met Frank.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.100
 You travel?

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.380
 Oh, you met Frank.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.340
 That is other stuff.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.140
 I just met like, I don't know, we got into like weddings and stuff.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:50.380
 Yeah, I know.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.580
 And it's just kind of an odd RMO.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.820
 Our audience isn't getting married anytime soon.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.140
 Every time you've brought up that you didn't, you never met Frank, it blew my mind.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.260
 Like I always forget.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.940
 And then it just re-blue my mind every single time.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.220
 And this was no exception when you're like, you're finally meeting Frank.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.660
 It's like, how have you not that Frank?

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.460
 That's just crazy.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.100
 Yeah, I know.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:15.980
 It's such a weird modern thing where there's this person that I talk to every day.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.020
 When something like funny or interesting happens in my life.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.540
 Like I tell him right away.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:25.260
 Like he's the person he's the only people that knows about everything that's going on.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.700
 Yeah, I have literally only ever seen him over discord video.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.580
 Yeah.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.540
 So finally, and I should have done this a while ago, like I just,

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.580
 I kept being like, I'm going to visit Toronto.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.180
 But I don't want to go when it's cold.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.660
 It has to be the summer, but I kept having other travel in the summer.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.060
 So I don't know.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:40.780
 I got kicked around.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.300
 And we're doing this last trip before.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.540
 Like the last trip we can travel before, you know, Liz gives birth and everything.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.500
 And then we won't travel for a little bit after that.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:56.220
 So we have to do it now or it's or now we're never so we just tacked it on at the end of

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.980
 the travel we were already doing.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.300
 By the way, airlines air travel is done.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.300
 It's all your tweets, man.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.260
 Yeah.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.940
 Yeah, I want to I want to dive into that too, because I I'm curious like,

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.420
 it all feels so bad to me.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.100
 But I saw you say something about how like you've seen it over your lifetime get worse.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.700
 And I don't remember when it was better.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.060
 It's just like it's always been bad to me, but I could see how it's gotten.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:18.540
 I don't know.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.900
 I need to hear your description.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.820
 Yeah, I couldn't tell if I'm misremembering.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.620
 Or it's one of those like things were better before kind of.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.660
 Well, you know what?

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.660
 I will say, I only flew for the first time when I was like 22.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:35.900
 That's still that's still like around 15 years.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.740
 Yeah, I would say it's okay.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.020
 Same range I'm talking about.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.220
 Okay, so here's the thing.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.500
 I remember for most of my life never thinking that hard about air travel.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.460
 I remember being like, I'm going to book a flight.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.540
 I land here and I'm going to make plans for what I do after I land.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.380
 And that was like a normal thing.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.980
 And there was one time where I missed my flight because security was doing something annoying

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.180
 with my stuff, but they rebooked me an hour later.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:06.060
 And there were like a few handful of delays here and there that didn't like materially

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.540
 make a huge difference.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:15.660
 Now I feel like my expectation is this is going to be an all day thing.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.220
 The travel, no matter where I'm going.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.020
 The flight to Toronto was 50 minutes, five zero.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.260
 You go up, you're in the air for 30 minutes and you come back down.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:23.900
 Yeah.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.260
 And I was at the airport.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:30.700
 I got to the airport and it was six or seven hours or no, it was eight hours before I got to Toronto.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.700
 Sores.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.540
 And I don't think it was this bad before.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.820
 Like do you remember differently?

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.180
 Like you feel like it was always that bad?

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.340
 I just had I probably just had bad memory.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:45.340
 I just feel like it always feels like a 25% chance that it's going to go terribly

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.460
 terribly wrong for me.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.020
 And I have to connect everywhere I fly from the Ozarks.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.540
 I never connected until recently.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.340
 Yeah.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:55.500
 So when you have to connect every time, like I think it's just always been kind of rough

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.860
 because it's so easy to get your first flight delayed and miss your connection.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.420
 And that just screws the whole thing.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.460
 So effectively taking twice a number of flights is me.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:10.140
 But I would say it's like 25, 30% of like either a delay or something horrible happening.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.100
 I've like I don't fly that much and I've had multiple times.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.260
 I'd stayed in hotels, some city overnight where I wasn't intending on being

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.700
 because I missed the connection and I have to take a flight in the morning.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.300
 Like that should be like a once in a lifetime thing, right?

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.300
 And I feel like it's having to be like at least three times.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.340
 It's just to me, it feels like it feels sloppy across the board.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:37.100
 So when we were going from, so we got massively delayed from Miami to New York or to New Jersey.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.540
 And so what happened?

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:46.220
 So Newark has collapsed, the Newark airport is like not working.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.660
 It's like, I don't know.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.100
 It like tipped over some threshold and it's a complete disaster.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.980
 And we got news of this a couple of days before flying and I was like,

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.900
 maybe it'll be better after a couple of days.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:04.700
 The flight coming from Newark to Miami to pick us up was delayed by an hour or something.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.820
 I'm like, okay, I get it.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.100
 Like Newark has had problems.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.260
 But we get on the plane at this point, like an hour and a half later.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:16.540
 We're sitting there and the people are like, okay,

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.460
 things are massive at Newark.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.700
 So they're not letting us take off because there's too many planes going there.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.340
 So we're waiting.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.140
 Yeah.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.100
 Waiting on the plane.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:23.740
 Slow control.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.220
 Yeah, exactly.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.180
 We're in all the words.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:29.420
 And then all of a sudden the guy comes on.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.460
 He's like, hey, we just noticed our GPS is broken.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.020
 So we're getting someone to come fix that.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.660
 So they're coming to fix that sometime goes by.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:40.780
 Probably gets back on.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.380
 Okay, our GPS is fixed.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.380
 But me and the copilot have timed out.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:44.940
 Like we can't.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.500
 This is too long.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.300
 Like our ship is over.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:46.780
 So we have to.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.340
 In there.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:47.900
 Yep.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:48.380
 Yep.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.260
 And they get off.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.780
 New crew comes on.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.620
 New crew says, okay, I think we're allowed to.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.940
 I think they're going to let us leave soon.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.340
 But we've been sitting here for so long that we're out of gas.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.220
 So we need to refill the plane with a weight.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:07.020
 This exact, I had a scenario where we both timed out a crew

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.380
 and they had to fly around weather.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.260
 And they weren't going to have enough fuel

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:10.380
 so we had to go back and refuel.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.260
 Like same exact, both double whammy things.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:13.820
 Yep.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.100
 There was no mechanical issue.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.020
 It was just like those two.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.940
 And then you deep, you deep plane the whole.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.980
 It's just a nightmare.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.420
 So then they get fueled up.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.620
 Then we're still waiting and we're stuck on the run.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.540
 And then we finally take off and we go.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.620
 We land like, oh, okay.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.820
 We're finally here.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.500
 Pilot comes on.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.100
 They're like, hey, one of our flight attendants

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.380
 can't find her purse.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.580
 Did anyone take her purse?

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.180
 And this has nothing to do with like delaying us.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.860
 I'm just like, what is going on?

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.580
 But the flight attendant is losing her purse

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.940
 in an enclosed tube.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.780
 A couple is possible.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.180
 This is like, she definitely left it in my room.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.140
 I mean, I was confused.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.620
 Oh, and by the way, my plane in Toronto,

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.100
 again, similar series of events delayed.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:55.820
 We land.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.060
 Captain comes on.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.660
 Hey, we're here.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.860
 But nobody is like pulling the jet bridge over.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.340
 So I can see the jet bridge.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.700
 It's like, I can see with my eyes.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.140
 It's like 20 feet away from where it's supposed to be.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.100
 So we're stuck there.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.580
 We're just waiting for someone to come and just move.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.980
 I'm just like, open the door and I'll jump it.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.260
 Like, I think I can jump it.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.540
 I'll jump it and I'll move it over.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:26.540
 To me, it's just like, yeah, there's like foundational delays.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.620
 But it just stacks on top of what feels like

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.380
 just sloppiness across the board.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.180
 And your brother's a pilot.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.380
 Maybe it's a better sense of things

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.060
 are getting better or worse.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.580
 Yeah, I need to ask him like,

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.540
 just what it's like from a pilot's perspective,

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.500
 flying that much.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.980
 Like, what's the percentage of his flights

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.980
 that feel like something goes wrong?

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:46.220
 Yeah.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.660
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.660
 Is this just like the world getting sloppier?

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.940
 Are people just getting lazier and brain dead?

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.900
 The US definitely has a cute problem, I think.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.100
 Because we like just have like our,

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.580
 we have the whole like air traffic controller shortage issue

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.980
 because we're like, we didn't fund those programs well.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.260
 We also just cut a bunch of them.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.540
 And then all of our systems are just really old.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.300
 They need to be like the newer issues

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.620
 is because our super old ATC system like went down

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.740
 and had a bunch of issues.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.500
 I think I was reading that there was a period of time

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.020
 where nobody in air traffic control

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.660
 could communicate at all with the planes in the sky.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.820
 And that was such a stressful situation

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.340
 that a bunch of them just took off for a couple of weeks,

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:32.700
 being like, I can't do this anymore.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.340
 You know, that job, flight controllers,

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.980
 is like the highest suicide rates of any occupation or something.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.260
 I've seen something like that.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:39.500
 Yeah.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.860
 It's crazy.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.740
 It's just like prolonged stress every single day,

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.900
 probably, like a lot at risk.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.860
 I'd be really focused.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.620
 So to me, it feels like, I can click to,

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.140
 and again, maybe I want a different experience,

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.900
 but to me, I can clearly remember an arrow

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.060
 where I felt like flying is fun.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.220
 And like, it's a good way to get around.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:02.860
 Now I'm just like, I do not want to do it.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.380
 Like, if I can avoid it, even if it takes longer or like,

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.620
 whatever, like, I'm going to try to avoid it as much as possible.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.260
 And plus also like all the planes flipping and crashing

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.020
 and hitting helicopters and stuff like that didn't help.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.260
 Well, yeah, I listened to the thing about that.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.580
 I guess like the rates aren't actually any worse.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:18.540
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.740
 I did see that too.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.140
 I don't understand why it felt like there for a bit.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.340
 It was a lot worse.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:23.980
 Like it did.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.340
 Number of incidents is the same.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.180
 But yeah, when a plane hits another helicopter and everybody dies,

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.660
 like that's worse than anything that's happened in a while.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.340
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.380
 The whole like thinking about like people becoming like training

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.940
 and becoming air traffic controllers and choosing that career path

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.420
 and like, then just thinking about like Gen Z

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.380
 and what I know about Gen Z, just like the younger people below.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.580
 It's like, are they're just not going to be

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.740
 air traffic controllers by the time we're like old people?

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.340
 Because no one can focus.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.380
 Or just like, yeah, not focus, not have any desire to do

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.300
 that kind of work or I don't know.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.140
 It's like not fulfilling enough for Gen Z.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.660
 I just feel like the boomers above us would do like whatever they had to do

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.020
 to just like survive.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.300
 Yeah.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.060
 I mean, I have a lot of lights about boomers too.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:10.380
 But I do feel like there's less grit maybe in our generation

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.660
 and the generations that follow.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.980
 And I don't know.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:18.060
 I worry about like all these hard jobs having people that want to sit

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.860
 and maybe technology helps maybe that we automate some of this stuff.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.020
 Maybe that'll actually be a benefit.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:23.500
 I don't know.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.260
 And this is what actually scares me.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:31.580
 So the thing with something like air traffic control is over the years,

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:32.940
 it just gets hardened, right?

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:37.900
 Like you get all these rules put into place after every incident and they get.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.100
 And that's why we have like, you know, we've experienced a period where there was,

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.260
 there's like basically no incidents and like we feel very safe on planes.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:50.460
 And this to me is like a very robust system.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.220
 These bottom up rules were put in place.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:58.220
 I can see how in a push to automate it, people look at the individual rules and they're like,

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.180
 what's the point of that?

00:26:59.180 --> 00:26:59.980
 That makes no sense.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.860
 Like it's simpler if we don't have that in the automation, you know?

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.460
 It's just it's from a software developer standpoint.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.620
 Everybody knows that feeling of rewriting a thing and be like,

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.860
 this is way could be way simpler.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.180
 And then you learn why all that stuff was complicated.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.540
 Like all the bugs that come up.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:13.340
 Yeah, exactly.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:17.180
 So I'm like, even automating this stuff, I'm kind of like hesitant where

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:20.300
 it has to be led by someone with the right perspective.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:26.300
 Like this is a going to be a very hard tedious slog where we're getting every little detail,

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:26.620
 right?

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:33.100
 Not just some like we're going to build a new simple system from day one type of thing.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.020
 Yeah, so that worries me.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:39.500
 Yeah, well, why is it that I'm just now I'm just thinking about like just,

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:44.060
 I mean, we're our perspective as software developers, like we're front row seats,

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.660
 like computing the crazy curve it's been on.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:52.460
 We think about like transistors, you know, like the Moore's Law stuff.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:57.100
 Why is it that like certain pockets of the world have advanced so rapidly

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.140
 in the last 50 years?

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.020
 And then some of them are just like the same like transportation is just the same.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.060
 Hasn't really is it really improved meaningfully?

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:04.540
 You know what I mean?

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.020
 People still drive cars and get on planes.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.540
 They all go to the same speed.

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.860
 Yeah, I mean, it's just one of those things where as much software as there is in the world and how

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:18.060
 much we feel like, man, I can't believe people are still getting hired to like build these dumb

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:18.460
 apps.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:22.380
 We still don't have the software like it's it is pretty crazy.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:27.820
 There's so all these crevices in the world that it has not reached because it's too difficult or

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:32.300
 there's just a lot of forces against it or, you know, like the migration is is challenging.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.420
 Yeah, we still need a lot more, a lot more software.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.700
 I think that's like why this AI stuff is interesting because I think it helps get into

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.420
 some of these crevices.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:39.980
 Yeah, good thing.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.100
 Implementation cost is going to zero.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.660
 So yeah, I don't know if that's true.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.380
 Everything I say about AI right now is just tongue in cheek.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.820
 I have no idea which side is true.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:54.780
 Probably zero is going to be free.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.460
 Easy to make or not.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.260
 It's going to be harder.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:57.740
 I don't know.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.980
 It's funny you messaged me being like some days I you were like, you sent me

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.980
 Claude, a screenshot of Claude being really stupid and you're like, some days I feel this is all

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.740
 so stupid and not growing anywhere.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:12.700
 I'm like, yeah, literally every week I have the opposite take on AI.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.940
 And someone even commented on it being like,

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:19.740
 that actually has to get different is like just arguing the opposite side every every other week.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.260
 And like, yeah, if you're actually using this, that's just how it feels.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.140
 Like there's days where I'm like, wow, it did such a good job.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:32.940
 And there's other days where you're like, this did such a bad job that I fundamental.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.660
 I think the tech is just fundamentally like there's no way this is the path to

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.460
 the place we want to get to, right?

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:41.500
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:48.060
 Some of the things that's capable of concluding or making diffs for or just like,

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.300
 this can't be it.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:57.500
 We get like a better version of this is still not good. This is no, no hope.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.460
 I don't know.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.260
 It's all simultaneously super exciting.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:05.260
 And there's weeks, like you said, there's like times where I'm just like, man, the future is just so

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.060
 exciting. I can't wait every new model. It's like exciting.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:12.220
 And then there's the weeks where it's like, man, I'm working on something like this.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:17.740
 Like I'm trying to make a thing that uses these tools and just for my own sake.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:22.860
 If nothing else, like trying to build a tool to use models to generate code.

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.540
 And then I'm just like, is this even worth doing?

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.700
 Cause this is like, some of the stuff you're running to.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:34.060
 You know, I've always felt that people are really bad at assessing what makes them more productive.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:40.380
 I think I wrote this thread on the other day where we like, there's things we like doing.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:44.780
 And we just described productivity to it because we want to feel like it's also rational.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.860
 So I think people are generally about assessing is a tool making them more productive.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.420
 And I definitely feel that way with some of these AI things where I'm like,

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:57.340
 a big drive for me to use them is so I can exert less and be lazier.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:02.780
 And that's really biasing my ability to judge whether it's worth it or being more productive.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:07.580
 I think that I found enough like objective things where I'm like, yes, but I'm just aware of this.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:11.820
 Like we're just bad at assessing what's actually making us go faster versus what's

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.700
 just the same or even slower.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:20.380
 Yeah, it's like, I don't even, I know at first I was thinking about the ways I could parallelize

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:25.900
 and be faster. I feel like I've long since decided, no, it's really just about, it's those moments

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:31.100
 where it writes something that I just hate. I hate doing that work and it did it and it did it well.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:35.580
 And that's what keeps me coming back. It's like this promise of a world where you can only do the

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:41.100
 parts you want to do. And it's good enough to like automate the stuff that's just not that fun.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:46.860
 That's that's what I hope for. So the paralyzing thing is interesting because I agree, like there's

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:54.140
 moments where you can do that. But man, does that take a lot of energy and like a weird like, yeah,

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:59.580
 it's like the opposite of flow state. It's like you're in this freaky like jitter zone where it

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:05.020
 does not feel good to be still a very hard limit. I don't feel like you can train yourself to get

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:09.980
 past a certain number of tasks that are being juggled at once and like actually make progress

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.740
 at any faster rate than if you just went head down on one finish it head down on the other

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:18.060
 finish it. Like, yeah, I don't know if you can do three things at once. I'm not convinced.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.740
 Yeah. And there's a lot of research. We already know that people are bad at multitasking,

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:25.980
 even if, you know, we have these tools. So I think we're so fundamental. That's what I agree.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:30.780
 Okay. So then you go back to the other thing you said where you said it let it just when

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.780
 they're just tedious work that you don't want to do, it can take over. What are you doing while it's

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:41.260
 doing that work? It depends a lot of things. I don't do the YouTube thing. I've never really

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:45.660
 fallen into the YouTube or watching Netflix while I work. I know that's a thing you like to do.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:54.540
 What am I doing? Usually I'm reading or like I've got a browser based, not reading like a book.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.940
 Like I'm usually reading something on the internet. Like I've maybe got Jim and I or

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:06.380
 or something open in the browser doing some searching or digging into some future problem.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:10.220
 I'm basically like stacking my next work, like trying to figure out how I'm going to solve the

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:15.820
 next problem. And I think that's effective use of time. Like I do think I'm more productive in a

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:23.740
 good day. It's just the bad days and what you're left with when it's over or just so devastating

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:29.980
 feeling. Like you didn't enjoy the day. So there's that at least like there were days in my 15 years

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:34.380
 of programming where at least you enjoyed the flow state or whatever. Like you enjoyed the

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:38.540
 process of having the music going and coding. Even if the other day you're like, man, I'm in a

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:43.660
 worse place than when I started. Like I ran myself into a hole. At least you had that satisfaction

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:50.060
 that you kind of enjoyed it. Now it's like, I don't enjoy sending a little like well written

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:56.780
 prompt and then waiting on it and it just being completely stupid. That part sucks. And then if

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:01.020
 you also end up in a bad place at the end of the day, it's like double sucks. Yeah, I don't know.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.740
 It's it's tough. It's tough to know whether I'm excited or I hate it. Sometimes I literally

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:09.900
 just think I wish none of this had been invented. Not because like I'm afraid I'm gonna lose my job.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.220
 I'm not like somebody who works for people. I don't like I'm not gonna lose my job over AI.

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:18.060
 So like this is not that fake. Some of people you say anything like this and they're like,

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:23.260
 oh, yeah, engineers are scared. There's people that get off to this idea of us losing their jobs.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:28.380
 It's just so stupid. I am not afraid to lose my job. I just sometimes wish it didn't exist. So I

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:36.220
 didn't have so much of my mental energy invested into this figuring out. Yes. When I had a perfectly

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:44.620
 fun, enjoyable job before. Yeah, it's it is just so weird. It's it's I think what makes it different

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:51.500
 is everything else, any other major shift in I've seen before, it's all just deterministic.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.420
 Like there's a new technology that comes out. You might not get it right away and maybe you

00:34:55.420 --> 00:35:00.460
 overuse it and you like eventually learn the right way to use it and you find a good balance.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:07.660
 This is like a chaos box. So like, it's just different every day, you know? Yeah, like they're

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:12.060
 not getting a handle of it. Like you can get a little bit better at using it. But yeah, like

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:17.820
 you had, like I said, there's another technology where there's a day where I do well with it.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:23.100
 And the next day, it's like 100 degrees, like 180 degrees in the other direction,

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:28.700
 like pouring me down. I've never had anything like that before. So chaos box. That's a perfect way

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.620
 of putting it. Yeah. So I can relate to you saying, I wish it was an event that because I'm like,

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:39.660
 I don't this isn't something that we can learn and get better at this way. We've done with other

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:46.060
 things. Yeah, I feel like if the models just suddenly stopped doing really stupid stuff,

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:50.220
 which I don't know if that's possible, but if they did, and they were reliable and they could call

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:55.580
 tools reliably, then like there is this world I think I could enjoy where I don't do tedious

00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:01.260
 things. And I mostly do high level and I can move faster. Like for anything I'm working on,

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:06.700
 I have these stupid lists. I use this clear app. And it's just like, I mean, it's just,

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:11.820
 can you see on the camera? It's just like, I have things and things and things that I want to do

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.980
 always. And I'm always thinking of new things. I want to add lists. If I could chew through that

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:21.820
 faster, I'd love that world, even if it's less enjoyable work. I just don't know if we're getting

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.980
 there and I can't tell if I'm actually moving any faster, if I'm just more frustrated. Yeah.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:31.340
 Yeah, it's like, you'll go to that list and it'll like nail the first one. You're like, wow,

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:37.900
 that saved me a whole day. Then the next one costs you two days. Exactly. That's exactly it.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:43.020
 Like you'll have that. It's like golf where you hit that one shot. Keep you coming back. I have that

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:47.900
 one day where it does all the things I need. And I'm like, I'm going to be a professional this,

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:52.860
 whatever this is. And then the next three days you spend on the stupidest stuff and you're just,

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:59.020
 it's just tough. I'd love to hear from other people have one thing I'm aware of is that

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:06.300
 I only use a very small subset of the mini tools out there right now. And even the mini models,

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:12.460
 I got to be curious from people who use cursor or winter for even the eaters of the world. There's

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:16.540
 like root code, I think is the thing, which, how would you name your thing after kangaroo? I just

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:21.740
 can't use a thing named after kangaroo. I don't know. I don't get it. There's Klein. There's like

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:26.220
 a handful of these that keep coming up. People say, oh, this one's so good. And I wonder, like,

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:30.460
 are people having a better time than me? Am I just too stubborn to leave Neil them? And if

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:34.940
 I just did, I'd have a better time. Like the models are really good with the system prompts they use

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:39.740
 on this tool. I don't know. I wonder about that. Yeah, I just don't think they are at least for

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:45.340
 like this agentic thing where like it just runs on its own. I do know something other like autocomplete

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:49.740
 stuff. There's something more of a variation and how good it is. But yeah, in terms of like

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:56.540
 the whole vibe coding thing, I don't think there's better experiences. Like you have pushed, you've

00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:01.340
 like looked at this from all different angles and tried it. I've done it myself, not just for coding.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:07.420
 I mean, less for coding, more on just general tasks side. And yeah, like there are people

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:13.020
 better than me at it that get better results. But it's like, I'm looking for like a five x better

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:18.460
 result. I think everyone's yeah, the best person at this maybe is like 25% better than than I am.

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:24.940
 And it's not really really that meaningful. The other thing is I'm stepping back a bit. And

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:29.980
 I like knowledge is a little bit like reading tea leaves and probably just making stuff up.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:39.180
 If I look at how open AI is operating, every single move they've made for years now is in the

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:45.420
 direction of this is roughly as good as it gets while saying the opposite, right? Yeah. And I

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:52.220
 believe that they can believe both things at once. But this whole wind surf acquisition blows

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:58.220
 my mind. Yeah, it's like, not the number of dollars. Just like, why are they buying wind surf? I don't,

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:03.980
 like, because they think this is it. And they just want to capitalize on all the people using the

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:09.740
 thing. There is basically creating more, what holds in like the application layer, right?

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:17.260
 If you think about like a parallel, like AWS cloud, imagine if AWS was like, we're going to focus on

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:21.740
 infrastructure and helping you guys with applications. And the next thing you know,

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:26.700
 they're building like, they're like building stat news on their own or they're building like,

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:34.060
 like linear on their own. Then you're kind of like, if they started doing that, you would think,

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:38.700
 oh, maybe they don't really believe in this cloud thing. They don't believe that the whole world

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.700
 could build on top of this. It's going to enable a lot because they're like, we need to capture

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:48.780
 the application layer. So the acquisitions, I mean, like a year ago, they had some kind of big

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:53.340
 announcement. I was at the most boring, enterprisey B2B thing. It was like in the middle of them,

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:59.340
 like hyping up AGI. And it was like, just, it was like the equivalent of like, single sign on,

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:03.820
 like it was kind of that kind of announcement. Yeah. And then sit and to them, they acquired

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:09.980
 Windsor, which again, deep into the application layer. They just hired, and this is a little weird.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:14.860
 They had a board member who was the CEO of Instacart. He is now joining OpenAI. She's leaving

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:20.780
 Instacart joining OpenAI as a CEO of applications, which again, is another like, deeper investment

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:26.300
 to application layer. Yeah. And there's old quotes from Sam Altman talking about

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:36.460
 saying that they're not going to be an application layer. And he defines it as, if you build anything

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:43.900
 assuming the model won't get better, you might feel like OpenAI is encroaching

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:49.340
 in your territory, because like the model will get better and they'll kind of make it pointless

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:53.580
 for that application to exist. But then he said, if you build things assuming the model will get

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.980
 better, that's when we define as the application layer. Our job is to make the model better. Your

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:03.500
 job is to build stuff that takes advantage of these better models and it fills whatever gap

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:07.340
 there is. And I think that makes sense. I think that's a correct way to phrase it.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:13.340
 But Windsor and AI editors are in that second category. They're not very good right now.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:17.660
 They're entirely built on the premise of the models getting better and then just doing the

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:25.340
 last mile for OpenAI to acquire and get into that space, effectively saying that we want to win

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:32.140
 the coding code editor towing war. Yeah, that is like, yeah, you're not doing that. You're

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.980
 not doing that. You're competing in application space. I think it's fair for us to say like,

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:41.420
 you're not really betting on just being a model provider. Yeah, yeah. No, that makes sense.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:48.460
 Yeah, it feels like they just they got really, because it codecs was not far before, like that's

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:52.940
 pretty close timing with the wind surf acquisition. It feels like they just like decided they needed

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:57.500
 to care about developers with the anthropic kind of carving that niche out. Yeah, I don't know.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:03.100
 This is all like random commentary. I think that is right. And I feel like anthropic has always

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:08.540
 positioned themselves as like they're going to focus on certain verticals and like do it really

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:15.740
 well or maybe like at least initially. And yeah, they found a foothold in coding and developer tools.

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:21.340
 And you can kind of like squint and see how if you're Sam Altman and anthropic has carved out,

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:25.340
 we're the best for developer tools. And then you realize how these models might only be good at

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:29.900
 coding. That might be like, yeah, this is all headed towards just like automating code.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:35.340
 Then you kind of have to like compete in that space. Maybe that justifies a wind surf acquisition

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.860
 just to get a bunch of developers that use one surf, which I don't know who uses the wind surf.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:43.580
 I know everyone uses cursor. Cursor was more popular, right? Why buy the second one?

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:46.780
 I guess cursor didn't want to sell. Oh, well, I guess that's fair.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:51.900
 Wouldn't that suck if Microsoft beats them? And then they didn't sell for $3 billion if you're

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:59.420
 the founders of cursor? I think Microsoft will beat them. And I like for the current valuation,

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:05.740
 which is nine billion, for that to make sense, you basically need to win the editor. Yeah,

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:10.700
 you need to be the default one that everybody's using. It would take such a colossal

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:16.380
 fuck up from Microsoft to allow that to happen. Obviously, I still think like even if Microsoft

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:20.940
 wins, there's probably still a multi-billion dollar business potentially.

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.860
 Yeah. As I think about it, the founders are probably fine. They're making so much money right now.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:31.100
 Yeah. Well, the other thing is like this, they are like one of the fastest, maybe if not the fastest,

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:40.380
 like ARR growth company ever, like it's insane. But I also don't think that anyone has ever given

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:46.940
 away more money or free. I think it's learned to the levels of Uber back in the day.

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:51.900
 Oh, yeah. I could go anywhere in New York for like $3.40. That was amazing.

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:55.820
 When you say that, are you saying like they charge, I think, a $20 subscription?

00:43:55.820 --> 00:44:01.500
 They're just the average users. Yeah. Is the average user using way more usage than that,

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:11.180
 you suspect? Are they burning cash? They probably are. If I think about my usage of Claude's API,

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:17.100
 I use more than $20. And I'm not even a heavy AI user. If I'm using like an AI-based code editor,

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:23.260
 I imagine I'm using it even more than I am. So again, I don't know. But it seems very unlikely

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:28.140
 this $20. It's like a made up number that OpenAI made up because they had to just pick a random

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:33.980
 number and everyone got anchored to that. And it's funny that random number five years ago was like,

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:38.060
 that's high for a consumer subscription. Now it's like, I don't know, you can't eat for $20. You

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:44.300
 can't do anything for $20. It's like kind of the new 10. Like an American 20 is kind of the new 10.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:49.660
 It's interesting how that's not even a high number anymore. Yeah. And if you look first like some other

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:58.460
 like data points of price discovery, anthropic is not letting you use Claude code on their $20

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:04.060
 a month subscription. They're making you do the $100. I think it's a $100 or $200 a month subscription.

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:08.380
 Then you can use it. It's confusing. They have a hundred and a 200 version of the same thing.

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:15.100
 Yeah. Max $100 version of the $200 version. And that lets you that lets you do use Claude code,

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:20.380
 but then even then it's limited. It's not limited Claude code. So the way I look at things is

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:28.060
 whoever has the least friendly pricing model is likely to have the most accurate like sustainable

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:34.940
 pricing model, least friendly. So it feels like a bad deal like paying over a hundred bucks and

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:38.540
 it's not even unlimited. Like it feels like a bad deal, but it's more sustainable. More like

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:41.980
 that makes me think that that's probably the real price. I mean, curse is still like raised as

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:46.300
 much as they're printing revenue. They're also like raising huge amounts of capital. So they

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:51.900
 must be in like burned phase where they're just like, I mean, obviously growing like crazy, I guess.

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:55.500
 Who is the user of cursor? I still don't understand. Like is it developers or is it

00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:00.780
 non-developers or is it like, how did they become such a fast growing? They just replaced people's

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.940
 VS code with cursor basically. So all the people, all the developers that use VS code.

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:10.220
 Yeah. I guess like if I'm a via, if you were a VS code user, there's basically like,

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:16.700
 pretty sure every switch to cursor. Yeah. That said, I'm just like, what the fuck is even cursor?

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:26.380
 Like a few times I've tried it. It feels like such a slight modification to VS code. Like I get

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:33.020
 the cursor tab thing is made better than get up go pilot or whatever. I buy that. But again,

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:39.100
 like that's just a plugin again. And then like the whole sidebar. Yeah. Okay. The diff thing.

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:43.260
 Okay. You can see the diff on the file and accept it like that. That probably is like a good,

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:50.140
 good workflow. But it feels so thin. Is this like a thin thing to build a company on?

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:54.460
 They like train models or something, don't they? Do they like do custom models or no?

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:59.980
 Yeah. They were hiring for people to do that. And they are doing that. And they acquired

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:04.140
 SuperMaven, which is a custom model. I don't know if they're using that. If they just shut it down

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.700
 and they have their own, like, I don't know exactly what happened with that. But uh,

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:10.380
 they better not shut it down because I'm still paying my $10 a month. It's so good.

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.700
 Me too. I'm, yeah, I love using SuperMaven. But yeah, I have no idea what's going on inside

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.060
 that company. If they are, I mean, if they are training their own models, maybe they could be

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.580
 using them for internal stuff. But you like choose a model and cursor, right? Like people use

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:26.060
 Gemini and cursor and use. So it's still the underlying providers right now. You're right.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:30.700
 A gentic. Yeah, you're right. Which I, I, this whole thing, like people talk about all these models

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:36.140
 and how great. Oh, now Jim and I 2.5 has a new version and it's so great. I, I hate how much

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:41.820
 the reality is. I can't use anything but 3.7. Like Sonnet 3.7 is the only thing that can call

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:47.020
 tools reliably and actually do the agent thing. Yep. I use Jim and I and I just dumped my whole

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:53.740
 code base into it to get like ideas and insights and to build markdown files as a plan for Sonnet.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:48:00.060
 But like I cannot use a different model as the workhorse model in this agent thing. Everything

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:03.820
 else falls on its face just immediately. Yeah. And it's funny because that's not even coding

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:07.900
 related because I went through the exact same thing for open control of figuring out I had

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:17.100
 my test prompt of like looking to why I had a billing spike in February. And I tried every single

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:24.380
 model and they all just they all seem to not the feeling I got was they did something with 3.7

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:31.180
 where they like very intentionally made it like do this a loop run to an issue think about a new

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:36.700
 idea retry thing is almost built for that flow. Yeah. Every other model seems to when they when

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:41.260
 it does do that it almost seems like by accident where like they'll kind of do it and they'll like

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:47.500
 flop on the next one. Whereas yeah. 3.7 feels like I'm going to burn all of your money to

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:53.020
 figure out this problem in a good way. In a good way. Yeah. Not like a malicious way. I

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:57.980
 don't think they were just trying to like burn more tokens. It clearly has this formula 3.7

00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:03.900
 where it starts by saying okay I'll fix your problem with it summarizes what you prompted it.

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:09.020
 Then calls a billion tools. It'll just call tools until it finally gets to a point where it says

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:13.420
 okay I did the thing and then it summarizes it with a nice markdown summary. None of the other

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:17.100
 tools and none of the other models do that like they don't they don't do the summary at the end

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:21.260
 they don't acknowledge you at the beginning they just start calling random tools and they just stop

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:26.220
 or they won't call some of the tools like they clearly used to do the work you're asking that's

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:31.340
 not a funny thing. Yeah. Could you show me this file? It's like no you have a view file to use it.

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:37.500
 Yeah. It just spit. Yeah. I'll tell you like refund something on Stripe and I'll be like

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:42.460
 you should go to their Stripe console and refund them. I'm like no I'm asking you to do that.

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:48.140
 Yeah. That's the whole point here. Yeah. So they did something there's some magic there.

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.420
 Yeah we talked about this on one of the pockets I think it wasn't a coincidence I don't think

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:55.980
 that they released 3.7 and cloud code at the same time. They've clearly trained 3.7 or they've done

00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:01.340
 something with some kind of underlying prompt system prompt thing and it is built for this purpose.

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:07.900
 I just wish the smarts of Gemini 2.5 or even one of the open AI models like O3 I wish the

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:13.260
 intelligence of one of those models had this ability and I would never use cloud 3.7 again

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:20.700
 like ever because it's dumb. It's just it's stupid. I think the proof here is with a lot of these

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:26.940
 other models. They were really bad. It basically would try one tool and give up. Then when I put

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:32.300
 in something really aggressive like if you run an error think really hard about like a different

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.860
 way to solve the problem and try again and never give up and it would it would improve. I wouldn't

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:42.540
 say I'm not saying it's like it fixes a problem but it would approve right it would like you know

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:47.580
 kind of do what I'm asking it whereas the system prompt for cloud code does not include that at

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:52.620
 all it doesn't say anything about like keep trying or like call them yeah it's baked into the model

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:56.860
 like it's baked into something we can't see anyway maybe not into the model but like they have their

00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:01.100
 own system prompt that they milled with ours or something there's something on the other

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:06.380
 side of the API boundary that they do to make 3.7 that way and I just wish that secret sauce would

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:11.500
 make it into every other model so then the latest greatest models you could just plug in in this

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:16.860
 role and it would do all the things you expect. Yeah I would expect this to happen because I think

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:22.940
 they're gonna see this yeah yeah I think a lot of people posting stuff like you know I think

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:28.140
 yesterday we saw everyone was like oh the new 25 pro update is so good and you know whatever

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:34.540
 benchmark crap I got a good score. I think the average person doesn't test this thing at all I

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:40.300
 think they just like ask it a single question and see if it gets a good answer. I do again come back

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:45.740
 I wonder do people test it in cursor and does cursor have a better system prompt that like they've

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:49.980
 worked the magic to get this out of these other models I just wonder if that's the case somebody

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:54.460
 said Klein is really good with Jim and I 2.5 they haven't had this experience I need to hear

00:51:54.460 --> 00:52:01.820
 somebody tell me or like show me not just like Twitter speak like oh no it's really good like

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:07.100
 show me like is it actually really good because I've never seen another model do what 3.7 does

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:13.100
 and I wish I had one that did it. Yeah to me the variables seem very limited it's like the only

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:18.700
 thing you can control as someone just using the model is the system prompt and like the list of

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:23.900
 tools that in the description. Yeah and I guess how you yeah how you name the tools how you format

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:28.780
 the descriptions like there's there are some knobs you could turn. Yeah and and I've seen

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:34.140
 improvements where like I've like improved the descriptions or like document the parameters better

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:38.940
 or like update a system prompt and I've like improved some prompt over time and it does get better

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:44.700
 but but there's still like a binary thing that 3.7 has that the other ones don't have. Yeah it just

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:50.460
 feels like and I don't think that tweaking explains the difference between one person being like this

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:54.620
 is bad and the other person being like this is good. Yeah but yet the tweaking can explain that

00:52:54.620 --> 00:53:02.220
 wider gap to me I think it just people aren't really using it as intensely or like really comparing

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:06.860
 it to like consistently trying the same thing it's seeing if it's actually getting better or like

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:11.900
 keeping kind of what it sucks at and trying it again like it's it is like a very a lot of this

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:19.260
 is like traditional science because the model is such a black box that we do not understand how it

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:25.740
 works or what's changed about it so it's like very similar to like scientists trying to observe

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:32.780
 phenomena in nature yeah where you have to be really really really diligent to actually figure

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:38.780
 out what's going on what's like a false it's like so easy to find false correlations and things like

00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:46.780
 that and I don't think any of us are particularly we're not that rigorous yeah yeah I think for us

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:52.860
 we are very used to seeing a very complicated system that's like naked so we can go like

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:57.180
 introspect it and understand how it's working and then say oh okay here's how it works

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:03.660
 we're not used to a system we can't look inside that we need to just poke and see what the behavior

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:09.180
 is and like you know get understanding that way yeah there are a couple people that I follow on

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:15.340
 Twitter for this exact reason that they do this and but the problem is so one that's like more

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:23.100
 like household name not household name but what's Simon do you do you follow Simon will

00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:30.540
 will listen he writes he's got like a blog and he's like a longtime co-creator of Django like a

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:37.180
 long time python guy so I never really followed him or had a reason to until AI stuff he writes

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:40.940
 really nice articles about when there's new models I've seen this Twitter around yeah like when he

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:45.020
 when there's a new model he actually does kind of like run them through some benchmarks of his own

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:51.740
 or whatever and he seems pretty knowledgeable about it the other person though is uh ex oh man

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:59.020
 I'm gonna yeah ex JDR I basically just go to Twitter to see this Shrek man's tweets these days the

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:06.380
 problem is uh he's like doing like kuda programming and all this stuff like he like custom runs all

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:12.460
 these models on his two million dollar rig with full of GPUs like he is not a normal person so

00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:17.180
 when he says a model is good it's like he's doing things to make it good like he still says maverick

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:20.940
 is good and like he runs it using all these certain parameters like yeah you just got to tweak

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:25.660
 the whatever and I'm like okay well for me that's not helpful yeah but it's nice to see somebody who

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:30.380
 actually knows what models are good at what like he knows this one's really good at tool calling

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:35.420
 this one's really not and I actually trust everything he says so give him a follow on Twitter he's

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:40.540
 amazing but yeah this again like it's crazy every time pretty much every time we've got on his

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:45.180
 podcast talk it's like the same topic and it kind of goes yeah to what you're saying which is

00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:53.820
 we're like oh stuck trying to figure this out and it doesn't really feel like it's by choice it feels

00:55:53.820 --> 00:56:00.060
 like we have to because this thing is this uh-huh it's like showing the new guy around the office

00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:07.740
 like we just it's an obligation yeah and it's part of our job now but like some days I love it some

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:12.540
 days I hate it it's such a weird yeah there's just 15 years of doing this there's never been anything

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:18.140
 like this for me in my career yeah not like AI just like this kind of dilemma where I feel this

00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:23.260
 way about my work yeah and this stuff is so complicated because it's like so I think about

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:29.020
 some tedious worry let's say I like rename something in a way where like my lsp can't just

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:35.180
 auto rename it I need to go up there things in a bunch of files mm-hmm obviously tedious boring

00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:42.460
 but I there are like times in my day where I feel good doing work like that because it's

00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:47.660
 just you know you're like every second you're you're like getting stuff done you know it's gonna

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:54.300
 work at the end it's like it's like just it's labor but it feels kind of good to cut up you know the

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:59.820
 other kinds of ways I need to use my brain in the day um and that's the type of stuff that AI can

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:06.940
 just totally take away from me but I don't know if that's putting me in a better place yeah well

00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:11.820
 a good example yesterday I had to do like a big fine replace of a couple of patterns across

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:17.580
 a code base and I could have just burned the tokens and just had a I do it and I think it would have

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:22.700
 done it like done it fine but I also realized like I don't do a very good job of this and

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:27.420
 kneel them like I didn't have the whole quickfiscs lists like workflow down very well and I don't

00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:31.100
 have the commands memorized once I do have stuff in a quickfiscs list so I just like spent the time

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:36.860
 to like do it kneel them the right way and like used even used Jim and I or something to help me

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:40.060
 understand the trade-offs of different approaches because in kneel them there's like a hundred ways

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:44.060
 to do everything yeah and in Unix in general there's like a hundred ways to do everything

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:48.860
 so I just kind of like did it the manual way but like tried to improve just sharpen my tools

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:52.860
 you know like the kneel them approach and I realized like that yeah it's taken away from

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:57.740
 that too like it's taken away from the tinkering and the like just kind of like refining your craft

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:03.900
 if you just spurred the LLM on stuff like that like you realize like a lot of those types of tasks

00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:08.300
 there's some way that somebody's come up with before all this that's like a fun kind of like

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:15.260
 brain tickling experience now yeah it's all fine I think the challenge here is it's good to preserve

00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:22.620
 that if it's still needed the question is like which way is it gonna fall right like let's say

00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:28.860
 and I always compare it may as comparison CSS float we all knew all these float tricks back in the

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:34.460
 day to like get the right layout and you know that ended up being a thing that just totally was

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:40.140
 not needed when certain like layout stuff came out like flexbox and stuff yeah flex yeah sure so

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:45.340
 it would have been dumb to be someone trying to like preserve their usage of it yeah ultimately yeah

00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:55.260
 was eliminated mm-hmm but if flexbox only partially solved it and failed in a lot of cases

00:58:55.260 --> 00:59:02.380
 then the people that like kept up their knowledge of that end up in a really good position if they

00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:07.740
 like learned both mm-hmm so yeah it's just it's unclear which way it's uh it's gonna fall I can't

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:14.300
 tell if I'm just yeah preserving tradition for fun or if it's gonna continue to be something

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:19.740
 that's important I mean I feel like I at this point I'm doubled down and quadrupled down on

00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:25.900
 leveraging these things and it's gonna just feel like a huge bummer if they don't get better because

00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:30.460
 I feel the pain every day of them sucking and I better at least get the payoff of them getting

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:35.660
 good and all this being worth it you know what I mean like like I've invested heavily into this

00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:41.900
 between tokens and also just like building tools it just feels like I need this to pay off from

00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:47.580
 my sanity but then if it doesn't I guess it's like the consolation is we still love programming and

00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:52.060
 that's like pretty good I just want to know worst case I know I know yeah and I want to know how

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:56.700
 long it's gonna drag on like this like I don't know there's this thing that got posted and it was

00:59:56.700 --> 01:00:02.220
 made like a month ago it was like that was called it was basically some people deep in the AI

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:07.820
 research space that like play out the next like 10 years or something and they call these predictions

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:12.620
 and how things are gonna go out and obviously they get to a pretty or not obviously but like

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:17.740
 as you would guess that gets to a pretty fantastical place pretty quickly and

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:21.900
 you know how I say I've read like 10 books and they've

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:27.900
 for the right 10 books yeah one of the ideas that were like deeply

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:35.980
 that show up across some of those books is how consistently

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:45.100
 experts in a field I know you're headed like just a horrible prediction like they do worse than

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:51.020
 a non-expert like an average person like and it's it's crazy dynamic where like the closer you are

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:55.820
 to it the more likely you're like over time that you're overfitting this there's information

01:00:55.820 --> 01:01:00.140
 you have and it becomes very hard for you to predict stuff in the future and this shows up as like

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:08.540
 uh like deep like intellectual analysis of why this happens you know I've seen in a bunch of

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:12.700
 places there it also shows up in like fun practical places like there's this really famous

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:21.980
 panel that Isaac Asimov was on alongside a bunch of like scientists or like people deep in

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:28.460
 like people actually doing stuff and they're all asked to make predictions of what you know the

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:31.020
 50 I forgot what it was maybe like 50 years in the future what it's gonna look like

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:38.860
 and the science fiction author Isaac Asimov had the most conservative responses and ultimately

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:45.740
 ended up being closer to the truth than the people like building the future yeah I've seen

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.860
 to me this is like a first principle to me like I had seen it enough from like this is a

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:55.020
 foundational truth about the world like you just cannot like use expert analysis or expert predictions

01:01:55.020 --> 01:02:02.220
 as like it just never works out simultaneously like I'm still very open to the idea that this

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:07.260
 time it's different you know it feels like what I don't like about this first principle is it feels

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:12.620
 like a like an attack on a personality it's like you're this kind of person therefore

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:16.380
 anything you say is wrong so I don't like that because it has nothing to do with a substance of

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:22.620
 their argument but simultaneously it just is so true historically yeah so that's where I also

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:28.620
 struggle with this yeah it feels like a different category of problem than predicting the future

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:33.900
 in the sense that like like if I guess playing out what you're saying like the experts right now

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:39.020
 in our field or in technology would say like coding is going away in the next whatever let's say

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:43.020
 the conservative ones are saying in the next two years I mean the more aggressive ones are like

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:50.300
 three months or whatever six months ago that's yeah so if this if the experts are prognosticating

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:57.340
 that programming is going away in months I guess the more conservative like if you had the science

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:04.220
 fiction writer of today guessing they would say five years my problem is like is it even going away

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:11.100
 like is this even gonna happen like are we even gonna keep going on this path is like a real question

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:17.020
 in my mind like there's yeah it's not like how soon it's like is this yeah me too yeah I also

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:21.420
 feel like is it even possible yeah I could have bold that whole thing I just said into like I don't

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:25.740
 know if it's predicting how soon or whether this is even the direction yeah yeah so for me it's not

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:30.300
 even like the getting the time right I I agree with you it's about like is this even are we even on

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:35.980
 it is a path we're on even the right track something that leads to that given infinite time

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:40.780
 yeah I think this thing cuts in two ways right so when we say experts we're talking about experts

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:44.940
 in AI people that are people that like really understand how these systems are built and

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:50.140
 and like predict how they're gonna get better mm-hmm they're not experts in programming right yeah

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:58.460
 so just like programmers often think that they can automate things that cannot be automated

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:01.580
 because it's a lot more complicated than same so an outsider because you're an expert at programming

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:06.300
 not express something else I think the same dynamic might be happening here where they're just wrong

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:11.260
 because they don't understand the depth of this yeah simultaneously programmers are not experts

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:16.060
 in AI so like us saying it's not gonna happen also you know everyone is just

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:23.100
 no one's an expert in the what like the full picture right mm-hmm so I think yeah that's why

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:30.220
 I have such a tough time strongly believing anything yes saying yeah like at my core I believe that

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:35.900
 it won't I don't think it's gonna dramatically make a huge impact in the world I feel that at my core

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:41.420
 if I look at people's behavior versus what they're saying their behavior also seems to line up with

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:47.020
 what I'm saying but I just acknowledge all these biases I have that makes me want to believe

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:52.060
 all that so yeah I just really enjoy making fun of the people at this point that strongly believe

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:58.380
 anything about AI people are so weird it's crazy I'm like how can you again it's a chaos box how

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:03.500
 can you not hate it one day I'm love it the other day like uh-huh I don't understand how you can have

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:08.060
 any other feeling about it there's just some people that have made AI like their personality like if

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:15.500
 you if you have in your head a definition of like AGI and ASI you're just weird I'm sorry like just

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:20.780
 move on like find another hobby because you're one of those people that is the reply guy on twitter

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:27.180
 that strongly feels something about AI and it's just so annoying like what I mean people do this

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:32.540
 with crypto but like feels even weirder with AI like the amount of like emotional reaction people

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:38.060
 have around something so unrelated to them as a person maybe it's just the state of the world

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:44.060
 like everything's getting more impassionate I don't know impassionate yeah I'm impassioned

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:49.020
 yeah I think I keep trying to like remember exactly what crypto is like to see if there's any

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:54.860
 wisdom in our experiences there it was definitely weird yeah and it was definitely like uh

01:05:54.860 --> 01:06:00.220
 obviously a lot of parallels but I think the thing that throws a hitch and everything is AI is like

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:05.740
 already more useful than crypto is so it's like hard for me to draw the parallel without like

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:10.860
 feeling like I'm not giving it the right credit can I ask you a really random question before we go

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:15.820
 yeah what do you think about uh royally does that name mean anything or don't need to say

01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:20.620
 more about him I have a lot of complex thoughts about him I do too and I want to hear your thoughts

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:26.780
 I feel like his millennials uh this is a fun topic because it dips into like this new generation

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:30.380
 that's coming up and all kinds of stuff yeah yeah or do you not want to talk about him maybe

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:35.580
 you don't want to I do want to talk about him I think I'd love to talk to him and give him some

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:41.420
 advice I think that's kind of where my oh okay yeah he probably would not come on our podcast but

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:49.180
 that would be awesome yeah I think and again for people that just to get a little bit of context

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:55.500
 royally invented this like tool that lets people cheat on interviews and was very good at making

01:06:55.500 --> 01:07:01.420
 a big public stink about it uh Columbia got pissed was very good at leveraging Columbia getting pissed

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:07.180
 into more attention here's my feeling about him I think there's a group of people that are like

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:13.180
 he's ruining his reputation or like he's like he's he's like screwing himself over

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:17.180
 I think they're wrong I think like fundamentally they don't really get what's going on I think

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:23.500
 they're wrong yeah but I do think he's making a mistake that it's a possible not to I don't even

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.860
 think if I talk to him like I could even get I think it's the thing that you have to go through

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:32.300
 yeah he's obviously very good at getting attention and a lot of people look at that and they're like

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:37.180
 they focus a lot on that they're like he's so good at getting attention that anyone criticizing

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:45.180
 him but anything is wrong but I think there's this trap where when you mechanically when you're

01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:50.780
 so good at like knowing what will get people to engage and like focus and give you attention

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:59.100
 you think you are conquering that system because you're like playing it but it's playing you also

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:05.100
 because it like traps your mind into focusing on things that will get attention or that obviously

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:09.420
 will get attention or doing things in a way that'll obviously get attention and it's mechanically

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:14.780
 following that step-by-step does not lead to there's not there's no guarantee that leads to a

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:20.620
 a good place right mm-hmm the product he products he builds are things that are innately provocative

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:25.900
 there's no guarantee that the most important thing that he can work on is going to be something

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:30.940
 provocative it might be something that's not provocative at all so I feel like the things he

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:38.780
 works on and things he does he's so biased by how can I do it provocatively that he does dumb

01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:43.980
 things that don't that that are wrong and and don't make a lot of sense so yeah sure that's

01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:49.900
 basically my feeling around him I think the the stuff from this week was particularly funny

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:57.180
 the other types of things I like I think I don't even so much have opinions about him or where he's

01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:01.100
 headed or like you have this very like start-up mind where you can like see all the pitfalls and

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:06.220
 all the things that I'm just thinking like my first blush I'm a millennial developer and I hate

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:11.740
 every Gen Z developer like I just hate him so first I just hate this guy who is just oh my god but

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:17.260
 then it's like oh he doesn't have a an anime face that's nice yeah that's true actually shows his

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:21.900
 own face and then like and then I dig into like oh I actually really agree with this whole like

01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:25.900
 college stance that it is just so fake and there's so much stupid stuff about college

01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:30.860
 and about the systems that exist like I get the like stick it to the systems

01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:36.300
 I get that sentiment and then like he's really good at the attention thing and it's just funny to

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:41.980
 watch people get inflamed so obviously like he's just he's good at that stuff yeah and I think I'm

01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:46.460
 not so much thinking long term it's just like I've accepted now that like I can like Gen Z it's

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:50.300
 fine they're different they're just like throwing out all the stuff that we said and almost just

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:55.020
 like just throwing it out to throw it out like just like they're annoyed at us as well like you can

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:59.100
 feel the tension that Gen Z's kind of like wants nothing to do with millennial developers in our

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:02.700
 whole generation and I think that's why I said he would never come on the podcast like we're a

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:08.220
 couple of millennial developers I'm sure like well he did he did comment on our yacht video and he

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:14.380
 replied oh did he did reply and he I think he follows me he did reply saying one or Asian people

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:20.780
 didn't do anything this cool so okay so he doesn't completely have an irreverence towards us as

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:27.820
 millennials but I do I feel the like the changing of the guard almost this is so stupid and like

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:34.620
 I don't know just like pointless to have these thoughts probably but like it's just like waste

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:39.900
 of time slots but like there's something about that gap that it was bridged with this royally

01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:47.260
 character I feel like for me yeah the whole the whole like anonymous crowd of Gen Z devs

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:55.020
 in twitter and elsewhere like the whole anime face thing uh really had me like a very annoyed

01:10:55.020 --> 01:11:01.580
 with that group and this this is the more refreshing take if he like he's like doing the leader of that

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:05.580
 and he's actually doing stuff like the whole anime face thing they never do it and they just

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:11.180
 talk about doing stuff yes he's actually doing so I had a very bad taste in my mouth and I feel like

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:15.740
 he's made me come around on it and just seeing millennials get upset with him helps me not be

01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:20.940
 upset anytime people get upset people I just get upset at them so yeah exactly yeah so he feel like

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:26.540
 I can empathize a little bit I just find everyone annoying yeah yeah yeah he's uh it's it's funny but

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:32.700
 like I guess I had this thought the other day and I don't again I'm going to also acknowledge that

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:38.700
 I'm obviously heavily heavily biased to believe this but I'll make a case for it regardless so

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:45.740
 there's a prototype of Silicon Valley founder right super young doesn't care about the system

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:50.860
 disruptive makes a huge impact a lot of the stories of the big companies previous generation

01:11:50.860 --> 01:12:00.540
 fit that mold right young energy go crazy do whatever I'm kind of wondering if there's a

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:06.140
 completely different explanation for all this stuff which is they just knew how to use computers

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:10.060
 it actually didn't it's not that the fact that they were young there's something about innately

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:14.780
 being young there was a generational divide at where at some point there were adults

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:19.100
 some of the adults or most adults did not know anything about using computers they kind of

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:23.260
 naturally like think in an internet way they didn't get any of this and then there was a

01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:30.060
 generation that did and they happened to be young and they did extremely well and that prototype is

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:39.660
 like persisted where Silicon Valley still expects that shape of person to win and like lead in the

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:45.500
 new disruption in the new companies whatever but I think the times are totally different now

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:51.420
 where the people that are young aren't competing with people that don't use computers they're

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.860
 competing with people that also not use computers as well as them and get everything as well as

01:12:54.860 --> 01:13:00.780
 them they may not get the marketing side as well but I just I don't see it playing out the same way

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:07.020
 and again I'm obviously biased I'm more in that latter generation now but I'm like yeah if you

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:12.060
 go head to head someone that's like young in the early 20s against someone that's like

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:17.740
 from like you know they've already had a 20-year career in tech but like as like a startup founder

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:23.180
 I have a hard time explaining why the young person would actually win like both these groups

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:27.660
 understand all the same stuff but the latter one has experience and in the world it shifted

01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:34.140
 in between two generations where it's going to default to the to the young one again so I don't

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:38.060
 I don't know if this shift is actually going to happen like I said some some stuff on like the

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:43.500
 marketing and attention side the younger generation understands more natively but I don't think the

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:49.100
 other generation is impossible for them to get there yeah can I kind of offer like a

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:56.940
 way to galaxy brain like assignment to Roy Lee it's this is like probably a stretch and this

01:13:56.940 --> 01:14:00.140
 may not be what he's doing but I just kind of view the whole startup thing is like another

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:06.460
 uh potential just like FU to the system like would it not be perfect for him to raise a ton of

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:10.860
 money for much of like old white men and then just like let it fly mountain who cares just have

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:15.900
 fun doing it but like it's another like this is just a stupid institution that has you know what

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:22.300
 I'm getting at like like VC as a concept just like colleges as a concept I don't know maybe he's

01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:27.580
 maybe he actually has startup dreams but I would not be surprised if none of that is even the point

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:34.220
 and like he's just having his fun kind of mocking the whole thing I mean that that would be really

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:41.660
 cool I think if he was doing that it would look a little bit more exciting and fun but yeah I so

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:47.900
 far so far it looks like he's just playing into he's like literally just doing the startup thing

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:53.500
 the exact persona of what he thinks he's supposed to be doing as a in the stage that he's in but

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:59.100
 yeah I don't know like I don't know if these like young founders are really gonna be it you know

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:05.420
 um I don't like I said I don't see cursor beating Microsoft I really don't because it's not like

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:10.700
 Microsoft is staff full of people that don't get it right totally different how it was back

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:17.500
 in the day big and slow but once they eventually get there yeah it's gonna be hard for my job to win

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.860
 and they're not starting from zero and they have yeah so it's I think it's just different these

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:27.580
 days and I think it's being a founder I think it's gonna we're gonna see a lot fewer first time

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:33.180
 founder wins like I just I just don't see how that's possible nowadays makes sense you seem

01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:37.660
 really needs to not have an anime profile picture because he's a millennial and he just screws the

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:43.100
 whole thing up are you sure this is a non-millennial thing I didn't know that I didn't understand I

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:46.860
 didn't think of it I actually don't know I don't know anything about all the anime profile people

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:51.180
 because there's nothing to know about them because they're not people they're just anime profile

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:55.980
 pictures and they don't actually have it tied to anything in the real world so maybe they are

01:15:55.980 --> 01:16:01.180
 already I don't know I think you're I think you're right maybe it skews younger but I says the other

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:07.020
 day have you ever seen them disagree with each other um don't think so they all say the exact

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:11.100
 same things and value the exact same things and like they kind of talk in the same way it's like

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:16.780
 this it's this weird subculture that exists and I don't know if it's an age thing I think it's like

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:22.060
 there's something else that's like finding them together really really annoying it's embarrassing

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:27.980
 like why are you such like a homogenous group of people that all think the exact same way and

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:33.020
 it's funny because they're like one of the things they believe in is they're not they're not that

01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:39.180
 yeah this reminds me of when I visited every time I go to Portland I had the same thought which is

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:44.940
 man everyone here is so alternative but they dress alternative they look alternative but they

01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:49.260
 all look exactly the same like they're the same alternative with each other like it's just uh-huh

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:56.940
 it's like their identity is positive but it's so superficial like yeah it's yeah okay we should

01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:09.500
 get out here yeah this one was long yep all right see ya
