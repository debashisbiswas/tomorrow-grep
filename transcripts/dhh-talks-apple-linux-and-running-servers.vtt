WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
 Hello. Oh, there we go. It's DHH. Are we recording? Oh, we are recording.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.080
 So are you in that amazing office that we see pictures of all the time?

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.800
 This is the office. This is the office. This is the other picture out the back of it.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.600
 How? What's the elevation? Like, you're above the clouds?

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.640
 Question. I think, uh, what did I look it up? 2000 feet or something? It's not that high.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.320
 Yeah. It just looks high because, I mean, I like to take a picture of it when the when the fog rolls

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:05.920
 in and the fog looks like it's fog. I thought it was clouds. I mean, it is clouds, but I think

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.240
 not the kind of clouds most people would call clouds, I suppose, because it is sort of fog.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.920
 But, uh, yeah, no, it looks, it looks great. And we've just had like a streak of it for a whole

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.520
 week. I would walk into the office and it would look like that. And I was like, hot,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.000
 dinky damn, I've lived here for seven years. It doesn't get old. Nature is amazing like that.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.800
 It's funny because I saw some random account post it the other day with like some like meme

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.000
 caption. I'm like, Oh, yeah, no, no, it goes meme almost every time. I mean, part of it is.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.480
 I don't think they know where it came from. I think they're just got random picture.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.840
 No, no, a bunch of people are just like, um, I got a bunch of people saying like, this is AI.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:52.560
 I was like, Adam gets comments about that with his face. Like we get comments on our

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.520
 videos all the time where they're like, that brown guy looks real, but the other guy looks AI.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.400
 Yeah, it's usually when I'm getting really monotone that that we had a whole TikTok where like six

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.200
 people said I was clearly a skinwalker, which I learned what that is. I don't know. I gotta get

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.760
 more more intonation. I'm always like, is that a compliment? Like, it should be

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.440
 because AI people look perfect, you know, so I think you should take as a compliment.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.920
 Yeah, what's going to say? I mean, most AI people I see now all the latest models,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.440
 I mean, they all look great. There's not a lot of ugly people AI models being pumped out.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.840
 Yeah, what's your I've not heard you really talk about the AI stuff, like the just generative AI.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.000
 I mean, part of it is because like, I don't have any special insights there. I'm just a happy

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.120
 consumer. And not only am I a happy consumer, I'm even perhaps like a slightly conservative

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.240
 consumer when it comes to that. I mean, we haven't shoved AI into every crevice of the applications

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:59.520
 we make because I have yet to see a lot of useful examples of that being done in say productivity

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.360
 or an email. Most of the cases like, hey, summarize these boring emails. I find actually

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.160
 vaguely dystopian that we're going to have a bunch of AI's like writing each other because

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.320
 we just can't tell it straight. Like, I'm going to tell the AI to write some bullshit for me.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.440
 Here's the five bullet points. Could you just send me the five bullet points?

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.280
 Like, that's what I'm going to my AI turn it back into anyway. And now we're playing in

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.720
 telephones where AI is probably going to get it wrong about 15% of the time, at least.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.240
 And that just seems a little silly to me. And also, it doesn't seem that useful. So, I mean,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.640
 for me, the thing that blows my mind is, is a, it's ability to be a peer programmer.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.640
 Even though I almost want to chug it in the bin when I sneeze for the 500th time, someone goes like,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.440
 programmers are now already obsolete. I just hired my co-founder, a cursor AI,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.360
 like, jeez, have you tried to use it for anything real? Again, I'm impressed by what it does at the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.800
 same time, utterly annoyed by the hype cycle that comes with it. But maybe this is just how it goes

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.520
 with everything. And then I think it's the gen AI stuff that blows my mind, as you said. Like,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.160
 how is this person not real? Like, the ones that just came out where they had a string of images of

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.360
 women given presentations at, like, TED Talks or something? Yeah, yeah. I zoomed in. I was like,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.320
 what's the tell? I was like, I can't find the tell. I would have to spend, I think it was something

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.440
 like arm flap folds or something like that was supposed to be the tell. Now, like, all the flaps

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.240
 aren't exactly, I was like, wow, it's gotten good when we're down to flaps. We're not even counting

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.240
 fingers anymore. Because the angle of the flap is a little off. So that's why I don't talk about

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.640
 it that much, because I don't feel like I have any unique input to offer beyond perhaps just the

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.520
 temperance that comes with the fact of having seen more than a handful of hype cycles,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.440
 self-driving cars. I think it was a great example of that, right? And we all got, I got quite excited

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.240
 about that in 2017 when Elon was like, at the end of the year, your Model S is going to be

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.520
 a taxi earning you money. It's actually financially irresponsible not to buy a Tesla right now.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.200
 It's going to be printing money, driving other people around. It's like, that didn't quite happen,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.640
 did it? Well, at the same time, then whatever, the FSD 12.5 is actually pretty impressive. It's not

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.080
 fucking a money printer driving around doing the things. And this is now where whatever,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.560
 eight years later, very hard to predict when these things tip. But I think the reason we

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.120
 wanted you to have you on here was you've been talking a lot more about Linux on the desktop,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.640
 which I've been like a lifelong Linux on desktop person. It's been like 12 years, I think so far.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.080
 But yeah, we just want to hear about, it's like, what got you into that? This is a new thing for

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.360
 you. Like, what's the story behind all this? It is a new thing for me to run Linux full-time

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:02.800
 on the desktop in anger as my primary offering system. And it came about also out of some anger.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:11.840
 The final straw, the motivating sort of light to the fire here was Apple. And I've been,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.720
 I was going to say a happy Apple fan. I think that's fair to say, actually, for 20 years,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.400
 about 20 years, a little more than 20 years. Not only was I a happy Apple fan, I was an Apple

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.360
 evangelist. And that came about in part by very much a replay of what's just happened. In the

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.520
 mid to late 90s, I was a very reluctant Windows user. I was actually kind of a pissed off Windows

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.880
 user because I was using Windows because it felt like that was the only option, but I didn't like

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.160
 it. I didn't like anything about what Microsoft stood for in those days. I didn't like the leadership

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.160
 of Microsoft. I didn't like the choke off their air supply, business tactics that they were applying

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.640
 to Netscape and the other competitors they had at the time. I didn't like the overly smug,

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.000
 I want to punch you in the face look of Bill Gates when he was sitting for the deposition at the

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.880
 antitrust cases. I just, I didn't like any of it. And I thought like, I'm begrudgingly using this

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.560
 operating system because I simply feel like there is not a realistic choice. And maybe there

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:23.040
 will be a bunch of Linux people too. Well, Linux was already great in 95. Yeah, it wasn't for me.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.680
 I had friends using Linux back then. And what I saw didn't win me over. Let's just put it like

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:39.360
 that. And then 2001, I believe it is, rolled around. Apple rolls out the new Mac OS, OS 10.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:46.320
 I think it was what was it? Puma 10.1 or two or three. I forget what whichever version was out in

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:52.640
 2001 was the one I hopped on. And I hopped on to that because for the first time it felt like there

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.920
 was a credible alternative to Windows that I could use as the web developer and as a general

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.040
 computer user without being like this super nerd that was going to figure out Linux on the desktop.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.920
 And I thought, you know what, isn't this the best of both worlds? I get to use like a BSD-based

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.400
 operating system. That's kind of like, it makes it's the same ethos. Underneath the technical

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.000
 underpinnings, this is why I don't have to install an antivirus system within the first five seconds

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.360
 of putting the computer short of it getting taken over by some botnet. So there were all these

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.400
 advantages to it. There were all these advantages when working on open source software. I was already

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:37.440
 working with Apache and MySQL and picking up Ruby a few years later at PHP. All that stuff was just

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:45.520
 better on a Unix-based setup. Now, there were about a million trade-offs nonetheless. That original

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:55.840
 version of Mac OS I ran ran on an 800 megahertz power PC with 256 megabytes of RAM and it sucked

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:02.720
 in terms of performance. It was so much slower than what Intel and Windows were able to put out

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:08.480
 and I still didn't care. I was like, I'm just happy to have some alternative here that gets me out

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:17.120
 of Gatesland and I pushed on that for the next 20 years and didn't really realize that I was

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:24.400
 getting slowly boiled. Apple went from being the ultimate underdog in 2001 who saw an interest for

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:32.000
 them to be a good partner to developers, to be emphasizing and assisting and doing all these things

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.960
 for people who wanted to build software, especially for the web. And then slowly, but sure, well,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:43.280
 actually not that slowly. Suddenly, they had a much bigger platform on their hands after the

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:51.680
 iPhone got released and that platform introduced the concept of the App Store. And that to me,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.960
 if I was going to pinpoint a moment when we look back upon this history, everything started to go

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:03.600
 to shit was when the App Store and native apps started taking off. Now, that's a perhaps a weird

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.880
 thing to say because in many other ways, this idea of having mobile supercomputers in our pocket

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:15.600
 that can run this incredible software, video games, I mean, I used to be a big gamer, they go run

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:23.200
 video games at 120 FPS with graphics that would shame even the wildest, craziest, dedicated PCs

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:31.200
 of the 2000s. That's amazing, right? And that's true, but it really put the squeeze on developers,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:38.720
 freedom, and independence. And kind of that kept building to a crescendo first when we

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:48.240
 launched hate.com, our email service back in 2000 and 2020. When we put that out there and got that

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:54.160
 dreaded, no, I'm just remembering this, I had forgotten all about the hay and apple stuff.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:02.720
 Yeah, I haven't. I'll tell you that because we had literally spent two years almost at that point

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:09.280
 developing the system, millions of dollars poured into it. I had slaved away for many hours developing

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:15.440
 the system. We were incredibly proud that we were going to take on Gmail with a fresh new system

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.200
 based on thinking from 2020, not 2004. And we thought that was going to be the big boss, right?

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:27.040
 We're going to take on Google with an actually quite good email system, Gmail is a good system.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:32.800
 It's dated, it has issues, whatever, but it's a good system and it's free. And we're going to

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.640
 come in and say, you know what, you should pay for email. What? So already that had long odds,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.240
 but we didn't even get to begin that fight before a bigger boss showed up and just like Apple sat

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:50.400
 down on our chest and said, give you, you're going to give me your lunch money and 30% of

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:57.360
 everything your own in perpetuity going forward. And we're like, what? No, no. So that led to a big

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:06.000
 fight over multiple weeks where the future, the life of that new service hung in the balance.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.760
 Because the reason Apple has all this power is that they have all the economic activity,

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:18.480
 at least in the US. What we eventually found was for our email system, hey.com, 85% of those of the

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.320
 paying users we have, they use Apple products. So if you were shut out of Apple's Garden of Eden,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.640
 it was going to be dead. There wasn't going to be a business. There was going to be 15% left,

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.400
 and you just can't build a competitive business in there. So that's where the whole antitrust

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:39.520
 thing comes in. But it was also for me just a wake up call. Okay, the pod has been boiling for

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.640
 several years. I had already been, I had already, well before we even introduced, hey.com, I testified

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.120
 in front of a congressional field hearing in Colorado where they were looking into all these

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.080
 antitrust matters. And going like, hey, here's my perspective on this. Things are not going in

00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:00.000
 good direction. Developers are getting squeezed in all sorts of different directions. The guidelines

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.120
 of an app store is dictating the kind of businesses that can exist in the world because of this

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.160
 economic activity issue. That's not a good place to be. In fact, we should look at the internet

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:16.720
 as a far better alternative model for both application distribution, but for business formation,

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:23.360
 for independence, for freedom, all these things. And then I got my own kind of fight with Apple.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:30.480
 And you don't want, even that wasn't enough. I fucking still bought, I was going to say. And

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:38.160
 like three or four more MacBooks. So I mean, I think that goes to tell you A, how sticky platform

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:43.920
 choice really is. And B, that Apple does make good stuff. Oh, their hardware is so incredible.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.640
 Their hardware is really good. I have found since that, even though that point is true,

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.280
 I was a little myopic. There are actually other people making really good interesting

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:59.360
 hardware. They don't make the same if you want this sort of millimeter unibody aluminum case

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.920
 stuff that Apple does so well. Apple does that better than anyone else. But there are different

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.840
 things you can choose to focus on where you can actually end up with something better.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.200
 Repairability and expandability. And there are other parts of the hardware experience

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.440
 that can be better. What are the laptops? I'm blanking on the name. I've seen you talk about

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.880
 these. They've got like modular. Are you using a framework currently?

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:27.280
 I am. Framework is my laptop. It has been my laptop. That was actually, I mean, I know it's a

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.280
 little long winded here, but this is how we get to the story of how I ended up on Linux,

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:38.320
 because it was frameworks fault. And I use that currently. I also have a desktop PC. I mean,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:45.280
 the other thing I realized was Apple does their stuff really well. And they also charge proportionally,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.800
 maybe they would say, but I mean, I had a specked out MacBook Pro. The last one I bought was an

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:59.120
 M3 Max something. I think it was $3,500 or $3,700. Whatever it was, it was more than the cost of my

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:04.720
 Dell precision with the latest fastest Intel chip, which either way is quicker than that

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:12.240
 fucking M3 Max chip kind of work that I do, which is web work and running Ruby and whatever. It's

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.600
 actually quicker than that. And then I also could buy a framework machine and add that on top.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.560
 Now, I fully understand there are a lot of people who like, I don't want to computers. I just want

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:27.280
 to laptop and I want to run everything on it. So there's still advantages there, but it was eye

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.600
 opening to see what was actually going on, because I really have for quite a long time just thought,

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:37.520
 like, do you know what? I'm not in the market for anything not Apple, because I'm in the Apple world,

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:42.800
 I'm running Mago as I'm deep in the ecosystem. That's the other way they get you, right? Like the

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.960
 little bangs, little hooks. I was running the photo setup they have. I was going to call it

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.080
 iPhone. I don't think it's called that anymore. Things are just called Apple photos and the

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.720
 sinking and the all the things and all the historical data you have, it's like impossible to all the

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:02.320
 data was embedded with it. Before we introduced a calendar, I had my calendar and Apple calendar.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:08.400
 Before we introduced a email, I was using Apple's own email client. So there was just a lot of

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.440
 hooks in it, but one by one, those hooks were already coming out. I mean, hey email and hey

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.120
 calendar took out two or perhaps the biggest one I had been used to that's sinking of things back

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:25.440
 and forth. Now we had hey clients on both email and or on mobile and desktop. There was still some

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:34.560
 and I had to sort of pry him out like thongs, right? It took a little while and for a while,

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.480
 that's the amazing thing when I look back upon this. This just happened by the way, right? I just

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.600
 switched to Linux full time in what February or March and it already feels like it's been five

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:50.400
 years, but I still do remember those dark spring days trying to get out of the ecosystem and thinking,

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.800
 I don't even know if I can do it. I didn't even know if I want to do it. Oh, it just seems so

00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:02.880
 impossible. There's so many things blah, blah, blah. And then I spent, well, first I got hooked

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.240
 and the way I got hooked was I was like, all right, I don't want to use Apple stuff anymore.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:15.920
 The final straw was when Apple in their sort of malicious compliance way said we're going to pull

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:23.520
 PWAs, the standard for making web applications out of Europe and we're going to rip it out of

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.760
 Safari because that's the way we choose to interpret what the European Union is doing with their

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:33.440
 interest drive. And I thought, I just built another app that sort of depended on PWAs.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:40.560
 We had built a app called Campfire under this one.com umbrella where we will sell you a web chat

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:46.480
 system, kind of like a slack in a box for a single fee. And part of that setup was we were not going

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.400
 to make native apps. We were going to lean on the web and we were going to lean on PWAs and we

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.840
 were going to lean on all this stuff. And then Apple like literally two weeks later went like,

00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:00.880
 we're going to take the PWAs support that we barely just introduced out of the whole thing

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.320
 and we're going to screw over the entire ecosystem. And I just went like, I can't buy another iPhone

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:14.800
 after this. I can't buy another MacBook because if I in this position of almost infinite privilege

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:20.240
 in terms of resources and whatever, if I can't even make it to switch, then I should just roll

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.440
 over and accept that Apple owns all. And I don't want to do that. Then, all right, let me just

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:32.400
 go back to my native Danish roots and grow potatoes for some things and bacon or whatever else.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.640
 I don't even freaking know. I just don't want to do computers anymore. That's really actually

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:42.160
 the point it got to. That was the final motivating point, which is insane that that is the level

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.080
 of pressure it needs to bring that like, I don't know if I want to do computers anymore.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:53.840
 As a profession, as a business, because I felt like the reason I got so, or have been so excited

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.560
 about computers and loved working with computers was the internet. And why was it the internet?

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:03.760
 Because it was a free platform of distribution. I didn't have it to ask anyone for permission

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:10.000
 to launch Basecamp back in 2004. We bought a domain name. We pointed that at an IP address,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.040
 running a server and voila, we're business and anyone who shows up to Basecamp.com

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.760
 can buy our project management system. And if no one shows up, that's no one's fault by my own,

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:26.880
 right? Like, my faith is in my own hands. That's not true with native applications anymore.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:33.520
 Your fate of your entire business is in the hands of Apple bureaucrats, who every single time you

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:40.000
 submit an update, go, "Me, I don't like it. I just call it blue. It's a little too blue,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.440
 which, yeah, good. And then you submit again. Yeah, yeah. Sorry. I brought you the right color

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:53.520
 blue. I still don't like it. Just sign up screen. Like the font is too small. And you're just like,

00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:01.360
 it's like begging some petty, inconsistent tyrant for the right to grow wheat. And I'm like,

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:08.800
 are we fucking back in 1506? What the hell is going on here? I don't want to be that kind of

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:15.680
 peasant. I want to own my own land stat here, right? And do you know not allowed that? And I just saw,

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:22.800
 like, how are we going backwards? How do we go from this glorious age where developers and software

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:29.200
 businesses go have direct access to their customers? And we got to enjoy that for what seven fucking

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.800
 years from the dot com bust until the iPhone was introduced. And then another dark ages was

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.960
 introduced where we basically went back to, oh, no, you can't just distribute software. What are you

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.440
 talking about? You need a publisher and that publisher needs to make a deal with a distributor

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.640
 who needs to have a deal with blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it's like, again, no, I don't want

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.440
 to do that. So anyway, very long story to now I have all this pressure going on me. It's either

00:20:53.440 --> 00:21:00.000
 not using computers anymore and fucking retiring with the potatoes and the pigs, or it's finding

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.280
 another platform. And the first step I went was like, oh, let me see what my old art

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.920
 enemy was up to these days. So I went back to Microsoft with an open eyes and I thought, you know

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:17.040
 what? People change. I mean, it's been 20 years, 25 years actually at that point. Well, 23 years,

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:23.120
 let's call it that since I last ran Windows sort of proper. And there's a new Boston town.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:28.160
 And I hear good things about like what he's doing. And I like the investments they've done into

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.280
 a VS code. I like their stewardship of GitHub. I like a lot of things. Like maybe this Microsoft

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.480
 is not the same thing anymore. And I showed up and I ran Windows for a couple of weeks and even

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:45.440
 said, you know what? This is it. I'm switching to Windows. And then, and then I was running

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:52.080
 Windows on this framework laptop. And I was like, I guess I could make this work, but it was kind

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:58.320
 of begrudgingly, right? Like I was like, ah, shit, I still don't really love Windows. I found a new

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.880
 respect for it. I'd say first, I used to think, you know what, there's no way I can enjoy doing

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.720
 what I do on a Windows machine. And I was in the day, days prior to WSL. Yeah, before the Windows

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:16.320
 subsystem for Linux, when the Windows subsystem for Linux, especially WSL 2 is really effing good.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:21.680
 Like the amount of steps it takes from you to have, I have a Windows machine to I'm running Ubuntu

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.400
 inside of it. And it actually mostly kind of works. There's a little bit of the

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.120
 file system barrier. You have to finagle around. But it's actually quite good. That was really a

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.480
 revelation. And I thought, oh, this is why I can make it last. But then I installed Linux on this

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:42.560
 framework laptop. And the first thing I noticed was, holy shit, it runs faster. Like I just ran my

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:49.680
 Chrome's bitometer 2.1 test and I'm like, Jesus, why is it 15% quicker? Why am I getting 15% more

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:57.520
 juice out of this CPU that's inside of it? Huh. And then I thought, like, that really is nagging

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.680
 at me. And I thought, you know what, maybe I'll give Linux a try. First, I ran into a bunch of

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:09.360
 issues. Like the original framework 13 screen was of a dimension set where if you ran it at 100%,

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.040
 the font was too small and it didn't look right. And if you ran it at 200%, everything was a

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.880
 little big. And I was like, that's not quite right either. And I just went through all of these

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.880
 steps of finding, Oh, I like something about Linux. Oh, I don't like that thing about Linux.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:30.240
 And I spent maybe five weeks just going like, all right, do you know what, I'm going to,

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.440
 I'm going to learn this. I'm going to figure it out. I'm going to get a desktop. I'm going to

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.680
 get a framework. I'm going to set it all up. And I spent like two of those weeks battling with

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:43.920
 Nvidia drivers trying to get them to work with my Apple six K XDR display, which by the way,

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:50.320
 spoiler alert, it never will. It won't. I went through about 400 layers and wild goose cases,

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.840
 trying to decompile things and kernel flags and whatever. Don't do that. Don't put yourself

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:01.680
 through that. Just buy an AMD graphics card. If you're not doing literally top tier gaming that

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:08.800
 requires a 490, then the AMD stuff is awesome. It works out of the box with a six K XDR display.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:13.040
 I could have saved myself two weeks, but I still like the journey. And I like the journey because

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.640
 Linux was a challenge. And I think Linux still is a bit of a challenge. I mean,

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.320
 it's funny. I just posted something yesterday about this where I said like, hey, do you know what,

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.440
 I think more developers should run Linux because it's a challenge. You learn a lot about how it

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:33.520
 works. It's not as straightforward and paved as Windows is or Mac OS is. And then I get the

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:39.200
 normal stance Linux does. What are you talking about? Ubuntu is just as easy as Mac OS. You're

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:47.360
 like, I mean, come on, let's get real. It just isn't. It just isn't. I'm glad you got your grandma

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.680
 set up with Ubuntu and she's running Firefox and she doesn't need anything else. That is awesome.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:58.240
 And I'm not disputing that. But for a lot of normal software, like if I was going to convince

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:04.080
 my wife to run Linux, yeah, I was not going to do that. She just uses too many apps and they're

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:10.480
 too specific. And I'm like, I'm not like, Hey, babe, do you want an adventure in setting up like

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:17.760
 your webcam? She's like, no, I don't want that adventure. What are you talking about versus if

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.240
 you are a developer, I think they're actually legitimate benefits. And maybe some of it is just

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.840
 you kind of just acclimate to your environment. But I thought in just those six months that I've

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:34.560
 been using Linux full time, I've gotten far more comfortable with Linux in ways that are

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.400
 pushing me on like, what are we doing on the server? And this is what I see as one of those

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.760
 main benefits. Anyone who works in web development today, they may work on a Mac, but they deploy

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:49.520
 on Linux. No one is fucking deploying on a Mac box. They're not deploying on a Windows box either.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:54.160
 I know there are some people actually literally doing that, but like 95% of the internet runs on

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:59.920
 Linux. And if you are a developer working with the web, I think you owe it to yourself to understand

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:06.400
 what's going on. And I don't think that the cloud is able to pave over that experience to a degree

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:12.480
 that is helpful for you. And I also think it locks you into a bunch of overpriced premium

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:18.400
 AWS wrapper services that you'd be better off without. That's a mission I'm pursuing. But

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.680
 regardless, Linux is a little bit more of an adventure, but holy shit, what an awesome adventure

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:29.440
 it is. And what an incredible oasis you're able to arrive at. That was what actually blew my mind.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:35.120
 I didn't know legitimately if you spent the time to set it up, Linux could be not just good,

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:40.720
 but here I'm really going to go out and limp better. And again, I am biased at this point.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:47.520
 I accept it. But I like the Linux setup I have today better. I'm not like making do with scraps

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:54.720
 here. I like it better than what I had on Mac OS. That's pretty freaking incredible. I'm not saying

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.840
 against it's better for everyone. I'm not going to force my wife to convert to Linux tomorrow

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:06.160
 for the reasons we talked about for me as a developer, Linux is better. And that was quite

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:12.240
 the revelation. I mean, I literally legitimately did not know. I still had an idea of Linux that

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:18.160
 was based in what 2009 or something. That wasn't that wasn't accurate. My mental model was out of

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:26.080
 date. And I got a I got a nudge. Thank you to explore modern day Linux looks like. And not only

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.320
 was it better in terms of economics, not only was it better in terms of sort of the infrastructure

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:36.800
 plumbing, not only need to talk around about 400 million times better. But it could also look

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:46.080
 amazing. I mean, discover Linux porn was actually kind of cool. I don't run a Linux

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:52.480
 porn setup, but I took a lot of inspiration from that. When I finally compressed all of this

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:59.520
 journey, exploring all the Linux tools and whatever into sort of my take on what a great

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.200
 out of the box Linux experience should look like for developers, which is what ended up

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:09.840
 becoming Amakub. Amakub, which is what I want today, which is Ubuntu 2404 underneath. And then

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:16.640
 a layer on top that is aesthetic personalization or not even personalized customization. And a

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:23.360
 bunch of things installed just out of the box, make the Linux experience feel like it's incredible

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:31.840
 without having to sign up for 140 hours of YouTube, Linux, nerdery videos and tutorials and like,

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.680
 oh, you have to compile this thing with 400 different flags, then it works with the other

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:41.200
 thing. Someone just do that. And like, I ended up doing it. And sorry, like, let's share. And

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.400
 that's where I am today. I am running Linux full time. I freaking love it. I'm doing it on a

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:53.920
 framework laptop on a Dell precision desktop. And I even got into freaking mechanical keyboards

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:59.680
 because of it. And then I put all of it into to Amakub and released it. And now I'm on the

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:08.640
 evangelical trail trying to at least give other Mac users an invitation that there is life

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.440
 outside of Apple's garden. And it's quite pleasant in a lot of ways. It's not the same.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.400
 And this was one of the actually hurdles I had to get over. When I first switched to Linux,

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:24.320
 I was like, okay, the text that I have on my Mac is called textmate. It has a certain theme.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.200
 It looks a certain way I run all Hallows Eve and like all the keywords are exactly like this.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:34.480
 And it's been drilled into my brain that this is what code looks like. This is what code feels

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:40.800
 like. So the first thing I tried to do is replicate textmate in VS code on Linux. And you can get

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:48.240
 about like 96% there. And I was ready to blow my brains out over the last 4% because it was total

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:53.600
 uncanny valley. It was just like, yeah, everything is the same old. It's not. And then we just get

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.920
 frustrated and they're just like, I should just go back to the Mac. Why am I let it? Why am I making

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:04.400
 do with something that's only 96% as good? I could just swallow my pride and come crawling back to

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:10.320
 Saint Cook. But I was not going to do that. I was going to stick with it. And I realized

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.160
 the way to stick with it was to make it king cut do something else. So the first thing was like,

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.600
 all right, I'm not going to, I'm not going to run text, man, I'm not going to try to replicate

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.280
 text. Man, I'm going to give VS code a fair shake and I'm going to run it with a different theme.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.880
 And this was how I discovered Tokyo Knights, which. Yeah, that's what I used to.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.200
 We're just a team of all time. And then I set that up and I worked with it for a bit. I was like,

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.320
 actually, VS code is not bad. Not text made. I miss a few things, but now it looks different

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:39.520
 enough. It feels different enough. That is something else. But the final kicker that really got me,

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:44.000
 like this is actually better. I was like, VS code, I was like, this is tolerable. I can see why people

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.640
 like it. It's not text made. I miss a few things. But then I went to Neovin. There we go.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:57.200
 There we go. Right now, by the way, I think. And with Neovin, particularly through the

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.600
 distribution of the lazy Vim setup, where everything comes pre-configured for you,

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:12.960
 I went like, Oh, what? This is. Yeah. Nice. I remember some of the Vim shortcuts from literally

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:19.200
 20 years ago, I think back in 2000, I was doing three PSD servers set up for some stuff. And I had

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.640
 to learn to win motions to do that on the server. And I still fucking remember how to set the program.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.880
 And I also remember a couple of other things. And Neovin was basically like,

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:34.480
 reactivating that ancient knowledge from the back of my brain. It's like the motions never

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.560
 leave. They just take off space and maybe get to move to the attic at the back of your head,

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.640
 but they're still there. And you can pull them out of the attic. And you go like, Oh, yeah,

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:47.520
 actually, I can see why this editor that is literally 50 years old still has purchase on people.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:55.760
 And it was through that that led me to discover all these amazing Tuis. I mean, Tuis was even a

00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:00.720
 word that that's actually the nickname we use for for one of my boys, like a Tuis bird. I was like,

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:06.560
 Oh, Tuis also terminal username face. And I discovered Neovin, then I discovered Lacy Git.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:13.360
 And I was like, Holy fuck, what even is this? It feels like I'm in a movie. Like the only in

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:21.200
 mainframe or something. And there's just something incredibly appealing about that neo vintage,

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:26.800
 neo nostalgia kind of look that isn't just about aesthetics, although it is also about that. And

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:33.280
 this is, let me just make it quick aside here. There's a huge contingency of Linux super neck

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:41.920
 beards or decks. What's no with aesthetics, right? Like it's, is that so they take pride in making

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:48.800
 things as ugly as humanly possible with the worst color coordination you can imagine and about five

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:54.080
 pencils in their pocket protector. Those people exist because that is why we have the links that

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:59.600
 we have, right? Like that's the sort of the cement that we can then build upon. And that's great.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.800
 I really care about aesthetics though. I want a beautiful workstation. I want a beautiful work

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:11.600
 environment. And Neovin together with all these Tuis like Lacy Git and whatever offered me a

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:18.800
 more compelling aesthetic than the one I had on the Mac while also leveling me up in terms of

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.760
 capabilities that to me is sort of that match made in heaven where it both looks incredible

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.400
 and it feels incredible. And you're able to be productive with it. And now that I've been using

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:35.680
 Neovin for quite a while now, I mean, you feel like a god. It's amazing. I sometimes do a set

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:43.760
 of motions where I'm like making or selecting text inside of like a quote with like two commands.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.760
 And then I do whatever the thing where it's just like, I just got to stop. I'm just like,

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:54.560
 did I just fucking do that? I just fucking do that. Or you're just like, this is incredible. Like,

00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:00.640
 I just benched a new record. Yeah, it like created a midi game to text editing. It's amazing. I've

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:07.440
 loved it lately. And it's the best kind of game. It's one where like the payoff is actually literal

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:12.640
 productivity that you can deposit towards goals that you have in life, like building businesses

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:19.760
 and so forth, right? It's not just sort of wankery for its own sake. So anyway, all that led to

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:27.440
 first being a reluctant Linux user, almost like a Mac OS refugee. I just need to find a tent

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:32.880
 somewhere where the wind is not too harsh and whatever. I'll make do on this rock until realizing

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:37.280
 you know what? You could just walk five feet further. There's a fucking oasis down here. And

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:43.840
 there's got them coconuts and pineapple and just everything is flowing. How did I not know this?

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:49.120
 This is actually the reaction I had. I knew about Neovin. I had never heard of Lacey Git.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:56.240
 And I was like, how the fuck did I go 20 goddamn years? Not knowing that like this entire universe

00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.960
 existed just around the corner, just around the corner. Yeah, I could even have been running it

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:05.920
 on Mac OS. I mean, a lot of these two tools, they run just fine on the Mac too. I just even didn't

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:12.640
 know. Yeah. So that's where I just got more and more grateful for the entire expedition,

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:17.760
 because it was taking me to foreign lands and foreign experiences. And I liked a lot of it.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:23.360
 And now I've ended up in a place where I love my computer more than I have loved the computer

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.160
 in at least 15 years. The last time, and this is both on the software and hardware side,

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.480
 on the hardware side, the last computer I really loved, I mean, I don't know why.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:40.240
 So this is why does love work the way it does? It was the MacBook Air 11 inch that ran the

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:44.880
 shittiest Intel chip I think you could buy at the time. So it was woefully underpowered,

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.440
 but it just, it felt right. Like the size of it was right, the screen of it was right.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.960
 I love that computer for many years and I carried it for many years and was my primary

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.520
 development tool for many years. Then the MacBook Air came in and first we went through the

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:04.960
 awful five years in the desert with the butterfly keyboard, where at our company,

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:12.160
 30% of all laptops we bought ended up broken. That's an incredible failure rate. Within two years,

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:18.320
 we did the math. Over 30% of them had to go back for repairs, some of them multiple times,

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:23.360
 you never really got to work proper and Apple was just like, you're typing it wrong. I was like,

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.840
 I don't think that's the problem when 30% of us are ending up with that. So you went through that,

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.800
 right? And then we got to actually did the best place Apple has ever been in. They went back on

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:38.000
 that, they went back on ports, they introduced legitimate steps forward with the M chips and

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.800
 efficiency. And you ended up with a product that was really good and also really boring and boring

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:50.480
 in the ways that something that is too perfect can be. I think this is one of the reasons why

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:57.760
 there's such a surge or interest in imperfection. Why do people like a manual stick sports car?

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:04.240
 Why did they like vinyl records? Why do we like mechanical watches? Why do we like these things that

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:10.000
 are objectively worse than their counterparts? Oh, you can get a automatic transmission. It'll

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.520
 shift smoother than you. You'll get better gas mileage. You can get a quartz watch for $20

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:22.080
 that'll beat the accuracy of any role likes you can buy. Yeah, but also no. And that's what I found

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.000
 when I found with that framework 13 laptop, I was like, do you know what? This has quirks,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.240
 weird, interesting quirks. It's not perfect. But the things it's good at, it's really good at.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:37.920
 First, a reminder that keyboards really fucking matter. Holy shit. Again, I'd only been in

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:44.000
 Mac land and I was like, actually, this Mac magic keyboard is fine. It's great. I don't know if I'd

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.160
 say that. It's fine. Why do I need anything else? And then you try a framework laptop. It has 1.5

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.960
 millimeters of travel, which is basically like what the old power books I think used to have the

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:02.080
 Apple laptops of the mid 2000s. And like, holy shit, this feels so much better. What? I didn't

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:07.680
 know that that Matt, why does half a millimeter or 0.7 millimeters of travel matter? Oh, oh, yeah,

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:13.840
 oh, yeah, it really does. Matt displays. I was like, Oh shit, I remember the power book that had

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:20.080
 the math display. Matt displays are really nice for programmers. It just fits text rendering much

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:24.880
 better. Maybe it's not as good to watch a blockbuster movie on, but it's great for text entering three

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:32.080
 by two aspect ratio. Holy shit. What have I been doing in just 16 10 69 land? That is a weird

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:38.480
 elongated optimized for just consumption kind of display. That's not what I use my laptop for. I

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:46.080
 use it for to make stuff. And when I make code 3.2 or 3 by 2 aspect ratio is much nicer. So there

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:53.120
 were all these advantages on top of the upgradability framework came out with a new freaking screen,

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:58.960
 like whatever month ago. Yeah, the 16 inch, right? You could buy the screen by itself and replace

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:02.960
 it on your freaking laptop. I was like, what's crazy? You mean, I don't have to buy a whole new

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:09.120
 computer just because I want the newer display as an Apple user. That's just insane. That sounds

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:13.360
 impossible. I mean, I have literally, and I'm not proud of this. I'm actually ashamed. I have four

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:18.400
 MacBooks sitting in my closet. And the reason why I have more four of them was I wanted the fastest

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.400
 chip. Every time you wanted a newer chip, you had to buy a whole new goddamn computer. Yeah,

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:26.320
 I wanted whatever. There were some upgrade to the screen that came out at one point by a

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:32.560
 damn new computer. It's like, this doesn't feel quite as if you have bad when you see all that

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:37.760
 stuff piling up in your in your closet. Yes. And then now I have my my framework. I've upgraded

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:42.720
 the RAM. I think it came I think I bought it with like 32 gigabytes. It was like 200 and some

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:50.320
 dollars to buy 96 gigabytes of RAM off Amazon. And I could just plop it in. I bought obviously

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:56.720
 the new display for it. I upgraded the battery capacity in one of them too. It came with a 51

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:02.640
 one hour battery and they had a newer 61 that gave you another 10% battery. Like, holy shit,

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:08.160
 I'm still keep I still have the original one that I knew to that's really cool. So I fell in love

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:14.160
 with that framework laptop. And to me, then the pair of the two framework, Plaza. I'm a coop.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:22.160
 That is the Linux version that I had tingled and optimized really felt like this is this is

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:28.960
 incredible. So that's where I am right now. I mean, really happy with the Linux setup and just,

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.920
 I don't know if I'm angry or disappointed. I'm just a little like, I kind of wish I knew this like

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:39.040
 four years ago. Like, I should have done this in 2020 when Apple was just like, we're going to

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.600
 break your kneecaps here. That should pay us 30%. That should have been the signal worth like,

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:51.120
 Oh, shit. Why am I still here? Just like it was when the original I book came out in 2001,

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:55.840
 I was like, why am I still on Windows? If there is an alternative and it's good enough, I should

00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:06.080
 switch. So yeah, that was that was that was. Yeah, that transitions painful. But like you said,

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.520
 it's you can get to a better place on the other side. And I think there's a lot of technical

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.920
 details. But I think what it comes down to me is, you know, I sit at my desk and there's things

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.640
 sitting here and my whole life is coming through it. Like, it's what helps me provide for my family.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:24.720
 It connects me to the whole world, everything. And knowing how that thing works, like deep,

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:28.560
 having deep customization of it and like feeling that harmony with it, like it's just good for

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.560
 your soul, like beyond any of the technical details. And kind of when you get there,

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:36.240
 it's hard to explain to other people, but you really feel a lot more connected with this

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.040
 really important thing that's, you know, sitting on your desk every day.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.120
 It's funny, I'm reading, I don't know if I started at right at the same time. I don't even know if

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:48.320
 I was an accident or just a serendipitous. I mean, reading the book, The Sen and the Art of

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:53.760
 Motorcycle Maintenance. I knew that's what you're going to say. It's so many parallels to that

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:58.800
 point. It's exactly to the point of, do you just want to be a consumer? I mean, this is a story

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:03.680
 about writing motorcycles in the 70s. And they needed a fair amount of tender love and care to

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.800
 keep them running. And you needed to know about timing chains and how to oil things and tighten

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:14.880
 things and whatever. And in the book, he makes a very compelling argument for exactly what you say,

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:23.040
 that there is just a satisfaction in the soul of knowing how the things you interact with on a daily

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:31.520
 basis even depend on work at least at a basic level. And I find that Linux just forces you down

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:37.520
 that path because there is a few more timing belts you have to tighten yourself. And it is good to

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:43.600
 know where they are and what the commands are and so forth. But what you come out on the other side

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:53.760
 as is a more knowledgeable, experienced, comfortable and confident technologist. And I think that is

00:42:53.760 --> 00:43:01.200
 in great lack right now. And where I see it, hugely is in this discussion about the cloud.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:09.360
 So cloud technology and services and platforms as a service have convinced an entire generation

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:15.280
 of developers that connecting your own service to the internet is way too fucking scary.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:22.800
 It's like running that motorcycle backwards blindfolded on one hand. Like that's just fucking crazy.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:28.560
 That's for evil, can evil shit to connect your own computer to the internet. I was like, wait,

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:34.800
 what? How did that become to be the case? Why are we so afraid of connecting computers to the

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.720
 internet? And I think a lot of it is based on, first of all, outdated mental models. I mean,

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:45.600
 anyone who's been around technology, as I said, there was a time where if you bought a new Windows

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.840
 machine and you connected to the internet and you hadn't already set up the antivirus stuff,

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.920
 you could give it five minutes and it would be infected. That's kind of a man time ago.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:44:01.360
 And Linux was never like that. And I think those mental models haven't fully updated. And then

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:07.040
 the cloud providers have literally put in billions and billions of dollars to scare the living

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:12.240
 but Jesus out of anyone from connecting computer to the internet. Because if someone realizes

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:20.640
 that they can do that, they will realize that a lot of the cloud machinery is insanely overpriced,

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:25.680
 that it's an economic model of renting versus owning that they actually don't appreciate,

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:31.200
 that it's a surrender of independence and whatever else that isn't very flattering.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:41.040
 And Linux, I think, is the antidote to some extent. If you run Linux on the desktop yourself,

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:47.840
 you will be familiar enough with the basics of, oh, UFW as a firewall, for example,

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:51.760
 is actually super easy to use. It has one of the best user interfaces for any firewall I've

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:56.880
 ever seen. It's super quick just to say like, hey, lock the shit down so I can only access

00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:03.840
 is on 22. Oh, this is a web server, open up 80 and 443. That's it. Done. Oh, yeah. Okay,

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:10.080
 turn off password authentication, only SSH keys. And now you have fucking four knocks.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.880
 Good luck getting into that. If you could get into a box that is set up like that,

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:20.960
 it has UFW running, it locks down to just those three ports and you switch from password authentication

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:26.160
 to SSH key authentication. If you get into one of those, if you can get into a box like that,

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:31.360
 I mean, you just want the fucking lottery. You have a zero day. I mean, you can sell that

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:38.720
 to North Korea or China or make them bid on it and boom, five million cases. So that's the sort of

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.320
 basics, right? Like, it's actually not that difficult to secure a box. It's not that

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:48.320
 complicated to run sudo apt upgrade. If you need to update something, you don't need to do it that

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:54.960
 often. And also, by the way, didn't you just set up a fucking JavaScript interpolation deployment

00:45:54.960 --> 00:46:03.680
 compile pipelines that involved 700 megabytes of note modules across 5000 dependencies? And you

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:09.120
 were able to figure that shit out. You're telling me you can't add one line of configuration to

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:17.680
 the sss SSD demon, and you can't run uf w allow 22. Oh, no, that's too hard, man. Shit,

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:27.360
 just way beyond my capacity. What man the fuck up? Oh, the fuck up. That's pathetic. That is

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:35.120
 pathetic. And we can beat that shit out of you. We can do some server phobia reverse cognitive

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:39.760
 behavior with you. You're gonna, okay, listen, listen, I know you're afraid of the server. It's

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:44.240
 not gonna bite you. It is not gonna bite you hackers are not gonna get in there. But first,

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:50.320
 let's expose you to Linux. See, here's a computer. It runs the Linux. You can touch it. It's okay.

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:56.880
 Just put one hand on the spacebar and push it. Push it one time. See, nothing bad happened.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:02.000
 And I think that level of cognitive behavioral therapy, that's part of the reason why I'm excited

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.920
 about things like on the coupe. Can we introduce that level to this generation of developers such

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:13.520
 that they will realize that running computers on the internet is not some exotic dangerous

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:19.280
 thing that's only for Linux wizards and neckbeards who've been doing it for 40 fucking years.

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:25.680
 It's for you to never be easier. It's never been cheaper. And the stand you're able to take for

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:31.600
 independence and pricing and all the other advantages that you get out of that is totally

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:37.760
 worth it. Totally freaking worth it. It's nowhere near as complicated as figuring out how to make

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:47.040
 a 1972 Yamaha motorcycle work or the timing belts. So we need to disabuse people of this nonsense,

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:55.040
 which includes sort of addressing head on the fact that the AWS reseller model is incredibly

00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:00.240
 profitable. This is why all the VCs want to do it. There was just an announcement I think

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:06.000
 yesterday about another web framework who also wants to be an AWS reseller. And I totally get it.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.480
 I totally get why VCs look at that. Wait, so you're telling me I don't even have to own computers.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.120
 I can just rent those computers and then rent them again to someone else. Oh, that sounds like a

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:21.200
 I have no inventory. I have no staff. I have no nothing. I just mainly have to convince

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.520
 developers that they're stupid and fragile so that they need my shit. And then I can just

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:31.280
 run the money printer. Yeah, no, that's not the model of the internet that I'm interested in.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:36.000
 And again, I'm putting things to a point. I appreciate the advantages in developer economics.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:43.200
 Her Roku, for example, really did amazing pioneering work in the AWS reseller space. And they taught

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:48.080
 the rest of us. Do you know what? Deploying to a server could be a whole lot easier and we

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:54.240
 should make it easier. But to me, that is essentially shining a light on a part of the infrastructure

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:59.440
 level of how we work with the internet that open source should then address. And it's not like,

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:04.160
 Oh, you got to come up with Photoshop, right? That's the whole Photoshop versus gimp debate that.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:08.560
 Yeah, do you know what? Even as a now converted Linux fan, I can look at that and go like,

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:13.360
 Yeah, gimp is not as good. I'm not saying gimp is bad. I'm just saying end user software like

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:18.080
 Photoshop is difficult to make on this model. What's not difficult to make on this model

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.400
 is got them infrastructure. All the best infrastructure in the world is open source

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:29.200
 from Linux to MySQL to in genex to whatever all the entire stack, even the entire stack that's

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:33.040
 being used in the cloud, it's all built on open source stuff. So this fact that we're going to give

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:38.800
 up the last mile to a bunch of VCs and a bunch of close source commercial passes.

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:44.800
 Fuck that. No, no, no. This is where we take up the mantle and go like, we can make this easy.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:50.560
 We can make this better. I've been trying to push that envelope with Kamal and deploy tools that we

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:56.400
 used to build on top of Docker to get out of the cloud. We used to be in the cloud. We used to be

00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:01.440
 on AWS. We used to be on all this stuff for a bunch of hours, things with base commit. Hey,

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:06.560
 and we yanked all of it out because cost was just getting ridiculous. And we built a bit of tooling.

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:14.640
 And now I'm on a goddamn mission to make open source as capable, as easy to use as all these

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:21.360
 AWS results we have against any box running basic Linux with an IP address you can connect to.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.840
 Yeah, I think I think beyond the fear that you described that people have actually,

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.280
 there's another dimension to there's almost like a pride. I think there's like this

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.560
 narrow definition of productivity where they're like, if I have to learn something,

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:39.040
 like that's not productive. And they kind of have this literally narrow path of like,

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:43.360
 I'm someone that loves being productive. I'm all about business. That means I like, you know,

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:48.400
 value these things. But a lot of this stuff, like you said, like when you go and understand these

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:53.360
 under underlying things, that does make you more productive in ways that are really hard to explain.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:57.440
 You get advantage in other places. So yeah, I think for me, it's more like there's a weird

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:01.600
 pride with not knowing this stuff. I mean, that's like hard to shake people up straight out of

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:07.280
 center in the art of motorcycle maintenance. The guy he's riding with is riding a BMW motorcycle.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:12.640
 And he explicitly takes pride in not knowing anything. Like, it's part of a core identity.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:18.320
 There's a whole philosophy in that book about why that is, why does that develop sort of our

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:23.520
 struggle with modernity and the hardness of knowing everything and then essentially becoming

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:28.320
 alluded not wanting to know anything and then developing an entire identity around that.

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:34.560
 And I think that's really interesting. I also think it is sad when it comes to developers because

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:39.200
 it is not internally consistent. It is not an internally consistent model of how do you become

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.920
 a capable developer? Because first of all, as we've discussed, you're figuring shit out all the

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:51.040
 time to make a JavaScript project from four years ago, compile requires a fucking PhD at this point,

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:56.320
 right? Like in archaeology and whatever, you've got to dig out all these things. Oh, we're using

00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:03.760
 webmaster politics. Oh, that was in the ancient times of 2018, that we use tools like that to

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:08.880
 compile those stuff. So if you're able to figure that shit out, don't tell me you can't

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:14.160
 set up a Linux machine. They come pre-baked out of the box for most cases. There's very little

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:18.960
 seasoning. You have to apply to that dish for it to be delicious and good and nutritious.

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:27.440
 So I think it is weird and it's weird in fascinating ways of like, why is humans weird? And I also

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:32.960
 think it's fixable. I think it's fat driven. And I think we can absolutely reverse course.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:39.520
 The cloud, when that was first introduced, sounded nuts, right? Wait, I'm going to rent computers

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:46.160
 the entire time, even if I need them all the time from some other person who runs a everything store.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:52.640
 What? That sounds nuts. Why would I do that? And then a few years happening, again, we realized

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:57.440
 that there were some real advantages to that. But a lot of it was also just like a mental

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:03.360
 shift, right? A mental shift. And do you know what? Those things can shift back. And we can

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:09.520
 knock things straight. And some of it is pendulum swing, right? When it comes to setting up servers,

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:16.400
 I think the main shift for me is the difference between pets and cattle, right? Is this like your

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:21.280
 loving, nurtured machine where you've tweaked out your little configs in a bespoke way and it

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:24.400
 lives just on this box. And if you need another box, you're like, oh, this shit's going to take

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:29.120
 me 20 hours to set that up. Or do you live in a cattle world where you're deploying containers?

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:33.760
 And that's where all the interesting configuration happens and it's repeatable and it's scalable

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:39.360
 and it's all these other things. Now, that pet versus cattle idea, which really got pushed forward

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:45.440
 with the cloud, can totally work on your own stuff too, or work on dedicated machines or whatever.

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:51.280
 So some of it is, is relaying the fact that you don't have to give up on modernity to understand

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:56.960
 how things work. You don't have to give up on containerization to understand how a Linux box

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.880
 can be connected to the internet. Like these things are actually not in opposition. And as we found,

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:07.680
 when we moved out of the cloud, we had a team of about 10 people on our ops team and a bunch of

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:13.280
 them were cloud native specialists. That was their main thing. Then we moved out of cloud on to our

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:19.440
 own stuff and they could retain like 90% of their skills. 90% of the system administration work was

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:25.440
 the same whether we own the boxes or we rented them from Amazon. And I think that's the part

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:30.960
 a lot of folks are appreciating. They're thinking, wait, computer, does that mean it's running in

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.960
 your basement? How do you secure that? Do you have a baseball bat down there in case someone tries

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:40.240
 to break in and get it? What even is it? No, that's not how it works. There are professional

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:46.160
 data centers that you just rent a space for and then you put in your own computer and there's just

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:51.760
 some basic education here where I kind of feel like it's like we're discovering an ancient

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:56.160
 civilization and people going, how the fuck did they build those pyramids, man? I don't even understand

00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:01.840
 how the snow gets up there and wait like 100 tons. Like what kind of space is technology?

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:07.760
 And then the people built the pyramids which is like, hey, man, I'm like 45. We did it like

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:14.240
 nine years ago. This is ancient technology that we need archaeologists to figure out. It probably

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:20.000
 wasn't fucking aliens either. Like we knew and we know how to do it. The people are still alive.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.920
 The people who set up the internet, as you know it today, which was set up not on hyperscalers but

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:30.880
 by individual companies owning computers and connecting them to the internet, they're still

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:37.200
 fucking alive. There's kind of a lot of them too. And we can rediscover that. We can rediscover that

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:43.200
 and we'll be better off for it if we do. And a bunch of the advances we've had in technology

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:47.600
 since then have actually made it easier to do that. When I got started with the internet,

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:51.920
 well, not even the internet, let's just say, when I got started with base cam, when we launch

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:59.040
 base cam, we launch base cam on an Intel Celeron one core, I think, CPU with 2.8 gigahertz. Is that

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:05.600
 right? Something like that, right? One fucking core, one 2004 core, by the way. That shit was slow.

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:11.920
 I mean, by modern standards, two orders of magnitude faster, I just bought a hobby box from

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:21.440
 Hetzner, just to rent and play with an experiment, right? 48 cores, hyperthreading, 96 vCPUs for $220

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:28.800
 a month. What? What? The amount of computing power that's in that machine could operate,

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:34.640
 probably 95% of all SAS businesses that exist in the world. And napkin math that I did yesterday

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:38.400
 on Twitter said, like, you know what, we probably only need like five of those boxes to run all

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:46.160
 a base cam, which is a SAS company doing tens of millions in ARR. Computers have gotten insanely

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:53.520
 fast and capable and productive. And you wouldn't know half the time if you're dealing with a reseller

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:58.320
 of a reseller of perhaps a reseller of AWS, because that shit is still expensive. I mean,

00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:02.240
 Heroku, again, I love Heroku, and I'm just gonna bang them, then I'm a little bit like,

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:08.400
 well, literally charge you like 200 bucks for like half of a vCPU and two megabytes of RAM.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:12.560
 That's a little over the top. But hardware is really good, really fast, and it's getting faster

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:18.080
 and cheaper like all the fucking time. Moore's law, once you look at multi core setups is very

00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:24.240
 much alive, should be should be getting twice as fast at half the cost in no time at all. And it is,

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:30.960
 except if you buy it from a reseller of a reseller. Yeah, the the point about the tools working,

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:35.760
 like the cloud tools, like also all those things being retained. That's a good one. So I work on

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:41.520
 infrastructure as code stuff. And all of our tooling was developed for deploying cloud services,

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.800
 right? So there's good ideas there, like declaratively defining config, like, you know,

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:51.120
 applying that. And we realized the other day, we can just point all the same stuff to like a

00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:56.960
 Docker daemon running on a machine. And it all works exactly the same. So all the great benefits

00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:03.280
 that we kind of invented in the cloud, you can just use that same model, anywhere. So yeah,

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:08.160
 it's quite a different experience. And I was at a post the other day, I was remembering the first,

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:14.080
 my first company, I actually launched it off my laptop. Like it was, I was like, it was a Wi-Fi,

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:19.040
 it was like a Wi-Fi laptop, right? And this was like in 2010. Eventually, we moved that to servers

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:22.880
 in my parents basement, like literally my parents basement. And we sold the company at that point.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:26.640
 And I remember like the first thing they did, they were like, yeah, we need you guys to move that.

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:31.680
 I was probably not secure. But I actually did build and sell a company of that.

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:38.480
 We had a dog, you know, yeah, it was dusty down there. The servers are still there too. I could

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:44.160
 probably still use them. But but yeah, like, you know, I did build and sell a company that way.

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.320
 It's a lot better these days to do something like that, though.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:52.240
 It is a lot better. And I think that that's also where these things are not an opposition of it.

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:56.800
 I'm glad the cloud thing happened. I really am. I think it moved the ball forward in a lot of

00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:01.760
 ways of how to understand how to run things. Some of the conceptual models, the pet versus cattle,

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:07.840
 the clarity of setups, all that stuff. We owe to the cloud. We owe to the billions and billions

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:11.920
 and billions of dollars that got pushed into it. But we don't have to stay there, right? I like to

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:17.760
 think of it a little bit sometimes, big pharma. So someone puts in a billion dollars to develop

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:24.320
 a new drug. We should be thankful as humanity for that to happen. It is really expensive to do the

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:29.120
 R&D. Lots of the R&D doesn't work. Even when the R&D does work, it goes through all these

00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:34.960
 clinical trials. They cost absolutely astounding sums of money to do. It requires investors to

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:39.280
 underwrite all of that. And those investors will only do it if they occasionally get a slam dunk

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:46.800
 with Simpec to pay it all off, right? Incredible. Equally incredible. The fact that patents expire

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:52.960
 after 19 years, 18 years, and then shit goes generic. And after it's gone generic, the price goes to

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:57.840
 essentially what it costs to produce the compounds, which is usually nothing, right? I mean, I guess

00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.160
 I can get as riled up as anyone about the state of the American health care system. But I can't give

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:07.520
 that riled up about the idea that like a pill costs more than the chemical compounds it takes to

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:12.880
 produce it because that's not the expense, right? Like the expense is developing the drug that works

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:20.400
 and is safe and can be rolled out. And America just for whatever peculiar reasons ends up bankrolling

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.400
 the whole world on this, right? Like Americans pay through the nodes for their medication. And

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:30.320
 that's why we have all this medication. Anyway, so when all that happens, it's also amazing that

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:34.400
 we have the forcing function of the generic threat, right? Like, first of all, it means that these

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.960
 pharmaceutical companies can't just develop a drug and then the next 200 years milk it like

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.000
 Mickey Mouse. Things will actually expire and they have to come up with new shit or they'll go out

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:51.200
 of business. And just as important, the advances for humanity accrue to all at zero cost one shit

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.760
 goes generic. That's the model we should think about with commercial software development and

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:01.760
 cloud development. The cloud was on a patent for quite a while, and it developed a bunch of

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.240
 cool new shit. And that's great. And we should be grateful for it. And I'm grateful for it.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.560
 But also now it's time to go generic. Now it's time for these advantages in developer

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:15.840
 economics and deployment and containerization and of the wazoo to go generic system. We don't

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:22.080
 have to pay rental fees until the end of fucking time. The internet today exists the way it does

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:27.280
 because of open source software. There wouldn't be and I owed as many businesses if every goddamn

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:35.120
 vendor wanted a per CPU license charge as though you were buying Oracle in 1998, right? Like that

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:43.760
 was just going to seriously curb the dynamism of the entire economy. So we need to respect the

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:48.240
 fact that the capitalist forces are pushing these things forward at the frontier. And that's

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:53.200
 amazing. And I am a capitalist in that regard very much so. And I'm also a goddamn communist

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:57.440
 when it comes to open source software and like that it all should be free and we should be fighting

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.400
 to move more things generic and so forth. Those ideas, even if they sound contradictory,

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:07.680
 they fit inside someone's head. They can fit inside someone head. You can wrestle with that

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:14.320
 paradox and be better off for it by embracing both at the same time. But it is well overdue

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.040
 that we go generic with the cloud nonsense. Yeah. I mean that resonates a lot with me.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:23.520
 The work that we do is like some of these resellers you're talking about. Sometimes they do come up

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.560
 with cool ways to deploy stuff or you know, they come with stuff that we wouldn't have thought of.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:32.880
 And what we do is we take it and we just make it open source so that people can use it wherever

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:38.800
 they need to. So there's like a it's a little antagonistic but there's also like a like a

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:44.080
 harmony to it as well. Yeah. I think all capitalism the idea of capitalism is there's no permanence.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:49.360
 If you have permanence, it doesn't work. You need things to get destroyed. Yes. Yes. You need

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.520
 the pencil. And you can't be a cook outless if you don't believe in that. And I think this is why

01:02:53.520 --> 01:03:00.240
 I've been so vocal about the cloud issue in particular because I've been seeing what looks

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:05.520
 like the formation of new monopolies. And that is partly coming because these hyperscalers

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:12.960
 are not operating in a traditional free marketplace because it is very difficult for companies to

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:18.080
 actually switch. And again, it's been the promise of the cloud almost since day one. Oh, we're going

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.080
 to use all these declarative conflicts and so forth. And you're going to be able to just like,

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:26.640
 you don't like pricing in AWS. No problem. You just switch to GCP. You don't like that. You

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:31.120
 switch to a sure. Yeah, no one's doing that. No one's doing that. And in fact, much of the

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.960
 evangelism around the cloud is like you're not doing cloud right unless you're using all these

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:40.480
 proprietary APIs. Unless you're fully taking advantage of the managed services and the serverless and

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.960
 the this and the that and the other thing that is usually just peculiar and particular enough

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.160
 to a single cloud vendor, you're not doing it right. And that's of course the maximum amount of

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.920
 lock-in you will ever get on the business if once you go down the path of using bespoke, slightly

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:00.560
 tailored, slightly different version of these open source tools that most of this stuff is built

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:07.280
 on at AWS or or other places. We went through that. It took a fair amount of time to get out of the

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.920
 cloud. It was not about just changing the IP addresses of sort of the Kubernetes deployment

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:16.480
 target and then pushing the button and they're all working. Maybe one day we will get there. I

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.200
 don't know. I think there's a very strong incentive from the hyperscalers for us not to get there.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.240
 They don't want a competitive marketplace. They don't want ease of migration or use of change

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.720
 because that's going to bring pricing pressure. In fact, I just saw, I think it was yesterday,

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:37.360
 that prices for the same amount of compute in total refutation of Moore's law is going up.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:43.760
 Like cloud is getting more expensive for the same amount of compute. That's fucked up.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:49.520
 Like that to me is an example of a captured market that's not responsive to the normal

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:56.800
 competitive pressures of a functional market. I think we need open source for nothing else for

01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:02.640
 that. Pricing power becomes extreme when you have full control of the market. Just ask Apple.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.160
 We started out of that discussion. How the fuck are they able to take 30% of everyone's

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:11.600
 business on the app store? Well, because they can and there's no other alternative for you if you

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:17.360
 want to ship software to iPhones. If you can control a toll booth like that, the cloud providers

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.440
 are not quite like that. They're a little more like a Roach Motel. You can check in. You just can't

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:27.040
 check out. You need to make it like a regular hotel. You can check in and then you can stay

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:32.080
 for a while and you can leave without it costing an arm and leg in the firstborn.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:37.600
 One thing I will say I disagree a little bit is I think if you are going to use a cloud,

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.360
 if you're going to use one of the public clouds, if you try to use it in a way where you're just

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.480
 trying to rent servers, you're going to have a horrible experience. Like it's way too expensive

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:49.040
 to do that. If your approach is I'm renting servers, I'm going to run my own software.

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:52.880
 Just don't use a cloud at all. Just go to like you said, that's stuff that you guys are using.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:57.280
 Go directly to data centers that offer renting the hardware directly. You can have a much better

01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:02.160
 experience. If you are going to use a cloud, you might as well like just commit to something,

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:06.240
 like commit to using it properly. And then yeah, you can use the services high level services.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.440
 They're more expensive, but at least you get the benefit. I think it's this middle ground

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:14.080
 where you like try to use a cloud in this agnostic way. That's just never going to work out at all.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:19.520
 So whatever model clicks for you, if you like console servers, just go

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.880
 buy them directly. It's probably at least 10x cheaper, if not more.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:28.720
 That was my mental model and we used a lot of the managed services. We used RDS and that whole setup.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:34.080
 And unfortunately, I would say is that that's where you get reamed the worst.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.680
 The managed services on RDS and with the search was the other one we used, what was it called,

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:45.920
 open search or something else AWS. I would actually wouldn't count both of those because

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:51.600
 I guess what I've thought. So those are like just shitty repackaging of stuff that you can

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:56.960
 just run directly. I actually thought they were decent in terms of economics. They did save us

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:03.040
 some degree of some kinds of backups and whatever. It was a little bit there, but the upcharge was

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:10.640
 so freaking insane. We were spending on RDS alone. We were spending more than half a million

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:16.400
 dollars a year in rental fees. It cost us, I think, to replace that, like the hardware and setup,

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:22.400
 we bought $125,000 worth of machine and then we owned those machines. Now, we still have to pay

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:27.920
 for power and we still have to pay for some other, but holy shit, literally the payback on the machine

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:34.720
 purchase was like five minutes. Five minutes of rental, we could buy all these huge honky

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:39.600
 beasts of machines with amazing amounts of cores and rams and all the other stuff

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:45.520
 and we just have to connect them to the internet. Again, there's something there. I'm not

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:50.960
 disputing the fact that there are cases where the cloud makes sense. What I've usually said is,

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:57.600
 especially if you have a huge dynamic range on peak to trough in terms of your usage,

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:03.040
 like one day you're doing whatever, 100,000 requests a second and the next day you're doing

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:08.480
 10. That is a huge range where you're going to have a bunch of idle servers sitting around

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:12.960
 if you're going to build out your setups just that they can take it. So there is a tip of our

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:16.480
 point with that dynamic range, I think makes sense. And then there's also a tip of a point

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:24.400
 where you're not even using a whole machine. I just need to rent like 18% of a computer because

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:28.960
 that's all I need right now. Yeah, the granularity. So there's some granularity there. And then I'm

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.120
 also sure that there are other cases like access to specialized hardware is a good one. Good luck

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:39.360
 trying to buy a bunch of H1s or H100s, whatever. The hyperscalers did have access to them and they

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:44.160
 would rent it to you. So I think there are plenty of cases where it does make sense. I think the

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:51.040
 my argument has been that the default case is not right. The default case being like,

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:55.200
 hey, you should run cloud and everything and running your own shit is like trying to produce

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.440
 your own power. That was one of the analogies that were used for a while. Well, are you in the

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:03.920
 power production business? No, then you should just buy power from the socket. Are you in the

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:08.640
 cloud data center business? No, therefore you should just yet that one doesn't hold. It doesn't

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:14.480
 actually work. You are much closer to the same dynamics, whether you you rent it or you own it,

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:21.520
 a lot of the difference just like is in the finance model and CapEx versus ZopEx and whatever. And if

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:28.160
 you actually ran the numbers, you would be surprised. Now part of the irony here is it's

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:33.840
 actually very, very difficult to run the numbers in the cloud. We had like FinOps. That's a cottage

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:40.880
 industry. That's a whole thing. Yeah. Specializing in understanding your bill, if that is not a red

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:46.160
 flag or red flag, I don't know what it is. It's just so complicated. I need specialists with

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:52.080
 PhD and statistical analysis to just understand what I'm paying for. What? I mean, and we saw this

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:56.960
 ourselves. We tried to, well, not just tried. We worked very hard to understand our bill,

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.320
 like how to proportionate and what is that application spending? That was tens of hours

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.760
 a month. Just trying to understand the bill. It comes up, it comes up all the time. Every other

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:16.720
 month. And after we bought our own servers, yeah, that went away. That was just a whole category of

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:22.800
 work that just disappeared. We did one big analysis when we bought all the servers we needed to get

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:28.320
 out of the cloud for whatever. And it was like, I don't know, $5,600,000. Not an insignificant sum,

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:33.280
 but like our cloud budget was $3.2 million. So like proportionally, not that big of a deal.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.720
 Anyway, we do that analysis once and then we're like, all right, CN five years. That's the next

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:46.960
 time I'm going to worry about whether I need an AMD EPIC 9454 or a 9754. Like, yeah, I don't need

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:51.920
 to do this every day, right? With the cloud, you kind of sort of do because if you don't,

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:57.120
 it is so easy for these things to run away from you. The 3.2 million we had on our cloud budget

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.640
 really should have been twice that at least. It would have been if we hadn't been Nazis about

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.880
 chasing down the last penny and stopping all the right services and doing all the optimizations

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.720
 and entering long-term contracts is the other thing that blows my mind. People have this

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:15.680
 conception. Oh, the cloud is like just meter as you go. Yeah, no, no, it isn't. No one actually

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.800
 using the cloud at scale is paying like per the minute. They are entering into at least one year

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:26.640
 contracts on committed instances because that's the only way to get any pricing that makes any kind

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:35.200
 of sense. On AWS's S3 service, we were in a four year fucking contract four years committed to

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:40.800
 getting any pricing that sort of made sense. So there's a lot of contradictions and all this

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:44.800
 stuff. Again, different businesses are different in different ways. And I'm not saying there's one

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.560
 size that fits all here. I think there is an opening though for us to reconsider what the

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:54.480
 default should be when you should start doing the calculations. And also, if you do know Linux a

01:11:54.480 --> 01:12:01.440
 little bit, the alternatives won't seem as foreign or as inconceivable as I think they do to some

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:07.840
 companies, right, who have grown up in a cloud first world and have a team that's familiar with

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:14.640
 instantiating new AWS services. And then they go like, what do you mean, Ethernet? Where?

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:21.840
 Like that? That's fixable. Yeah. Yeah. So I think where we can agree on is like, I'm still

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:27.520
 like, I use the cloud, have we like clicks for me? But what I don't like is the people that are

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:33.840
 like, quote unquote on that side, don't know how to do the other thing. So it's just like, I can't

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:39.200
 really trust your opinion, even though you're like on this side, because you're doing it out of

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:45.600
 not knowing the other side. I've always had a home lab that I manage, would run whatever like,

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.880
 I would use to expand my little like Kubernetes, with no math, like all the different registration

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:53.920
 stuff. So I've seen how that stuff's progressed. And I enjoy it. Like I said, just like with my

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:59.600
 desktop, it's, it's really good when you like curate that's a garden almost, running all the

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:06.000
 services that power my family stuff. So like, I have a sense of that. So when I'm choosing the

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.880
 cloud, I'm choosing it with like awareness of what I'm trading off and what I'm balancing.

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.040
 I don't think that's what most people do. Yeah, I agree with that.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.320
 I don't think that's what most people are doing. No, most businesses are doing. They're not doing

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:20.000
 it from like, Hey, I know how this works. If we're going to run ourselves, I know how to work

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.960
 into cloud and like I can make the math work or I can make the economics work. That is not what

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.960
 I'm seeing broadly. And I think that's a shame. And I think again, we can fix it. And I think part

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:34.240
 of the fix literally is exposure therapy, getting more developers exposed directly to Linux,

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:39.360
 so as to realize that the operating system, they're going to run their servers on is not this scary

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:44.480
 alternate universe where everything is upside down. It's actually, first of all, quite familiar in

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:49.600
 many ways. Like if you're a developer working on the Mac, the hop to Linux isn't like, if you were

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:55.360
 a Windows PowerShell user and you didn't want to run WSL, okay, that's going to be a culture

01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:00.800
 shock of some mention when you hop into Linux, right? If you've been running on the Mac and you

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:06.320
 run Homebrew and you're familiar with some of these tools, whatever, it's not like going to

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:10.160
 a different universe. It is like going to perhaps a different continent, but they kind of still

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:15.200
 speak a version of English, just kind of broken. I guess like Americans going to Australia and like

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:21.200
 just going like, hey, mate, that's like the Linux version for Mac OS folks switching over. It's a

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:26.720
 dialect, right? But the difference is in the dialect and the difference is realizing that this

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:32.240
 is literally the same stuff as you run on the server that should make you far more comfortable

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:36.560
 in thinking you can run it to without needing a PhD in Linux harden.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:39.920
 So I have a quick question for you. So this is a thought I had the other day because I

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:43.840
 feel a lot of the same things you're talking about where I'm like, people these days don't

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:49.680
 even know how to X. Yes, I am. And you remember when we were young, people would say that to us. So

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:54.880
 like, are we just doomed to repeat this? Is this actually going to change? Is it actually different

01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:00.240
 this time? It's always different when it's your generation than young people are ungrateful and

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:04.400
 the older one is stupid, right? It's kind of like driving in the highway. Anyone who drives faster

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:10.560
 than you is a maniac and anyone who drives slower than you is a grandma. Perfect speed. How amazing

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:17.600
 it worked out that way. I do think about that all the time. And exactly for the reasons that you

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:22.160
 say, I remember when I started working with the web and I had a bunch of programmer friends and

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:29.040
 those programmer friends were used to writing applications in a simpler in C. And a lot of them

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:34.160
 had a very difficult time with something like PHP, where they just go like, that is literally

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:41.600
 10,000 times as inefficient that for loop. As if I wrote it in a simpler and get a move and a

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:50.160
 whatever X or I don't even fucking want to know. But they had a very difficult time adjusting to

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:54.800
 that, right? I do try to think about that often when I go like, well, back in our days, when we

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:59.120
 had to set up servers and connect them to the internet, like we walked barefoot in both directions

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:05.760
 and smelled all the time. So you got to be careful not to turn into the literal Simpson's episode of

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:12.800
 like the old man shaking at the sky. While at the same time, I'm also realizing that not everything

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:17.280
 new is better. And then we've seen that over and over again in all sorts of domains where

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:22.640
 I think it is a very healthy time or healthy instinct that we should constantly be pushing

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.160
 forward. How can we make things simpler? How can we make them faster? And we should be using those

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.600
 additional CPU cycles, for example, to make ourselves more productive. And this was actually

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:37.840
 why I am so passionately angry at the cloud is because I felt like they didn't hold up their

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:43.200
 end of the bargain. I did not feel like things got sufficiently easier that I was paid back

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.640
 in additional productivity. We were never able to materially change the configuration of our

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:53.200
 operations team. When they worked in the cloud, there were some things that were slightly different.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:58.960
 They weren't worrying perhaps about, hey, there's a warning here about the second PSU in this

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:03.040
 sled that needs to be changed. That was not a warning they would get. That would just go to the,

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:08.480
 I was about to call it cloud monkeys. We're all fucking problems. And someone in that

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.240
 data center would run around and you would think, oh man, the computer is so sophisticated. No,

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:18.400
 that's fucking just George. And George is spending with your damn CPU over that box and he's pulling

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.680
 it out. You just don't know, don't George. George lives behind an API. Sometimes these big day

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:28.400
 centers, there's only like, there's only like two people that are there, like on call. Yeah,

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.320
 it's not even like a whole team or anything. There's some of that. And that's why I think I

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:35.440
 would have, I mean, that's why I was a cloud believer actually for many years. I was very

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:39.280
 passionate. Like, this is the way the future is going to work. We just need to get over this hump

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:44.000
 that's going to be easier and cheaper. And I never fucking did. Never fucking did. That's why I'm

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:51.040
 so mad. I tried for more than half a decade to find cheaper and to find easier. The only thing I

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:56.240
 ever consistently found was faster. And I mean, faster in terms of procurement. It is still amazing.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:02.080
 I will grant that with one API call, it's been up like a thousand servers. It's gonna cost you

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:09.360
 probably a house and a condo, but you can do it. That's pretty fucking cool. You can't do that

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:14.400
 by going to delt.com and ordering a bunch of power edges, right? Like that's gonna take like a

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:19.440
 week and a half, at least maybe two before they arrive and before they're racked. So that was always

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.160
 there. But to me, it was always about the three things. It was supposed to be cheaper. It was

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:29.200
 supposed to be easier. It was supposed to be faster. And it's only really the speed of procurement

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:33.760
 that I saw at our business. Again, as we've talked about, there's different considerations

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:37.760
 and different analysis you got to make on your own business. But I was just so disappointed

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:44.400
 that the promised land never seemed to arrive, that when I look at setting up a new AWS installation,

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:48.640
 when I read through the like, Hey, get started with AWS one on one, I went like,

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:54.240
 this shit is off the scale complicated. Just even remembering like how I do the AM,

01:18:54.240 --> 01:19:01.120
 I am user management configuration in the cloud. I'm like, I feel like I have to go back to school

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:04.960
 to study again, again, some of it's just different things. And you learn different things. And you

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:10.720
 could say living is also complicated. Okay, yes. But also no, like there are different scales of

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:16.720
 complexity. And I felt or I feel like the cloud in many ways did not help up its end of the bargain

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:20.960
 that it promised us simpler. And we didn't get it. All right, I got a question. And this is kind

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:26.320
 of moving off of all the cloud stuff. You said earlier that the Apple stuff made you mad enough,

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:31.280
 you considered like hanging it up, retiring. I think in my generation, we're kind of the

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.200
 generation right below yours that looked up to you. You called me old. Let me just

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:45.280
 equal amounts of gran your beard. I'm the one that said I guess I've always wondered like

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.920
 someone like you, you get to that level of success or whatever, you could not do this anymore. But

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:54.800
 you choose to. And I wonder like, are do you have this idea in your head of what it would take for

01:19:54.800 --> 01:20:01.200
 you to kind of stop programming? Yes. If Matt's ever decides to introduce static typing into Ruby,

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:08.160
 I'm out. The other one would be if somehow like browsers would only accept TypeScript

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:14.720
 and not JavaScript anymore. I'm out. No, seriously, as long as I'm still having fun,

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:20.720
 and I feel like I have my independence, that's really the two factors I gauge things on. I'm having

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.760
 a tremendous amount of fun. This is one of the reasons why I'm so passionate about the Linux

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:28.560
 thing. It's really been fun. I was about to say a journey of the lifetime. That's probably actually

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:35.920
 fair. I haven't had that many platform changing. I'm just going to mix it all up. I'm going to take

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:41.520
 20 years of ingrained muscle memory about where the Apple key goes with copy and rewriting that

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:47.360
 to the control key. That has been a ton of fun. And building all this tooling we built to get

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:51.840
 out of the cloud has been an amazing amount of fun. So I actually don't think I'm going to stop

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.520
 thinking computers are fun. I just fundamentally really like computers. Like they are just on my

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:03.520
 days off, whatever, on the weekend occasionally. I was like, I just want to go like type on my

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:08.800
 little keyboard for a while. I'm going to fix a bug. I'm not even hit by the bug. I don't fucking

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:14.000
 care about the bug. I want to hear me going to clack from my mechanical keyboard. I want to commit

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.960
 something. I want to push it. I want to do a release because it's just freaking fun and I enjoy it.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:23.200
 So I don't think that part is going to go away. Again, Matt, if you're listening,

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:27.600
 short of you fucking putting static typing into Ruby, not going to happen, man. I'm going to stay

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:33.200
 on Ruby three version and whatever before that until the end of time. The other one that's more

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:40.880
 likely is that it stops becoming possible to run things independently that you have to run

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:46.560
 on say a hyperscaler and release through an app store. Then I'm out. Like, I don't want to do that.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:50.400
 I don't want to go through multiple layers of permission. I don't want to have to beg

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:57.200
 fucking cook about whether I can release a new idea into the wild, whether I can release software.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:05.440
 So as long as we can keep the internet strong, and I think that's not as obvious of a premise as

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:11.360
 I would have assumed an advocated for it being in like 2008. Like the internet is under pressure

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:15.600
 from a lot of different forces. And this idea at the very least of global internet

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:21.520
 seems more or less over. Like we are fracturing the internet at an alarming rate. And okay,

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:26.240
 maybe that can happen. And maybe we just have to accept that like, at some point, like there's

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.960
 going to be a European internet, just like there's a Chinese internet, just like there's halfway

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:35.920
 a Brazilian internet. And they're not kind of connected, or at least they have very severe

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:41.440
 firewalls that prevent things from going back and forth. I hope that America's not getting there.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.120
 I don't take it for granted, though. And I don't think anyone should. If you care about the internet

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:52.880
 in its sort of original ethos and form, I think you're going to have to get ready to

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:58.080
 fight for it, to some extent. What does that mean? I don't fucking know. I don't want to get

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:04.560
 political about that in any way. Just this idea of appreciating what we have and realizing how

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:11.120
 unique it is. The internet as a software distribution platform is truly one-on-the-kind. If you had

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:15.840
 explained it to any VC today, they would have gone like, "Yeah, but where's the toll boost? Can we

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:21.200
 just install one around the whole thing? Would you have five different corners? How do you do it?

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:25.120
 How do you capture all the economic activities that are coming out of this thing?" And the fact

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:30.560
 that we ended up with such a powerful platform that wasn't owned by any individual company and

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:38.480
 backed by any individual VC is just mind-blowing. And I think you only realize how unique and rare

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:43.920
 it is when you look at the regression we've gone through with the App Stores. That to get software

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:51.200
 onto mobile phones, it's not like that at all. It's an absolutely dominated platform with a

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:56.480
 single gatekeeper who tells you whether you have a right to exist or not. So if that's what the

01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:02.960
 internet either becomes or the internet disappears or gets so kneecapped by all these fencing in

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.640
 that it starts resembling that, okay, I'm also out. But it sounds like the computer's thing that's

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:13.520
 for life. I've always wondered. I hope so. I mean, this is actually one of the reasons I

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:17.120
 look at AI, right? We talked a little bit about that at the beginning. And people are like,

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:22.400
 "They're so excited that AI is going to take all programming jobs." And to some degree,

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:26.800
 I can be excited for that in the same way that like, did we need, I don't know,

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:32.640
 two million people tending to horses for our economy to function? Maybe not, but I don't really

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:38.160
 like horses, but I know people who do, and they still ride them. I hope to be that. I am still

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:46.320
 riding the manual code. I'm typing into commands. I'm just narrating to producer 5x AI to build the

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:51.840
 shit for me, right? In a museum. Exactly. And I do actually think that that is, there's still

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:57.760
 going to be space for that, but I think it's very plausible. And you should certainly consider that

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:03.680
 we've reached the high watermark that the number of people employed doing programming for a living

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:08.880
 has peaked. It's entirely possible. If you look at almost any other phase of the economy that has

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:12.320
 happened, the number of people who work in agriculture, the number of people who worked on the assembly

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:19.040
 line, there are plenty of precedents for this idea that there was some glorious times for a

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:24.000
 certain industry and for the workers in that industry, and that ended for one reason or another,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:30.000
 usually economic or progress or otherwise, right? And I don't know what that's going to look like,

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:36.400
 and I think I don't want to be a few longer here, but I do accept the fact that there are people who

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:43.280
 make their living doing this stuff who are right to be a little bit nervous about it. I mean,

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:49.280
 if you worked in Detroit in 1972, and you were putting together Buicks, and life was pretty

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:56.000
 fucking good, and you had a whatever good setup and two cars in the garage and all this stuff,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.120
 yet that doesn't exist in the same way anymore, right? Is that programmer's future? I don't

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:06.400
 fucking know. I hope not. I hope not, and I hope also, right? Isn't that weird? Like we think back

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:11.600
 on like, do we want to go back to subsistence farming? Do we want to go back to like 98% of the

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:17.200
 population, like literally swinging a hoe? Probably not, right? We also don't want to go back to the

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:22.400
 assembly line that that occupies everyone. But it's very hard in the moment to like, what comes

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:27.120
 after? What is the next? Where's it all going to cycle into? I don't know. And I think sometimes

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:32.240
 the cheerling is like, yeah, we're all just going to become prompt engineers. Yeah, no.

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:38.800
 Yeah, I mean, it's just like your transition to Linux. It was painful. You didn't know that it

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:43.440
 could be better, but eventually kind of you kind of got there. That's what I choose to hope. I choose

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:47.360
 to hope that like our AI overlords are going to be benevolent, and we can still prompt them

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:55.040
 that they're not prompting us. So one last thing, I have to plug this because you mentioned you

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:58.720
 like to ease, you're like blown away by like how crazy two weeks can get. Have you seen what

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.960
 we've done with our coffee shop? I have not. So we built a coffee shop that's served entirely

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.840
 over as a sage. So if you do as a sage terminal dot shop, that's awesome. You get a full coffee

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:11.920
 buying you can really buy coffee and it shows up at your clear house. But I'm going to try that.

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:15.120
 I don't drink coffee, but I will try. I don't drink coffee, but I sell it.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:22.480
 But it was fun because Adam worked on a lot of the like the front end for it, but it was cool

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:27.120
 because it's a very constrained UI. You can have like different font sizes. You can only do like

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:33.520
 colors and stuff, but the constraints kind of breed like a lot of cool stuff. And build. Yeah,

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:37.760
 constraints of the best. There's like amazing to UI tools that I've also been going deeper and

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:42.640
 I've built a bunch of other ones too for for work. I love it. Yeah, it's wild. Like it's better UX

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:48.560
 than a lot of the more powerful, you know, environments that we have UI in. I dream of doing a 2A for

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:54.880
 hay all the time and even a 2A for base camp. It's funny because I remember my first sort of

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:59.760
 exposure to twoies was travel agents and flight attendants. Like they work in. I don't know if

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:06.160
 they still do. They go fast. They go so fast. They were ahead of the fucking curve. You're

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:10.400
 a little quack. They're on a mechanical keyboard. They were hits from the mirror before that became

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:16.480
 a thing, right? They're like, I know all the things are F. Well, you're gene. Yeah, you can get to bank

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:22.880
 off through Shanghai and stuff over in Buffalo. And you're like, Jesus smokes, have you tried to

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:29.680
 use a travel website these days? I mean, this is half the banner on my wife and I's direct chat

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:36.800
 is just like, how the fuck did airlines get so shitty? How did shit occasion devour the travel

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.840
 industry to the point now where I'm like, I pray for travel agents to make a comeback.

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:48.080
 It's so damn painful to book any kind of travel through a web-based interface and I'm a big fan

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:52.160
 of the internet. I'm a big fan of the web. I built like 20 years there, but I also have to accept

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:57.040
 defeat that like a lot of shit on the internet is just actually getting worse. And if they had

01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:03.600
 the 2e constraints, you couldn't get that shitty. So maybe we should get back to travel agents and

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:08.560
 2e's. Everyone's going to be running their own servers and we're only going to be serving up

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:14.480
 2e's over as a sage. That's that's a future. Yeah. All right. Thanks so much for coming, David.

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:18.080
 This has been so good. Yeah, that was really funny. It was funny. Appreciate it. All right.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:28.880
 Thank you. All right. We're really bad at saying goodbye in like any podcast. So this is just a heads up.
