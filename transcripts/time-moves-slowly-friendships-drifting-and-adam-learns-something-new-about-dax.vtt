00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 Hi, my name is Dax and I'm using a mic.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.760
 I'm a white person. How bad can it be?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.640
 The fuck are you smiling about?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.640
 Well, I mean, it's been a week. Like, we skipped a week.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.440
 So it's kind of like, I haven't talked to you in two weeks.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.200
 And there's that. I am kind of upset that I paused this video.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.000
 I'm watching Ashton Jinti. He's a running back for Boise State.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.960
 And I just kept hearing his name. It's one of those deals where it's like,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.520
 you keep randomly hearing about this person. I mean, I listened a lot of NFL stuff.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.880
 He's a college football player and he's amazing.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.320
 And I don't know why that's on our podcast because it's very random.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.920
 But you should watch some Ashton Jinti highlights running back. He's amazing.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.440
 He's a running back. Yeah. And running back.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.360
 Yeah, running back hides are always really, really fun.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.760
 But running backs, like in the NFL, it's like whatever.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.480
 It's just like that you can get a dime a dozen.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.240
 They don't really need a good running back.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.200
 But then every once in a while, there's one of the generational prospects they call them.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.280
 It's like they change franchises, even at the running back position.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.080
 He looks really good. Anyway, I don't know anything about running back or scouting or whatever.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.120
 But the highlights are cool. Moving on.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.880
 When I say I need like 15, 20 minutes, am I the kind of person that when you hear that,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.120
 you just immediately think it's going to be 45 minutes?

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.680
 Have I earned that reputation yet? Or do you not think that?

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.280
 I live in Miami where nobody's sense of time can be trusted at all.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.200
 So at this point, including my own, so at this point, I just don't even

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.160
 a digital thing. So you're decent. Okay, cool.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.920
 Because I feel bad when that kind of thing happens.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.120
 And then I'm like, is this what always happens? Do I have a reputation?

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.120
 I don't know because in different circles, different friendships over my life,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.120
 I've had that reputation and I wonder if I've shook it off and this is rare.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.120
 I don't know. Just started thinking.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.160
 For me hearing this, it's funny because like my perception is like,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.840
 because you're white, I'm just like, there's no way it can be that bad.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.120
 I don't know what it is. I don't know if this makes any sense.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.280
 But literally I'm just like, okay, like I'm Adam's like, oh, I'm always late.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.160
 I imagine that you're like five or 10 minutes late, you know, because I'm white.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.920
 Okay. Like I'm around a lot and people all the time.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.720
 Yeah. And they will be one to two hours late and won't even acknowledge it.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.680
 Oh, okay. So it's a it's a very different thing.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.120
 And that's and that's intense.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.480
 Getting out the door is a is a challenge and like,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.920
 so like whatever you're saying, I'm just like, yeah, I can't be that bad.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.800
 Can't be that bad.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.600
 Okay. I'm a I'm a white person. How bad can it be?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.160
 Don't worry. Maybe again, relative to your community.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.600
 Maybe it's the worst, but maybe if you ever come here,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.760
 you're going to be like early to everything, probably.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.320
 Oh, nice. Okay. Well, that's that's good.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.120
 Just saying community or just kind of talking about past friends.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.520
 Do you have a hard time? This just came up last night.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.200
 I was talking with Casey about it.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.760
 I have like a string of very close friendships over my adult life,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.440
 and even going beyond that, like going back into school, like high school or whatever.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.160
 I have like always had a really close friend and

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.880
 there's like three or four of them that I never thought I wouldn't stay in touch,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.120
 but it's so hard to like try to stay in touch or even like want to respond

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.560
 when they try to stay in touch because it just feels like this very heavy thing that like,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.520
 if I'm going to talk to you at all, are we going to have to have like a really close relationship

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.800
 like we used to? I say really close, like whatever. It's really close as I can be to somebody.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.680
 It just feels like too much effort to even consider the relationship because we used to be close.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.720
 Does that make sense?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.920
 I feel like I've been thinking about the exact same thing lately.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.800
 So I have a similar situation like I have. I have a friend that I mean, it's a group of friends,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.800
 but I'm thinking one specifically that and I've known all these people since I was like in middle

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.680
 school. So people that, you know, I've known for a very long time. One of them I was at least

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:27.600
 particularly close with. So he's having his first baby next month. Yeah. And I didn't hear about it

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:36.000
 until like a month ago. So it's just like and it's not like it's like the reality of

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.560
 it's not like a rude thing at all. It's just like we don't have we just kind of lost any natural

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.720
 way that we natural situations that we would cross paths. So I didn't mess with him. I went

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.760
 up, you know, you end up calling me and we talked for a little bit. But yeah, there's just this

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.560
 thing like if you're not basically talking every single week, it just becomes like you said this

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.120
 heavy thing where it's like, it's very formalized way of communicating and it's like one person saying

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.840
 a bunch of things about their life and you're just like, Oh, cool. Oh, nice. Great. And then it's

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.920
 good. And you say a bunch of things. Yeah, exactly. So it's just not the way that, you know,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.600
 people hang out. And it's it's really sad. And I guess it's just a reality of getting older and

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.320
 like going through different phases of your life. But wow, like I just never really thought that

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.200
 this was a thing that would happen. Yeah, it feels like this graveyard of past relationships,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.560
 but like they're still alive and you still could like stay in touch kind of, but it just feels like,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.320
 I don't know, like it's never going to happen. And I don't know if I wanted to happen. Like,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.000
 I feel like if I was in a room with any one of them, it would immediately be like,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.120
 it used to be and it would be it would feel, you know what I mean? But it's like,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.760
 we don't live near each other. Or if we do, we're just living great different lives. And yeah,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.720
 like you said, if we don't talk every week, it's just very hard to imagine still having

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.960
 that friendship. I don't know. It's weird. It's kind of weird. Yeah, I think like you,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.360
 I just never expected it to happen. I don't know what I expected, but all those people I would have

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.480
 thought I'd be close with forever. And I never would have thought I'd have like a handful of them

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.840
 because I've just been alive long enough. You know what I mean?

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.880
 Yeah, it's true. Yeah. Yeah, I guess I'm actually, now that you mentioned it, I am going through a

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.720
 second phase of that. It's a, yeah, so it is like a handful. So I have like my friends from school

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.160
 growing up dealing with that, you know, kind of not being as close anymore. And now that I'm in

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.800
 Miami, it's all my New York friends. I'm like going through a second phase with that as well.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.720
 And it's like almost the exact same thing. So, and it's not either so New York, they all move

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.240
 too. So they're having this problem with each other as well, I imagine. But it's, it's funny

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.360
 because it's like literally all they would take to fix it is to turn it into this thing where I'm

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.080
 like messaging them every day, just a little, because there are people I message every single day.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.840
 Or like I used a couple of times a week. It's just that there's no trigger or like my brain

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.600
 doesn't think to message them. Like when I see something that I want to share with someone,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.360
 like they've just rotated out of the set of people that I share stuff with. So,

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.480
 yeah, all it would take was, this would be for me to actively like remember to do that.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.080
 But yeah, as little as it is, it's, it just doesn't happen.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.160
 That's the weird part. It like, I think that's what I'm really hung up on in the conversation with

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
 Casey last night. It's like, it really wouldn't take that much. It's not that much effort. Why

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.560
 don't I put it forward? Because it's really like, it just feels like the easiest thing in the

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.560
 world. And those were valuable relationships I had. But I just continue to not do it and almost

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:47.040
 actively like avoid it. I don't know. It's interesting. Yeah. Just one of those things about getting

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.560
 older, I guess. A lot of bad things about getting older. They say like time goes faster, the older

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.000
 you get, do you, have you heard that? I don't want to talk about that. Okay. Okay.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.080
 Because I hate that concept and it's like, go on and think about it. Okay. Well, the one thing I was

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.080
 going to say is it just already feels like it's going so fast. So like, I'm going to go faster.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.720
 Anyway, I'll stop. Maya, both Liz and my mom also said this. And I think it's true because I've

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.920
 experienced a year that was like this. They say time goes slower if you do a lot of different things

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:22.560
 every year. Yes. And we had this past year, we did a lot of different things that we don't

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.280
 normally do. And it feels like a very long year. Like we're coming up the end of the year and I'm

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.800
 like, wow, like, I can't, like, can you believe that React Miami was this year? That feels like

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:39.360
 five years ago. There were so many things that we did this year. So it felt like a slower year

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.280
 than the year before. So that I do remember now, Casey and I have talked about this as like an

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.240
 antidote to like our kids just disappearing from our lives and it going so fast. It's like,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:55.200
 things like a year feels slow. If you can, if you have like a lot of memories and you don't really

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.840
 make memories unless you break out of your normal routine, like basically, you have to like have

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.080
 experiences, do things that are different out of the normal. So the more, yeah, like you said,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.880
 the more you can do that, you have these markers that kind of like stretch back over the year and

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.440
 it slows that year down. It makes it feel like, I don't know, it's the whole thing. It's, I guess

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.520
 it's just perception and retrospect. It's not really feeling slower in the moment. It's about

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.360
 feeling like, I don't know, you lived a year worth while at the end of it, I guess,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.880
 not just feeling like, I can't believe it's Christmas again. Like, it's not having that feeling.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.360
 Yeah. Like, I can't believe like Dallas was just what two months ago, that feels like so long ago.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.560
 It does feel like a long time ago. And now we got New York, New York. People still don't know

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.840
 what we're doing, right? I know what we're doing, but people don't.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:50.320
 Did you see the disaster that happened? No, there is a conflict. Oh, no.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.760
 Wait, wait, what? The jazz nation's speaker dinner is at the same time.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.840
 Oh, no. What channel would I see this in? Well, it's a, there's a sentry channel that

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.600
 was in there, was messaged me about it. And then, so I emailed the jazz nation person,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.320
 let's see what, what they say. But I think we'd lose like five people if every single one

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.080
 decides to go. How many, how many did we have? Did we have backups?

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.800
 We didn't even have enough for teams of five. We had enough for four.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.720
 Oh, no. So we're going to have to, oh, well, I just do some stuff.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:26.240
 There's going to be teams involved. Yeah. And it was, it was two teams of four.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.080
 Are we on any of the teams? What are we doing? What do I have to do? Nothing.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.440
 We're going to be on one team, but there's going to be, we need three teams

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:42.640
 besides us. Sorry, we need four teams besides us. Okay. So that was 20 people.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.200
 If we do teams of four, I think it's totally fine. That's down to 16. Yeah, we're at like,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.960
 every single one of them decides not to go. We're at like 13 or 14. So we'll, we'll figure it out.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:57.280
 It just says it would be a bummer. Bummer. Well, I did send email.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:03.600
 And I was like, you know, I, I said like, no, we could give all the speakers free tickets to come

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.520
 and, and all of that. But I was also like, hey, the speakers are really excited to go to our thing.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.880
 So they're probably not going to go to, I didn't say that explicitly, but I'm hoping to put that

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.880
 together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I mean, I hope that works out. Yeah. Because that's,

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.960
 I just saw the list of names that, that'd be a bummer. In the back of my head, I was like,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.240
 one thing is going to go wrong. There's going to be one thing that you're waiting for. I guess it's

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.560
 gone too smoothly. And then here it is. Here it is. Just shout out real quick to Liz for being

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.920
 awesome and on top of all the things. She's doing such a good job.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.400
 Yeah. This is a, it's like what she's built for. So MVP. Yeah.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.680
 When she's going to, when she's going to organize an Ozarkian paintball match,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.760
 because that would be, that would be a lot of fun. The podcast will have a little sneak

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.840
 peek on that one. They'll know what's coming when we're like, we're doing an event in the Ozarks.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:57.520
 They'll know. There's nothing else to do here. AJ heard about this. And he was telling me that,

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.160
 you know, it seems like AJ is someone that is very good hobbies. And I learned that he has

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.520
 he used to have a hobby used to be on a paintball team that basically was like a national pro or

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:15.520
 something. Whoa, okay. Yeah. He's jumping all pro AJ. Look at him. I was saying, okay,

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.680
 we need to do some kind of thing where someone jumps out of a plane related to terminal and like,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.160
 yeah, he's going to do that for us. You know, yeah, yeah. We got a guy.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:31.600
 No, I was, I was asking him what the laws were on face jumping. Like, what is the law? Like,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.320
 can you just jump off of a plane anywhere? Like, can someone jump out of a family in my backyard?

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.760
 There has to be some kind of, well, I'm trying to think of precedent. Like, are there ways that

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.640
 the government tries to keep us from killing ourselves accidentally doing risky things?

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.280
 It's not really killing ourselves. It's just like landing in the city is sketchy, right?

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:55.280
 Oh, he was saying that basically it's if you meet certain certifications, which are quite

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.800
 hard to meet, you can basically do whatever you want. Wow. So I think we could have someone

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.800
 jump out and land in my backyard, you know, if you name that precisely.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.440
 That would be amazing. How funny would that be?

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.760
 You just, that's something about that just reminded me of drones. What's going on with drones

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.440
 these days? I feel like drones have been around a long time and like, has the technology gotten

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.920
 better? I mean, like, can you buy like really amazing drones now that like, and are there

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.360
 laws around flying drones? I don't know. I've heard things about that.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.320
 Did you see, did you see Andoril's new drone product?

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.880
 Two. No, obviously not. I don't know who that is.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.360
 Okay. So you know, Palmer Lucky, the Oculus founder founded a military company?

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:40.000
 No, but I believe. Okay. Okay. He did. It's called Andoril. And, like,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.920
 Andoril. It's the name of like Aragorn's, Aragorn's sword and.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.800
 Aragorn? Okay. Oh, Lord of the Rings.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.800
 Actually, not that. Yeah. Oh, his sword is named Andoril. I think I knew that, but you're saying

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.080
 it. Yeah. And Andoril. You're saying it like somebody who has only ever read it.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.000
 Somehow. I don't know. I definitely have only I read Return of the King. I've mostly watched it.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.520
 I'm sorry. I don't I don't have a native Middle-Earth accent.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.720
 Well, I just couldn't tell if you're saying Andoril or Andoril. It was Andoril.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.240
 Andoril. Andoril. I've never said it out loud. I think that's the issue.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.160
 Yeah. I guess why would you why would you say Aragorn's sword out loud, you know?

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.520
 Like, well, where would that come up?

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:28.480
 They make products for the military, like like missiles and things that blow up,

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:34.800
 but they put out like sort of product. Reels like it's like an Apple product. I mean,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.560
 it's a totally different vibe. It's not like the Apple vibe, but it's like that level of production

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.440
 where it's yeah, seems like it's a consumer product. But they're selling these drones now,

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.880
 again, to the military. To the military. Yeah. That can like blow up. And they're like,

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:54.320
 they have all these crazy capabilities of like being super precise and they do these dive bombs

00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:00.960
 and they blow up like right above the target to the shockwave, like yikes. It's at maximum lethality.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:06.560
 So yeah, drone tech seems pretty legit. Have you seen all of the like pretty much all these big

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.760
 events have started to replace fireworks with these crazy those crazy drone? Yeah, like synchronized

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.120
 drone shows. So I knew about that like a new China was doing something at the Olympics several

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.400
 years ago. So I figured, is that made into consumer stuff? Can I buy like a drone show? If I want to

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.320
 like hire somebody to come to a drone show at my event, that's like a thing. Yeah. I mean,

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:30.000
 the nearest thing we went to this past year, like in my neighborhood data at a drone thing going on.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.920
 Okay. So it's made to Miami. It'll be in the Ozarks in about four or five years.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:41.040
 Something like that. It could be you. It could be me. Maybe I'll just start a new career as a drone

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.640
 operator. You can just freak out people. Just like, just start projecting really crazy shit.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.920
 Oh, they totally would think it was UFOs. I thought Starlink was UFOs when I saw it for the

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.440
 first time. No joke. I was in the shower and I freaked out. I was like, Casey. Oh my God. What

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:02.640
 is this? There's nothing that could be that it's got to be easy. And then we looked at that. Have you

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.840
 seen Starlink at night? Like the string of them? Yeah, it's like a perfect line. If you've never

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.400
 heard of that or seen it, it's like what else could be flying together like that? Like nothing

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:18.000
 moves. That's not a plane. It's not planes. I don't think it's not shooting stars all synchronized.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.360
 It's crazy. It's made by humans. I know. It's a thing that's made by humans. Yeah, wild.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:32.160
 I know drones were really influential in like the Ukraine, Russia, conflicts, ongoing conflicts.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:39.600
 I think after that, the Ukraine, Russia thing, I really understood how much of war is like just

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:45.520
 economic things. It's like you imagine that you're trying to win a battle. So you just like send in

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:52.240
 your forces. Yeah, it's this deep calculation of like, this tank costs X million dollars. If we

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.640
 put it in, it takes out this other thing. But that thing costs less than the tank. So like, is it

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:04.240
 like, I think drones just make those calculations really crazy because you're risking a multi-million

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:10.480
 dollar thing and someone with like a thousand dollar drone can, yeah, $1,000 and like take away

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:16.000
 millions from you, right? So yeah, the whole asymmetry thing is pretty wild. Yeah, I guess the

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.920
 reason I brought up drones, it just feels like one of those things that it was like 10 years ago,

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.480
 whatever, when people got the first like consumer drones. And I just remember thinking like, man,

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.600
 someday they're just going to be flying all over the place and they're not. So I just wondered like,

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.960
 why is it just kind of a novelty? Is there a reason to own one as a person? Like, I want to own one.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:39.280
 You know me. I'm like a, I buy a lot of things. I'm a consumer at heart. I don't own one,

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.280
 but I have no reason to own one. That's the only reason I don't. I think for people in filmmaking,

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:49.040
 it's just totally, I mean, filmmaking in the loose term, like just people do. Yeah. Yeah.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.960
 Twitch streamers programming Twitch streamers? Okay.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:18:01.200
 Well, it's done here. I did have this thought where in every movie you've ever seen, there's

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.320
 always like an overhead shot. This is always overhead shots all the time. And what do they do

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.920
 before drones existed? Do they just like buy stock footage? But that's so much crazier. It's

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.560
 like so loud and it's like rent a helicopter to get this overhead shot. I mean, for movies, I think

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:22.080
 are you saying for lower budget stuff? I mean, even for a movie, it's like just to have like a

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:27.360
 three second overhead shot to set up a scene. Yeah, they had to rent a helicopter and do that.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.000
 That's like, I mean, that's a lot of it. I watched all the Lord of the Ring special footage in high

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.080
 school. And I'm pretty sure that you still have to have a couple of thoughts. Yeah, right. Yeah.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.640
 Today, would they just do that with drones then, I guess? Yeah. Like, is there any loss of quality

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:48.320
 by using a drone? Probably a drone. I got my, I think I posted a picture right, my small rig thing.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:55.680
 Oh, yeah. It's like an iPhone harness thing. So we can just film stuff. It's so well thought out,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.320
 like, I mean, people in the podcast can't see, but this is like a thing to put my iPhone into and it

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:07.040
 like has like handles and has like a built in SSD in the handle. Oh, built in SSD in the handle.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.760
 That's cool. This thing is so up. Okay. So see this. Yeah. Like you can like quickly like reoriented to

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.480
 have like different, different angles and stuff. Oh, nice. And people can see this if they want

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.920
 to go to YouTube, by the way, our podcast is on YouTube. I don't know if you want to watch us.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:28.720
 Top of this handle right here. Here's what's crazy inside of it. You can open it like this.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:35.840
 And it has a SSD slot. Wow. That's pretty smart. That's a small rig thing, you said.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.720
 Yeah. Yeah. So I put that in there and then it plugs it to my phone and I just record straight

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.680
 straight to that. And that's pretty awesome. That like level of creativity is like,

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.200
 there's like a million little details in here like that. Like you can like, you know,

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.000
 the handles rotate so you can get like different angles. But the reason I brought this up is this

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.400
 is like in partnership with some guy named Renly. He's like an independent filmmaker. So he always

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.680
 like makes it, you know, he'll do like a two or three minute thing that he films with this.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.240
 It's crazy how creative they get like they attach this. They like create like a

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:16.080
 they want to like overhead chase footage. So they put it on like a zip line and they just

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.720
 let it go. And it follows the people. They'll like throw it over stuff. Like they'll do

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.800
 pretty pretty creative things. And yeah, it like comes out. Has anyone made like like a movie?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.600
 Like a like not a big movie, but like a movie with an iPhone? What did you do not see this

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:39.680
 the thing going around? Do you know that series that zombie series are 28 hours later, 28 days

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:47.520
 later sounds familiar. Okay. So is a movie or is a zombie it's a zombie original zombie movie

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:52.080
 28 hours later, which is like, you know, the idea is 20 hours after a zombie thing. Okay,

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.440
 that was 28 days later, which is like, you know, more time has passed. And now they're doing like

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:03.040
 28 months later or something. And it was going around because the whole movie is filmed on an

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.040
 iPhone 15. And I was like, wow, that's so crazy because it's it's not like an indie.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.600
 It's like an in the theaters movie. Yeah, it's like a hundred million dollar budget like something.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:16.880
 Yeah, what? But a hundred million dollar budget, right? Okay, the first thing I did was like,

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.240
 I want to see them using it. Yeah, I was like looking at pictures and I was like,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:26.720
 like, I can't find a picture of them using the iPhone. Then I realized that the thing they had

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:33.920
 in a tripod, which was this giant freaking device. There's an iPhone in there, but it's like, it

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:40.000
 has like crazy cinematography lenses and stuff on an iPhone. Yeah, yeah. There's there's some company

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.280
 that it's like thousands and thousands of dollars of gear on top of the guy. So it's like, okay,

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:53.040
 yeah, it was like, guys walking around, hold my phones like, yeah, it's not that. So it's not that.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.840
 So it's like, okay, like, interesting, you're basically you just built a camera, you built your own

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:05.760
 camera and like, it's still impressive. Like, yeah, I guess because it doesn't have like, I don't know,

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:11.440
 I don't know a lot about cameras, but like, I feel like how do you get the real depth of field

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.360
 without, is that just the lens? That's where it's weak. That's where it's weak, right? Because it

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:21.040
 doesn't have like a shutter and an aperture and all that. I don't know how the lens can still help

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:26.320
 with that. But yeah, there's there's definitely certain limitations of what you can do. And I

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:32.960
 watched a bunch of videos of the professional cinematographers like explaining how far they can

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.600
 go with the iPhone and like where the limits are. So people have broke it down. Yeah. And someone

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:43.680
 actually went and like, did a bunch of shots, like identical shots with both, and compared to it.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:49.840
 Yeah. And it's like, and even even he said like, technically, I'm gonna prefer all my camera gear.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:56.240
 But the gap is really small. Yeah. And he was like, especially going back to when I was starting

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.440
 out, this is like a million times better than anything I'd ever had, like earlier in my career.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:08.160
 That's why. Yeah. And the camera stuff obviously like looked better, but man, like it still looks

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:14.880
 very professional, the iPhone. That's wild. Do they even make like cameras that aren't really

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:19.040
 nice cameras? Do they make like point and shoots anymore? Is there any reason to buy those? Like,

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:25.040
 I would think there's no market if your phone has a better camera. I mean, that used to be a thing,

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.200
 you know, like camcorders and cameras that were all like varying price points.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:34.800
 I've been growing up. Yeah. Like a digital camera. I had a little like zoom out lens on it.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:40.000
 They'll remember the sound it made with the little deep sound when you press a button. Yeah.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.720
 No more doesn't exist. Doesn't exist. It's kind of wild. It's kind of wild to imagine like,

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:52.480
 life as an adult now without an iPhone or without just a smartphone, I guess. Can you imagine like

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.920
 navigation? That's the one I always think of like when we drive somewhere. There's so many little

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.920
 things. I've always been horrible at navigating. So that's huge for me. Yeah. Yeah. They were

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:07.360
 simpler times. Hey, we got an election coming up. That's exciting. Yeah, I'm voting for the first

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:13.680
 time my whole life. No, you're not. What? Yeah. Yeah. What are you 20? What are you talking about?

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:19.760
 Well, I wasn't this this and until like right after the previous election. Wait, what?

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:27.600
 Yeah. I'm sorry. How did I not know this about you? We're 113 episodes in. How did I not know

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:32.480
 that you're only like recently? It's confusing because I've been in the U.S. for

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:41.040
 25, 26 years or something. Yeah, but you didn't become a citizen till when? 2020.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.400
 Like how many years in? So like 20 years in to being here? Yeah, I could have done it a

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.800
 long time ago. I just didn't. Like I've had a permanent resident green card for a very, very

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.520
 long time since I was like 12 or 13. Oh, so it was just more like a formality. It wasn't like

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.880
 you were waiting in line for 20 years and then you found out. No, no, no. Okay. It's like getting

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.720
 a driver's license. The kids who are like, wait until they're 17. You're like, what are you thinking?

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:06.640
 Why aren't you driving? Yeah, it's exactly like that. Yeah. It's exactly like that. But I mean,

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:13.520
 to be fair, I did apply for like it did take me several years because one, I think this is right

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.800
 when Trump got elected, they slow, like the process is just slowed down a ton. Yeah. And they made a

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.600
 mistake and rejected my application. And when they make a mistake, it already takes them like a

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.120
 year to get back to you. And then it takes like so much time to like appeal it and acknowledge that

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:35.600
 the mistake and you know, all that stuff. So it took me super long. But when I got sworn in as a

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:44.000
 citizen, it was like during the end, it was like during COVID, like not like deep in it. So they

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.960
 brought us all into a room. And it was like, it was so weird because it was a giant room with like

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:54.320
 a grid of chairs, but each chair was like three feet apart from the other one. So we were all

00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:00.880
 just like sitting in like, Oh, because yeah, yeah, yeah. And the judge wasn't physically there. He

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:07.520
 was doing it over zoom. But what that meant was he could do, he was doing like three of them at

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.720
 a time. There was like the one in Manhattan and one in upstate New York and one in, he was doing

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:18.320
 three simultaneous that I'm like, this just, you just increase efficiency by three X minimum,

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.920
 because now there's a little in three places at once. Do they stick with that? I wonder,

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.160
 did they abandon that policy? It seems more efficient. Like why why it's such a,

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:33.440
 yeah, it's such a formality. Yeah. But you got to be sworn in as a citizen. I don't think I got

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.920
 sworn in. I was just boring. To be honest, I think every person should have to do that at some point.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:43.760
 It sounds kind of cool. It's like a moment where you're like, okay, I'll do it. I'll be a citizen.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.680
 And I'll be a good one. Yeah, they make you swear all these things. And it's so,

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:52.080
 it sounds so intense too. Like, you know, I love like dramatic stuff like that. It's like,

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:58.720
 I've, I like forsake any allegiance to any foreign prince. It's like, it's like that. It's like,

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.720
 it's really intense. I commit to doing noncombatant military duties because I actually don't think

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.200
 they like make you commit to doing military duties. Yeah, military stuff. They say like,

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.160
 they say you commit to doing at least noncombatant military duty. Huh, a little,

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:19.120
 little disclaimer on there. Were there any you had to think about? Were there any that you're like,

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.400
 oh, do I want to do I want to swear to this? They're like, you have to accept next JS as the best

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:32.880
 react framework, meta framework. Well, the one that gives you pause, the ultimate downside of

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:38.800
 being a US citizen is no matter where you go in the world, you owe the US government taxes.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.960
 I was going to guess taxes. I thought a moment there, I thought I should get to guess, but

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.440
 that would have been my guess. Yeah. Not every place is like that, right? Like, imagine you

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:52.640
 leave the US and you go, yeah, but America, if you're a citizen, like to not pay US taxes,

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.240
 you just have to renounce your citizenship, right? Which people do, like, there's like

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.240
 billionaires that do that. Yeah, do they just say, I renounce my citizenship. There's like some

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.680
 paperwork, probably. What is that from? There's something is that a resident of it where I declare

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:19.200
 bankruptcy. Michael Scott. Yeah. I renounced it. Did you hear me?

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.880
 So you were sworn in. I can't believe you've never voted. This is all like, like, I knew you

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.400
 weren't born here, but for some reason, I just thought you've always been a citizen. I don't know why,

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:35.440
 like why I thought you just got it. I don't know. This is news to me. The timeline of

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:41.920
 Dax and his citizenship. So you were a citizen of India. That's right. Right there. But, okay,

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:47.840
 here's another fine. Here's another fine dynamic. So the US does not recognize dual citizenship.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.960
 Oh, really? It's this funny thing where you're like, what is dual citizenship? It's just one

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:58.080
 country being like, ah, it's cool. You know, the other countries have to say it's, yeah, it's cool.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.600
 The US does not recognize dual citizenship. So you basically say, like, I, like, renounce

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:07.200
 any citizenship, whatever. But if the other country does recognize those, yeah, we're fine.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.040
 Yeah. So they have something called India is still like, you're cool. Yeah. They have something

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:19.040
 called an OSI versus in of India, which I need to apply for. And that lets me, you know, worst case,

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:24.640
 if something horrible happens, I can go, yeah, on property there or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:29.440
 Why? It's so funny to me. It's such an American thing to be like, we don't recognize dual citizenship.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:35.280
 Like, you don't need to. It doesn't matter. Like, if the other country does, and like, what do you

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.800
 know what I mean? Like, just like, but like, technically, what is your stance? Your stance is,

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.960
 you're an American and you shouldn't be. And that's it. You know, you shouldn't be half and half out,

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:47.840
 which I kind of agree with. Like, I don't, uh, like, I get it. I think that's maybe the right

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:53.200
 policy to have. If you're the country everyone's immigrating to, yeah, yeah. If you're the country

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.200
 where everyone's leaving, you're like, you'll just do whatever you can to so like have some kind of

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.400
 tie, right? Yeah. I was the indie people from India moved to the US, so it's good for India to like,

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:08.160
 latch onto them somehow. Yeah. You know how there's like a subculture for everything and like,

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:13.120
 there's people who are really into like every most obscure thing you could ever think of? Yeah.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.800
 Do you ever just like predict those? Or you just like, can imagine this whole thing exists,

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.080
 but you're not going to look into it. You just know it does. Like, I know there are people who

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.680
 compete with like, how many citizenships they have. I've never heard this before. There's,

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.520
 I'm sure there's a Reddit. I'm not going to look at it, but it's just kind of fun to think like,

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.120
 there's a guy that has like eight citizenships and he's like the record holder,

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:37.360
 just like the languages. Like that's very similar to like, I know two dozen languages. Yeah.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:42.800
 Yeah. I mean, if you're in Europe, because now they have the EU citizenship thing,

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.520
 which is so convenient. Like, I'm imagining how bad it was before. Imagine if you had to deal with,

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:52.640
 it felt like international travel every time you like left Missouri, just like a different state

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:58.320
 in the US. That would be tough. Yeah. Because I leave my state all the time. I mean, you left this

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:03.520
 week, didn't you? I guess I did. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I do travel a little bit. That was kind of a dumb

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:10.080
 joke. Yeah. I used to not, I think I was like 18 before I left the state of Missouri. Isn't that

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.480
 sad? Oh, you're one of those. I'm one of those. I'm trying to think of it. You never saw the ocean

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.680
 until no, I guess I wasn't 18. You were already an adult. You must have driven to Florida. No,

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.520
 that's not true. We went to Florida. I don't know what I'm talking about. I must have just,

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.120
 like, imagined myself as a kind of tragic story for yourself. Yeah.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:35.120
 I definitely never gone overseas. And I've only really gone. Wait, have I gone overseas?

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:41.040
 I've gone to Mexico. That's not over in a sea. I've never gone. I've never gone over a sea.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:49.360
 Wait, you're up. You've never been to. No, no, none of them. That's crazy. Have you been to,

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.640
 what other countries are you going to do? There's deferrals that go to Europe, like every other

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:58.080
 weekend. Yeah. I've been to Canada. I've been into the waters of Canada.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:04.720
 What does that mean? In Buffalo. Oh, like Niagara Falls? Niagara Falls, yes. The waters of Canada.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:12.240
 That's a freaking river. I've been to Niagara Falls, which is kind of Canada. And I've been to Mexico.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:20.000
 So that's it. North America. I'm, oh, I've only been North America. Wow. North American AF.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.200
 AF. You were like born in another country. You had to be sworn in as a citizen. That's amazing.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:33.280
 Yeah, I know. I had to swim here. You're so cultured.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:44.560
 There was, there's some tech stuff. We had a next conf was this past week. I can't believe

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:50.080
 we didn't live stream go over like live stream for that disaster last time.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.960
 That was it. Is it a disaster? I remember you couldn't figure out the layout. I can't

00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:00.160
 put ourselves way too much over. Yeah. And TJ was going nuts in the chat. Yeah, TJ.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:06.880
 What they announced? Well, what, what kind of new goodies do we have to play with? There was a

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:13.760
 slide in the keynote that had opened next on it. Oh, for real. Yeah. Oh, this is cool. They gave

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:20.560
 two open X contributors, $2,000 each. Wow. Look at that. Is that more than you've ever given any

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:27.760
 open X contributors? Not to turn a shade, but. Yeah, it's definitely more. Just. I mean, I believe

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:34.240
 you, but I'm not trying to like shoot you down. You guys are playing nice. You in versatile.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:39.840
 Sitting in a tree. Who knew? I know. Look at that. Who knew? They published SST examples and

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.920
 their repo and their docs and they're going to like publish. They publish like not just a like

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.800
 render Netlify like a bunch of examples. Netlify. I know that they're joining open X as well.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:52.400
 Wow. It's a movement. Yeah. So look at that.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.200
 It's like someone at Vercel was sitting in a meeting with some higher ups and they were like,

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.920
 have we, have we tried just like being nice to these people? Have we tried that? And everybody was

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:09.760
 like, huh. Yeah. And it worked. And then it worked. It's amazing for exhausting all of their options.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:15.840
 Yeah. They just went with this one. We're not going to win in a flame war. But what if we're

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:22.080
 just nice? What if we just like work with them? Cool. So that's that's going on. I still think

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:33.600
 next day sucks. I said to get that on the record. I know. I like want to do something with that.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:39.280
 With that still Drey. So I don't know if you know that, Dr. Drey. Still Drey. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:44.320
 Oh, yeah. Because because everyone sees me being nice to Vercel and they're like,

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:50.640
 like, have you changed? Like, what is this? Like, this is not what we're here for. But listen,

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:57.440
 I'm still me. I still think actually sucks news for babies. It's for babies. Oh, it's funny.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.560
 It's for literal babies. What's it like to be abrasive on the internet? I just couldn't do it.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:08.320
 I couldn't be. I mean, like, I can be abrasive, but I couldn't be like, openly in conflict with

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:14.480
 something. It was just hurt. It's weird. You can just turn off the app and it's like, it's like,

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:22.960
 nothing is happening. So that's crazy. It just is not real life. And yeah,

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:28.160
 I can be abrasive and just not open my Twitter. And it's like it doesn't exist. It literally

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.080
 just doesn't exist. So it's like this universe that literally exists in my pocket and nowhere else.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:38.480
 Okay. So that reminds me of like how I've not been on Twitter, really. And something happened

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:45.440
 last night. So if this person listens to podcasts, I love you. This, I don't mean this in a negative

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:52.400
 way. But someone actually message my wife on Instagram, someone that I was close with in the past

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.920
 that I haven't kept in touch with. Just the whole conversation at the beginning of this,

00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:01.040
 where I just, I'm not bad at saying in touch. They were concerned about me. And the reason they

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:11.440
 sided was that I haven't been posting on X. I just thought that was so funny. Like they're

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.920
 concerned with me because I'm not posting on X. And I just think like, isn't that kind of

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:21.280
 backwards? Like if I were posting a lot on X, I feel like be concerned that I'm too online. But

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:26.320
 like, I don't know, he doesn't seem like he's doing okay, he's not posting on X. I don't know.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.240
 It's fun that the truth is exactly the opposite. I'm like, Adam's life is going well now. And he's

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:35.440
 just like, you know, he doesn't like need all this stuff anymore. Yeah, I feel like if you were

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:41.280
 to like chart it, like X, Y axis, the better my life is going, the less you will see me on X,

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:47.440
 I promise you, there's a future where I'm like retired and not doing anything technology related.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:52.640
 And I will never literally open the app again. And that's I think why I'm not really getting on it

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:58.320
 these days. It's like, I just have no desire to read any technical anything. Like anything anybody

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.040
 has to say, even you, I mean, I just like, it's not that it's not interesting. I'm sure it's

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:07.680
 interesting. It just doesn't interest me at all. And that's the only thing I have on Twitter. Like,

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.080
 I don't have any other circles on Twitter. They're like other types of content. So when I open Twitter,

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:16.640
 it's just a bunch of tech stuff. And I just don't care. I don't know what happened. I still love

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:22.480
 programming. It's my job. But for some reason, like, most of all, maybe this is bad for our podcast.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.960
 I don't know. Most all tech stuff just doesn't really do it for me anymore. I don't know if it'll

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:34.240
 come back. But for now, it's gone. I don't even see any. I mean, I told you, I've like shifted to

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:39.520
 read on me on Twitter. Sorry, right on me. It's funny because you think it's read on me. I know

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:46.320
 it's right on me. No reading, only writing. Yeah, I actually don't I don't really know what what's

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:52.320
 going on. It's not even like I don't I'm not interested in like recurring themes or anything.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.320
 It's just like normal stuff that like people would want to share because it's cool. Like,

00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:00.800
 they're working on this thing or this thing is interesting to them. It's just for some reason,

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:06.400
 it's really not interesting to me. And I don't know what happened and when like if it's because

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:11.040
 I always imagine like there's lots of developers that don't get on Twitter. And they're just like,

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:16.960
 they don't read Hacker News. They just like their job, but they don't necessarily like obsess or

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.440
 dive deep on all that's going on in the world of technology. I feel like that's happened to me.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:26.800
 And I don't know what that means for like, I don't know. It means you've peaked out on all

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:31.360
 downhill from here. I've peaked. Yeah. I was thinking more in terms of like the podcast because I do

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.400
 realize like people might listen to us because they care that we talk about technology. I'm not

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.680
 saying I don't like to talk about technology with you because it is kind of interesting,

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:45.200
 especially stuff that's not like programming, more like just things and that affect my life,

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:49.680
 like how technology is changing the world around us. That stuff's way more interesting to me than like,

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.080
 I don't know. It's felt five is out. I'm like, I don't know. What does it feel like? I just

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:58.880
 don't care anymore. I just don't. Yeah, I actually it's funny because it's I think it's a combination

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:03.760
 of you don't care and they're it's hard for me to separate because I think I'm kind of in a similar

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:10.080
 place. But I perceive it as nothing is happening. Maybe stuff is happening and I just don't care.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.640
 Maybe maybe that's what it is. Maybe there's like there's not enough big changes. It's too

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.960
 incremental. And I'm just oh wait. Well, for me out, that's a literal thing. You weren't that

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.240
 wasn't like a made up example. No, I literally saw that when I opened Twitter. And it's another

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.680
 example of like, I used to care about this stuff. I used to like, I think I did see that a couple

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:32.080
 of days ago and I just didn't even bother looking into it. Yeah, I have no idea what it is. And we

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:36.960
 used to felt like literally it's all over the code base. I don't even know what version we used to

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:42.240
 be honest. I've become that person. I'm that developer that's like, oh, you guys, he's fine for

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:49.920
 coming. I just don't even know what's about five is. I'm sure it's great. That's the one with all

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:56.160
 the signal stuff, I think. Cool. Or runes or whatever. Yeah, so I was saying this to somebody else

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:04.560
 earlier this week. I've been on like a several year journey ever since I left Elixir to figure

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:10.480
 out my tools for the things that I build. Yeah. And I think that journey has come to an end,

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:18.000
 basically, like basically everything is solved where day to day, my pain point is like just

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.720
 styling and like making stuff look and feel good. And everything outside of that is very good. And

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.680
 like, I don't really have significant problems with it. So I think that's also contributing to my

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:35.840
 lack of interest. Yeah. Everything's like hit my bar and all the problems that I was looking to solve

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:41.200
 are basic. Does that make you want to build more things, like have more irons in the fire just so

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.560
 you can use your because I feel like that's a superpower to get to the place where you're not

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:49.600
 fiddling with your stack anymore. And you're not like unhappy with this part of your app development

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:54.720
 process. Like, I feel like I'd want to just build all the things. If I felt like, I guess you still

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:59.520
 have to do all the front end and styling and all that part that eats up time and cycles.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.880
 Well, that's actually that. That was a context in which I was talking about this. I was like,

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:10.000
 I'm way more interested in actually building stuff now than I am improving your process.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.800
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like things have gotten decent. There's like one or two things I still need to

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.680
 build. I keep begging people to build it, but no one will do it. Like a tool. You're going to

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.320
 you're going to give us a little inside scoop or you're just going to hold it to yourself.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.000
 I post those other day. The last thing I'm missing is a job library for

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.720
 just like the JavaScript ecosystem. Oh, yeah. We've talked about this before. So I keep being like,

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.000
 someone build this. Like if you build it, literally you will get millions of downloads because it's

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.240
 so needed. Yeah. I don't know. Are you going to build it? Are you going to build it? You're going to build

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.880
 enough conviction around it. Yeah. So I'm going to I'm going to do it. So I'm reworking the console

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:55.040
 right now so that it uses less AWS e patterns so that it can run in other places. If you want to

00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:01.200
 just help host it in AWS, but also in other places. Yeah. And the key thing that's missing is

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:09.120
 being able to just do async work without relying on SQS and the Lambda or something. Yeah. Yeah.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.200
 Well, hopefully it doesn't have code build, I guess.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:19.360
 I just need to general like event stuff like kicking off and having to do it. Okay.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:24.800
 So like I'm building something that it's going to adapter things so you can have it backed by

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:32.320
 Postgres for MySQL or SQS if you like, you know, have that available. Okay. Yeah. Cool.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:38.080
 That's one thing. That's like the last thing. It'll just be like an it'll be like an SST thing

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.960
 or it'll be like a desk. No, it's just going to be like a library. I'm like, I see we'll probably

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:47.920
 have nice support for it, but you can normal library that really should have existed. I don't

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:53.040
 know why. I don't know what people are doing. Like what the fuck you got to do async work like

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.840
 and you're not using like, what are you doing? Like we're fast tools, probably lots of them.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.280
 Yeah, I know every time I'm putting this up, everyone's like, why don't you just use ingest

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.920
 and then they link me to the ingest self hosting thing. And I'm like, I'm not fucking going to deploy

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:12.800
 this. This like three node architecture so I can kick off the two background jobs that I need to run.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:20.080
 Have you come up with a name yet? That's the hardest part of any new library or project.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:24.640
 I actually want to build it entirely using AI or like using AI in a very different way.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:32.240
 Because I want and I think I mentioned already, I try, I give a trial run of doing this already

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:37.440
 for this using bolt, which is like this AI thing that from staff.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.360
 That's at the payment. No, there's a payment company called bolt, the funny one.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.640
 That's a new product. Yeah, I need them to add a few more features. But when they do,

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.920
 I think I should be able to like build up because I'm trying to port an Elixir library.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:55.360
 Oh, okay. Like Elixir has their their job library, Oban was perfect. And I just want to port

00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:01.280
 it over and like support adapters. Yeah. And yeah, the L.M. was doing a great job at it. And I was

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:06.320
 giving it feedback on design things I didn't like. And yeah, I want to try building like like a

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.720
 real library with something like this. Yeah, okay. If you're taking any input on name,

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:16.080
 so if you considered Aragorn or what was his sword's name? And a real and a real.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.920
 It's taken in the military space, but I feel like on the consumer side, fair game.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:27.440
 And consider it and a real and a real. What if it's like and do you real?

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.040
 Visually? I think it looks like a fantastic name. When I read it, it sounds great.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.640
 Now I'm saying it out loud. I'm like, this is kind of awesome. Yeah. Yeah.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.960
 That's the thing about like coming up with the name. You have to have a domain that works.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.880
 It has to sound good and read good and look good. There are like all these fast SEO good SEO good.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:51.600
 Yeah. There's a lot of to I hate naming things. Oh, oh, I would have so many projects if naming

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:57.120
 wasn't hard. Yeah, the ultimate name is just a random sound that has never been before. Yeah,

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:03.200
 but then I feel like those just feel so forced to like because there's only like so many good

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:09.120
 sounds left to like a lot of them aren't taken because they're awful like like dork school block.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:15.440
 It is a new sound. You're right, but it maybe just don't. Dorff.io

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:20.400
 with a pH at the end, you know, it's like door.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:26.560
 That's not supposed to be a sound in English. This is not one we make.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:31.120
 Are you ever going to do another side project ever again? That's that's a great question because

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:37.040
 I have done so good at not having side projects. Like, I don't think I will because I mean,

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:42.080
 it's terminal side projects, terminal side project, like terminal is kind of my side project. I mean,

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:47.760
 like, I don't need anything else at this point. I feel like I'm my plate is full and I'm happy

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:53.920
 with both of them. They're so different. So like, I could just work on stamp used by itself forever.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.360
 And then when there is like something that needs to be done on terminal, it's this nice little

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:04.080
 refreshing like, Oh, go laying. That's fun. Forgot about go laying. Yeah, no, I think I'm good.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:09.760
 I write so much go. You write so much go. Oh, because like I see, see, yeah, I'm doing a fun

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:15.600
 thing. Did you see? Oh, yeah, I'm on Twitter, but you see that ghost. He's going to hit 1.0.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.520
 They're going to release it publicly. Oh, no, I did. December. Oh, everyone's going to have it.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.560
 I'm going to have to find it. Yeah, I knew that was going to be a reaction. I knew that was going

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:29.680
 to be a reaction. Oh, man, I love it. Yeah. So you said next month, what did you say?

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:34.080
 I think you said December. Yeah, they're shooting for December. But here's a cool thing that I didn't

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:40.640
 know. Did you know, go see is built as not an application, but as a library and an application?

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:46.880
 I saw this. That's how you talking with Mitchell about this on Twitter. I did not know that.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:52.000
 I didn't understand it. Like even seeing you guys talking about it still don't really know what

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.080
 you guys were saying. But I didn't understand it because he was like, it's a library. And he

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.200
 mentioned that you can use it to build a multiplex. And I was like, I don't really understand this

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:04.880
 split. But then when as soon as he said, it's a library and there is a front end for Mac and a

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:11.040
 front end for Linux. Yeah, basically the library, it's a terminal emulator in that like it can you

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:18.480
 can load a process into it. And it basically has an API being like, given a 500 by 400 screen,

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:24.400
 here's what each each cell should look like. So you can just take what it tells gives you and

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:28.400
 just paint the screen and you don't have to know anything about it. But the front end is just like,

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.840
 you know, I don't know anything about it. So that's good paint your thing. Okay.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:37.840
 But point B, he built a terminal emulator that's going to and he's releasing as a library too.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:44.560
 So okay, so he's most of the ghosty effort then in the library or the front ends. Okay,

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.160
 so the front ends are both because I'm sure the free want to like render it efficiently and use

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:55.680
 a GPU and all that. But the terminal like processing terminal codes and like figuring out when a

00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.720
 process emits this, like you need to change this cell and update the color and then all that stuff.

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:06.640
 That's in the library. Okay. And that's amazing because I'm using a very crappy implementation of

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.840
 that that I found and go and I found a bunch of bugs and I patched them for the SSC multiplexer.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:19.280
 And he made me realize like, oh yeah, I can embed ghosty. Yeah. And like, I'll start the process

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:23.520
 in ghosty and ghosty will tell me, oh, here are the cells. Well, here's what the cells look like.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:29.760
 I can paint that and go. So SST, the CLI would be powered by ghost. And that's why I tweeted like,

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.920
 okay, so we wrapped our form and now we're going to wrap ghosty. We're just like following Mitchell

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:42.880
 around. Yeah. Yeah. And did some more research and I found out that there's a

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.480
 another there's aren't there's are another C library called libv term that I could have used

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:51.280
 if I understood any of this before, but I might try that in the meantime. I love the just speaking

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:59.440
 to side projects. I love like Mitchell's path of like doing this big grand thing like terraform

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.600
 that's just so like influential in the industry. And then being like, now I'm going to work on a

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:09.680
 it was just a Mac terminal emulator and going like all in and it's like you just see people

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.920
 who are really good at stuff. They're just going to make good stuff. Like he made really cool thing

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:17.920
 and then he comes along and he's going to make another really cool thing like everything he touches

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.720
 is going to be good. I think this could be really impactful if it's adopted correctly because

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:28.800
 VS code, for example, has a really shitty they're built in terminal is like

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:34.720
 so much worse than the most of native terminals. Like I find there's so many SST

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:40.160
 multiplexer bugs in the VS code terminal, which a lot of people use unfortunately. They swap to

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:46.000
 using this under the hood. Could improve a lot better. You can build like a terminal on the web

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 using it. Yeah, that breaks my brain. I'm not smart enough to figure that out. Just all the

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.520
 words. It's like terminal. Okay, emulator. Nope. Don't know what either I'm are. I lost it.

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:03.920
 Like I can't really conceptualize most of these things and you're like multiplexer. Nope. That

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:08.000
 sounds fake. That's made up. Hey, use T mux all the time, don't you? I know. I know. I know.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.840
 And like, I kind of know, like I could have a conversation with someone and be like, yeah,

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:16.240
 I use ghosty as an emulator, but I don't really know what that means. I don't know what an emulator

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:22.160
 really is. I just know I could use ghosty or I could use iterm or I could, you know,

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.280
 alacrity or whatever. I know what the emulators are, but I don't know why they're called the

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:29.120
 emulators. Does that make sense? I was very confused about this until I worked on. I feel like

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:34.480
 there's so many layers. Seal. I understand this confusing. Yeah, because there's everything you

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:39.600
 just talked about the emulators, but then they don't actually do anything. You're running. What

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.320
 are the emulators inside it? Probably. Right. You're running like a shell. Right. How's the shell?

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:48.640
 How's the emulator? And yeah, I don't understand all the layers. Why are there so many layers?

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:54.480
 In the show, you spawn a multiplexer, but the multiplexer spawns the H sessions inside of that.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:59.520
 Oh, God. Stop. And then those start the processes. Yeah. I'm so confused. Yeah.

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:05.360
 Ultimately, I think the root thing is terminal used to be a physical thing. It was a physical.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:10.640
 That's why they're called emulators. I didn't know this. So it's like, they used to be the mainframe

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:16.800
 terminal. It's like a terminal station, like a place you could walk up to that's got access

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:21.760
 into the workstation thing. And when it had the width and the height, that was a fixed physical

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:26.720
 width and height. Oh, wow. It was something that you could resize and whatever. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.360
 And those terminals can understand certain codes. And you've come across this for the

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:37.520
 the test. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And see, and see codes. And see code. That's what I meant. Yeah.

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:43.600
 I'm totally tracking. I'm right with. Yeah. Yeah. So now we have emulators that

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:51.040
 interpret those same anti codes, but then they paint to a like any kind of screen using your

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:55.840
 graphics capabilities of your computer. That's why they're called an emulator. An emulator.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:52:01.120
 They're emulating that physical terminal. Okay. That's cool. Yeah. That's actually pretty cool.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.320
 Yeah. And all this. You realize you start just know how to emit and see

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:11.360
 anti codes. Yeah. That's it. Okay. And that's what our company does. And that's why it's called

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:18.960
 terminal. Yeah. And terminals have two modes. Wait, what? And two modes. Insert and edit. No.

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.480
 All right. I forgot what the normal. Is it called normal mode?

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:27.600
 I don't know what the normal mode's called, but I know the fancy mode is called raw mode.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:33.200
 And that's what we use. Wait, what? There's raw mode in raw mode. Have you ever had your

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.880
 terminal like something crash and like nothing the terminal is working? Like it's printing all

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:41.200
 as we're characters and like, yeah, you're trying to hit buttons, but just printing like weird codes.

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:47.440
 That's because a process put that terminal in raw mode. But then in raw mode before it could reset

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:56.480
 it. And raw mode to do all kinds of crazy stuff, like repaint stuff and like go over stuff interesting.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:01.360
 And that's what we use for like a terminal that shop. It's in raw mode. It's in a very,

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:06.560
 very educational episode of tomorrow. You told me you weren't interested in tech anymore. I gave

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:11.520
 you the most boring information about all this. What's talking about terminals and emulators?

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:16.320
 That sounds interesting. It actually kind of is. All right, I got to get up here. I got to get my

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.760
 kid off screen time. I'm soloed adding. So if you've been listening to this whole episode,

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.040
 just think my kid's been watching a screen the whole time. I'm a terrible parent. I'm so sorry.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:27.760
 He's watching our last episode. Maybe that would be that would not be very good for a kid. He would

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:33.200
 not enjoy that now. He's five. All right. Okay. Whatever. You're fine. Whatever. Tough crowd.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:39.680
 Okay. I'll see you next week. Yeah. All right. See you next.

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:54.640
 Yeah.
