WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 Because every minute of a conversation is so entertaining so just want to make sure it's all captured.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.840
 You don't want to talk to me unless it's on recording, it's interesting.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.480
 I didn't mean for that to be on the recording.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.800
 How you been?

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.720
 I've been good. I mostly want to hear about how you've been because you had TwitchCon this.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.800
 I did have TwitchCon this weekend.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.080
 I couldn't tell.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.320
 Yeah, I was going to say your voice sounds a little messed up.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.520
 I don't even think it's from yelling, which there was like one night at the casino where it

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.960
 felt like everything was really loud and you're screaming like the bar setting.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.840
 But I think it's because everyone in Vegas smokes. I'm pretty sure it's a requirement.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.280
 To be a Vegas citizen or traveler they're in, it's awful.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.320
 Why do people smoke? I don't understand. Have we ever talked about smoking?

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.640
 No, we haven't. I don't get that because I think we're definitely in the generation where

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.560
 it fell off as a thing that a lot of people do.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.600
 So it just seems super weird to me to develop that habit.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.320
 Yeah, it's still a thing people do and our generation too.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.360
 But I agree. We all were the ones that knew like, "Oh, smoking is bad."

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.440
 They finally got rid of smoking. Yeah.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.800
 But why? There are friends in our group and I won't name names.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.720
 Well, we saw a picture. We saw a trash with a cigarette.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.480
 At the whole time, the whole time prior to TwitchCon, he just kept being like,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.840
 "I know I'm going to smoke a bunch of cigarettes."

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.000
 So that's why he only smokes when he travels, which cracks me up.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.400
 How do you have the most addictive habit ever for a few days and then go home and then never do it?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.720
 I don't understand. Yeah, I mean, I get that.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.760
 It's like me and me and Liz have this joke that stuff doesn't count when you're traveling.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.680
 Okay, so I am the same way.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.000
 Just I think smoking is this other level for me.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.360
 Oh, it's like one more level, yeah.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.280
 But when I travel, I eat whatever.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.800
 I don't care. I feel awful because of it and I wish I didn't do that.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.680
 But yeah, I don't think about like sleep habits or exercise or I'm just like...

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.920
 It doesn't count, it literally scientifically does not affect you.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.880
 Except it does affect you.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.160
 Man, I feel awful.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.360
 My voice is like... I'm pretty sure just secondhand smoke.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.000
 Like, I am basically a smoker at this point.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.080
 My lungs are probably black, I don't know.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.520
 And in the sleeping, there was one night, which I try like...

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.320
 I've not gone to a lot of things.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.480
 I guess this is like my third conference.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.640
 Is that right? Yeah.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.400
 But I think each of the conferences, there's like one night where I go really hard.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.880
 Yeah.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.760
 But then I like act like I'm 25 again and party.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.520
 There was one night and I think we slept like three and a half hours that night.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.400
 And then we're up doing the thing the next day.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.480
 It's just not good for you.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.160
 All the food I ate.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.280
 But then it's the same time nobody eats.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.960
 Like the whole conference day, you're in this big building that's very hard to get to anything.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.640
 And mostly everybody just kind of acts like no one eats.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.600
 I don't know, it's weird.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.160
 Which is why I think as crazy as Vegas is,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.400
 I don't think it's the best place for a conference

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.000
 because everything is so difficult.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.080
 You can't just like on a whim go do something unless you're like,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.640
 I'm just going to go eat the same place every single day for every single meal.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.200
 Because you can't like traveling around the strip is so hard.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.480
 It's a nightmare.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.800
 It's even worse right now because we're doing this F1 race in like a few weeks.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.560
 And so they're shutting down parts of the strip to like build these huge grand stands and all this.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.120
 So I'm not even kidding you.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.480
 We were just like a mile north of the Bellagio.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.360
 But for some reason everybody wanted to gamble with the Bellagio every night.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.760
 I guess they have the best casino.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.320
 I don't know.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.200
 Like what there's casinos all over the place because we just like stay up here.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.280
 It would be like 45 minutes an hour to go a mile down the strip in an Uber.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.200
 And I guess we could have walked in retrospect.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.480
 But even walking in Vegas takes way longer than it should.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.960
 Like you think you're close to something and like.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.400
 It's just the zag around.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.200
 Yeah, it's forever.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.080
 It's just the night.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.520
 It's insane even when you're inside a building and you're just trying to get to the end of the building.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.760
 Yeah.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.000
 It's just takes it possibly long.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.760
 And they all look exactly the same.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.120
 Like having spent a couple of weeks now in Vegas.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.040
 All the casinos, the major ones, they all look exactly the same inside.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.840
 Like you could tell me I'm in any one of them and I would have no idea.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.520
 Like I would believe you.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.560
 I think it's because it's such like a thing to optimize that everyone arrives at.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.080
 The same conclusion.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.240
 Yeah, there's like no reason to do it differently.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.960
 It's like websites that all look the same.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.440
 They all have the same like gradient colored font.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.720
 Yeah, exactly.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.760
 It's the exact same thing.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.360
 And yeah, last time we were there, we were talking about how even the playlists they choose,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:10.240
 even like all of it is just if something can make you spend 1% more money at their scale.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.960
 And the number of people they have, it just becomes so worth it.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.640
 Yeah, they'll figure it out.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.880
 It's like the rate at which they bring you the drinks and like every little little detail.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.200
 Yeah, so you get drinks for free when you gamble.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.160
 I didn't know this.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.480
 And like I spent more on drinks probably than some people spent gambling.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.040
 I could have just gambled, got free drinks.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.520
 I don't know.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.160
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.280
 So it was fun overall.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.160
 Like it was three days.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.440
 It was it was fun.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.960
 Okay, so it should have been two days.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.120
 Melke and I decided on the last day that last day is totally unnecessary.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.480
 We had seen everybody, we had done everything we wanted to do, and we wanted to be home.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.040
 So I think trash was only there for two days.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.360
 He knew the the gig.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.280
 He got there and then he left early.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.320
 That was a good call.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.880
 But it was fun.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.080
 It was good to see everybody.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.040
 It was kind of bizarre.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.240
 Like the the first day at noon.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.280
 So basically like the first thing I did personally was a prime had a panel.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.480
 It was like non-gaming like streaming to non-gamers.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.880
 So it was a panel of like all kinds of different stuff.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.400
 There's a music guy and whatever.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.080
 So prime has this panel at noon.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.440
 And I haven't seen anybody yet.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.920
 And we all show up to this panel and it's like seeing everybody for the first time.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.080
 But we're all we set like right in the front two rows.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.800
 Like we took up the whole first two rows and we're just like right in front of prime.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.000
 And every time he said something, it was just like we're all just cheering.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.880
 It was just it was a bizarre experience to like all of the dent streamers are right

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.680
 here in one place.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.200
 We're kind of all seeing each other for the first time and primes up there on the stage.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.240
 Just like our hero.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.200
 It was just a good time.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.800
 That was that was interesting.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.720
 Yeah, it's a it's an eclectic group.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.880
 Just generally TwitchCon like not like reinvent.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.760
 So if reinvent is like a lot of people in suits, uh, TwitchCon was like a lot of people.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.280
 Different kinds of suits.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.920
 I had hair.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.600
 Yeah, different kind of cosplay suits.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.760
 It was yeah, it was kind of different in that sense.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.480
 It was fun.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.040
 It was.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.920
 I'm glad I did it.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.800
 I'm going to take like three days to recover physically from all my terrible choices.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.760
 But overall, yeah, happy I did it.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.560
 Wish it would have been there.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.480
 I think I had less FOMO than I expected.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.520
 I definitely had it.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.480
 And I was like, uh,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.320
 Was anyone even posting photos or anything?

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.760
 Like I realized I didn't post anything.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.640
 Not too many.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.240
 That's why I don't think it was like,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.160
 I think with some conferences, it just feels like that's all you see for three days.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.920
 But this I guess this is a small group of people.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.720
 Uh, because really just like the people that stream inside the dev world.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.320
 Yeah, there's like 30 of us.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.680
 I mean, we went to dinner one night.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.440
 We took up a whole like, uh, subway car, metro line car.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.640
 But there's like, are those people that like all stream or are they people that are like?

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.520
 Yeah, fans.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.240
 Oh yeah.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.840
 Dead streamers.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.320
 Yeah.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.280
 There's like 30.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.920
 30.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.560
 Yeah.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.520
 What the hell?

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.640
 It was intense.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.960
 And like, we spent a lot of time up.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.640
 There's like a partner lounge.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.640
 So that would be like a way to kind of like,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.080
 there's like eight of us.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.360
 It was like a smaller like, okay, just take a breath.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:01.920
 Yeah.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.560
 It was kind of quiet.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.240
 In fact, the last day, I think I spent man tired day in the partner lounge.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.240
 It was like the serverless thing at re-event.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.040
 Yeah, exactly.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.960
 Just like, I'm going to set in one spot.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.920
 I'll see people.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.960
 And then just go move.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:12.960
 Yeah.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.520
 Yeah.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:19.040
 It's funny because, uh, uh, Michelle, the one, uh, she runs React Miami.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.440
 Yeah.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.680
 She specifically brings up that dynamic.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.360
 And she feels like when a conference gets to a size where people feel the need to find

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.520
 the spot and not move, she feels like that's like a threshold that where you like,

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.720
 you've lost something.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.040
 Yeah.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.280
 Yeah.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.880
 So she's like, that's like her one of her, like, metrics or like of, are we,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.440
 for the way that she wants to do these conferences, like never want to get to that level.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:43.920
 Yeah.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.320
 Yeah.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.920
 And it's funny because it is such a common thing.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.760
 Like exactly what I felt at re-event and like,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.440
 and you in TwitchCon, like it seems like it just happens all the time.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.320
 It's just so overwhelming.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:52.640
 Otherwise.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.280
 There wasn't really another place to lounge.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.840
 Like it was the only lounge and I felt really bad.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.720
 Like when we would split off, like, we'd be with people that,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.560
 oh, they're not partnering or they can't go.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.360
 And there's not like a, another place to just go hang out.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.520
 It was like you're on your feet in the expo hall or you're in the partner.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.280
 There wasn't really, I mean, there was a session.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.920
 So people would go in and set it sessions and watch those, which the sessions were, I mean,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.040
 we went to, I think I went to two of them and they were just panels.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.560
 And maybe all of them weren't panels, but they weren't like conference talks.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.080
 It was like way more casual and it's just like your friends on a stage.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.880
 Was that better?

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.080
 It was so much better.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.720
 Yeah.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.960
 They should take that to tech conferences, panels.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.320
 Maybe they do, but it felt like everything at TwitchCon was just a panel of streamers

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.120
 answering questions.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.760
 Yeah, because I think, so React Miami is doing that second day,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.040
 the unconference thing.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.680
 And I think there's going to be some stuff like that.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.400
 I didn't realize how much less like cringy as a format it was.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.400
 Like the whole conference talk thing.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:50.800
 I don't know.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.080
 It's just worn out for me.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.720
 Like.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.000
 Yeah, the thing, here's the thing.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.160
 There are like historically amazing talks that I can point to,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.080
 but it's like one in that have like changed the dialogue and stuff.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.280
 Yeah, it's like one in 100 maybe at best.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.080
 So we're just like expecting everyone to like constantly be delivering at that level.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.520
 And it just doesn't happen.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.440
 And a lot of them are giving the same talks.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.120
 Just at the different conferences.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.680
 So then they all end up on YouTube.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.080
 It's the same one and like heard this talk.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.920
 Yeah, it's like contrived.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.240
 Was there anything else besides like, so there's the lounge.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.960
 There's like the panels, like they do other like events and stuff.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.760
 So there was like a giant theater where they did some like big,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.640
 like they had the big streamers like XQC.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.640
 And I don't know if Ludwig did anything.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:48.080
 We saw Ludwig like walking to the expo with a mask on like very, uh, sneakily.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.840
 But we were sure it was Ludwig for funny reasons actually rocks.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.800
 I was with rocks.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.000
 He just came for a day.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.560
 And he he was 100% sure it was Ludwig for just some hilarious reasons that.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.400
 I don't know if I want to say on the podcast.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.040
 Like the shape of his butt, like what?

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.400
 Yeah, literally.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:10.640
 So it did look just like Ludwig like, I don't know, something about like,

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.400
 I don't know if he like shaves his arms or something.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.760
 It definitely looks like Ludwig is just like a very clean individual

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.920
 with a giant mask covering everything but his eyeballs.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.640
 But then rocks said Ludwig's known for having a large backside.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.600
 And rocks turned around to check and confirmed.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:33.600
 Anyway, they had this theater where they did like just like funny events,

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.760
 kind of improv stuff with these major, like the big names and streaming.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.320
 Oh, nice.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.000
 Uh, I'm trying to remember the editing Emily or something.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.880
 What's her name?

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.440
 I don't remember.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.440
 There's like, there's a handful of them that were.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.880
 Oh, yeah, I've, I've seen her stuff.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.280
 Yeah.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:47.520
 Yeah.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.360
 How was the scale of it?

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.120
 Cause I know like reinvent just feels, I mean, that feels, they literally spent like a hundred

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:53.920
 million dollars on it.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.000
 A hundred million dollars for me.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.640
 Wow.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.280
 I didn't know that.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:57.360
 I think so.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.880
 Cause I was looking at the tickets and I multiplied just the ticket price by.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.560
 The number of people that go like 50,000 times 2000.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:05.440
 Okay.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.640
 Simple math.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.840
 Uh, that's a hundred.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.120
 That's literally a hundred million.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.920
 And I'm sure like half of those are discounted, whatever, but.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.880
 But I, I believe it.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.200
 Yeah.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.640
 I mean, just like to rent out the entire Venetian, like they do for reinvent.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.760
 I mean, basically, right?

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.920
 It's like the whole Venetian is just taking over.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.480
 Plus they have just like a, they like rent out every little space.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.440
 They can find like private events and stuff.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.280
 So obviously it wasn't at that scale, but they still feel like high end or.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.280
 I think I heard 30,000 people.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.160
 Did I make that up?

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.960
 That's a lot.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.080
 It felt very high end.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.480
 It felt like reinvent, but for like degenerates.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.800
 I mean, just like the Twitch spin on it.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.280
 You know what I mean?

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.800
 Like the huge display when you walk in the convention center was very impressive.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.320
 A lot of people just took pictures in front of it.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.960
 Because it was just like four stories and just as wide as the convention center.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.120
 It was just giant TV display thing.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.000
 It was, yeah, it felt very well done.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.760
 Like they clearly put a lot into it.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.160
 It's funny because it's also technically an Amazon conference.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.440
 It's just like, it's their thing.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.080
 They just love owning Vegas.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.520
 Yeah, I guess.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.000
 Well, because last year it was in San Diego, they said.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.200
 Yeah, which I would have liked.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.080
 I've never been in San Diego.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.720
 I've heard it's nice.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.360
 Yes.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.160
 Well, I'll tell you what, I heard from a little birdie that next year.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.440
 It might be back in San Diego.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.920
 I don't remember if I was supposed to say that out loud.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.080
 Probably not, but whatever.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:22.480
 Probably not.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.600
 But it came from a source inside, if you know what I'm saying.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.280
 So I'm pretty sure we're not going to be in Vegas next year.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.560
 So you might want to come.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.920
 It's funny because that's enough information for me to know who you got that information from.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:39.520
 You knew you know, don't you?

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.080
 Yeah, I know.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.800
 That's funny.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.080
 Okay, well, we'll keep it private.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.880
 Just us and our podcast listeners.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.080
 Which one we're not going to say it.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.280
 I'm not going to say it out loud.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.720
 I mean, I would definitely go.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.240
 The Vegas part was a big limiter for me.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.200
 Like the fact that it was in Vegas made it more difficult, especially because every single person,

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.680
 when I told them I wasn't going, they're like, what do you mean?

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.720
 It's only two days.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.000
 Like it's not going to affect anything.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.240
 And I'm like, it's not two days.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:10.160
 It's like the day before where I'm like getting ready and like getting the dog sitter and all that stuff.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.120
 There's the time there.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.560
 And there's a three days of recovery.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.480
 The recovery, yeah, assuming I don't get sick, which is what happened last time.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.480
 So I had COVID right before.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.840
 I mean, we're not right before.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.360
 It's been a couple of weeks since I tested negative, like not right before.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.000
 But I felt like going in, I kind of had this superpower that like, I'm not going to get sick.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.400
 Yeah, my immune system's been through it all.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.960
 I'm just going to have second hand smoke, black lung, and feel awful for a few days.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.920
 But yeah.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.400
 So I just wasn't able to tolerate that disruption for going to Vegas.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.360
 It's funny though, because you know, who had more FOMO than me?

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.960
 Liz had more FOMO than me.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:51.040
 Because after reinvent last year, she's formed like a really fond association with Vegas.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.240
 And she like wants to go back.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.200
 It's funny because it's literally like Vegas literally, I don't think is her thing at all.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.360
 But that week for her was like a really nice week because she would wake up,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:11.040
 go to the we work, work all day, then like meet up with us, have like a really nice dinner and like

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.840
 do like some like nice thing in the evening and doing that every single day for a week.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.360
 That was like your whole life.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:17.840
 Pretty nice.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.800
 Yeah, it's not bad.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:18.960
 Yeah.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.600
 It's hard not to enjoy that place.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.240
 Yeah, even if it's like your friends and we were there with friends.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.960
 So it was like, you always have people to hang out with.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:33.600
 So yeah, I think in her head, it was like some kind of high-end summer camps type situation.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.440
 You know, so the whole time I was, I was taking the wrong angle.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.400
 I could have just been trying to get Liz to convince you to come.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.040
 I was trying to convince you, but like.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:43.520
 No, no.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.080
 Yeah, wrong angle.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.840
 She just got the spouse and pressure on man next time.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.360
 Yeah, you normally think the spouse is like trying to stop you from here.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.440
 We have this funny relationship where she's like a hundred percent of the heat in this.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.800
 And if I ever go to her being like, do you think I should do X, Y, Z?

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.920
 She's always going to like overly encourage me to do it.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.480
 So yeah, usually it's like they like check you, but for me, it's like the opposite.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.000
 She like enables me.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.840
 That's how I am with my wife.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.640
 I think I'm that role because I just want her to like do things that she'll enjoy

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.000
 and have a good time because I know she doesn't enjoy a lot of her days.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.720
 So I think I played that role.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.240
 That's interesting.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.120
 So I like that to be like, okay, this isn't, we can't, we can't do it.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.200
 But next year, potentially, can I just say I chuckled when you said he missed

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.240
 like I knew what the word meant?

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.600
 But I don't know what the word means.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.320
 I still don't know.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.520
 Oh, he didn't miss.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.800
 It's just like someone that will just take all of life's pleasures.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.760
 It's like to them acts.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.160
 Like they're really all about enjoying like food and like, okay.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.400
 Those are from people like everything.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.560
 Yeah, fun people to be around.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.600
 I someone once I saw I read something that was like, I forgot what it was.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.160
 Someone was, I was like looking up dog beds for Zuko or something.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.560
 And someone asked a question where they were like, worry that their dog wouldn't be,

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.360
 wouldn't figure out how to like get on it and be comfortable in a certain way.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.120
 And someone was like, don't worry about that because dogs are the ultimate hedoneness.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.400
 And that line has been stuck in my head because it's so true.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.040
 Like there's no sense in them to be like, I should limit my pleasure.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:21.840
 Yeah.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.040
 Like if there's a way to be comfortable, they're going to go and do it.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.240
 They're going to do it as much as possible.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.720
 If there's food there and go eat it as much as possible.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:33.920
 Like like Zuko, what the door to our bedrooms open, he goes on our bed

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.720
 and he sleeps there because that is the most comfortable spot in the whole house.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.040
 He doesn't think like anything.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.720
 He's always just trying to maximize his happiness and his pleasure every single second.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.800
 And it's a kind of inspiring in a way, you know?

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.400
 Yeah, it is.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.120
 Like I feel like that's kind of like vacation mode for some people.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.600
 Like I do feel that way on vacation.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.000
 Like I'm going to maximize like we're going to just enjoy this.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.880
 But to not do that every day.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.240
 Yeah, I definitely don't.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.840
 I don't think that way all the time.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.680
 And you feel like, well, I can't.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.480
 I have to be a responsible adult, but maybe not.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.360
 Maybe some people just figured it out and they're just living life that way.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.320
 Like a dog.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.360
 There's a Ricky Gervais bit where he's talking about how he

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.600
 like gives his cat all these treats.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.640
 And he's like, so good to his cat and the people are like, you're going to spoil the cat.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.040
 And he's always, he's just like, who cares?

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.240
 Like it's a cat.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:20.960
 Like what?

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.360
 Oh no, the cat spoiled like what's going to happen.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.280
 Like it's not like trying to have a career or anything.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:25.920
 You're right.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.400
 Yeah.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.320
 There's no goal to try to get a real job.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.800
 It's going to just live off of your treats forever.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.040
 Yeah.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.200
 So it's like, who cares if you spoil the cat?

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.120
 It's a really good point.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:35.920
 It is a good point.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.360
 There's another word I didn't know that I just remembered.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.240
 I'm glad I looked it up before we got on in case it came up.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.800
 Did you see that Theo's tweet about the react leak?

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.360
 The taint.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.000
 Yeah, I didn't know what that word meant.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.520
 And I thought it was serious.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.200
 I'm glad I didn't get on here and like ask you like.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.480
 So what's the deal with reactate?

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.200
 I've never heard of this.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:57.920
 No, it is here.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.240
 Okay.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.200
 This is a funny thing.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.080
 Oh wait, it is serious?

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:00.960
 Oh, damn it.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.280
 Okay.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.520
 Here's what's really, really funny about this.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:03.840
 Okay.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.080
 What does everyone love shooting on?

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.440
 Everyone loves shooting on Kubernetes.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:07.920
 React.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.880
 Oh, Kubernetes.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.280
 Okay.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.680
 Everyone is always talking shit about Kubernetes.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.280
 Everyone's like, it's true.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.920
 Here, like everyone's talking about all the time.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.520
 As though they know what the hell it is.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.800
 And this topic is a great topic because it proves that everyone

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.880
 that's talking about Kubernetes does not know anything about it

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.520
 because the word taint was in Kubernetes.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.880
 It doesn't come from there, but I mean, they use it.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.600
 Yeah, like, I mean, the root const is like,

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.880
 we've all heard the word tainted.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.240
 Like, oh no, this was tainted.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:36.560
 Yeah.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.200
 That word.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:37.840
 Yeah.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.920
 So it's using a bunch of places like Kubernetes is one,

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.800
 like pearls, another place where it shows up.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.320
 But everyone is reacting to it.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.040
 Like, I had someone, I saw some messages today

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.560
 where they were like, what's wrong with Versailles?

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.080
 Like, are they trying to like bait people?

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.800
 Or are they trying to like create like some kind of like controversy

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.680
 by using this word?

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.000
 I'm like, it's just a normal, it's also a normal word.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.880
 It is a normal word.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.880
 And I wouldn't have thought it wasn't a normal word

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.720
 until I looked at the replies that tweet and people are like,

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.320
 glad I looked it up on Urban Dictionary.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.240
 And then I looked it up on Urban Dictionary.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.120
 And it has another meaning outside of meaning, but I knew.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.480
 So it's a real thing.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.320
 You're telling me that's a real, that's a real twist.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.440
 It's a hundred percent real.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.520
 'Cause Taint is a correct word for something like that.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.400
 We're a roller coaster.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.520
 You mark it as like, be careful with this thing.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.320
 Yeah, but listen, I am surprised

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.920
 that you had to look it up on Urban Dictionary.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.360
 This word has never come across.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.440
 I mean, I know the meaning of Taint, like the real meaning of it.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.200
 No, I've never heard of any slang.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.680
 No, never heard that in my life.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.640
 That's odd to me.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.760
 Is that a common one?

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:44.640
 I feel like that's like the first like 30-ish word I ever learned.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.920
 Are you serious?

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.480
 It's old?

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.280
 It's like old?

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.280
 Yeah, it's not like a Gen Z thing.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.080
 No, no, it's been long.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.280
 Oh, wow.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.440
 It's like before us even, I think.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.640
 I don't even really understand.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.160
 I feel like the thing that it describes is like a noun.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.440
 And Taint seems more like a verb.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.400
 I don't know.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.560
 It doesn't even make sense for that to be slang for that in my mind.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.040
 And I'm not gonna say it on the podcast.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.400
 People can look it up if they want to look.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.120
 It just feels weird.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.960
 It's weird because it's a noun and a verb.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.400
 That's what's weird about it.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.560
 Oh, oh, Taint is a noun, too.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.520
 Yeah, you can apply a Taint to something.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.560
 Okay, I see.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.840
 Or you can Taint something.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.880
 Okay.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.440
 I don't really get how that became slang for the thing.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.800
 Yeah.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.840
 I feel like it's appropriate.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.320
 I feel like it sounds exactly right.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.880
 Like it's like Taint's the human.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.840
 No, I'm not gonna stop.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.440
 No, it's just like the right vibe.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.880
 I'm not gonna put it into words,

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.120
 words, but words, but.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.160
 Words, I just can't believe that that tweet in the end,

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.760
 that tweet was actually real.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.840
 I thought it was real at first.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.080
 Then I felt embarrassed that I thought it was real

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.920
 because I thought it was not real and it was a joke.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.680
 And now I'm learning it in fact is real and I'm embarrassed again.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.000
 Just a lot of embarrassing things going on.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.560
 Well, did you actually read what the API does?

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.200
 No, I did not.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.120
 I just saw the O's tweet.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:08.320
 It's kind of interesting because stepping back and like looking at the positioning,

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.000
 they posted an article on, hey, I really care about security.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.080
 You should care about security too.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.080
 So here's like a bunch of,

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.120
 he's a whole article talking about React Server components

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.080
 and security concerns that you need to be, you need to consider.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.840
 So because they premise it with that, like,

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.360
 hey, we're here to talk about security.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.560
 It came across like, oh, here are some good solutions for these problems.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:40.000
 But it completely sidesteps the idea that we only had to invent these solutions

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.720
 because of how React Server components work.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.160
 So these are new problems that kind of showed up under the new model.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.440
 But it was positioned like, hey, we care about security.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.800
 But it's like, you create security problems and now you have to care about security.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.680
 We have to cover our tracks.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.760
 So I think that the APIs that came up with are fine.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.800
 I think that article makes sense and I think it's a decent solution.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.680
 But damn, it is, I was looking through and I was like, wow, this is like complicated.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.720
 Oh, really?

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.640
 Do you understand it where you could explain?

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.640
 Yeah, so I mean, the rough idea is you have the magic that they added

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.440
 was basically auto capturing state so that you can,

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.600
 it feels like you're triggering a server function from the client, right?

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:27.120
 So you can write a function on the server and the client can trigger it.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.880
 But HTTP is a stateless protocol.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.480
 So any arguments that need to go into that function need to be sent

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.240
 down to the client first and it could back up.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.480
 If you have a variable outside the function and the function uses it,

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.040
 like you can't just run the function without that variable.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.320
 It's outside of it, right?

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.960
 So what React does is it'll capture all the context needed and like serialize it down

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.240
 and then send it back up.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.240
 So they like encrypt that now.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.720
 So like the payload that comes down is like junk and you send it back up against encrypted.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:00.640
 Okay, it's that plus the idea that you're like passing something that's like a server-only client,

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.040
 but that might have that might have like a child that's a client component.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.080
 You might pass and the user object and the user object might have a password field

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.000
 and then suddenly it has a password field.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.280
 So there's like all these scenarios that come up and they talk about

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.200
 some stuff they do to automatically mitigate it like that encryption one is one example,

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.680
 but then nothing really stops you from accidentally passing through something you weren't supposed to.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.720
 Yeah, so they have this whole Taint API now.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.080
 And this is like, I wouldn't say this is the primary way to do this,

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.600
 but this is like kind of like a good guard rail system where you can say,

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.760
 okay, process.env, I'm going to taint that object.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.920
 So if you ever write code that tries to pass that down or anything in it down,

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.240
 it'll throw an error.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.480
 But that only works for stuff that's passed by reference, right?

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.600
 So now if you like want to taint a specific string that's like,

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:53.680
 you have to compare the unique value of the string again, like very complicated.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.720
 It works the solution, but again, it's one of those things where I'm like,

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.760
 if you if you've gone to this level of complexity and like dealing with this level of problem,

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:08.480
 I feel like the underlying design prioritized the wrong things that autocaptor stuff is cool,

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.800
 but now you have all these like other things that are open up and other things you have to

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:19.280
 concern yourself with. I feel like requiring people to be a little bit more explicit

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.000
 in a bunch of places to avoid this entire class of problems.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.080
 I think that's what I would have leaned towards.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:29.520
 Yeah, so that was the article and that kind of goes to that and more and that.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.560
 It's pretty easy to understand.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.200
 And when I said it's complicated, I didn't mean that it was hard to understand.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.880
 I just meant that like there's so many new things you have to think about

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:43.680
 and to be a good react engineer, you now have like a whole set of new gotchas and tricks and

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:48.320
 awareness that you're going to have to teach people. People learn it. It's not crazy hard.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.120
 It just definitely feels like stuff continues to get more complicated.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.200
 And I don't know what we got from it, really.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.880
 Like TRPC already lets you feel like you're calling the server from the client.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:11.280
 And this is maybe like a 10% improvement in terms of API with like a whole set of new problems.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:17.200
 Yeah. Did TRPC just sort of like fade out a bit with the whole RSC movement?

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.240
 Like does it come into play at all with the new?

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.080
 I think that's a question, right? So I think the reason they launched this launch,

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.960
 they released this article is because they merged server actions into React Canary.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.440
 This is like a whole, I just said a lot of words there and it's very confusing.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.800
 What does emerging into React Canary mean? You think you hear the word canary and you're like,

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.080
 that means it's prototype leading edge, not for production.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:50.880
 But now they're definitely canary is like it's for production for frameworks to adopt.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.320
 So they merged server actions and I was at people like,

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.760
 I've talked to a lot of people that don't like this model. Like they don't believe it's stable

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.800
 and it's in Canary, which I get. Next year's implementation of server actions can be considered

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.720
 stable or production ready. So this is now an all like a direct alternative to RPC.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:11.920
 So you can like not use your PC now. I think that's kind of why if you look at their numbers,

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.480
 I'm sure it didn't like fade it off. I'm sure that like you're probably like continuing to grow

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.840
 like more from the discourse standpoint, just so it just hasn't been talked about as much because

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:26.000
 there's a question of like, is this can this is continued to be needed? Yeah, until what degree?

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.720
 Interesting. I'm not super sure. It's a meteoric rise. Like

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:38.160
 feel like TRPC blew up so fast. And then and then yeah, all the RSC stuff, all of the

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:44.960
 murkiness around next JS roadmap and all that. Yeah, sort of like quieted the conversation a bit.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:50.160
 Yeah, that's a challenge when you build on top of and like obviously TRPC is not put on top of

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:58.080
 next JS, but it was a good common way that people use it. Yeah, like one day it's happened to Blitz,

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:03.520
 also remember Blitz JS, I was like built on top of next. It's just hard to make it just build that

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:10.000
 thing or they can cannibalize you. Yeah, exactly. So it's Shopify. Don't build Shopify apps and

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.200
 become successful. That's what I hear. They'll just build it themselves.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:21.680
 Can I bring up a topic that's related to the Vercelle and react all this stuff that I don't

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.000
 know how to talk about this? I don't know how to have this conversation, but I just so badly

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.680
 want to get some thoughts out. I feel like I've said a lot of negative things about the Vercelle

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:39.680
 camp to the point that like, well, they're so they're having next JS comp and like everybody's

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.840
 going. Everyone that was just a Twitch con is like, I'll see in a couple weeks in San Francisco.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:48.480
 And that feels bad. It feels bad to be like, I'm not going to next JS comp. There's no way I'd

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.280
 ever go to next JS comp because I'm like an enemy of next JS in Vercelle. And I don't want to be an

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.880
 enemy of anybody. That's what I'm trying to say. I don't know how to have this conversation because

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:02.000
 it feels weird. Like, I wouldn't go if they invited me because I'm not going to travel twice in two

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.280
 weeks. My wife would kill me. I would go in a perfect world where I'm a hedonist and I just

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:15.120
 maximize pleasure. But like, I don't want to be like, I've made some like negative comments about

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:21.760
 react even like, I just realized like, I have like, I have like enemies in tech and I don't like it.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.400
 I don't want to have enemies. This is a peace offering.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:30.400
 I think that you can look at it another way, which is your sense around that is maybe magnified

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.800
 because I'm sorry about these people in person. I think if you feel that way, I should feel that way

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.840
 times too, maybe we get you should. Yeah.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:49.040
 And I don't think I would have an issue going to next JS comp like, yeah, I mean, you go to react

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:54.480
 Miami. So I mean, you don't have a total issue with. Yeah. And I like talk to people that work at

00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:04.000
 Vercel. Like it to me, it's just kind of like, there is some level of awkwardness because we genuinely

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.640
 believe certain things and we generally push certain ideas forward. Yeah. But if you step back,

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:14.640
 you can also recognize like, there is just this game and you game forces us to do that. Yeah. And

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.520
 we can like all participate in it, but still recognize that we're all just like players in it.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.920
 And it doesn't have to. Yeah. No, that makes sense. And as you said that, like you talk to people at

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.080
 Vercel, there's a lot of people I love at Vercel. I've got like what I would consider friends for

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:33.440
 sure that work at Vercel, and I forget sometimes that I've like, I don't know, publicly just said a lot

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:39.280
 of like, not mean things about Vercel, but just like anytime somebody takes themselves so seriously,

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:45.920
 and I feel like the Vercel brand, not any one individual, but like the brand is so serious. It is so like

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:52.640
 self-important or something. Anytime I see that in anybody or anything, I just do want to poke at

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:57.840
 it. Like I should be like pop the bubble. Yeah. Yeah. So I do feel like I've said a lot of that

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.400
 kind of stuff, but then I remember like, Oh, he works at Vercel. I love him. Yeah. I feel like

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:07.920
 we're close or I'm like, I'm on the same team, but then I don't want to be like at the company level.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.720
 Yeah. Maybe I'm blowing it up in my own mind. I'm like making this a big problem is no,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.160
 I get the feelings. I have thought the same thing. I was like, would I go to something like

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.480
 next conflict would be awkward and to some degree, maybe a little bit, but I just told myself is

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:26.400
 probably just inflated in my head. The company that I think I have, maybe the most positive version

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.120
 of this relationship with is Clerk, because I'm just like, brutally making fun of them for everything

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:37.520
 that they do. But I don't think anyone is like upset with me or anything. No. Yeah. Yeah. I feel

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:42.720
 like I've like with Jeff and I'm domed there. Like I feel like I have a lot of people. I really

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.280
 enjoy it, Clerk. Well, Dan's there. I mean, there's, yeah, did you keep hiring everybody?

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.280
 So more and more friends are going to work at Clerk. But I do feel like I've said a lot of like,

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.000
 I don't know, just like making fun of their marketing strategies and everything else.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.280
 Just like they are everywhere. And I'm going to stop now because I don't want to say more.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:06.080
 But yeah, I love it. Just do it. I love that. Just say that.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.480
 The tech conference industry is being single handedly held up by Clerk.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:16.000
 It really is there. They're on top of it. No, that's a good point. So that's a much lighthearted,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.880
 a more lighthearted version of the Vercel thing. I think like even Guillermo, I feel like I've

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:26.800
 poked a Guillermo a lot. I look up to Guillermo so much. He's like embodies so many things that I

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:33.040
 wish I were, like how regimented he is and just how particular and I personally am a huge fan of

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:37.120
 like high quality and like perfectionism and like all these things. It's a lot of the same traits.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:42.240
 Maybe that's why I do it. Maybe it's like Guillermo is the better version of me.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:47.440
 And I just I poke at him because I know he's reached levels I'll never reach. Maybe that's it.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.840
 This is good. I don't feel that right. I don't think he's a better version of you.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.760
 I definitely see the similarities, but you know what I'm saying? Like I just realized like,

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.400
 oh my god, this is on the middle of I'm learning it as I'm saying these words,

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:05.280
 that like I'm super into like the OCPD like everything has to be just right. And that's totally

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.600
 versatile. Why is my alarm going on? Well, so real quick, I think here's what I think about that.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:19.040
 I think that people believe in these like stereotypes or caricatures and not a negative way like the

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:25.360
 even positive ones and they kind of overly emulate that to get the thing that they want.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:31.680
 And that's what I don't like about some of the versatile stuff. I feel like they're kind of an

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.640
 exaggeration of a concept and believe that to be really obsessed with quality, to be really

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.960
 obsessed with X, Y and Z things, you're someone that's like so serious all the time and like so

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:46.960
 serious about everything. But it kind of denies this reality of like you can really care about

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.560
 those stuff and be obsessive to like an annoying degree. And also you can be like

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:56.560
 a different type of personality, you know. So to me, whenever I see someone lined up so perfectly

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.520
 with like a stereotype that's in the world that we recognize, I just feel like they're kind of

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.320
 faking it to some degree. They're like kind of, you know, if I act like that, then this other thing,

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.880
 then this will be, yeah, okay. I agree. So that's kind of what that's kind of what I feel like.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.880
 There's like a, I mean, like a stupid, the stupidest version of this is

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:21.440
 the Theranos thing with the Steve Jobs like Turtle Neck and all that stuff.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.120
 Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah, she does that.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.880
 Playing a character, right? And that's like the most extreme version of it where it was like

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:32.640
 so backwards. Yeah. But we all do this to some degree where we have like some identity that we

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:37.760
 try to emulate and hope that we somehow stumble upon positive traits from it.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:43.200
 Yeah, interesting. Now I'm just, my mind is racing over trying to think of who I'm trying to

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.120
 emulate or what I'm trying to be. I think, I think the thing you describe is accurate. Like this,

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.080
 the thing you describe, like you're, the thing you're emulating is gear, because gear most

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:57.680
 perfectly emulating that thing. But the point is everyone is emulating. It's like, there's a,

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.480
 there's a part of it that's doing, but there's a part of it that's like acting.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.000
 Okay. Oh, man, you've got, you've just got me in my head so much right now.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.720
 I'm just like, you said the word identity and I remembered like, I don't know what my identity is.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.560
 I'm just like, the point is you don't have to have one. And I think it's free.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.280
 Oh, that's the point. That is nice. That's a nice thought.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:20.080
 It's very natural to crave an identity and try to like be a thing. But I think the actual work is

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:25.840
 figuring out to live without one. But like you, okay, what I'm trying to get at here. And if you

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.960
 had something really important you would talk about in the next eight minutes, we can get in.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.240
 Okay. Because I just, I don't want to get into a therapy session. I feel like we kind of got

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.920
 away from that. And I wasn't like just constantly asking, well, we can bring it back. We got to do

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.360
 it all. Okay, we're bringing it back. Well, I just got back from TwitchCon. And it's like

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.760
 seeing people who have very strong personalities and just very like, they know who they are in

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.840
 life. And you're that way. Everything you say, I feel like it lines up. It's like, of course,

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.800
 Dax would say that. Like we've talked about, it'd be so easy to train like an AI Dax because

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:59.200
 you just give like a hundred year tweets and it would nail you to the team. Like you could just

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:05.280
 set that thing on autopilot. But like, I don't know. I don't know. This whole TwitchCon thing was like,

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.200
 when I got there, I realized, oh, I came to TwitchCon and I don't know if I ever want to stream or

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:15.040
 talk about tech again. Like, I just don't know if I care about this stuff. But I wanted to come and

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:19.680
 see all my friends. Like, I've made all these friends in this space and I was very excited to meet

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.800
 them all. But then it really is like the whole thing of TwitchCon is like, we're all streamers.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.480
 And it's like, I don't know. Am I a streamer? I don't know if I want to be. And then it's like,

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.400
 what do I want to be? And then it's like, I've talked about not wanting to do content at all,

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:36.160
 maybe anymore. I don't know. And then I don't know. It's just like, do I not need to know? I don't

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.920
 need to know what my personality is or what I care about. I don't think you need to have

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:46.400
 an identity that you can apply a very clear label to. I think some people do have, like I said,

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:51.280
 with me, I've said this all the time, whenever I take a personality test, it feels like the most

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:57.520
 accurate thing on the planet because I have a very like, identifiable thing. But it's just like a

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:02.240
 random thing. I don't think that's that's the part that doesn't matter. It doesn't matter that the

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.840
 thing I am or the thing that people are has like, a clear label on it. I do think the thing you have

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:13.520
 to figure out is like, if you feel lost to some degree, I'm like, what? Yeah, you're driving towards.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:19.280
 I think that probably is like a real concern. I think I think that gets pointed out when you're

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.160
 around people that have like, such a clear identity, but the identity part is not the part that matters.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.040
 Okay, so identity is not something that matters. But what I'm doing with my time

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:32.400
 does matter. And just trying to figure out, like, I really enjoy, I've enjoyed streaming.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.400
 Like, I have a lot of fun the moment I'm doing it. And I feel like I could do this every day.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:41.120
 And it's, I love it. But I don't like, I constantly then like, after a month, I ask myself, like,

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.960
 why am I doing this? Like, what am I trying to get out of this? And I have no answers. Like,

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:49.120
 I can't think of a single reason. I don't even know why I do a podcast. Like, honestly, I don't know,

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:54.000
 like, I don't know why I've done anything that you put into like the content bucket.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.440
 Like, I don't have any like aspirations toward it making money. I just can't imagine ever making

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:06.240
 more money doing content than I could just make if I didn't ever turn a camera on. Because I feel

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:11.360
 like I can make more money that way. So it's not money. And it's not like, uh, I've already made

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.040
 all the friends I want to make. I guess the friendships that I thought about that at TwitchCon, like,

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.320
 had I not ever streamed, I wouldn't have gotten to know any of these people I would have had no

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:23.840
 reason to. And I'm very thankful for the group of friends that I feel like online I've made.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.560
 So maybe that's all it was. It was just the friends we made along the way. That's like a saying, isn't it?

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:36.000
 There you go. You figured it out. OK, that actually helps me a lot. I think it to move that to like a

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.960
 more even like selfish place. It's, uh, to me, it's just about like creating opportunity. I don't know.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.440
 And when I say that, people might think like, Oh, like career opportunity. Yeah. But also just like

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.800
 any kind of opportunity, like, yeah, whether it's to make friends or to like have experiences. Yeah.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.880
 Yeah. The more stuff you have out there, the more stuff just comes into your life. I think, uh,

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:01.600
 I mean, a really great example of this is that podcast where we talked about how we're going to

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:06.880
 pivot, boo me and maybe work on this new thing. Yeah. I had so many people reach out to me after

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.280
 that about being like, I want this or here's what I thought about or here's like, you know,

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:16.960
 and that's really motivating. And that's amazing. And I would have never had that before. Anytime

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:22.240
 in the past when I wanted to, when I had an idea, the biggest barrier was, Oh, the world is just

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.640
 going to ignore this idea. How do I like push past that? But now like having like all these people

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.080
 reach out to me. It's because, you know, I've been able to put myself out there and allow for

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:37.600
 that kind of thing to happen. So yeah, I also am not like trying to make this directly my work,

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:43.760
 but for the same reason as you, like it's just not, yeah, like I have other ways that to make

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:50.080
 mind that when I enjoy more and to where I think more lucrative, but yeah, this is like a, like,

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:55.600
 a turbocharger for all that other stuff increases your, your opportunities set in life. It just,

00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:01.040
 I do, I think it was Alex to be told me about somebody who wrote about friend catchers. Have you

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.440
 heard of that concept? We were talking about that? No, but I mean, it sounds exactly what this is.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:10.080
 Yeah, it's like if you don't ever put out anything in the world, if you're not publicly

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.560
 putting yourself out there, then you're missing this opportunity to just like find that the people

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.520
 like you or people who resonate with you. But like you're putting every time you create something,

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.760
 you're putting out these friend catchers that like you're going to have people that you get

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.960
 connected to in life that you just wouldn't have otherwise. And that makes sense. I spent a long time

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:32.720
 10 years of my career not doing anything publicly. Same. And yeah, met nobody. I mean,

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:37.680
 basically just whoever you work with directly. So I see the appeal of all that. I guess it just

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:44.080
 feels like, I don't know, just like when I see the consistency, whether it's you or prime,

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:48.720
 like prime is just such a like a personality. Yeah, because that's going to be his job. Like,

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:53.520
 that is the thing that he's meant to do full time all the time and take that to whatever extreme

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:59.200
 and ceiling there is for that. But and I guess it's okay to just accept that like it's not my job.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:05.600
 I'm just like, I'm I've had some fun and it doesn't mean I have to stop doing this stuff if I don't

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:11.520
 think it'll ever be my job and still do it. I just have a different expectation around what it is.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:17.120
 I'm not going to have a strong personality. And you so it's still something you want to get better

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:21.200
 at and like continue to get better at and whatever, but it is. Yeah, because it's fun. And anything

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:25.120
 I do you want to do the best you can. It's the same thing as like Tugitsu, like you're not trying to

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:30.720
 one become a world champion. I literally want to become a world champion, but okay, that's okay.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:36.800
 If I never said that out loud, I really do. I want to like win masters at some point. Okay, that's

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.720
 the goal. I mean, it might belt. It's always at your own belt. Like you're, I always forget that

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:46.080
 it's at your belt and your age and your age and your size. Yeah, there's tons of world champions.

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:50.640
 It's still extremely hard. It's when like 10 matches in a single day, but I'm going to do it.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:54.400
 Okay, wait, wait, just rephrase it. Are you trying to make it your career or trying to make money

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.240
 from it? No, not my career. I mean, I'll never get a dime from it, but I don't think you have

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:02.480
 those feelings around it. Like, why am I doing it? No, that's true. I don't. When I think about

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:07.360
 Jiu Jitsu, I know why I'm doing it. It's like, I'm obsessed with it. The physical activity,

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:12.640
 it's good for my health. Well, I don't know. There's better. Better things for your health

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:18.240
 in Jiu Jitsu because you can get really hurt. But yeah, that's a great point. If I could just

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:22.640
 feel that way about, I never even know how to label all this. Is it content? Is it just,

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:28.000
 is that the word? I could feel that way about extracurricular activities in tech.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.560
 Yeah. Like there's my work and then there's all of this stuff. If I could feel that way,

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.000
 the way I do about Jiu Jitsu, I'd be really happy. So me and Liz were talking about this

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.440
 the other day where she feels like she has all these things that she's interested in,

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:46.560
 but it doesn't have a way to express them. And she's listening to Steve Jobs,

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:52.080
 the Walter Isaacson book. And she brought up how he was interested in so many things,

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:57.280
 like technology, architecture, art, aesthetics, like all these wide ranges of things that he was

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:03.840
 obsessed with. And from her perception, he was lucky that he had this. The thing he was doing

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:09.600
 could draw all of that. The Apple stores feed the architecture stuff. Obviously, the product speed,

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.720
 the aesthetic stuff, like the art and the technology. He saw like, he's so lucky that he had one thing

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:22.320
 that pulled everything. But I think that if you have a thing that you're able to really focus on,

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:28.000
 it always just pulls all your interests into it. So only thing that is missing is like

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.600
 having the thing that you channel everything through. Because we're talking about this

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.560
 content stuff. And for me, it's an interest of mine. I find it interesting to do, I want to get

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.840
 better at it. I find it fun. But I have a thing that draws that can draw that into.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:49.120
 I can channel that into SSC marketing. That pulls it out. You have that central thesis

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:54.480
 that I feel like everything runs through online. Yeah. And it's funny because the way it feels

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.720
 is, and I've always experienced this through my whole career, it feels like I randomly got

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.200
 interested in this thing. And like, whoa, what a weird coincidence. I happened to need that thing

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:08.400
 at my work or whatever. And it literally feels like the week after I discovered it,

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.840
 I also just randomly happened to need it. But what's actually happening is I'm like,

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.920
 forcing it in there because it is a genuine interest. And it does make sense to do.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.280
 But yeah, it always feels that way. It always feels like a miracle that my random interest

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.960
 shows up at work. But it's just because I have consistent work that I'm interested in.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:28.320
 So it'll draw everything in there. So I said all that. And like, I actually am going to stream.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.680
 Like, I want to stream more than ever. Maybe it's just because at TwitchCon,

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.800
 I'm going to be doing this stuff still. And I'm going to think about everything we just talked about.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:41.440
 But I don't have to have an identity. That's okay. Maybe I won't even do tech stuff. I've

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.920
 talked about this a lot, like not doing tech. I don't know. Like, what is a variety streamer?

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:50.240
 Can I just be a variety streamer? It doesn't matter what I stream and just talk and do whatever I want.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:54.080
 Maybe I'll do that. But like, look, you're already putting a label on it. What the hell's a variety

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.120
 streamer? It doesn't matter. Just do whatever you want. I just heard the word. Okay. Yeah, that's

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:02.160
 true. Just do whatever you want. Okay. Let people decide what category it is. It doesn't have to fit

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.480
 into some box for me. I'm actually going to start streaming again too. I like, realize the other day

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:12.800
 that I definitely felt more in sync with a bunch of stuff. And I have a hard time putting it to

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:17.440
 words, but I felt like this stuff just like clicked better when I like was constantly talking to

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:21.200
 people every day. It's a whole and it's a whole schedule. It's a whole thing that it kind of like

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.560
 introduces into my work. That's nice. A structure. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that is nice. And especially

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:33.200
 like working on SST, like I do remember every day I would stream, there'd be someone that would like

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:38.080
 talk to me about it in some way. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That was always that. That's like, it gives me

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:42.400
 sense of something that I think is useful. Okay. No, I have to get another call. I have to pee.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:48.720
 So it's a double whammy of hard stopping. All right. I was really thinking too, I wish we could like

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:54.480
 start, like, say bye and then keep talking for a while and just let it record. There's another

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.320
 podcast that does that totally unrelated to tech. But yeah, I'm done. I tried that. That's funny.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:03.280
 I think we always had such good conversation after we hit stuff. It's never on the podcast.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:09.200
 Oh, also, I want to say Jason came up to me. He's a listener of the podcast came up to me at Twitch

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:15.600
Con. That was really cool because as I said, in person, it's hard to know if anyone listens.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:20.320
 And he said, yeah, you say that on the podcast all the time too. Sounds like me. Yeah.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.160
 Say the same things all the time. Okay. Thank you, Jason, for coming up. That was so cool.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:29.520
 Okay. I'm going to go have to pee. Bye. See you. I'll see you next.
