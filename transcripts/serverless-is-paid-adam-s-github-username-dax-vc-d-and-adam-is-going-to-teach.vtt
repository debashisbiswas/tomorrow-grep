WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
 What number is this, 69? Oh, no. Nice. Episode 69. I don't even know what that means.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.200
 I don't want you to explain it to me. Okay. Yeah, I'm not going to.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.560
 Yeah, I've been seeing so many people post videos from those glasses. Someone that I know

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.640
 did like a Saturday drive, they live around me, did a Saturday drive and did like a beach thing,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.680
 like the same thing that we do pretty often. And it was like so crazy seeing it and like

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.840
 recognizing stuff in there from like that perspective. Yeah, that's really cool. I think I want to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.680
 get one. Yeah, get one. I just got one. This is the first time I've used it. I haven't looked

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.120
 into it at all. I've only seen the end result. Is that is it just one camera? I think so. I believe

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.680
 so. Is it right here? Yeah, I see a blinking and then what's on the other? That's the that's

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.560
 the like a status. I think the other side is the camera. I see. Yeah, yeah. I can't secretly

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.800
 record people. Yeah, I've never worn glasses in my office with my lights on and stuff. Big glare.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.280
 Turns out. How do people how do people do that? Well, wait, first of all, are those like see like

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.360
 eyeglasses or those sunglasses? They're sunglasses, but I got them clear. Do they wear them indoors?

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.160
 And I'd feel like an idiot. No, they don't transition. They're just always clear. Oh, you can have

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.960
 well, you can have always clear sunglasses at work. I guess I don't wear sunglasses. I don't know.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.200
 Like, will they still block harmful sun rays from my eyeballs? I know I need I need you to go outside

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.000
 and look into the sun right now with this sunglasses. I'm just kidding. Look at the sun.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.640
 Actually, you're supposed to start your day looking at the sun. It's good for your circadian

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.800
 rhythm. Okay. I know way too many Huberman things. Why do I feel shameful knowing Huberman things?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.320
 He's just like a scientist and he shares like science. That's good. Why is it bad? I don't know

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.840
 who he is. I have no idea. I've never come across him. I only see people reference him. I hear you

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.440
 referencing a lot. Yeah. And so I just want to make fun of it. He's like a research scientist at

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.960
 Stanford, or maybe he's not a researcher. Maybe he's a professor. He's a professor or something.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.360
 I don't even know what he is. But he's really smart. Okay. And he references ways that science

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.960
 can help you in your day every day. I want to look into the sun. I don't know how smart he is.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.640
 Not look into it, but like get the if you heard this. Okay. I like know all of his advice because

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.440
 it just comes up so often. And that's why it's easy to make fun of. It's it comes up so often.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.840
 Is it the demographic of people that have latched onto it? Is it bros like me

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.760
 that have gotten a hold of it? And that's why it's shameful. Is that why I feel bad?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.400
 It's not shameful, but I'm just always going to make fun of people thinking about their life in

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.040
 this way. It's just too easy. You know what it is? It's just trying hard. Whenever someone's trying

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.200
 hard. It's trying hard. Yeah. You like to poke at people that try hard. Yeah. Yeah. I guess everyone

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.280
 does. I just realized I'm live on Instagram to no followers, but they won't hear you. So this is

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.160
 kind of pointless. I guess at least they got a little inside look at what it's like to be a

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.280
 tech bro in 2023. Did you have to title this stream? Yeah, I got the titles tomorrow.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.520
 Is that why you titled it? What stream? Oh, I don't think Instagram's I don't know if

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.280
 Instagram live gives you a title. Oh, I see. We're telling your followers you started a live video.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.840
 Well, thank you, Instagram. Okay, I'm going to end this thing and take off my glasses now.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.560
 Are we streaming on Twitter? Yeah, we are. I didn't have. Wow. Last time we had a very

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.880
 clickbaity title. And this time I just did some engineering. So we'll see what the difference is.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:06.080
 It's talking to me. Wait. Oh, because it has speakers. Oh, it has speakers. I don't know if

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.440
 it actually has like, does it have AR stuff? Like, is it going to ever like do stuff? So right?

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.600
 There's like, those are like normal screens. So what did you get them for? Like, is you

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.400
 was there like a specific purpose? Why do I get anything, Dax? I don't know. Just to mess with it.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.640
 I have an aura, an aura ring now. Oh my god. You have an aura ring. I recommend them.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.680
 No, I don't know. It gives you sleep tracking that like, I don't wear my watch when I sleep.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.320
 So it's really nice to see like a lot of data on my sleep. Yeah. I was working out more.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.840
 I used a whoop. I use that for peers. Yeah, whoop, whatever. Yeah. I have a neighbor who is also

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.520
 into all the things that I'm into like, Superman and whatever. He's got the same cold plunge. He's

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.680
 like, I mean, literally, like, I've just copied him in every way, I guess, in life. And he uses a

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.720
 whoop and an aura ring. I'm like, why do you use both? That's too much data. I think.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.600
 What was pretty cool? It's kind of a company that I wish I came up with. It seems fun.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.160
 There's a lot of companies like that for me. Yeah. I wish I came up with Google, Apple.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.680
 Those are boring answers, Adam. Be more interesting. Okay. SST.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.600
 That means. Well, I didn't. Okay. Yeah.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.640
 Okay. So I feel like we have a lot to talk about. We have too much to talk about.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.640
 Before we talk. Yeah. Can I just say I'm going to be very talkative? I have had caffeine in today.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.240
 Nice. I haven't eaten in 40 hours. I'm on a 40 hour fast.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.000
 These are getting fat. No, I'm cutting for another competition. I wasn't aiming for 40 hours.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.240
 I was aiming for 36. But then like you get into it and you're not hungry. It's like, I feel like

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:53.120
 I could never eat again. Is this the one Atlanta you're going to? Yeah. Yeah. It's in like 20 days.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.760
 Oh, wow. Yep. Well, I mean, it sounds so dumb to be like traveling to Atlanta for a white belt

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.280
 tournament. But Casey's family's in Atlanta. It's right around Thanksgiving. We haven't been there

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.480
 in a couple of years. We want to go visit anyway. So it just kind of all works. It's like an excuse

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.720
 to go there. Yeah. Okay. So yeah, we have a lot to talk about. Sorry. Go ahead. I'm just going to

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.720
 be talking really fast. Well, yeah, let's start because I don't. I feel like we have so much to

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.600
 talk about. It's stacked on top of each other. Made me forget what we have to talk about.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.680
 I made a list actually. I've never made a list of things I want to talk about.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.880
 Oh, so prepared. Should we let's start with like,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.080
 interesting stuff, maybe? Good, boring stuff. Why is there boring stuff on your list?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:40.880
 I mean, like tech-ish, like things that people might care about. And then we can just do the

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.200
 stuff we normally do, which is whatever. The serverless framework is a paid thing now. I don't

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.280
 actually know. I didn't see the announcement. So I need you to tell me, first of all, what happened?

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:59.040
 You have to pay to like continue using serverless or what? Yeah, I mean, the post was pretty and clear,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.000
 but the parts that were clear is they're going to come out with serverless V4. They're on V3

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.840
 right now. I think V4 is going to come out next year. So it's not like happening today or anything.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:17.920
 V4 will be paid, but only for customers that have more than $2 million a year in revenue.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.920
 Okay. I never liked the revenue-based numbers. I feel like those are

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.840
 so those range so widely for certain companies. Like there's companies that can be making $2

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.480
 million and still be negative. And there's companies that make that much and it's almost 100% profit.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.680
 So yeah, I was fond of that. Very different philosophies. Yeah, but I get why they did that.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:47.120
 They're also launching this extensions concept. It looks, I'm not too like, it doesn't look that

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.120
 series. It just looks like, oh, you can now like run some steps in the Docker container. Let's

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.000
 take some kind of like, they let you add whatever Docker image or something. It works something like

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.800
 that. But the interesting part about that is they're saying that if you author an extension,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.960
 there's going to be a revenue share where you get 80% of the money associated with the extension.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.520
 But it's very confusing because when they even the first part where they're like, you have to pay

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:18.160
 for it, it's not really clear how you pay. They talk about instances, which I guess are like

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:26.080
 deployments. So for like each stage, each app. But it's not clear like how much you pay or like,

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.800
 none of that. I don't know if it's 50 bucks a year or like 500. I have no idea what it is.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.280
 And then how does that translate to like revenue for the extension author? So like, do you set

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.000
 like if you're the extension author, do you set your price? Like if you want to use this extension,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.800
 it costs X hours a month. I don't think they I don't think it's like you're paying extra for

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.400
 the extension. I think it's some kind of revenue share where like, for apps that are deployed using

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.600
 your extension, you get some cut, but then like the right, like what just is very unclear.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.480
 But they're clearly trying to bootstrap like some kind of terraform like ecosystem where you can

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:08.560
 coordinate all kinds of things. And I think that's it. I think that that's all the details that were

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.440
 in that post. So it's going to be paid. Not sure how much we're just bigger companies.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.800
 So I just it just occurred to me. I don't know, like HashiCorp's business model. How does how

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.400
 does terraform make money? Because it's kind of a similar model. I didn't realize I didn't think

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.840
 about like a huge public company, right? Yeah, but they have paid products and they have I think

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:33.440
 they even have a services division where they do like consulting and stuff. But HashiCorp has,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.280
 I mean, if you look at terraform, they have terraform cloud or terraform enterprise,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:44.640
 which are like these just more large company focused tools like there is like a CI tool for

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:51.040
 terraform. Okay, so terraform is still free, but people lots of people apparently pay for the like

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.120
 they make a lot of money, right? I mean, they're public company. They went public during the crazy

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.400
 times. And now they're kind of like, if you look at their stock, it's pretty much like

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:06.640
 just been down since they went public. So definitely one of those cases where they got ahead of

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.720
 their situation. And that's why they were forced to roll out some of those be like those licensing

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.560
 changes on terraform. Oh, I forgot about it. Yeah, they have a they have a lot of products.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.000
 They have a lot of products and they've been around for a while. Like terraform was something

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.040
 they came up with. Like I knew about HashiCorp for years before I started using terraform

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.200
 because they had other their products, but they're pretty diversified.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.160
 So it's interesting though, there's, I mean, they could have at one point looked very similar

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.000
 in their lifecycles, like serverless dominated serverless framework dominated.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.800
 And today, it was deployments, right? Yeah, if you look at today, they're still 30 times larger

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:54.000
 than SST. How much? 30 times. Yeah. Wow. MPM downloads. Yeah. Well, I heard like 90%

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.560
 of cloud formation deployments at one point were serverless framework. Oh, wow. Yeah. That's

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.880
 not that surprising. But I mean, we have like a very unique perspective on this because the

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:11.440
 original product for like our company, our original product wasn't SST. It was a CI tool

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:17.360
 for serverless framework projects. So I mean, these are before I joined to use, by the way,

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.960
 yeah, seed diagram. Yeah, now it works for us as well. But that's how the company started.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.000
 It was just looking at how big the serverless framework ecosystem was. And I'm thinking,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.800
 okay, we want to help people do serverless stuff. This is an angle. And yeah, like, you know,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.920
 that product grew to a certain size. And then we realized that serverless framework, it was

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.520
 obvious even back then they were a dying framework. I don't think when SST was built,

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.240
 a lot of people would have agreed. But there were a bunch of signals that like it hasn't,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.280
 it hadn't changed in years fundamentally. They haven't really been expanding the open source

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:02.560
 product much. They like tried their hand at so many different paid products that never stuck.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.520
 But that was kind of we were like, if we're building on top of them and relying on them

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.960
 to grow the ecosystem, we're kind of screwed. Because if they fail to do that, then we fail.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.440
 So that's why we moved off of them. And then I think, I would say like a year or a year and a

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.920
 half ago, I think it became a lot more publicly clear that it was kind of a dying framework.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.560
 So I haven't really thought about them in a long time. I don't really think of them as like

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.840
 a competitor that we're like, really like focused on.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:36.480
 You're so triggering. You're that meme. I don't think about you at all. There's all the things

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.480
 you've just said in the last two minutes, like if serverless framework people were listening

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.200
 or are listening, they're so triggered right now. And they can't say anything back because you're

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:51.920
 on the line. Sometimes things don't work out. And like we just genuinely, it hasn't been our focus

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.440
 because that market just is a certain size and serverless framework never grew out of it. We're

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:03.360
 kind of stuck in. I'm an AWS person. I care about serverless and I use serverless framework.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:10.640
 They never broke out to. I'm a person. I'm trying to build applications. Oh, this framework was cool.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.080
 Let me learn about serverless through it. I just never reached a broader market.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:20.240
 And that's where our focus was. We're like, there's no reason to double down and like spend

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.240
 all their time trying to convert serverless framework users because that's like a static

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:31.120
 pool of people. I'm taking a word for all this stuff. You clearly know this a lot better than I do.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.960
 Yeah. And then so a bunch of people messaged me last week about it. And they were like,

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.040
 oh, what do you think about this? Or like, oh, do you think I see is going to get a bunch of users

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.800
 now? Or we had someone posting our Discord being like, hey, this kind of thing worries me.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.440
 Like, can you tell us like how come SST is not going to go down the same path?

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.360
 Yeah. I saw your tweet. And that's where that came from. Yeah, exactly. So I was like, let me

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.600
 just say it publicly. I wrote it on Discord initially and I kind of reposted it publicly.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:07.200
 But the thing that is funny about the situation is we're seeing a company kind of take their

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:14.320
 core product and turn it into a paid product from open source. A lot of people, namely people that

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.800
 are big fans of serverless framework or even worked at serverless framework are saying,

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.240
 point to the situation and they're like, wow, open source monetization and sustainability is so

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.480
 hard. Like we need new models. Like the classic conversation about how hard it is to sustain open

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:34.720
 source, like they're framing it in that way. And to me, that's like so hilariously wrong,

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:41.920
 because this isn't like the solid JSTM, which is like a small group of people working on a product.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.040
 This is a company that raised $20 million at probably a $100 million valuation that failed to break

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.720
 1 million ARR despite being a year's old with like a massive user base. But to me,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.680
 this is just a normal startup execution failure. Like they messed up.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.360
 It's not a it's not an open source monetization, like landscape issue.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.760
 That's not like the whole open system open source ecosystem is broken. I hear you.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.520
 Yeah, yeah. It's like everyone's like, oh, it's open source broken. But like they were given

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.240
 $20 million or something, whatever the number is public. And they couldn't find a way to make

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.760
 it work. That's okay. It's like a startup failure. It happens. But like spinning it as like,

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.000
 oh, this is a great example of why open source, like we all need to look harder open source.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 The models need to change. So I posted so that's why my threat on it wasn't so much about like

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:38.560
 anything besides the startup mistakes that we think caused this this issue and what we're doing to

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.600
 make sure that we're not setting ourselves up in the same situation, like how we're making sure

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.600
 that we're staying super small. So the bar for sustainability is a lot lower so we can get there

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.240
 sooner and continue to make our own decisions instead of being pressured into different situations

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.240
 or like having a board that's getting stressed out because we're making we're not making money.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.680
 Like all those distractions that happen with, again, normal startup problems.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.520
 The CEO of Service Remake did reply being like, I don't relate to any of this.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:13.120
 And his explanation was he was like, the only model that works is asking people to pay for the

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:19.360
 core framework. And he kind of stated like, that's obvious doing anything else doesn't work.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.960
 And in my head, I'm like, well, then why did you try for the last eight years to do other stuff?

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.840
 Like we all know that asking your customers to pay for your open source product is not a situation

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.160
 anyone really wants to be in. It just kind of guarantees that you never really grow once you start

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:38.400
 doing that. It does sound tricky. Like just from like a I've been using this open source framework

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.000
 or library for years. And now all of a sudden, how do you like, you have to like put a credit card

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.520
 in to get up? Well, how do you pay for it? Like it comes off getting up?

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.080
 Yeah, here's here's another thing. I don't understand the enforcement of this.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.680
 Like, how do they know how much revenue you have? How do they know how many apps you're deploying?

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.800
 Are they now like hooking in to a bunch of places? Like do you have to?

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.840
 Oh, that's a good point. Like the two million or whatever you said it was revenue.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.240
 Like I don't I use frameworks all the time. They don't know how much revenue my company makes.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.720
 I'm okay with a good faith thing. Like I'm sure some larger percentage of people will say like,

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.120
 okay, we are. We do need to pay like our our relationship with Replicash is like that Replicash

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.600
 is similar model where it's free unless you raise a certain amount of money or you're like you're

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.640
 making a certain amount of money. Yeah. And like we like the company. We don't want to screw them. So

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:36.000
 we good faith pay. Yeah. But I'm like more confused about like the deployment like tracking the number

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.320
 of deployments. Like do I do I just self report everything? I'm like we have 100 deployments.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:46.240
 Are we going to pay you for that or? Yeah. Are they like analytics inside the CLI?

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:53.360
 It just seems like kind of clunky to actually implement this. So you've been very vocal about

00:17:53.360 --> 00:18:00.240
 like your approach or your as SST your approach to open source monetization.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.040
 Do you think there's like a fundamental? This has been like a big topic for years about like open

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.440
 source sustainability. Is it actually an issue or is it just people need to get more creative?

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.160
 And I think kind of where you stand on this, but I'm just I'd like to hear you.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.240
 Yeah. Well, I think there's let's I think we just need to separate companies from

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:23.840
 like more pure open source efforts. If you're again, going back to solid JS team,

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.840
 I'd categorize them under. Yes, like maybe we need to think about how to support these teams

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:35.360
 better as an overall industry. That's fine. Like they're not trying to build a company.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.200
 They're all volunteers in their spare time. There's a foundation, whatever.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.680
 But then people also point to situations like Gatsby or again, like the serverless framework.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.080
 And this is just a different thing. You tried to build an open source company,

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.440
 which is great. I think more people should try to do this because there's a lot of benefits

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.760
 to the world for doing this. But the thing I always say, like it's it's doubly hard because you need

00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:02.960
 a nail to killer products. And most people can't even nail one. If by miracle, you somehow nail one

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.360
 and get the timing right and people are adopting it and it's growing. Now you need to start over

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:15.440
 and nail on a secondary product, just as well. Yeah, I don't envy the three of you at SST with

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:21.920
 the just the execution roadmap laid out in front of you in terms of the open source side. And then

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:28.800
 you have the console side like, it's just a lot to juggle. It's hard. Yeah, it's hard. And

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:35.200
 there are people that pull it off. And a lot of people, a lot of companies fail at it.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.000
 But yeah, to me, it's like, it's not fundamentally impossible again, because we see companies that

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.720
 have done it. I keep pointing to tailwind because we talk about like, oh, it's the sustainability.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.720
 Is anyone like worried about the tailwind people at all? No, of course not. Like they know what

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.640
 they're doing. And like they figured out their model and they have a good way to say themselves.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:01.440
 So it's definitely possible. But you know, it's it's not easy. So I think there is a temptation to

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:07.600
 explain away some of these failures as like some external issue with our industry, but

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:13.760
 just normal sort of failures. Like you're you didn't find a product that hit. I'm pretty sure

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:19.600
 our CI product probably made more money than their CI product. And that's that's like a problem,

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.760
 right? That's like, yeah, why didn't why why was there an opportunity for like another company

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.480
 to build on top of your users? Their frame, actually corporate the exact same problem like they had.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.400
 There's a few companies that executed on the paid product better than

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:38.160
 HashiCorp did. So yeah, to me, it's like the we see us all the time. Like this happens over and

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:44.960
 over and over. Hmm. Okay. Well, that went pretty well. I was a little nervous about what you would

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:51.280
 say. You only probably triggered like a handful of my friends. Love you people. If you want to

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:58.960
 come on the show, we could talk about it. Good times. Anything else you want to say about

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:05.280
 that before I try to gracefully transition to something on my list? No. Okay, cool. So you

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.560
 gotten a little bit of a Twitter, you just write such long tweets now. Of course, in a tweet,

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.720
 yeah, I've run some long you write a tweet that long. Like somebody's going to take issue with

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.200
 some part of it. Like there's just no way you're getting out unscathed, especially with your

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:25.920
 communication, the way you tweet. Well, it's like you read a short tweet and people misinterpret it.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.840
 You read a long long tweet. People focus on one line that they didn't like.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:36.560
 Exactly. Yeah. I like the long tweets. I saw Jay said right, shorter tweets. Yeah, what the

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.840
 hell was that? I got something by my own team. That's awesome. You guys are toxic in the best

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:47.920
 possible way. I love it. I have like a shake right now. Like I am literally like just vibrating

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.160
 from caffeine. You did too much coffee. This is the second day in a row. This happened to you.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:57.760
 Well, I'm tapering. So yesterday I had way too much. Today I'm having too much for a normal

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:04.000
 day, but like less than yesterday. Okay. And I had to have no food in my system. So I'm quite

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.520
 jittery. Can you hear it in my voice? No, I can't tell. Well, maybe your eyebrows switching a little.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:15.680
 A little bit. Also, cold plunge this morning, that doesn't help. There's like frost on the ground

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.720
 this morning. It's like the first frost here, where like, do you know what frost is you in Miami?

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:26.560
 Like the snow or the white stuff, right? The grass is like frozen solid. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.640
 And your breath, you could see your breath. So like you get in the cold water and it's just like,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.760
 why am I doing this on purpose? Does it cold plunge? Do you need to do anything or do you just

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:42.720
 fill with water? It's coming just when you stand outside. Like I'm in next to nothing in my swimsuit.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:52.080
 It's like, yeah, yeah. When you stand outside and it's 28 degrees outside, it's almost as bad as

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.000
 getting in the cold plunge. The water still hits different. It still sucks worse. But like,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.240
 yeah, you can just stand outside or go for a walk. And that's basically cold exposure. I mean,

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.400
 that's like cold therapy right there. I see. I'm shaking for lots of reasons.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:14.160
 But I say this is not a topic I wanted to discuss. I do want to discuss the, my get up handle.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.720
 This is just a little thing. Oh, yes. Share the tragedy. I just have to tell you, too,

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.560
 something I forgot to mention yesterday. So I finally got in contact with the guy who owns

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:28.320
 Adam.dev on GitHub. It's like the only social platform I don't have that handle for.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.320
 And it drives me bananas. Yeah. It drives me crazy, to be honest,

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.960
 because like when I go look, look at your GitHub, I'm just reminded like, oh, it's different.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.880
 That's it's different. And it's right now I got to change it because I want to get my last name

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:47.360
 just like scrubbed from the internet. And it's part of my GitHub handle. So finally got in contact

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:52.000
 with him. The way I got in contact with him was I realized like I hadn't been like mining his

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.880
 GitHub connections. So he had four people that followed him. And they're all from the, well,

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:02.320
 I'm not going to say they're all from the same university overseas. And so I just de-imbed all

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.800
 of them on LinkedIn because I found them. Yeah. This is kind of what Frank did to get our GitHub,

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.920
 like just crazy investigation stock. Yeah. I de-immed them all. Nobody responded to me,

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.000
 but then he reached out to me. He added me on LinkedIn and he was like, hey, a few people have

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.680
 reached out saying you're looking to buy the Adam.dev handle, not interested in selling. And then he

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:27.360
 ended it with this is part of, I'll show you, he ended it with love your site, by the way. Good luck

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:34.960
 with all your mini endeavors. That was pretty funny. It's kind of a sick burn. Like, I don't know if

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.720
 he meant it as a word. I think he was just being genuine. Like he probably was like, good luck with

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:44.160
 your endeavors. But you know, but he doesn't want to sell it for any price. I don't understand that.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.760
 Why is he? Is it active? Is he? That's what I can't get. I can't get in my head. Not really. He's not,

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:55.120
 I mean, he's got some stuff on there. I'm sure he uses GitHub. But like, I don't know why you wouldn't

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.920
 want to sell, especially to a person who's known for buying things for way too much money. Like,

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:05.040
 I've done this before. It's a golden opportunity. You're sitting on a GitHub handle that is worth

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.680
 something. He's like still a default profile picture. He could sell it to me and just change

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:14.960
 it to whatever else, his full name. I don't know. This is so funny. It feels like this person has

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.080
 been put on a planet just to torture you. He's seriously a rational decision. And he doesn't know

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:25.120
 how much it bothers me. I'm trying to be polite. And like, I've told him if anything changes,

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.920
 please let me know. I'm just going to have to wear him down. I'm just going to have to get

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.400
 really annoying and message him every other week until he finally decides, you know what? I just

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.480
 want to stop having to talk to this guy. Can you block me on LinkedIn? Is that a thing you can do?

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:42.400
 Yeah, for sure. And you can block you on email. But so you should just start escalating to threats.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.240
 I'll mobilize his friends against. I'll just keep annoying them. Why would they listen to you?

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.400
 And then they'll be like, would you please just sell a handle? I got to figure something out.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.680
 Maybe the whole podcast, if you listen to this podcast, maybe you could help me out.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.800
 And we'll put it in the show notes. No, we won't. That's terrible. I'm going to put his name and

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:04.560
 contact information. And I want that handle so bad. I'm going to have to change my handle

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.640
 everywhere. That's what you said yesterday. I probably have to change your handle everywhere,

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.240
 or you're going to have to play dirty and throw. How could I play dirty? Please hire someone to

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.360
 shake him down in person. Shake him down. What do you even mean right now? In person? Dax? What

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.680
 are you? What are you saying? What do you suggest? Do you want this handle or not? I want it so bad.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:30.400
 I'm not going to resort to hiring a mob boss. Yeah, for sure.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:37.360
 Man, you have handles, man. They're worth a lot. Another option is to bribe a GitHub employee.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:43.120
 That's terrible. I can't rip it out from anything. Before I was able to get in contact with them,

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.600
 and I didn't know how I was going to get in contact with them, I thought, is this a trademark dispute?

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:55.200
 I own Adam.dev the domain. I own all the handles. Could I be like, I mean, it's not a trademark,

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:05.120
 but like, come on. It's on my wall. It's my name. I had a situation with a domain that I wanted,

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:10.160
 and it was owned by some random little ISP or something. It's just some small business

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:16.160
 that didn't seem very active in Michigan, and they just would not sell it for anything,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.920
 and it didn't seem usable. I wish I could get in the headspace of that psychology.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:28.720
 Why would you not even listen to an offer in this case? I don't know if they came to that for you.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.920
 It's so different to me. I'll sell anything. I'll sell literally anything.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.400
 I'll just stop being on the internet at all. If somebody's like, I'm going to buy your online

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:45.520
 presence. You got it. I'll sell you Zuko. I'll sell you Zuko. I wouldn't tell my boys,

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.440
 but other than that. But for the right price? I mean, everything has a price, right?

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.080
 You also didn't imagine your wife. But not my kids. Well, not obviously not my wife or my kids,

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.320
 but like everything else. It's got a price. Everything has a price. Anyway, okay.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.640
 Could you just steal it somehow? Could you like go to the dark web and like do the things you

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:08.240
 do on the dark web? I was kidding about all the everything I said so far, so trying to take me

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:15.520
 into the tracks. I'm trying to cover my tracks. If you go and do something crazy, I don't want to

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:21.120
 be at fault. Oh, man, that reminds me, I forgot to say something to you. The other day, there's

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:29.520
 an interaction on Twitter that cracked me up. You said it was like, uh, Aiden commented on

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:36.160
 something you tweeted. I don't know. And you were like, uh, like that time you banned me on Twitch

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.640
 because Aiden works for Twitch. Like that time you banned me on Twitch and made what did you say?

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:47.280
 You said something I accused him. I claimed that he used his access to ban everyone from my

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:53.520
 Twitch stream until I paid him a ransom. Right. Right. His response. Now that I've hung out with

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.240
 Aiden in person, I can just picture him saying it too. And his response was like to be very clear,

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:04.640
 I did not do this. Dax is joking. Yeah, he did. He's very nervous. He's being like,

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:10.880
 one, my boss follows me on Twitter to all my visa stuff is going on right now.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:19.920
 And I go with you all myself. So he got so serious. He was so clearly scared. And I was like,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:26.480
 maybe I should make you pay me a ransom to stop. So you actually started doing the thing. You

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.560
 can use some of this. This brings up a point that I've always wondered. Like I've never heard

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:37.120
 an answer to this. What like, what is the law or why can like people say they're doing a certain

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:42.880
 drug in like a song or why can like, why could I just like tweet tomorrow or something awful

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.040
 and like can't get in trouble for it? Why can you say stuff? Go ahead. Yeah, because it's not.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:54.880
 So what crime are you being accused of like conspiracy to smoke weed?

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.760
 No, no, we would have, what if like, I don't know, what's something super, super illegal to

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.800
 consume or to own or any, any schedule on drug like cocaine? Like if you took a picture of some

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.720
 illegal weapon or something you possess, or yeah, you, I'm doing cocaine right now. If I say that

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.360
 publicly, why can't I get in trouble? Because what's the actual crime you committed? The crime wasn't

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:21.920
 that you said it's not like a speech crime without to be again, like conspiracy to do cocaine,

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:28.000
 which, but I said I'm doing cocaine. The, the, the crime I did is cocaine. I did cocaine.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.160
 But if the only piece of evidence that people have, or is the fact that you said it, I mean,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:37.280
 it came from my mouth. I am the witness. I am the person, the perpetrator and the witness. Isn't

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.680
 that well, like, unless you're going to go bring up charges on yourself and then be and then give

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.840
 a confession. Like it's okay. Here's the thing. So why couldn't you bring up charges? Why couldn't

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.320
 you charge? Now that's like only police people can charge? Why couldn't I? No, I can ask the

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.960
 police to press charges and they were probably declined because this is not worth their time.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.040
 For like something they know that is hard to prove in court. So they can't prove it by just

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.400
 playing back the tape of me on video being like, I'm doing cocaine right now. Well,

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:08.240
 like physically showing it. Whatever you do with cocaine. Showing it maybe. Yeah, but it's again,

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.160
 it's like, I don't think anyone's going to try that hard for a drug crime. You know,

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.480
 I don't know enough about law enforcement. Me neither, but I think, yeah. But what,

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.000
 okay, what about like, I feel like rappers probably talk about killing people.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.800
 Okay. So there is a thing where if you are charged directly with the crime,

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:34.560
 they can bring up things that you've said to that point to you planning the crime.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.520
 Okay. So that's different, right? So that could be like a rap song could be

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.680
 admissible as evidence in the court of law. They have done that. It's like really weak evidence.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.760
 So like it's not stuff that should count and there's actually that's art.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:52.400
 There's videos of, I forgot who it was. It was some lawyer and some rapper

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:57.600
 like laughing while they were pointing to like lyrics being like, this is so stupid.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.720
 It's like, it's really, it's like circumstantial. It's like what?

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.280
 Like you can say anything just because you said it. Does that mean it makes it true? Like,

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.440
 I see. You always have a defense against against that being of saying like,

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.560
 I was being sarcastic or like it was artistic or like, you know,

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.480
 and that's good. Like you shouldn't, you should be able to claim those things.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.240
 Yeah. I guess it'll, I guess it makes sense now. I've always had that question.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.080
 I don't know why I've never asked it to anybody.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.560
 I mean, I don't know the direct answer. Maybe a lawyer can give us the real answer.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.120
 We should have a lawyer on that. That'd be fun. What is?

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:33.920
 I would just want to immediately ask them like, are you losing your job to chat GPT?

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:38.160
 Like, are you going away? Maybe like the boring lawyers. Yeah, probably.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:43.120
 That's what I'm saying. I genuinely believe lawyers could be on the way out.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.040
 Or at least some of them. I haven't used a boring lawyer in forever. I've like,

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:54.160
 even without AI, I found enough tools to like avoid that. Like incorporating a business that

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:58.560
 used to require a lawyer. Well, you get that's easy. But like, I don't know, they're just like,

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:03.360
 as a startup person, you know, there's stuff that happens that's just, no.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.720
 Even then, I did, I did a whole fundraise myself and lawyers.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.920
 I guess, did you like safe? I mean, did you just do like, yeah, exactly. We did

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.360
 saves. It was very easy to self administer. Yeah, I guess there are like a lot of tools now

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.920
 to just kind of like get pretty far without needing custom stuff.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:23.600
 If you do any like deals, like B2B deals, I think that stuff maybe you need a custom.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:28.240
 So even there, we've gotten away with just finding some shit online and chat GPT.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.560
 Wow, that's amazing. It's fun. You're talking about custom deals.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:38.960
 I got to cover my address. But do you see that? It's a flipped. Yeah. Do you know a block?

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.280
 Oh, is that your, is that your shares? I just got my shares yesterday.

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:49.600
 What you physically, you got physical shares. It's like in Carta, but you get that too.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:55.920
 No, it's not in Carta. It's it's in something called computer share. It just looks like the most

00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:01.120
 90s thing ever. And they sent me no information about it digitally. They just sent me this piece

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:07.760
 of paper with the number of shares and the value. Are you retiring? Is that it? Okay.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:15.680
 I mean, you were a VC, you VC'd and now paid it. Hey, you know, I've never lost money on a

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:23.600
 startup investment. Like none of them have gone to zero yet. So I've done, I think, I shouldn't

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:29.120
 say that. Oh, yeah, that's fair. I think I've done five, five investments. Three of them have

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:34.560
 exited with a positive return for me. And the other two are still alive. One is doing insanely

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:42.080
 well. The other one's SSD. That's an incredible track record, though. Like, I feel like that's not

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.880
 normal. I mean, I guess it's small time angel investing in the sense that's five of them. Some

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:52.480
 people do. I don't know, a lot. The thing is, though, it's like all the ones that succeeded,

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:59.280
 succeeded in a way that I didn't expect. So I was like wrong, but I lucked out, which is how

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:04.000
 almost all investing works, which is why you listen to VCs about anything. You're usually

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.680
 right by accident. I've never, I've never done any investments. Casey, not a big fan of the idea of

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:16.080
 all of my income comes from tech to then like turn around and invest in tech companies.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:20.640
 I don't know. It does. It's not for the money at all. What is it for? The cache?

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:29.280
 Is that a word? Well, to me, for me, it's, if I can do this and I can end up breaking even or like

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:34.480
 losing, let's say like 20%, whatever, like losing some, some small percentage of it. That's a massive

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.760
 success because a main reason is to find people you like and instantly submit like a permanent life

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.240
 long connection. Interesting. Yeah, that does do that, I would think. Yeah. So that's really for

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.000
 the friendships. Yeah. It all comes down to the friendships. Like you don't make money angel

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.320
 investing. Like I'm really like, like I said, I've gotten lucky so far, but if I continue to do this

00:35:52.320 --> 00:36:00.160
 for 10, 15 more years, if I break even, that would be a success. Like I don't, it's just. It's too

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:07.040
 weird at like early stages like this. You just never know, even if even if everything makes sense.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.600
 So you can put investor in your bio though. That's a perfect. That's only a downside.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:18.080
 Investors a stupid job. Oh my god. It's a stupid job. So I went to something with Stefan

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:24.240
 last week in Miami. It was like an event hosted by VCs. Ah, one of the rich parties we've talked

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:30.800
 about this. Well, it was like on a nice rooftop and I guess there was food, but I guess it probably

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:37.120
 was expensive to throw, but it didn't really feel like like we're living the life. Like we do when

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.360
 we went, like when we were on the yachts, it's quite different. Yeah, with pit bull. Yeah.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:50.400
 But I was like so floored because almost every single stereotype that you imagine

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:57.280
 was just like thrown in my face like crazy. Do you know how on Twitter every investor

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.880
 investor? If you look on their bio, what do you see? What do you see if you go their bio?

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:08.160
 Is it a mo is it an emoji? No, no, no. That rolls up the avocado emoji.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.880
 It's going to be I'm going to kick myself for not knowing, but I can't think.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:17.680
 Okay, so it's early investor in Uber Airbnb, like all these companies you heard of. Yeah.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:22.880
 And it's like, why are there like thousands of people with this in there in their profile?

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:30.320
 So I kid you not every single person I talk to there. Less than one minute. First 60 seconds,

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:37.040
 we'll throw in. By the way, we were early investors in X, like without fail. By the way,

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.840
 we were the first check into superhuman. By the way, we were the first. It's just like every

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:47.360
 interaction for them is like, I don't know who you are. I need to establish my credibility as soon

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:52.480
 as possible. I'm so smart. And I picked the winners. And this is how I do it. And some people I even

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.920
 saw were like when I would hear them introduce themselves to people. And they wouldn't be like,

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:04.400
 hey, I'm Dax. They would say, hey, I'm Dax from like whatever VC firm they're working on.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:08.640
 Instantly credibility. I'm Dax from blah, blah. I'm not a random person. I'm like somebody.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:14.080
 It's like the most extreme version of probably all the stuff that we hate. Yeah, it was it was

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:19.920
 funny. That's pretty funny. Yeah. I met some nice people, but you know, I mean, yeah,

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:25.040
 I know some nice investors for sure. There's lots of people. I still get Christmas cards from

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:32.080
 an investor that lovely family. I do. I do. I wonder like, is venture capital a permanent

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:38.880
 fixture in society? Or no? No, I like want. I don't think so. I mean, not in the way it's been.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:45.440
 Like it's fun. Yeah. It's just funny talking to them because from my point of view,

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:52.080
 it's so clear to me that their entire life is just dictated by the overall market going up and down.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.520
 Yeah, they're real estate agents. They're basically real estate agents.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.760
 Anyone can get the job. You just decide today. I'm a real estate agent. I'm a venture capitalist.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:05.360
 And there's no bar. It's like, it's all just random. And if the market's doing really well,

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:10.880
 it's a good job. Yeah, exactly. For 99% of people, they're just they're not doing anything. They're

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:16.800
 just like slaves to whatever the market's doing. But then their feelings around it are like they

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:23.200
 don't perceive it in that way. So they were just like so like confused or like reacting to this

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.800
 stuff in a way where it was just really weird. It like seemed kind of fake because let's be real.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.840
 Every VC is struggling right now. A lot of them are struggling just because money's not as available.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:39.600
 Markups aren't happening like they used to. IPOs aren't happening as they used to. But you talk to

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:45.600
 every VC and almost the exact same candle line, which is, oh, yeah, I think this is so great.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:50.400
 It's so like our industry really needed like a cleanup phase reset. Yeah, I needed a reset.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:55.280
 It's like you're the people that are being reset. Like it's you. It's like everyone else except for

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:02.800
 you. It's you. Yeah. So yeah, it's just funny. Like it's I feel like they live in this weird.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:09.360
 You know what it feels like to me? I feel like me as a founder, I'm so close to reality because

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:14.400
 a market is like punching me in the face every single day. Yeah, they're so far removed to it.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.800
 But from it, but like are still trying to have the same level of insight as a founder.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:24.640
 So they always just come off like really confused and unaware of like any any like amount of reality.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:29.360
 It's a hard position because they're not near anything that's going on. They're getting it through

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:35.200
 like secondhand, thirdhand accounts from like the companies I've invested in. It's just.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:42.400
 Yeah. Oh, by the way, I learned a new word while I was there. Every VC kept saying portco.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.480
 We had our portcos in every week. We try to have a portco. I've heard this word a lot.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.240
 I haven't heard it before. It was new for me. I've I've socialized with lots of portcos.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:57.920
 Hello, portcos. Yeah. Oh, of course. I feel like more of a venture capitalist than you all of a

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:02.240
 sudden. I've never made any angel investments. Well, you I think you've more directly raised money

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:07.600
 than I have. Oh, maybe probably have more experience with this. Anyway, any VCs listening,

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.920
 don't take it personally, invest in us.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:18.960
 And we better get the problem. Oh, I mean, I think about, yeah, okay. Maybe we shouldn't talk about

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:24.000
 the venture capitalist. Okay. Oh, I had a list. I don't know. It feels dumb now to read my list.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.560
 No, no, really. I think we went off topic for a little bit, but okay. Well, there is no topic.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:34.720
 So. Oh, I mentioned my ordering. I need you to buy one with my code because I don't want one.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.520
 Yeah, no, listen, hear me out. They're great. And if you buy one and one other person buys one,

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:43.920
 I'll get some kind of air purifier. I didn't know I wanted an air purifier, but now I do.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.840
 I have an air purifier in my in my office right now. What brand is it?

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.440
 Oronsie. It's good. I don't know.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:57.200
 Do you know the DHH people are obsessed with this? No, but when you say the DHH people,

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:01.680
 you mean like the base can't people? The base can't. Yeah, like they have so many talks talking

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.480
 about, I don't know if they're still obsessed with this, but there was definitely a period of

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:09.280
 time where they were like air quality is terrible and it affects your programming ability. And they

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:14.880
 were like, Oh, wow. Into air purifiers and like documenting the best ones and saying that

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.320
 everyone should have one and what a big impact it can have. It's like the way people talk about

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.840
 sleep and your performance, like they were kind of talking about that with air quality with air

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:26.960
 quality. Okay. So I actually did get one of the ones that they were into. I don't know if it does

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.400
 anything. We honestly got it because we have a lot of pets. And when you have a lot of pets,

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:35.040
 there's just like stuff in the air, like dander hair. Yeah, no, that makes sense.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:40.560
 So I can't, I don't know if it helps with that, but it feels like it's doing something like we do no

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:47.600
 fragrances. So like Casey is everything we buy is unscented. Yeah, same.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.440
 Let's just let's hate to Casey's really sensitive. Yeah, it's like women hate

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.840
 centered stuff. Yeah, it's like anybody comes over and they have like a strong

00:42:55.840 --> 00:43:00.960
 scent. It just lingers in our house for days. I would love if something would suck that

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.040
 scent out of the air. I'm surprised. But you guys must have something built into your house.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:10.240
 I think we do. We have like a whole house air purifier and a humidifier, like in our AC.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:14.160
 I don't know. Something about that. But like, I don't know, the things that they give me a free

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.440
 one. If I just got a few people to sign up, so now I want it. I'm a consumer.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:22.640
 Well, I'm not setting up soon. Okay, well, fine. You know what? Fine. I'm going to put the link

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.960
 in the show notes. There you go. I'll give it to Chris. I'll put it in show notes. If you're

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:31.200
 listening, listen, they're great. Look them up. Here's one right now. Oh, you're not watching the

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:37.040
 video, probably. Okay. So here's my issue. This is a reason I don't, I stopped using any of these

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:42.640
 things or I stopped trying to ease these things. What is your charging habit around it? It's,

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:46.480
 it has a charge for like seven days. Yeah, but my, my whip was also like a multi-day thing.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:50.720
 But still, what is your charging habit around it? So far, I've charged it once. And I just did it

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:54.080
 in the middle of the day when I was sitting at my desk doing nothing. So I didn't need to track

00:43:54.080 --> 00:44:00.560
 anything. That was it. And, and do you feel like that you'll sustain that forever? Or do you

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.480
 eventually feel like you'll, you'll follow it. Yes, I'm going to wear this literally forever.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:08.480
 So here's a great thing about it. I can't wear my watch when I roll with Injiu Jitsu.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:13.040
 Like it's just too big and clunky and it would hurt somebody. But I can wear this and it tracks

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.280
 my heart rate during my roles. So it's first time I've had insight into like the actual

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:24.880
 activity that I'm getting in Jiu Jitsu, which is great. And sleep, sleep data. It's great. Someone

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:29.440
 buy it, please. I need a couple of people just buy it on my link. Thanks. That's enough about the

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.320
 ordering. I feel like I just did a commercial. It's like the first time we've ever like,

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.280
 it wasn't a good commercial. I don't think anyone's going to buy it. It wasn't very good. Yeah,

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:41.200
 you made the anti case. So that didn't help. I made the anti case and he just didn't refute it.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:46.320
 So I didn't do a very good job. Yeah. Yeah. Well, whatever. Did you know Casey, my wife,

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:51.280
 we did the inside tracker thing while we're doing commercials? Have you heard of inside tracker?

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:55.120
 No, I have no idea what that is. What is that? If you listen to Huberman, you would know exactly

00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:00.720
 what inside tracker is. It's like a blood test. Like they, they do like a, all these genetic markers

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:05.920
 and they basically come back and tell you your cellular age. So like, you've been on earth for

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:12.320
 a certain number of years, but that doesn't mean that your cellular age reflects your calendar age.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.400
 I gotcha, because you know, depending on your life, you could have stressed yourself more.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.720
 Exactly. She's almost 10 years younger,

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:25.200
 cellularly than she is. Calendar, literally. That's great for her. What about you?

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.040
 I know. I haven't done it yet. She did it first. I got her for her birthday.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:36.960
 Yeah. So I'm just saying, we may be in our mid thirties. I'm calling my mid thirties still.

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:42.480
 But we're like, we're really in our twenties, basically. We haven't even hit the 3-0 mark.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.440
 Just say it. What if someone in their twenties does it and it says they're like 14?

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:51.280
 So we have it yet. So we have this theory. That's that whenever we talk about anti-aging stuff,

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:56.720
 it does come down to like, how long do you try and reverse it? Like, what's the lowest you go?

00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:01.120
 Like, 18? Like, when do you stop anti-aging? Like, you don't want to be an adolescent again.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.280
 It becomes illegal if you go below 18.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:11.280
 Right. Yeah. No, it's like the... We have a theory and we haven't read this, but that like,

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:16.560
 your body's really good at like, just repairing itself up until your mid twenties, thirties,

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:22.400
 whatever. So like, I don't think anybody's probably aging too much past their age and their twenties.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:26.160
 You know what I mean? Like, you can eat like garbage and feel fine when you're 20.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:30.000
 I mean, we're talking about your grandfather that just did all the best stuff.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.720
 Yeah. That's true until he was 94. He did walk to his job every day and he had like,

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:38.320
 a job he loved. He owned a clothing store. I think that was a big part of it.

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:43.680
 That's huge. I talk about this all the time. I feel like the best thing for your old age is to

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:48.240
 have a job that you like and are still active doing it. Yeah. Because he eventually, like,

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:52.960
 he didn't retire, but he had to slow down a bit. And I think that probably did it. Like,

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.920
 when he wasn't able to be at the store, he still wanted to know like what the numbers,

00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:00.400
 how many genes did we sell today? Like when he was days from dying. I mean, he was,

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.600
 he was really into it. Yeah. Yeah. He was pretty overweight. Like,

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:08.320
 so all the people that I see that are old and like, surprisingly with it are all like still working.

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.520
 I think about Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett probably might die. Oh, yeah.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:16.000
 Like, I don't, I wouldn't be surprised if he'd literally just died any day. Yeah. But he's like,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.320
 he was pushing and talking about work. Like, yeah. He's still being quoted. He's like,

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:25.360
 how many people that age are still like in the news, like for their expertise?

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:30.640
 It's kind of crazy. And also other guy, Charlie Munger also in situation.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:35.120
 So now I gotta, I gotta find a job for my life so we can grow to be 120 together.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:43.680
 Because raising kids is stressful and not fulfilling. And it lasts for 20 years.

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:47.920
 Well, I mean, you know what I mean? Like, she doesn't wake up and go like,

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:52.720
 I can't wait to do this stuff today. Yeah. I know. It's the stuff you have to do.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.400
 But I guess like eventually we're going to be 90 and we're not going to be doing what we do

00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:00.000
 today. So she'll have to figure it out. Just like, well, let's figure it out. Okay. Liz,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.360
 in case you're fine, they're going to live forever. They're women too. They live longer, right?

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:10.400
 I don't know. I feel like Liz is very masculine in a lot of ways. Like,

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:15.760
 she's definitely more like the, I don't know. I can see her dying from a heart attack.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.280
 We always joke about where she's like, I don't know.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:23.200
 He's like, well, no, it's funny because like dying from a heart attack is a very like

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.480
 masculine sounding way to die. She's like for her, like she would die in a heart attack in a

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:33.120
 boardroom. That's like her. That's like a 55 year old male. For sure. Exactly.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:38.880
 Okay. That's all I want to talk about on my list.

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.640
 What? You have to come up with the net.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.280
 You have to come up. I thought you had one item on your list.

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:53.120
 Okay. I have more stuff. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do the teaching thing.

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:59.600
 I'm going full Matt Pocock. If you follow Matt Pocock, you know, like, is that your archetype

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.760
 of person you're trying to emulate?

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.400
 But Kency Dobbs, Matt Pocock.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:11.040
 Well, I was wondering if it was specific because Matt does a lot of like the shorts and like little,

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.440
 yeah, bite-sized things and stuff. I feel like Ken doesn't know as much.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:20.640
 Basically going to be tweeting and doing YouTube videos and making educational materials during

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:26.160
 workshops. I'm going to teach stuff because you know what it is? I realized it hit me with this

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:31.760
 latest Vercel slash next JS with next JS comp. It hit me that like I complained so much on the

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:37.440
 internet about things I don't like in terms of technology. And I've never really put out what I

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:44.720
 do like. Like here's how I like to do things. And I don't hear a lot of people like championing

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:50.560
 the way I do things. There's a lot of people doing this the way I do things. I just don't

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:55.680
 see a lot of educators teaching like how to build real product for a startup, for instance,

00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:02.480
 on AWS, for instance, with SSC for instance. Anyway, yeah, I'm going to do it. I'm going to like,

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.960
 I'm making stuff. I'm going all in on it.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.960
 No, it's great. I think this is this is like how you started, right? This is why you ended

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:13.040
 up with all the equipment that you have. Your initial intention to make a course. Yes.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:19.760
 I announced it a year ago. Yeah, finally. Wait, you had a name for it was going to be AWS for

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:27.280
 web devs. That's just too much. That's like really long. So I've now I'm rebranding it to modern AWS.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:32.480
 Nice. There's there's like AWS, which is just giant thing. And like, that's not what the

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:39.040
 course is about. The course is about building modern applications. Like AWS can be modern.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:44.960
 And there are lots of nice shiny things we get now. SST is a big example of that. You can have

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:50.400
 awesome TypeScript mono repos and build on AWS. And I don't know how many people

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:56.480
 realize that outside of the SST community or outside of startup community or whatever.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:03.200
 Yeah, no, it's I mean, I like the modern AWS because I think it it does a good job of hinting

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:08.320
 that there's something you don't know. Yeah, modern. You don't know. Like is there something

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:13.840
 that changed? And yes, there is a lot that changed. Yeah, it's exciting. I feel like you're

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:18.160
 going to be able to put out like you're good at putting out high quality stuff. So yeah,

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:23.440
 I think it'll be good. I'm excited to like play with all kinds of things. I want to I've always

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:30.240
 wanted to make a course on AWS stuff that like vinded out AWS accounts. Like you were a student,

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.600
 you bought the course. Here's your AWS account. Don't worry. You don't have to worry about the

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:39.520
 bill. We spent like four hours. We had like a four hour meeting trying to figure out how to do that.

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:46.800
 Oh, no, is it not possible? It is possible, but it's not you need to do some funny stuff.

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.640
 Okay, the ultimate issue is at the end of the day, there needs to be a credit card

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:55.600
 before the account is used. Oh, it's going to be in my organization.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:59.840
 It's going to be my credit card. I'm going to create accounts in my organization

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:06.240
 for each student. But how do you prevent like abuse? That's on me. That's that's my job.

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:10.640
 That's why I was a four hour meeting my students. Yeah, it's hard. It's a hard problem. But I think

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:15.280
 it's solvable. Like I think with SCPs, I could like knock out 90% of the problems.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.480
 You can prevent people from spinning up certain resources. By the end of the day,

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.280
 you need them to spin up a lambda. Yeah. And there's going to have to be like

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:30.160
 some cut offs and some things that like I prevent. But it's going to be like a hefty course price.

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:36.240
 Like this is for starters and teams. Like I feel like there's some wiggle there if people

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:40.560
 accidentally encourage me. Because no one buy the course just to abuse it. Yeah,

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.360
 because the country price is too high. That makes sense. It's different for us.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:46.480
 Because we had it was like public was like free. Oh, yeah, it's like a free thing. Yeah, it's

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:52.000
 totally different. Yeah. If anybody could just start mining crypto. Yeah, that makes sense. And

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.440
 like what's your approach with it? Do you think you're going to like put in a bunch of effort to

00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:01.440
 make the course first and then like start to do other stuff or like if you like. So what I want

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:06.560
 to do is do a workshop in December. It's going to be a long play because I do have a full-time job.

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:10.560
 And like this is going to be kind of in my free time. But I'm going to do a workshop in December.

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:15.840
 It'll just be kind of like the first module of the course, I think. But do it kind of in a live

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:22.560
 like 20 to 30 seats workshop where I can like get feedback on the content, see how it resonates,

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:28.720
 and then kind of like turn that into part of the course down the line. So I'll do a few workshops

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:32.960
 sometime over the next several months. And then eventually sometime next year, middle next year,

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:36.720
 maybe have like an actual paid self-paced course. That's the goal.

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.520
 What is a workshop? I always see these professional course people do this. They like do a workshop.

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.440
 And then they like that like rolls up into their course. And like what is that?

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:48.080
 It's just like an interactive like presentation.

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:54.560
 Usually all day or half day like it's like a course. It's like if like a class like a university

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.280
 class, I think like where there's like 30 students and there's a teacher and you're at the end of it.

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:03.360
 There's some tangible thing that everybody learned and felt confident in doing. Yeah,

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:08.640
 there's like a whole science around workshops and there's this book. Well, you know, Joel Hooks,

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:14.480
 Badass Dev, he's got all kinds of resources. He points to this book on workshops. It's kind

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:18.720
 of the definitive. Oh, I see. Oh, that's funny. It's a like learn a new skill. Yeah, I love learning

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:24.400
 new skills. I love all of that. I think it's it's a cross-section of a lot of things I'm into.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:29.920
 So I'm very excited about it. No, it's good. Partly caffeine. It's partly I just I felt like

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:35.520
 I always thought I wanted to try teaching and like get into the education space. I never felt

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:42.160
 like I had a handle like on it on a idea of what it is I have to offer. And it's finally just in the

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:48.640
 last few days, it feels pretty clear. Like for startups building product, digital product,

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:52.160
 I feel like I have something to offer there. And I think they should do that on AWS. And I think

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:58.080
 there's enough there that I can come up with just infinite number of things to talk about.

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.040
 And that's the thing, I guess. Like when you watch Matt talk about TypeScript,

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:05.360
 he could just talk about different things. He could he has no end to the things he could share,

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:10.320
 knowledge he's accumulated. And I feel like I've kind of got that with AWS and with startups and

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:16.240
 with this whole space. So yeah, it's funny because and I was saying this to you, it's such a huge

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:20.160
 space. Again, like the biggest conference in the world, the tech conference in the world is

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:26.240
 an AWS conference. Like it's so it's so big. So you would assume that it's super over saturated

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:32.160
 with educational stuff. But I was telling you the other day, people always ask me like, hey,

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:37.360
 like, how do I become good at AWS? Like what resources do you recommend? And I literally tell

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.960
 them it doesn't exist. Like to be honest, there's nothing I can point you to.

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:47.360
 So it's like that there's a ton of training resources put out by like actual AWS solutions

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:52.640
 architects. It's not what what this is, which is like, you're a web developer, you're building

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:57.920
 a startup and you need like a honed. It's like very different. There's like a sea of

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:02.080
 information out there, but that's not what people need. And then there's like a lot of

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.840
 cert specific stuff. There's like, Hey, you want to pass the certs? Here's a bunch of training

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.520
 materials. Yeah, it's like very like technical. It's like technical is not the word. It's like,

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:15.360
 you know what it is, it's stuff that flows down from AWS. It dictates certain things and then

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:20.560
 people like build their own stuff, according to those roles or those recommendations, etc.

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:27.120
 This will be a much more like unsanctioned AWS resource that's from the perspective of somebody

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:35.680
 who's probably more modern web dev than I am cloud nerd. Yeah, it's it's funny because I was

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.520
 thinking about this this morning, because there was this a post on Hacker News today,

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:45.600
 which was about should you use Lambda Lith? So like, should you have like a single Lambda function

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:49.760
 that has a bunch of routes? Or should you break it up? And I was looking at the replies and so

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:54.400
 many replies were like, yeah, breaking up into a bunch of routes is like dumb. And like, I don't

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:58.720
 know why they keep recommending this or I don't know why this is such a thing. And I was reading

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.640
 that and I was like, it's so crazy how far we've come in in two years, because when I was first

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:06.720
 getting into serverless and I had the same question, like, why can't I just pull up my routes on a

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:13.120
 single function? Yeah, overwhelmingly everywhere. It said like bad idea, bad idea, bad idea wrong,

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:18.240
 bad practice, whatever. And I kind of like went along with that. And then eventually I realized like,

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:23.120
 no, that doesn't actually make sense. Like we've gone, it's like this idea of having like a million

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:29.920
 little functions is like a made up solution that sounds good. And it's taking like years for that

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:36.960
 to like become a little bit like correct itself. And it's that kind of stuff like you can't

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:43.040
 if you just go off of the like the again, sanction is a good word, like the AWS sanctions stuff,

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:48.880
 it like you end up in places that aren't fun. Like you end up with these like grand architectures

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:54.640
 that sound good in theory, but just like suck day to day. Yeah, which is why I think AWS never

00:57:54.640 --> 00:58:00.880
 makes it into certain discussions. Yeah, I hope I can, I can be some part of the solution to that.

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:04.800
 Yeah, I think it's been needed for a while. Obviously we are very interested in having

00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:09.360
 something like that. Cool. You guys can just point everybody to my stuff. That'd be great.

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:13.120
 That would be great. Yeah. And yeah, I guess it's fun because like once you have that established,

00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:16.960
 like they're just going to be like infinite stuff. There's always going to be new stuff that's

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:25.040
 changing. I was always so hesitant to like become like tech tutorial teacher guy. I don't know why.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.800
 You're always hesitant for everything. You're always like, I am. I don't want to be

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.760
 ex persona. It's like what? Yeah, what is wrong with me? I'm self-conscious about everything I do,

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:37.680
 but I keep doing things that are like, well, the other day you were like, I feel like I don't have

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:42.320
 an identity, which is like one struggle. And the other side, you're like, I don't want to have an

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:46.800
 identity or I don't want to have this identity. You're like shy away from having. Well, I'm leaning

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:50.720
 into it. I've decided there's lots of people I respect that are teachers and I don't know why

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:54.560
 I had some weird hang up about like tweeting. I think it's just like the there are some like

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:59.360
 grifters that just tweet out like there's a lot more grifters than there are people that are good.

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:04.160
 Yeah, I want to be one of the good ones. I want to be one of the ones that does it right and actually

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:08.720
 helps people. Yeah, it's like, you're not at risk. It's like becoming a grifster. Yeah, I don't think

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:13.440
 so. Yeah, right. It's not like it's not going to happen to you. You know, it's like, okay, I don't

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:17.440
 think it just happens to someone when they turn into a grifster. I think it's. Okay, they started

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:24.800
 out. Okay, got it. Yeah, no, I'm excited for it. I think that's great. Modern, did you get the

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:30.080
 domain? I bet you did. Oh, of course, all of them. All of them. I mean, I'm in negotiations

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:34.960
 divided the dot com, but yeah, all of them. Wait, what do you mean all of them? Why is it not as one?

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:40.720
 I mean, most of the TLDs, most of the ones that the ones that matter, like modern AWS dot dev.

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:43.040
 Yes, of course. That's yes.

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:51.280
 Who owns it dot com? Because there's something I don't know. I use a broker to do all my domain

00:59:51.280 --> 01:00:02.000
 negotiations. Yeah, man, a broker probably loves you. I have a problem. I have an identity, I just

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:10.800
 don't like it. Like my guy. Yeah, that's one of the facets and listens to Huberman, exactly.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:16.480
 Yeah. That's exciting. I want I want this now. Okay, well, you'll get it soon. I'm going to send

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:21.840
 an email to the list and and do the rebrand on the website and all that stuff. Thanks. I really

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:27.200
 have to pee. So I just going to have to pee. It's we're an hour in. I feel like no, we're good.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:33.120
 We did our job. We did an episode episode number 69. 69. What does that even mean?

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.080
 Oh, stop. Can someone tell me in the comments and the replies?

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:41.760
 Can you tag Adam and send him in from me and tell it so he can tell me pictures and

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:49.680
 drive those but I do know what that means. This is a weird ending. This just got kind of weird.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:54.560
 Okay, I'm going to end the thing now. All right. See you. See you next.
