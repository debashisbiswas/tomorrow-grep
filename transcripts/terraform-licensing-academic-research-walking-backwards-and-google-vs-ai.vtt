WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 Ooh, hey, that's nice. It's nice to be heard.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.560
 All right, so if I hit stream in OBS, that doesn't make me go live.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.360
 I have to separately go create a broadcast.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.360
 Like on Twitch, if you hit start streaming, it actually starts the stream on Twitch,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.640
 but you're saying it doesn't on Twitter?

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.840
 Yeah, it doesn't. So I have to go and create a broadcast, which I just did.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.960
 And now I can tweet it. This is going to be our routine, I guess.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.960
 I'm just on your Twitter trying to see it, and I just saw your errors tweet.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.120
 This is good. And then I saw the part where you'll come to my house and slap me.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.880
 If I'm a going dick. Yeah, only going.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.600
 You know what's funny?

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.160
 I wrote that, and I was like, I know some Go Dev is going to say something.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.520
 I'm like very prepared for it.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.760
 And a bunch of people reply being like, you know what, I was going to say something.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.320
 Because I was like, good thing I put that in there. Otherwise it would have gotten annoyed.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 That's awesome. So another one of those big, big posts, you wrote a bunch.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.360
 And one post. Yeah, I've been doing that more.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.480
 Initially, I was like, if I write something long, no one's ever going to read it.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.280
 But I found the opposite. I feel like those, I've had good experience with that.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.000
 Yeah. I don't know if Twitter is doing something where it like is actively promoting longer stuff.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.240
 Isn't it? I remember seeing something at some point in the last two weeks where it was like,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.280
 how much time you spend looking at the tweet is like boost engagement.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.400
 So if they have to read a really long one, they're looking at it a long time, presumably.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.760
 That makes sense. Maybe.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.240
 Yeah. I still try to stick to the format where like it's broken up into bite-sized chunks.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.680
 Because I think that just is like a good way to write. Even before I was on Twitter,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.720
 and I even when I was writing emails, I'd always write in that way.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.960
 Yeah. I'd be like when I would write like big paragraphs, it would just be one big paragraph.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.760
 Yeah. I could just see them like skimming past it or like.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.320
 Can humans even read a long paragraph anymore? Like, is that a thing that we're capable of?

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.880
 Have we evolved out of it? You know what I mean? Blog posts, I guess, have long paragraphs.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.760
 But are blogs just, are they on a trend to zero? Is that how it works? Or is it going to always

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.480
 have a place? I've always been, I've always been a skimmer. I feel like even when I read books,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.080
 it's not that I would like literally skim and skip stuff. I kind of read in this way where I like

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.920
 skim over everything in a page quickly, then like skim it again. Kind of like it's like,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.240
 I am kind of like reading in order, but I'm like, I kind of do it fast as one phase,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.600
 and I do it like a little bit more focused on this as a second phase, and I've always kind of

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.160
 run in that way. So I, the way I read, and this is why I don't read blog posts anymore,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.840
 I'm reading word for word until I get distracted or I think it's something else,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.440
 and then I have to go back to like the last sentence. I'm such a slow reader. I constantly

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.960
 have to go back and reread, because I realized like I wasn't actually paying attention.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.440
 And if I wasn't paying attention, I got to read it again. So I can't skim, I guess.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.400
 I have no skimmer. No skimming bones. I'm imagining you with your finger on the screen

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.760
 of your computer. Follow the words. I have to do it that way. Yeah, keep my focus.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.400
 I do wonder about this. I don't think, I think with a lot of things, there's like always

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.880
 some moral panic over new technology, whatever it is, and it's usually kind of stupid, like,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.760
 I don't even think it's bad if we stop having attention spans. I don't know. It's just the way

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.640
 we're evolving. But go ahead. I get a little worried about it because the flip side is people

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.520
 always point to like, there's some like old news article that's like, books are going to like,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.080
 ruin your children. It just is something like that, where there's like panic around the concept of

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.920
 books. But in the past year, and I've like pulled this back a bit on my recovering,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.080
 I feel like I did go down a path where I was like very much eroding my ability to

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.200
 focus for a while. Oh, yeah, we've talked about this. I think I did too. Yeah, yeah,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.440
 exactly. And there's like all kind of thinking like that just happening to me as I'm like an

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.280
 adult and this stuff is showing up in my life now. And it's impacting me and I'm imagining like,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.240
 I'm seeing all this stuff on that thing they do on TikTok where they have to show you two things.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.920
 They can't show you one thing. They have to show you like the thing and then like,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.640
 the subway surfer thing at the bottom. So you can like, yeah, so you'll actually stick around and

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:59.000
 pay attention. Yeah. And I'm like, that, I don't know if that's good. And I think it just,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.360
 I just noticed I was developing a lot of compulsive behaviors where I would just do stuff without

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.560
 even thinking about it. And it was all reflexive, like, my phone and my finger will automatically

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.840
 hit a certain thing. And suddenly I would be somewhere and I'll be like, why did I get here?

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.200
 And if you need to use your phone for something, there's so many times like I need to look something

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.200
 up or I need to like pull up maps or something. And I end up in some other like, I'm in Twitter.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.520
 And it's like, how do I even I had something I needed to do? And I don't even remember what it was.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.160
 That does feel bad, I guess. Like we're a bunch of zombies. I mean, you have kids, so you can like,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.560
 I imagine myself like getting distracted and like five children, I like forget about them for like

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.040
 30 minutes. I'm like, Oh, shit. You know, I feel like that kind of stuff can't, but you can't let

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.160
 that kind of stuff happen. But yeah, I found this app that it just delays the opening of the app

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.360
 you're trying to open. So like, if I try to open Twitter, it like delays it by 20 seconds. It like

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:59.320
 shows me a loading screen on the web. And that like, no, on my phone on iOS. That's possible.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:06.840
 Well, it's so clever. Because iOS launched this like API for like app actions or like

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.440
 automations or something. So yeah, automation where whenever this app opens, let this other app handle

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.480
 it. And that app will show you a loading screen for 20 seconds and then let you what is it called?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.800
 I want it. That's so brilliant. I was thinking this is some Android thing. And I was like, no,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.560
 I know you got an iPhone. There's I saw it on a Twitter ad, ironically, it's I'm looking at the

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.360
 splash screen. I think it's called like one second or something. It's something like that.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.320
 One second. I literally Oh, here we go. It's called. Okay, open the app. How I figure out the app name.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:45.080
 Oh, it's called one sec. One sec. Okay. Yeah. This is a little bit annoying to set up because,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.480
 you know, iOS isn't what you do this directly. So to kind of like, for each app you want to

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.160
 trigger this on. Yeah. Do you do that? This has worked for you. Like it's helped you

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.080
 not just impulsively open stuff. It's killed the compulsion compulsive behavior. Now whenever I

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.560
 open it, I like I'm doing it very intentionally. And I know what I'm doing. It's and it like tracks

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.000
 how much it reduced your behavior and all that. So it's definitely rewarding in that way.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.040
 The reason I know this works is I a long time ago, I had the same habit with Reddit,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.160
 where whenever my brain would go blank, my reflex would just be to go on my browser and just type

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.000
 Reddit and I suddenly I'd like be on Reddit and like, why did I get here? Yeah. And there was a

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.800
 Chrome extension that just delayed the opening. And that just killed that habit for me entirely.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.160
 It's funny that just a little bit of friction is enough. I mean, that's the whole like atomic

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.200
 habits thing. I mean, there's at least part of the atomic habits book is about that, like putting

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.280
 friction between bad habits and you and then like reducing friction between you and good habits.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.280
 So that one of the 10 books you've read? I don't know. No, I actually haven't read that one,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.600
 but I know it's super popular as Liz Reddit and you've got the you got the gist of it.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.640
 I don't think she's read by I think Alan's read it and that's it. That's like, I feel like I have

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:01.560
 all the people in my life. They have like categories to cover the book. Yeah. Alan is definitely like

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.760
 the life hacking category. Yeah. Okay. Person. So he always summarizes those things for me.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.200
 Does Alan? Okay. So I feel like I've gotten into life hacking a little bit,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.520
 mostly because I'm feeling the age thing. We've talked about it a lot of the podcasts.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.840
 Yeah. You're definitely in that category too. Yeah. Like I'm doing the sauna. I'm doing the

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.600
 the cold plunging. Is that life hacking? And does Alan do those things? He definitely 100%. Like you

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.920
 and like all this stuff that you listed. Yeah. I'm sure he saw that list and just was like,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:36.040
 I'm he probably just wanted to try to like buy a bunch of that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.760
 Like I don't think I'm like in the life hacks, but I guess that's kind of it's like sophisticated

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:46.440
 life hacks. It's like, I don't know, when someone like Wim Hof tells you to like get cold exposure,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.080
 you feel like he's like a shaman or something. I don't know. It feels spiritual. It doesn't feel

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:58.600
 like a airport book. That's like, here's how to improve your whatever relationships. I don't know.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.280
 What are they? What are they trying to sell? Yeah. I know you mean it's like, it's more tangible.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.120
 There's like, and I, it's like, I actually believe in all that stuff. Like a lot of stuff is really

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.280
 effective. Well, yeah. Most of it, there's science. I mean, like, I mostly don't do stuff unless

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:16.360
 there's your favorite life. There's science. I mean, there's like papers. There's like peer

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:23.240
 reviewed papers. It's helping. I don't like to do things if I don't know there's been some study

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:29.880
 that has proven some non placebo effect. Okay. I only do things like that. I have a take on this

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.360
 and you're going to shatter my worldview. Go ahead. Sort of. I think, I think I like disagree

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.680
 with that concept. So here, here's a science. Oh, you disagree with science. Okay. Go ahead,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:45.240
 Dax. It's not the concept of science. I think I disagree with the vast majority of academic

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.080
 research. So I'll give you. So I was talking, so for background, so Liz spent the first part of her

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.960
 career in academic research. And she's described to me so much about those environments. And I've

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:01.080
 heard like beyond just from her, like so much about how those environments work. That just makes me

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.720
 like lose faith in a lot of it because it's kind of broken fundamentally. I think there's different

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:12.840
 categories of things. I think there's certain fields that the general idea of it is most academic

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.000
 research is kind of BS. You can kind of make up whatever thing you want. The incentives are not

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.640
 really around finding truth that's around like some of these other things. Yeah. So you can find

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:27.720
 competing like to. Yeah, they can find whatever, whatever you want. So studies that prove opposite

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.040
 points. Yeah. I like kind of an annoyed, I'm annoyed by everyone on this on involved in this

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:38.200
 process. Right. And the thing we were talking about the other day is I saw a paper that was like,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:46.440
 some academic paper that shows that trigger warnings are not effective. Okay, so what a trigger warning

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.240
 is is a trigger warning. Like, this is like, it's okay, this is a stupid concept that came out where

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.720
 people have certain trauma. And when you might potentially talk about things in that category,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:03.000
 you like say trigger warning for people blah, blah, blah, blah. It's a really dumb concept. It's

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.720
 like a way it's like trying to like formalize being sensitive or like communicating effectively

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.880
 into the stupid set of rules. Yeah. So from the beginning, I knew this maze that makes no sense.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.880
 Like anyone with intuition and can think about this and knows that this is a concept that doesn't

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:23.720
 make any sense. But then there was a research study on this concept. The research study,

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.720
 I also think makes no sense because you can like, how are you going to really research something

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.320
 like this? Like, you really can't put together an effective research study. So I think one of the

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:36.040
 people that made up this concept, dumb, the people then that went and did a research study,

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:42.440
 also dumb, they did find it has no, like it's not effective. So it kind of reflects what

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:48.040
 my instinct was. Yeah. But I also think people that want to cite that are also dumb. I want to like

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.560
 kill its entire process. It's like, when it comes to these like psychology and sociology things,

00:11:53.560 --> 00:12:00.280
 it's like the research around that stuff. I just, I feel like we would get out of the mindset of like,

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.080
 Oh, papers are the thing. Yeah, that proves it. Because it's like, you can find competing

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.160
 results for like anything. It's pretty noisy. That applies for you across the board for all

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.680
 areas. Because it's like, I agree with the psychology, sociology stuff. But what about like

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:21.800
 biosciences like medical health? It just it depends. I think I think we try to treat everything like

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:27.560
 physics. And we like run the same process for everything. That's why obviously for the stuff like

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:33.240
 psychology just doesn't work. That's so far away from something like physics. And there's a spectrum.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:39.080
 Even with the biology stuff, I feel like just the body is so, so complex. I'm not discounting all

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:45.000
 research in entirely, of course, it's how we make progress. But usually on a list of reasons why

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.840
 I'm like sold by something, like that part of it is lower is lower. That's low on the read. Yeah.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:57.320
 Okay. You should try cold. Do you do any cold exposure? Because I'm telling you, it feels amazing.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:03.000
 It feels so good. It doesn't feel good in the moment. But after like for hours after,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.440
 there's just this afterglow. You get like five minutes and a cold plunge at really cold temperatures.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:14.280
 I can't describe. I believe it. I have 100% believe it. It's just not this is not going to be my

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:20.200
 thing. I literally moved to Miami to do you like do you like the heat? I mean, you're in Miami.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:25.160
 Do you like a sauna? I definitely done a bunch of steam rooms and saunas. And I do enjoy them. I

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:32.040
 think they're great. So the cold plunge, I can kind of like this is probably not the same, but I can

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.680
 kind of relate to a little bit like growing up in my parents had a pool and we also had a hot tub.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:42.040
 Yeah. So at night when it got cold, we don't go into the hot tub, get super hot. Yeah. You would

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.960
 jump into like the freezing cold water. Uh huh. And then just stay there for as long as we could,

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.480
 then we would swim back into the hot tub and we'd do this back and forth. And it did feel like

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.880
 feels good. It felt right. I don't know. Contrast therapy. That's what that is right there.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.880
 Yeah. Oh, there you go. There's a name for it. There's a name for it. There's a name for

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:05.640
 everything that's it's in the papers. You should check them out. Do you read the papers or do you

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:10.360
 are you just satisfied? I don't read the papers. No, I just, um, as long as someone tells me there's

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.120
 a paper, you just say like, Oh, there's a paper that proves something. That's a checkbox for me

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.800
 in my mind. I'm not going to read the paper. I wouldn't know what to do with it if I read it.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.040
 Have you ever, have you done any like Wim Hof breathing? I've tried it because it's like,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.640
 it's insane how immediately effective it is, right? Like his approach. It is so yeah. I like,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:33.240
 I've tried meditation. I've tried like the headspace app and like, I've generally not resonated with,

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.520
 I don't know, clearing my thoughts and like being in a meditative state that I feel like is the

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:45.240
 closest thing that feels like when I deflate that like after 30 breaths and just hold the breath

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.440
 for 90 seconds or whatever, that state I'm in is the most relaxed I ever feel. Like I just feels

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.360
 really good to me. And it doesn't go any further than that. Like I don't care if there's an explanation.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:59.800
 It's just like, I feel really good at the end of that cycle of breaths. So I do love the Wim Hof

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:05.000
 breathing. Nice. Yeah. Jay is super into meditation. I think he meditates every morning and he's gone

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.160
 to a really good place with it. I think he's like, he's been on and off in his life. And right now,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.440
 he's in like this really steady, like he's been doing it for a while. It's like a thing that I

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.920
 always want to come back to like, it's an aspirational thing of mine. Because I know, I mean, the like,

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:23.640
 extreme examples where people just through meditation can enter into like, transited states. I mean,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.600
 just like, sort of like psychedelics, like they can. Yeah. And any state you can get to with a drug,

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.560
 you can technically like get to get there on your own. Yeah. That just blows my mind. So I do like

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:38.040
 aspire to get there one day, but I'm not, I've not been able to progress much when I've tried.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:43.720
 Yeah. Yeah. It is challenging. It's amazing. Like the Wim Hof breathing takes, I don't know,

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:49.400
 like 12 minutes or something, like to just do the normal, like set of three rounds or whatever.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.480
 And it's amazing how hard it is just every morning that's like set aside 12 minutes.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.360
 It's like, I just want to get straight to work. I want to get straight into something I'm on. And

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.000
 it's amazing. Like it's 12 minutes. I'll spend that time waiting on the Twitter app or whatever.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.920
 Like, yeah, it's so stupid. Yeah. It's just, it's just a habit. It's, um, you know, the habit I

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.960
 told you about last week, my walking backwards in the morning while blowing bubbles. Oh, yeah.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:20.120
 Been doing it. Yeah. This week. I went for a long walk yesterday. I like to put like a ruck sack.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.600
 Like it's like 30 pounds of weight. And I did like at least 10 minutes of my hour walk. I did

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.680
 backward. And my knee, I honestly, I feel like it's already feeling better. I don't know how

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:33.480
 that's possible, but the inflammation in my knee is down is it's amazing. Some things,

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.400
 some things are just like that. I think there's just like, you've never walked backwards. When

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.880
 you start doing it and immediately you're going to get some benefit. It's, it's that elbow thing.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:46.520
 I tell the tennis elbow is gone after like two days of using this little thing. Yeah,

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.000
 it is crazy. I quickly, you can, you can fix some of those things if you just find the right trick.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.760
 But yeah, I feel like I was walking, I feel like a sensation in the back of my knee where I like,

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.880
 I feel like it's getting worked out in a way that it's never been worked out before. And I feel

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:07.320
 like some kind of strength as a, like related to that. So yeah, let's get, let's get a little check

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:11.560
 on your physical activity here, Dax. Have you gotten back to it? Are you still using the

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.800
 old? I should probably get my knee a little longer. You know, you know, it's really stupid.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:22.440
 So I hurt my ankle two days ago. Are you kidding me? I'm just on this terrible trend. Was it walking

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:26.360
 backwards, blowing bubbles that you hurt your ankle? I like hype, I kind of like hyper extent,

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.280
 because I was doing some of these knee exercises and that kind of hyper extent in my ankle. And it

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:35.000
 felt totally fine. And like later in the day, I like got up and I was like, Oh man, that doesn't

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.680
 feel good. Oh no, it's basically back to normal. But I think by then this week, this week was

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.280
 supposed to be my week back. I was going to go back to Jim and do anything. Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.360
 Yeah, that's why I'm checking in on it. Yeah, this ankle thing. Delayed it a little bit.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.200
 I broke my toe like two months ago. You broke it. It's just how? How do you break your toe?

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.440
 You know how toes break that are just kind of like fractured and they use. No, I've never,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.320
 I've never broken a bone. I don't know. I don't know how anything breaks. I'm made of steel.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:07.080
 I just slammed it into like, I was coming back inside my house to the back door. And I like

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:12.520
 just stupidly slammed it straight into like the step. Oh, and I had no shoes on.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:21.400
 Oh, I don't know. Yeah, yeah. I am alive. Yeah. And I was like, well, that's definitely broken.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:27.400
 And there was one thing that like there's something you can do for you just tape it to the next toe.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.120
 It's like kind of annoying and they take forever to fully heal. It doesn't really stop you from doing

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.200
 like a nagging because you're still walking on it. I mean, you can't. Yeah, it's not been. I was

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.520
 like working out. I know it was all fine, but if you broke another bones, like, is this a common

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.760
 collarbone? You've broken your collarbone. It's a very, it's a classic. I'm like, I could actually

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.640
 participate in that Reddit, but no broken bones Reddit. Have you seen that? No, is that a thing?

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.920
 Oh, it's a thing. There's a Reddit for people who've never broken their bones. And as soon as

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.200
 somebody like breaks a bone, they post there and it's like, you're out and they kick them out.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.000
 Wow. They broke a bone and they're so sad that they're no longer part of the Reddit.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.440
 You should check it out. The subreddit. That's really funny. Wait, but you don't remember the name

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.760
 exactly. You've been injured though, because you hurt your like, tore your in. Yeah, I've had like,

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.880
 like, ligament injuries. I've never, never broken a bone now.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.280
 Maybe jiu-jitsu will, will push that to the limit. Maybe I'll break a rib or something.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.560
 Do people break things and jiu-jitsu at those mostly like tears and stuff?

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.280
 Ribs. People bruise and break ribs. Oh, wow. I think that's probably the most susceptible to a

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:32.040
 break. Rib, rib injury seem like the worst. It's like breathing. Yeah, exactly. Everything just,

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:37.640
 you're, you can't really keep it stable for any period of time. You're always breathing.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:41.640
 I've got all kinds of little bumps and bruises now. Like my fingers, my knuckles are getting so

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.960
 thick. Like they say you've got little micro fractures. Just from, yeah, just from all the

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.840
 gripping. I'm going to have these like arthritic, lumpy hands and I just.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.760
 Well, it might be good for it, isn't it? I don't know. That's kind of a thing last week. I think

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.920
 the thing that that physical therapist actually taught me was arthritis where

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:05.720
 her point was everyone has arthritis and some parts of her body, because all it is just like,

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.600
 stuff degenerating. Yeah. Then they use it less and then it just gets,

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.560
 it just kind of speeds up. It's deterioration. Yeah. So using it, if you keep using it,

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.720
 the arthritis isn't bad. Yeah. Like you might still have like some level of like

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:24.920
 discomfort or pain with it, but it'll like stay flat as opposed to getting worse. Yeah. Yeah.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:30.440
 So I'm going to change the topic because I'm talking about it. Oh, about our bodies. Yeah,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.880
 sorry. I'm, the last thing I'll say, I'm just, it's, I've never been obsessed with a physical

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.480
 activity before. So this is very new to me. Wait, is that true though? I don't know when you play

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.360
 sports and I was never that into it. I was like big and athletic. I had to play basketball because

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.360
 like my friends played basketball and I was like a foot taller than everybody. So I didn't have

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.440
 an option. Okay. I was like, I was a pretty good football player, but I never really was that

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.520
 into it. I didn't ever think about football if I wasn't on the football field. Like, okay,

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:02.280
 this has been like 24 hours a day. I am consumed with getting better at Jiu Jitsu. So it's just like,

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:08.600
 I've, my full obsession laser beam that I throw at things and it's a physical activity. So it's

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:15.080
 very new to me. Sorry. I've talked so much about my aging, aching body. I'll stop. But I'm competing

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.040
 at tournament amounts. You're probably going to hear more of it because like it's all I'm

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.760
 thinking about. Sorry. Tech. Let's talk about tech or something. Yeah. Yeah. So do we talk about

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:28.200
 the Terraform licensing change? No. And I know very little. I just know they made some licensing

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:34.040
 changes. Could you please inform me? Yeah. Yeah. So so hash a corp, the company behind a few major

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.640
 open source projects. I think people mostly know from Terraform, but there's a bunch of other stuff

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:45.400
 that they run as well, like vault and console and Nomad. They just make a bunch of like infrastructure,

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:51.640
 low level type open source products. Is this another benevolent dictator situation?

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:57.240
 No, I think it's a good different pattern that that shows up. So they they've started as an

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.920
 open source company. So everything they did was open source and they were following the model of,

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:05.480
 okay, we have an open source products and they're going to be open source because they make

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.920
 sense to be open source. We want them to spread as much as possible. We want an ecosystem to build

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.040
 on top of them. And then we're going to have some adjacent products that are more enterprise

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:20.200
 focus that are paid to sustain the whole thing. And they've been extremely successful as a company,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:31.320
 right? They like IPO, they're public company and all that. But they aren't actually doing super well.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:39.080
 And they recently made a major decision to move all of their products under a different license

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:46.840
 called the business source license. And this is an interesting model where it's not the same as

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.760
 taking something open source and then making it close source. Everything is still like the code

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:58.120
 is still available. And it's always going to be available. But you cannot use their products

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:06.120
 to build a competing product. So if you are an end user of Terraform, if you use Terraform to

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.360
 run up your infrastructure or whatever, you're fine. It doesn't really affect.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:18.360
 Yeah, it doesn't really affect end users. But SST. Yeah. So we potentially wanted to

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:23.240
 use Terraform to build SST on top of it. And there's a bunch of companies that have already

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.480
 done this. There's a big company called Spacelift that's been pretty successful on building a product

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:33.960
 on top of Terraform. Very successful, actually. People prefer it to Terraform's kind of equivalent

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:42.600
 product. So it goes after kind of competitive companies. I hate this situation. I think it's

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:48.360
 a really bad situation for a few reasons. I'm generally fine with business source licenses like

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:53.720
 this because there are situations that you want to prevent. If you build a database,

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.680
 you don't necessarily want AWS to provide a managed version of it without paying you.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.680
 Yeah. That's not a good situation. That's kind of...

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.280
 Right? I mean, yeah, with the last second. That's kind of... And Mongo, right? Or no,

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.880
 they didn't use Mongo. They just made a similar product. No, they did. And they have a good

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:13.640
 Mongo compatible products that no one uses. Yeah. Is that document to be? Yeah, anyway.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:20.120
 Remember Rick Wollihan was like ranting about it? That was so good. That was worth the trip to

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:28.920
 re-event. Yeah, that one hour. So that's fine. But I don't think it makes sense universally.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.680
 I think there's some tools that are low level. So you imagine something like a programming

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.360
 language, right? Imagine something like Go. Yeah. Imagine if Google was like,

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:41.720
 if you're end user of Go, that's fine. But you can't use Go to build a competing product.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.520
 That kind of kills the entire concept of using Go, right? For something foundational like a

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.400
 programming language, you need to be as open as, you know, widely available as possible. So I can

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.760
 spread to all the places that I can possibly spread to. Yeah. Yeah.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:01.080
 And the reason HashiCorp is doing this, my take on it is because they actually failed the product.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.440
 If you look at all the products they tried to build, they're extremely good at building

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:10.040
 the actual tools. Yeah. But all the SaaS software they try to build, they just failed. They just

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:14.600
 fail to execute on it. And there are competitors that actually did a better job. It's particularly

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:20.760
 damning because it's really weird when a competitor uses your tool to build a better product.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:27.000
 Because you have all the advantages possible. First to it, you have like way more influence on it.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.920
 Like, imagine if someone built a better host for Next.js than Versailles. That would be like a

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.480
 really bad fit. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Right. So that's a situation they're in,

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:43.560
 and they're choosing to try to like tighten and squeeze now instead of kind of foundation

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.000
 every thinking of what their actual problem is. They just fail at the business model side of

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.880
 the face. Yeah. So some of these examples of companies that are built on top, are they now

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:57.240
 feeling this? They have to like, what, pay HashiCorp or abandon the thing? Like, what do they do?

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:03.480
 Yeah. It's a tricky situation because, okay, so the way this stuff works is they can't retroactively

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.120
 apply this. So the current version of Terraform, and I think this license doesn't go into effect

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.880
 immediately. So I think there's another, either to the end of the year, there's another year or

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:17.400
 something like that. There will be a version of Terraform that will forever be open source.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:23.800
 It just cannot ingest any changes made after a certain point. So any like bug fixes,

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:28.760
 features, security patches, you can't just suck those in directly. Yeah. So at this point,

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.360
 a lot of these companies, they're going to like go to the legal process to see what actually is

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:37.800
 the case. Like, it's very unclear. A lot of the companies are saying, oh, we think we're actually

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:42.200
 in compliance based off what their licenses says. I don't think that's a case. I think the license

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.800
 is intentionally a little bit vague. So they can like case by case aside, like, we're fine with

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.640
 this company using it. We're not fine with this company using it. I think a lot of companies are

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.960
 going to, they're not going to be fine in this situation. So there just be a fork.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.760
 Yeah. Oh, a fork. Okay. So I was going to ask, like, they're just stuck on that version of

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.480
 the products that they're building on top of that you're saying they'll just fork it and make changes

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.600
 as they need to, like a community led thing right now. I think they're going about it in a good way.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.880
 Right now they established something called open terraform, which is not yet a fork. It is just

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:21.320
 right now, like a, like a plea to hash a corpse saying like reconsider. And here's like

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:27.320
 a hundred companies that have said, we want you to reconsider. And if you don't, we're going to

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.960
 commit X amount of resources to maintaining a fork. Yeah. So from hashtag course point of view,

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:36.520
 like they should consider it. I think a fork is not good for anyone. But if they don't,

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:41.720
 I think we end up in a much better situation actually because now you have a bunch of different

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:46.840
 companies. No one company failing is going to affect this project. It's big enough where there's

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.720
 enough companies that are going to support it. And that some of the companies compete with each

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:54.920
 other. So it kind of like brings that situation. I think that's a good thing. Yeah. It's maybe like

00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:00.760
 really like reconsider what kind of open source can work. I feel like anything this low level and

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:06.520
 this foundational, it just has to either be supported by something like this, where it's a group of

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:11.480
 different companies that are like, no one company failing is going to affect it, or just like in

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:17.240
 some kind of foundation and set up. Why does this remind my dumb brain of Docker? Is there any

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:24.600
 parallel to like? Yeah. I think I think Docker is a great example of what like hash a corpse

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.560
 worst fear in a lot of ways. Docker what is a runtime. And it's extremely hard to come with a

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.880
 business model around a runtime because the point of a runtime is it runs somewhere else, right?

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:39.320
 Yeah. So all the places people are running things are just going to support your runtime and profit

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:45.240
 off of it. So yeah, Docker runs on AWS on Google Cloud on like literally everywhere. And they

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.560
 almost feel as a company, they're like literally almost went to zero. They had a great turnaround

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.240
 story because it came up with a completely different way to make money. Oh, they did. I didn't know

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:58.040
 that. Yeah. They actually just charge for Docker desktop now, which I don't really understand why

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:02.680
 people play for. But really, I hate that I have Docker desktop on my machine. I can't imagine paying

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:06.920
 for it. Yeah. I think I guess because I'm back, you like kind of need it. Yeah. I mean,

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.560
 yeah. Emulate or run a VM or something. Unfortunately, it seems like there's always a project that

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:17.000
 makes me download Docker again. And then I delete it when I don't need it. Yeah, exactly. So I don't

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.840
 know how long this is going to last. I feel like eventually there's even going to be an open source

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:26.040
 version of that. But they hit like a hundred million hour like, oh, wow, two years after almost

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.200
 being dead. I didn't know that turnaround story. Again, where do you read these? Is this a Wall Street

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:37.960
 Journal? What are you? I don't know. I just feel like when you're, I'm just in the dead tool space,

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.840
 I guess, I would have been always hearing about this stuff from other founders and things. I think

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:49.240
 there was like a big write up on this. Like just like a good business case to learn from. But yeah,

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.880
 it is really pick your brain more. There's a lot in there. There's a lot of stuff. I mean,

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.800
 I feel like that's what this podcast is. I pick your brain quite a bit, but I'm not taking advantage

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.360
 of it enough. I feel like I can ask you any random question. And you've probably got an answer,

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:06.760
 some well informed. I'm just going to run out of stuff eventually. I don't really want you to

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.000
 increase your rate. I think your rate of consumption of my knowledge is good. I think we're at a good

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.960
 place. Okay, we'll just keep this pace. Yeah. I want to get beyond 100. Like 100 is a milestone,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:22.360
 and I'm very excited about or halfway episodes, 100 episodes. Yeah. Yeah. Not 100% of your knowledge.

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:30.200
 I don't know what that means. Yeah. But yeah, so it is similar to Docker and that like sometimes

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:35.080
 it is hard to figure out a business model around open source. I think it's always possible. I think

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.200
 if you are good enough a product and if you're good enough and creative enough to think about

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.200
 business money, you care from the beginning to make sure that you have that in place. So the whole

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:48.440
 thing is sustainable. I think it's very doable. But yeah, it's just a situation where again, they

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.880
 kind of grew up in a time where just fundraising was super easy. So I think they got to a really

00:30:53.880 --> 00:31:00.040
 crazy place very quickly. And now that it's kind of like, okay, yeah, pay up for where you are. And

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:05.720
 yeah, the investors are looking. I'm sure that the thing that happens is if you're doing well,

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:09.400
 you can run your business however you want. You can do whatever and same thing you want. No one

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.600
 is going to think twice. Everything you do is a genius move because you business is doing well.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:18.120
 Yeah. The moment it starts to not do well, suddenly there's like opinions everywhere. So I'm sure,

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:23.640
 yeah, the big shareholders of hash a corporate looking at them being like, you have this much

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:30.280
 adoption. You have competitors making money. Why are you allowing this? So there's probably

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.320
 a crazy amount of pressure, but it's all very short term because this eventually just kills

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:38.280
 what Terraform could continue to grow and be because if it's if it's not this ecosystem,

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.280
 you know, it does it does get hurts. But that's kind of what they're suffering from.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:47.080
 Yeah, I wondered when you first started into the they're not doing well, how much of that was the

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:54.280
 macro stuff. Yeah, hope that's a I don't know why am I am I at pessimist? I still feel like the

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.680
 shoe hasn't dropped on all that stuff. Like it's going to take years for all of it unraveled,

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:05.000
 but I don't know. Maybe AI will save the space. Maybe they'll just be so much advancement. Did

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.560
 that sound like a joke? I was a new joke. No, I don't think it's a joke. I think that but that is

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:14.280
 you are hinting at the larger pattern. There's inflationary things that happen, which are very

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.680
 visible, but there's constant there's constantly deflationary stuff that's happening in like a

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:25.160
 million different ways that is very invisible. So an AI is one of them. Can I ask you a question

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.360
 that now I wonder if you know the answer if you could tell me about something that I heard a

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.960
 little snippet about? Yeah. Did you hear anything about the Google AI search stuff? Like what Bing's

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:38.360
 doing the Google's doing it now? I saw someone post a screenshot and I didn't look into it any

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:43.000
 more than that. Yeah, I looked into it either. And I'm very curious what what it is, what that means.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.440
 From what I saw, it looked like they're going to show you AI results. AI type L like LOM type

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:53.720
 results alongside normal results. Is that what I was alongside? Oh, maybe. I don't know.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:59.560
 That's what I'm asking. I wish you knew. Here, I was just talking about how you know everything.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.800
 And then you didn't. My knowledge cuts off at 2021.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:12.280
 Yeah, I do wonder from a product perspective what the right way is because right now we have

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:17.560
 like a very focused experience of LOMs where you're like, I have a problem and I'm going to use now

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.200
 that the catch up to solve it and you have a very focused experience. I think that actually

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.960
 works pretty well. It worked better. It works better than I thought it would. I thought I would

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.440
 never develop that habit, but I have developed it now. Yeah. But this idea of like mixing together

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:35.320
 both things that does sound like a good idea. But I do wonder if it's just better to like

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:39.960
 have two completely separate experiences. Yeah, I don't know if we talked about like

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:45.240
 Google search, any of that stuff because it's something that's very top of mind for me.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:50.360
 No, what are you thinking? I mean, just wondering like what the trend over the next five years looks

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:56.760
 like, like, is Google's business of just selling ads on search result pages? Is that actually in

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:02.920
 jeopardy? Like the initial reaction when opening I launched at GPT, it was like, Google is dead.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:09.240
 And I don't know, like, I think everyone came off that a little bit, but is there some trend toward

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:15.880
 like, this is a better way to index and search information on the web, like throw it all into

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:20.520
 these giant models? I don't know. Is there like a fundamental change coming? I think yes,

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:25.320
 for a lot of types of queries. But remember, we still don't have a great solution for integrating

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:33.640
 into information. So anything that's somewhat real time, by real time, it's really like within the

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:39.720
 past year, you can't use an LM for any of that. Yeah, I guess like, I assume that that problem goes away.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:45.640
 But I don't know how. I mean, like the plugin stuff, what about that? Like, they can use plugins to

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:55.640
 search the plugins can like, can like do actions on a target, which can emulate searching.

00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:01.560
 Like there's some that search the web, like you can give them URLs and they'll fetch data from it.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.640
 But they're like using Google to do that, you know? Oh, yeah. Well, that's the other thing.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:09.160
 Like, I think it's like the chicken egg thing with Stack Overflow. It's like, oh, Stack Overflow

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:14.760
 traffic is tanking. It's like, what's going to happen when there's no new information? Yeah,

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:19.560
 because that's what it's all fed off of or feeding off. Yeah, like I said, I don't, I don't understand.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.720
 You know, this reminds me so much of, and it might, this might be completely unrelated. Do you know

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:34.280
 the thing with radiated steel? No. LK99? No. Okay. So I don't remember the exact detail. So I'm

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:39.480
 sure I'm going to get some details wrong. But generally, ever since we started blowing up nuclear

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:47.160
 bombs, just on earth, the level of like background radiation has changed in the world. So when we

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:55.160
 produce steel now, it like impacts how the steel comes out, which is fine for most cases. But for

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.960
 highly precise scenarios, like building a Geiger counter, like building a thing that detects radiation,

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:06.360
 you actually can't use modern manufactured steel. Do you have to make it on the moon or something?

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:13.400
 Well, they recycle steel produced before a certain day. Whoa, that sucks. So there's a limited amount

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.480
 of that. And it just kind of, but I think, I think the use cases right now are narrow. So I

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:22.360
 think we're fine. I think similarly, I think carbon dating also has been impacted. I think,

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:28.120
 I forgot what it is. I think the amount of carbon that you find on average in organic matter has

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:32.440
 changed over the years. So like, you have to adjust for that. Yeah. But it's similar, it's

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.920
 similar to the thing, because I'm like, now the AI is out. There's like a moment in time where

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:44.200
 LLMs came out. And there's like a now, after that time, content that exists is some percentage

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:48.600
 produced by humans, some percentage produced by LMS. Prior to that point, you can just ingest

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:54.680
 all content, because all content was produced by humans for this part. So at this point, it's like,

00:36:54.680 --> 00:37:01.480
 if you're going to read, refeed in new data that is being created, some of that data is output

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:07.960
 from that same from the LLMs. Yeah. Yeah. I see how you tied that with the nuclear bomb study.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:13.800
 That was, that was some expert level tying together. That was impressive. So I see the

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:20.760
 is it bad though? Is it bad that it ingest its own, like, if other LLMs even are creating content

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.400
 and like, some bigger model is being constructed that ingest that stuff, what does that mean?

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:33.160
 Is it like in inbred models? Yeah, kind of, right. I think there's a there's a situation where

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:39.720
 below a certain threshold, it makes you worse. It's like poison. Yeah. But if you ever get past

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.960
 certain threshold, you immediately hit like the singularity, right? Because it's like, it's like

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:48.680
 learning and feeding on itself infinite, like recursion of. Yeah. And I think there's like a

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.560
 spectrum. I think there is like processes where like outputs are like refed back into inputs and

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:59.160
 retrained, but in like a very like specific and controlled way. But like, just generally

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:04.680
 ingesting data, I feel like the whole, I mean, the whole problem from the beginning has been like

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:09.720
 having clearly labeled clean data. Yeah. That was like the massive part of like

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:15.000
 the intensive effort that it took to build these things. And it just gets harder now,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.040
 because now it's like way more way more. Yeah, I feel throughout a lot of stuff. Yeah.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:27.720
 Yeah. I do wonder. Are people just like creating whole websites of AI content and like trying to

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:35.720
 game SEO stuff and like build big? I bet that has to be happening, right? It's such low value

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:42.760
 behavior. I know. I hate that idea so much. I just like, you really have to do this. Like,

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.640
 I know there's people are going to be doing this, but like, can we just not? You know, it's like,

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:51.880
 we just not anything else to do with your life. There's any, anything else. There's definitely

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.760
 been some articles I've ended up on where I'm like, it's just a human. Did a human write this.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:01.480
 I didn't stay long. Yeah. I mean, even before all this stuff came out, this is already a thing

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:07.480
 because in like the finance world, when news comes out so quickly, a lot of the articles,

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.600
 people are consuming them in the posts, we're just like written using a bunch of heuristics,

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:17.160
 like, okay, earnings came out if this, if that, if that is just article. Oh, there's a company that

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:22.360
 did that. I know exactly what you're talking about and I can't remember. Yeah. They did it for sports,

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:27.240
 which is in my, in my alley a little bit. Same thing. I think that's like real time.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.480
 It's like box for comes out and they just crank out this like report of what happened in the game

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.920
 and it sounds kind of like color commentary, but it's just like a bunch of rules. Yeah.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:41.160
 Yeah, exactly. And now, so I'm sure people are doing that with, with LMS, but yeah, I don't know.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:48.760
 We'll see. Will they get better? How much better will they get? I think even if they don't get any

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:54.760
 better, there's still like decades of work. Now we can do, I'm going to grade them into places

00:39:54.760 --> 00:40:00.840
 and make things more efficient. But yeah, that's always the fun part. Yeah. Have you done any more

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:05.080
 digging? Are you, are you like still pursuing the LM thing? Now that you don't have to rewrite

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:11.240
 SST and Terraform, you've got some time in your hands. No man. No rerunning SST and Terraform. I still,

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:16.680
 I'm still hoping that Terraform thing plays out where we can, we can use it. Yeah. I'm talking to

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:22.600
 the Pulumi people to see what, uh, how they're doing things. Yeah. I think they put Pulumi. Yeah.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:27.160
 I still want to do that. I feel like I'd still love Terraform. I think it's a really, really great tool.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:35.000
 The old works really well. Like no tool is perfect, but I think like compared to what we have in with CDK

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.440
 and CloudFormation, and it is just so much better. So I think about that every day, every day I wake

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:44.280
 up and I'm like, I see all the issues SST has and just like, this is in Terraform. This wouldn't be

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:49.800
 a problem. Yeah. I'm so casually reading about all the all the stuff. Just like, it's kind of like

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.920
 what I read before I go to sleep. I try to like look up some random stuff. Have you been on any,

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:59.880
 any car path, the video, YouTube trails? No, I have. I remember that I remember that guy from like

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:06.280
 years ago when I tried to get the machine learning like in the previous era of all this. Um, no,

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:12.120
 I've even gone super. I'm not my approach hasn't really been like, I'm going to learn this topic.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:18.360
 It's been more like, I'm trying to, if I'm trying to do a specific thing, I feel like AI can help

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:24.920
 this. And I'm trying to like reverse into how it could could do that. Yeah. Um, because basically

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:29.960
 what I'm hoping to find out is here's a whole, like I'm trying to identify a category of products

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:34.680
 that people are going to build, uh, or category of features and pros people are going to build

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:41.160
 and figure out what gap there is from AWS bedrock to that and figure out, okay, here's what we need

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:45.160
 to do. So let's bridge that necessity. Yeah, it makes sense. Yeah, like we might be nothing.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.760
 And hopefully it is nothing, but it likely is going to be something. Yeah.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.240
 Yeah, there's track record there, I think.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:42:01.400
 I think I don't have to pee. Like I haven't drank much, but I do need to eat. I haven't eaten yet

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:05.960
 today. Now you need to eat. Can you tell I'm very low energy. I'm just, I'm in a great mood,

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:11.400
 but I am fading. I'm fading. Yeah. It's, we got to remember, well, you also, you also did this

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.240
 morning. So I'm sure you're tired. I was three hours of just, too. I had a private lesson at the end.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:20.840
 So I am, I am hungry. I'm going to eat a lot. We got to set a rule for the podcast. Like the

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:26.200
 time that we start is not that important. So we should always eat beforehand. I think it's true.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:31.800
 We should always eat before. Yeah. I feel like I'm so zapped and not very fun. Sorry.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:37.240
 I don't want to just like, you know, just crank them out just because we can. We gotta, we gotta

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:41.160
 make them good. I want to make the podcast. We need to take some like performance enhancing.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:46.520
 Yeah. There you go. PEDs for podcasting. Like what would that like? Probably the same stuff you

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:53.240
 take for weightlifting. No, I just laugh thinking because like so many podcasts advertise like

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:58.280
 alpha brain, like here's like your pill for your brain. I feel like that's a good, such a podcast

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:03.320
 commercial thing. Yeah. Alpha brain. Let's do it. Maybe that's what we need to caffeine always works.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:08.040
 Do you do? Do you do caffeine daily? Do I do. No, I don't. I don't drink any. I mean, I think

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.280
 I'm the kombucha. I drink. I'm sure has some out of caffeine. Are you still on the golden pineapple

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.520
 kombucha's? Oh, yeah. I got one in the fridge. Let me count. Let me count. Oh, I've got a whole

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:23.240
 bunch of three, four. Oh, this is five bottles behind five bottles. Yeah. I've got one in the fridge.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:29.480
 That's half empty. But this, can you see this? I don't know where the camera looks fancy. They

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:34.520
 have stuff like that. They have stuff that looks like that nose art. You're so funny.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.760
 It's a watermelon juice with pineapple in it. There's always pineapple. I don't drink something

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:44.600
 if there's not pineapple involved, but it's delicious. Mela, they make a passion fruit version and a

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:49.000
 straight watermelon version. Delicious and watermelon juice. Well, we got there's a paper. We got to

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.360
 go for the nutrition facts. Oh, yeah, we will. Do they add sugar? Is it? Oh, no, there's no sugar.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.640
 No, it's from the watermelon. There's sugar from the watermelon, but the ingredients are

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:06.040
 watermelon juice, pineapple juice, vitamin C, natural flavors. Nice. That's pretty good. Mela.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.200
 They're really, it's just like watermelon juice. And did you know there's a paper about how

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.280
 watermelon juice right after you work out? They're actually recovering. They're actually.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:21.480
 I haven't read it, but I trust it. It's delicious. This is a big fan of watermelon juice.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:26.360
 It's not carbonated. It's different than drinking a kombucha. It's a little lighter. It's just like

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:30.520
 fruit juice. I wasn't joking when I said they have stuff that looks like that in the Ozarks.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:35.240
 Like when I see that, okay, so for people that are listening. Oh, really? It's this like neon green

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:41.400
 like branded thing. It's actually yellow. But my camera might just be very good.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:49.880
 I'm I'm bad with color. So it just looks like so like brandy, like the most branded brandy thing

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.560
 ever. Like I know they like hired some cool designer to make this. Well, this is like, yeah,

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:57.960
 it's the product you could buy probably anywhere in the country. I think we get most of the product.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:01.800
 It's just a surprise. I just can't imagine something that looks like that in the Ozarks,

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:07.400
 just feels incompatible. Oh, man. You probably got to flow in. Did you know they have Dr. Pepper

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:14.920
 here in Coca Cola? That makes sense. That's like traditional American products. This is like,

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:20.040
 but you don't expect the niche health food products. This is clearly a startup like that.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:26.280
 Start up with four people that work there. You need to see is there like Mela, is this a drink

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.600
 you can get at your local like Publix or whatever? What do you go to? What a grocery store? Whole

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:34.040
 foods? But yeah, we go to Publix sometimes. Yeah, like Whole Foods. I have one in Kansas.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:41.560
 In New York, there was this thing happened and maybe it's so happening around COVID around lockdown,

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:48.840
 around peak zero interest rates. Seltzer took over to this point where there were like any time I

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:55.640
 would walk into anywhere, a bodega, a grocery or whatever, a giant wall of like a hundred different

00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:02.200
 Seltzer brands. I swear all designed by a single design agency that was killing it because like,

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.480
 they all just had like these. They all looked really good. It was almost like looking at art. It was

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:12.920
 like a wall of like just crazy, nice designed packaging, but like so, so many brands. And they

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.440
 all kind of looked like that like they were just like really well designed. And I was like, what is

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:21.400
 happening where there's like a hundred Seltzer companies being founded? It's really just water.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:25.800
 I never enjoy, I don't enjoy sparkling water. I've never gotten into that.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.800
 Yeah, I'm not a huge fan, but like I get it. Like I get why people drink it. I'll have it some time

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:34.120
 to time, but we just want crazy with it. Yeah, no, I remember when it was the big thing like at

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:39.640
 every like investor office in San Francisco, they'd have like a fridge for them. Would you like

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:44.680
 Lacroix? What flavor of Lacroix would you like? Is that Seltzer water? No, so is that different?

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.960
 No, it isn't. That's I think that that was like the first one of the first ones that got really

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:51.080
 popular. And I think they've been around for a long time. And it's like a million of them

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:56.680
 showed up. And the only differentiator was like really good packaging. I'm not packaging. I'm not

00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:01.720
 diminishing it. Like it was like incredible packaging. Maybe some of the best art I've seen in my years

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.600
 sucker for good branding. I really am. Yeah, like you can sell me so quickly, especially if you have

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.840
 like a series of products, so they have like four different colors of these. Oh, perfect. It's like

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:15.320
 the different flavors. And I'm just so sold when I see that, but try them all. Oh, yeah, and pick

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:21.560
 your favorite pineapple. That's my favorite. All right, I'm going to go eat before I pass out.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:27.000
 This is good. Was it? Hey, it's good. I think so. I mean, it's always good to talk with you.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.640
 You know, like I'm glad that people listen to the podcast, but it's good just to stay in touch.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.440
 Even if I look forward to it. I think it's become so such a part of my routine. I'm like,

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:42.280
 I think I need it at this point. Yeah. Yeah, we, I think once we're both not so busy,

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:47.240
 we'll probably try and like, I don't know, I'll get back to making little clips and do more like

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:51.160
 to spice it up. I don't know if anybody listening, you know, likes a little something spicy every

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:58.120
 once in a while and mix it up. Get too crusty. We'll get back to that stuff. We're just in the in

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:09.320
 the throes of things. Yeah. All right. Cool. All right. See you next. See you.
