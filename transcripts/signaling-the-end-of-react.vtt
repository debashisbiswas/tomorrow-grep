00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 That's what our signals signals.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:28.800
 Okay, let me see if I can explain this because

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.680
 I don't think there's an official definition.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.640
 I think there's a lot of interpretations of what signals can be.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.480
 But it's actually pretty simple in some ways.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:47.120
 A signal is just a thing that you can observe and get notified when it changes.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.160
 So it's not any different from, you know, like looking at a traffic signal.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.560
 Like you can look at it, it's going to flip and then you know that something has changed.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.960
 And that sounds kind of simple and like, why would that be useful?

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.040
 But it has become the foundation for a lot of the innovation happening in the front end world.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.440
 And that's why I think it's been coming up a lot more.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.400
 Okay, so SolidJS is sort of the, they're probably not even the pioneer of signals.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.800
 I guess Ryan would probably say it was something before that, which was the thing before that.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.360
 What is the, like, today signals matter and people are talking about them a lot

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.000
 because SolidJS sort of is gaining in popularity, I guess, and React doesn't use signals.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.040
 Is that a good framing?

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.680
 Yeah, exactly.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.000
 And I think there's a lot of frameworks adding signals or having signal like concepts in them.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.760
 I think for this discussion, it's probably easiest to scope it just to solid.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:45.520
 Mostly because I think for this wave of signals and like thinking about reactivity,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.440
 that is solid wasn't one to kick it off.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.960
 And I also personally think that they have the best, maybe implementations are wrong word,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.680
 but signals are just one piece of what you need.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.920
 And I think the way everything comes together in Solid and exposes signals to you.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.280
 I think for me, I think it's the best implementation so far.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.400
 So yeah, if you're looking to get into it and understand what's going on,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.880
 I think it's good to look at the way it's used in Solid.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.280
 So could you sort of juxtapose just talk about the trade-offs?

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.040
 So React does something different.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.360
 It has a virtual DOM and it's like the UIs, a function of state.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.640
 And that's different from the way Solid works and the way signals work.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.640
 Could you kind of just like lay that out for me so that my dumb brain will understand the difference?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.840
 Yeah, so I'll give you the shot.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.600
 So I think first, we need to think about how React works.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.160
 And I think a lot of us are obviously super familiar with this,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.120
 because most of us have been doing React for years and years and years.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.760
 And we kind of take a lot of how it works for granted.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.080
 But it's good to lay it out to understand how it compares to Solid.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.480
 So in React, you have the concept of components.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.200
 And I think that's why a lot of us use React.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.680
 We like breaking our application up into components.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.920
 And the way you define a component React is you define a function.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.960
 And the job of this function is to say,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.480
 given some input properties, what should the UI look like?

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.760
 So the function is a, it's not right to think of this as like,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.320
 oh, this is the way to do components with functions.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.440
 It's really the way React does components with functions.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.600
 They make you define it as like any time we need to know what this should look like,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.880
 we're going to call this function and your jobs spit out the,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.320
 like the JSX tree that it should display.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.760
 Then React is a hard work of saying, okay,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.240
 given you're saying the UI should look like this,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.640
 let's look at what the UI already looks like on the screen

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.480
 and figure out what's actually changed and will diff it and will patch the UI.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.400
 So it matches.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.920
 And anytime there's any kind of change in your application in your system,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.240
 it retriggers all the render functions across your whole app,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.120
 figures out what the UI should look like and then repeats this,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.720
 this patching process.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.880
 And this works incredibly well.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.240
 It seems like it would be slow.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.960
 It seems like a waste of computation,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.040
 but it does work really well.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.320
 And it was kind of a huge like burden.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.760
 The ease of burden when React first came out,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.440
 it was way easier to reason about then the way we're doing things before,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.960
 where we had to think explicitly about, okay, this thing happened,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.160
 like let me go find the element in the UI and go change it manually.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.800
 So that was a big innovation and it made a lot of sense.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.640
 I think as React changed over time,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.880
 and honestly, as UIs changed over time,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.320
 there's a, we're doing a lot more complex crazy stuff on the web now.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.960
 There's been some challenges with this model.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.240
 It still is pretty performant, but there are cases,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.240
 especially considering rendering a large table or doing anything with a lot of elements on screen.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.600
 These render functions start to get kind of expensive.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.160
 And there's a question of, one, can this be more performant?

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.960
 And two, there are a lot of cases in React that are tricky and hard to reason about,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.640
 especially when the hook stuff came out.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.000
 Like use memo and passing dependency arrays,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.200
 like forgetting to pass that in.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.120
 Use effect was a thing that came out that we were all using,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.920
 and then eventually we realized, oh, we should actually never be using this.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.480
 So there's been a lot of history with React.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.960
 And as great and successful as it's been,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.360
 I think a lot of us, when we're using React,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.680
 despite us having years and years of experience with it,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.760
 it's been kind of like, why do I still not feel good at React?

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.360
 I still feel like I'm struggling.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.800
 That's what got me excited of looking at something at an alternative.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.640
 And I found SolidJS about maybe two years ago now,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.080
 and it looked a lot like React, but the model is completely different.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.680
 So I just talked a lot, but does that make sense in terms of React works?

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.200
 It does, but that last thing you said, the model is completely different.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.480
 When I look at Solid stuff, and I'm just very new to it,

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.920
 but it doesn't look that different.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.280
 I mean, I know it's JSX, but even like the difference is like,

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.440
 you have to call the function of your thing instead of just like placing it in the brackets.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.120
 That it all seems very similar.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.240
 Is it mostly just the underlying way it works is so different,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.040
 but it feels very much like writing React or not?

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.840
 Yeah, I think that what you're describing is accurate,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.760
 and it's a pro and a con of Solid.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.640
 So a pro is when you're moving to Solid, you immediately are like,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.840
 "Oh, I know how all this works.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.120
 I can build you eyes."

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.440
 And you will, like you start to use Solid in your first day.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.080
 You'll be shipping a lot, because it looks a lot like React.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.280
 But it's kind of deceptively the same.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.840
 It's same in JSX and it's all familiar.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.960
 I personally went through a phase where I was like,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.160
 I basically built a pretty complex app over the course of a month.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.200
 And then I was looking at stuff, and I was like, wait a minute.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.080
 I actually don't understand anything that's going on.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.880
 And I just kind of recreated all this complexity for no reason,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.280
 because I was just bringing React patterns over.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.120
 That sounds like every time I build anything with any technology.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.080
 Yeah, exactly.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.560
 So I think it took me like a month or two to kind of untrain

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.360
 my React brain to really think in terms of Solid.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.680
 And there is a little bit of that learning curve.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.240
 And it's deceptive because you don't expect it.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.080
 Usually when you find something that has a learning curve,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.840
 you just are completely unproductive.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.920
 So you know, you don't know anything.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.720
 But with Solid, you kind of think you know something.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.520
 And then later you realize, oh, no, this is how it actually should be.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.120
 So let me get into the, you're right, it looks similar.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.960
 So let's talk about what actually is different.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:19.600
 So I said earlier that in React, component function is a render function.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.840
 Like the job of this function is to compute the HTML that comes out of it.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.440
 And Solid, it looks very similar because a component function,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.240
 again, it receives props, it returns some JSX, but it's not a render function.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.360
 It's a setup function.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.200
 So the way to think about it is when a component first shows up on screen,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.520
 your Solid JS component function is called once.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.120
 And it's a job.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.880
 It's a return a template.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.920
 And it's never run again.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.520
 So everything in the body of your Solid JS function only ever runs once.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.480
 So there's certain things that you do in React that make a lot of sense.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.040
 Like you can do a conditional and return no.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.000
 And if that condition changes, it's fine, right?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.360
 Because it's the function to run again.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.360
 And then the next time it's going to have an actual thing.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.360
 That actually makes no sense in Solid because your component only

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.080
 ever runs once.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.480
 A return, it's going to set up the component.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.400
 And from then on, it disappears.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.640
 And even at runtime, the constant of a component doesn't really exist in Solid.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.640
 When it's running, Solid doesn't see your HTML with a bunch of different components.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.280
 It just sees it as one giant HTML document.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.960
 And so this is fundamentally very different, right?

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.520
 And the way this works is when you return the template, Solid looks at the template and sees,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.000
 it kind of creates holes in the template.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.040
 It says, OK, like this part of the template, let's say your template is like you return a div.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:55.040
 It says, hello, my name is-- and then the name is referencing some signal, right?

00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.640
 It punches a hole in the template saying, OK, here's the static parts of the template.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.920
 Here's a part that changes.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.560
 Let me observe the part that is changing.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.200
 So it's basically a description of my name.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.240
 And then whenever that changes, it'll then surgically go into your DOM

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.200
 and then replace that hole with the new value.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.360
 While the rest of it remains static.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.600
 And the benefits of this is one performance, right?

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.800
 There's no diffing process.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.840
 It basically-- like your app renders once.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.000
 And it basically keeps track of the parts of your app that are static, the parts that are dynamic.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.680
 And whenever something of the dynamic parts change,

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.640
 it can just go and knows exactly where the DOM could go, make that update.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.560
 Does that make sense?

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.320
 So you have to use-- yeah, it does.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.720
 So you have to use signals for any part of your UI, the actual template that changes over time.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.280
 If it's going to change, you can't just do--

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.240
 what you described was very much stuff I do in React, where you just like--

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.560
 you just count on the fact this is going to run every time anything changes.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.200
 And you can compute like kind of like derived properties from other pieces of state.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:01.680
 Yep.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.880
 Can't do that in solid.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.520
 You do everything you need to change in the UI.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.560
 It needs to be sort of driven by a signal.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:08.800
 Yeah.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.280
 Is that--

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.600
 Yeah.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.800
 And ultimately, the primitives are actually very similar.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.040
 So a signal is effectively a piece of state.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.840
 And you can change that state over time.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.560
 It can be a number.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.000
 Similar to use state.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.040
 Exactly, similar to use state.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.680
 Just like that.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:21.920
 Okay.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.880
 Then the next level is derived state.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.200
 So let's say you have a signal that's count.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.760
 And then you have something that's like double count.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.960
 So this is count times two.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.720
 So that second piece of-- it is kind of-- it is state, but it's derived from another piece of state.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.320
 And then you have effects, which are, okay, when something changes,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.240
 I want to run this logic.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.560
 And effect is kind of like observing a signal.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.400
 Those are the three primitives.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.280
 It's honestly very similar to a React where you have use state.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.640
 You have use memo.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.000
 The thing that's different in solid is you don't have this dependency array concept.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.720
 So in React, when you say use memo, you have to pass in.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:00.960
 Okay.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.680
 Here are the things that we're going to watch.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.000
 If any of these things change, then rerun the memo.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.480
 In solid, there's something called auto tracking.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.880
 So you don't ever pass in a dependency array.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.600
 It knows what signals you're referencing in your little callback.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.680
 And it knows that whenever any of those signals change,

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.200
 it needs to rerun the callback.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.160
 So it's kind of-- that's really nice because you're not like debugging.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.800
 Oh, why is this-- why isn't this memo rerunning?

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.800
 Oh, I forgot to pass in something with dependency array.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.120
 And it's one of the nice things about solid.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:34.800
 The downsides of it are you might-- it's maybe a little un-- it's a little less explicit, right?

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.960
 Whenever you have auto tracking, it's a little less explicit,

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:43.200
 which means you might run to situations where you accidentally like track something.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.720
 You might create a dependency you didn't mean to.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.560
 But these are my-- this is kind of like blowing up on Twitter as like,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.520
 this is a huge deal.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.600
 I think in practice, it's one of those things where you like mess up.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.120
 And like three seconds later, you realize you messed up and you just fix it.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.240
 And over time, you get better at this and it feels entirely normal.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.280
 Yeah, I wanted to talk about that too, just kind of the discourse right now.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.200
 Like Dan from the React team has been calling out like,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:12.400
 here are the real trade-offs and sort of framing React as making the right choices.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.840
 Could you maybe better explain like from a practical standpoint,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.080
 could you build real stuff with these things?

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.840
 Could you explain like, what are the real trade-offs you're making

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.400
 if you choose solid over React?

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.320
 Yeah, so I'm going to give my unfiltered opinion right now, so get ready.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:28.800
 Yeah, please do.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.720
 The juicy stuff.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.000
 The thing that's a little bit frustrating for me with what's happening on Twitter

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.840
 is I think the conversation has kind of evolved into like not really a great place.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.640
 I actually think all this is good for solid and I'll explain why.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.120
 What you're starting to see is people are posting examples from solid

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.440
 that make it look silly or confusing.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:55.120
 And we know given any framework, there's always examples like this, right?

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.680
 Like, I can go make funny examples in React of being like,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.720
 look, this creates an infinite loop or like, look, like this, you know,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.880
 isn't this like you can't call a hook in an if statement.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.880
 You can make anything look kind of dumb just in without context.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.640
 And not a lot of people have like experienced building real applications with solid.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.520
 So it's hard for people to tell when they look at this snippet of like,

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.120
 a snippet that looks obviously dumb, by the way, a snippet that was being shared on Twitter,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.280
 the linter, there are some linting rules you can turn on and solve.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.720
 It would have actually caught that.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.160
 Similar to in React, there's something rules like catch like the rule of hooks thing.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.880
 But you know, people don't have that context.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.000
 So when they look at it, they're like, oh, this looks really bad or like,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.080
 this looked really intuitive, it was just confusing.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.680
 But in practice, you know, having built, like I have a,

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.920
 I mentioned this on Twitter, like I have a production and solid application.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.440
 That's probably the most complex application I've ever built that I've been building for

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.640
 over a year now.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.760
 So me looking at that snippet, I'm like, yeah, that's kind of,

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.560
 you kind of posted broken code that doesn't really make sense.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.920
 And yeah, technically it doesn't work.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.880
 But in practice, this never really bothers you that much.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.760
 Just like with any framework language or some things you kind of have to learn

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.560
 initially and you learn it and you never think about it again.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.720
 So I definitely fell in that category.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.400
 But it started to blow up more where, you know, people from the React team were quoting it,

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.600
 being like, this is the exact problem with signals.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.040
 This is why the React team never went down this route.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.120
 And they were a little defensive.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.920
 I think, I think what Dan said was, I think they're getting a lot of people saying to them,

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.680
 like, oh, you guys are dumb.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.160
 You never even thought of signals, which definitely isn't true.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.080
 Like they, like they spent a lot of time thinking about this.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.840
 I'm sure they thought about this model.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.160
 And for whatever reason, they chose not to go to it.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.800
 So they're defensive saying like, yeah, we did think about it.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.760
 This is why it sucks.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.880
 This is why we didn't use it.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.680
 And here's a trade off we made and why React is better.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.680
 So one, that's great for solid because now it's,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.120
 they have never put solid at the same level as React before.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.560
 It's always been like, oh, solid, like cute little project that, you know, Ryan works on.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.240
 But now they're saying like, oh, they are like the diametric opposite of what we,

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.960
 what we, you know, what, what they're claiming they did, which puts them at the same level.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:16.320
 Simultaneously, it's kind of a bad move on their part because I don't really think,

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.280
 I know they're saying this.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.840
 I don't know if I fully buy the React team story that this was a very explicit decision

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.440
 because these are two trade offs they saw because it's not entirely accurate.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.480
 Because it's based on this idea of like there's some fundamental trade off and saw that's not really there.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.200
 So if people do buy into the story of these are two equal trade offs and they start to

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.600
 explore the trade offs, they're going to find that, oh, it's going to look like the solid trade off

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.560
 was always the right choice because there's not really that gotcha is not like a real gotcha.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.640
 Yeah. So it's interesting.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.000
 I don't know why they've ramped up.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.120
 They ramped up in this way and might not be super intentional.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.840
 Might just be because a lot more people are annoying them about this.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.440
 But to me, it's like, this is, this is really great for the solid community.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.640
 It is the bundle size. I know you don't really care about this because it's like,

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.880
 oh, users are, well, maybe you do care about it.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:10.160
 But like users are using apps like this, these single page applications for long sessions.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.280
 It doesn't matter if, but like, it doesn't matter because to me,

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.600
 the 200 kilobytes or whatever of Uncle Brush JavaScript that React is just sort of like speaks

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.040
 to how old and large it is in my mind.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:27.360
 And it just feels like if, if, if solid can give me even 90% of what I enjoy from productivity

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.120
 with React and it does it with five kilobytes of JavaScript or whatever it is,

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.920
 like, it just feels like that feels better.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.840
 Yeah, exactly. So there's that and there's kind of what the bundle size represents.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.520
 My feeling when using, like I said, I remember when I was first using solid

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.360
 and what I created was really over complicated.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.880
 And then when I fixed all that, I'm like, wow, what was all this stuff I've been doing?

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.720
 Like web development is so easy.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:59.440
 So that like the extra bundle size also kind of maps to more complexity that's in our brains.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:05.440
 With solid, I kind of feel like I'm using, I kind of feel like I'm back to using jQuery plus like,

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.080
 like a nicer component framework on top.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.120
 I'm back to using stuff like, you know, query selector.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.280
 I'm back to like grabbing elements and like mutating them.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.440
 I'm not in this like, ref nightmare that you have with React.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.480
 Like anytime you need to touch a DOM element, it's like the worst thing ever is you avoid doing it.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.920
 So there's just so much for you want to use a library that needs to interact with the DOM.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.800
 Like you got to find react versions of everything, which granted it to huge ecosystem.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.560
 There are react versions of most everything.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.280
 But there's just like a mismatch with the way the browser operates and the way react operates.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.360
 So you're always like in the caught in the middle of that where what's all that all really feels

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.360
 like it disappears. It barely feels like a web framework. It more just feels like here,

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.880
 a bunch of useful reactive primitives, then kind of you can kind of just go use

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.800
 like the normal web stuff that that has gotten a lot better since like when React first came out.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:03.200
 So can we talk like big picture zoom out? Like everyone on Twitter is sort of like

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.400
 at a fever pitch these days around new things coming out. And that's always been the case.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.680
 And a lot of people will say, well, the people didn't say and like react was,

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.360
 we're going to see the end of react for years. It never happens.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.720
 Do you think things are fundamentally changing in favor of the field versus react?

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.400
 I know it's not a competition, but it kind of is. I mean, like people are choosing new things

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:31.440
 for Greenfield projects. And the mind share has been largely in favor of react for a long time.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.400
 Do you think that's changing at all? I think what people need to remember is there's like

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.640
 the absolute truth and there's a truth within a bubble. And they both actually matter.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:46.720
 The absolute truth is most websites are on WordPress, right? Like that's a fundamental stat.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.520
 Yeah, like you said this morning, a bunch of them are squeezing jQuery.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.040
 And forever till the end of our lifetimes, there's going to be a ton of react websites.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:02.320
 And this is all fundamentally true. So of course, you can always, people can always say like,

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:09.200
 oh, it's dumb to say it's an react because like, you know, the clistats. But then there's stuff,

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.840
 if you scope that down to a bubble, stuff starts to look a little bit different, right?

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.000
 The best engineers that are out there, the ones that are the most into what they're doing,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.760
 what are they getting excited about when they look for their next job? Like, what are they

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.440
 going to be excited about? When a company is starting a new application and they have the

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.520
 opportunity to, like you said, greenfield opportunity to like start fresh, what are they

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.040
 going to be excited about? Where are all the opportunities for actively maintain apps versus

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.240
 apps that are like kind of on life support being phased out? I think that's why,

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.280
 yeah, there's always new stuff coming out as well as all the energy around it. And I think

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.400
 people are frustrated because they're like, Oh, this stuff is so small, but it kind of represents

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:54.640
 like a majority of the future. So for me, I am never going to be starting a new react app again,

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.040
 except for that react native app, we just started

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:05.680
 because, you know, react native is still still dominant, at least for now. Yeah, but I'm never

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.280
 going to be starting one again. I don't think I'm really going to be willing to work anywhere that

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:15.280
 is using it. So yeah, for me, it's like, it's dead for me. And I think for a lot of people that are,

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.320
 yeah, sorry, new stuff for like, kind of really excited about this stuff. Like,

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.520
 they're going to see it as a benefit to be able to work somewhere that, you know, is using some of

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:29.600
 these new patterns. Yeah, and I mean, these people, it does matter to the react maintainers, I'm sure,

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:36.720
 that like, the topic on Twitter might not always be react. Like, even if it's still a small bubble

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:44.160
 of like, power users, the discourse does seem to be shifting away. And it, it from the outside,

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.880
 I don't know these people, but it does seem like it's bothering them. So a little bit.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:56.640
 Yeah, I wish I could just remind them that they were insanely successful way beyond anything

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.560
 else by comparison. Like one, there's, I was saying the other day, there's a whole documentary

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:06.560
 on reaction framework has ever gotten a documentary. That's, that's incredible. They've been around

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:11.760
 for so long. They've gone through and they've, I think they've kind of can't. So for me, if, if,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:17.040
 if a product can cannibalize itself, like that's really impressive. React used to look a lot

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.360
 different, class components, like, and now it looks completely different. They basically launched

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:27.760
 two successful frameworks, been around for, you know, 10 or so years. So that's, that's really

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:33.440
 impressive. Anything in tech lasting 10 years, you know, I work on SST. I would be shocked if we

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:40.240
 last 10 years. So yeah, it's, it's impressive. But you know, nothing can really last forever.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.560
 Yeah. So it's, it's not the end of react. React will be here forever. But it is,

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.040
 it's kind of the beginning of the end for react, at least in a bubble.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.720
 Yeah, I think so. But it's funny because that stupid cliche quote, the one that's like,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.880
 the reason I hate it is because there's that really cringy video of Elizabeth Holmes saying it.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.280
 So I think she like killed the quote, but it's the, the whole like first they ignore you,

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.400
 then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then they, then you win thing. I feel like,

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.680
 yeah, the solid just entered the, they fight you phase. Because, because like they were kind of,

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.040
 like, I mean, Ryan's been working on Solve for five years. Most of Solve history, he's been

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.640
 ignored. Yeah. Then it was kind of like, oh, like, you know, that's like a, you know, a cute little

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.600
 thing. And then now it's not the same level. So you can see where this is heading. Cool.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.880
 Well, I'm, I'm definitely excited about I'm, I thought I was going to use it. I guess one other

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.720
 question kind of getting in the weeds, this is not a thing to wrap up the podcast with. But, uh,

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.560
 from like a progressive enhancement standpoint, if you're building like mostly a site, I know sites

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.560
 versus apps is like a dumb generalization. There's a lot of nuance. But if you're building something

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:50.160
 that's mostly a site, but you have little bits of interactivity, just solid and other sort of

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:57.600
 spa first, like frameworks make sense to like progressively enhance your site. Or they more like,

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:03.520
 it needs to be a spa. I feel like Astro had just made this question really simple. I'm using it

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.600
 exactly. It's just like, just use Astro when you don't feel like you're going to build in a single

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:13.680
 page application. And then then the interactive bits are just like whatever framework you like.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.640
 So yeah, I've done it. So it's just the island. Yeah, exactly. So I've done a few things in Astro

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.320
 and I've always used it with it because that's one that I like. But it kind of doesn't matter at

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.880
 that point. It like kind of solves all those problems for you. Okay, that was a terrible question.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:32.480
 We'd wrap this up. You had like gotten into philosophy with like an Elizabeth Holmes quote

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.880
 and all this. And then, and then I asked that question. Okay, I'll bring it back down to Earth

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.840
 always. Got to bring a breakdown. Yeah, this has been fun. It's fun doing this podcast again.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:49.840
 I enjoy it quite a lot. All right. All right. See you, Dax. See ya.
