WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
 - Still a prime sub, still another prime sub.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.640
 - That one hurts, that hurts so much.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.480
 I just hit record and I'm in so much pain right now.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.880
 Kiwi. - Kiwi, hi, I'm Kiwi.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.060
 - Come back, Kiwi.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.640
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.400
 - Okay, so we're gonna talk about Kiwi

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.240
 to start this episode,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.920
 because we record these episodes on Twitch,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.760
 on Dax's Twitch. - Yeah.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.160
 - I used to stream on Twitch.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.840
 I used to be a bit of a streamer.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.960
 I was somewhat of a streamer.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.800
 What am I thinking of?

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.200
 I'm thinking of a movie reference there.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.640
 - I'm somewhat of a streamer myself.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.120
 You're the most Spider-Man meme.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.960
 - Oh, is that what it is?

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.760
 Yeah, that's it, yeah, yeah.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.960
 Somewhat of a streamer myself.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.040
 So I used to stream on Twitch a few weeks ago,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.760
 and we do this on Dax's channel,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.720
 but it's like a lot of the same people

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.680
 that were in my channel,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.800
 because me and Dax are friends.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.640
 So like, we all cross pollinate.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.760
 Well, Kiwi is this very mysterious figure in Twitch chat

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.960
 and on Twitter and Discord and wherever else.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.120
 And Kiwi always comes into Twitch chat,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.960
 just saying Kiwi.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.520
 If I talk too much about Kiwi at this point,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.440
 is everyone uncomfortable?

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.280
 Is Kiwi uncomfortable? - Wait, wait,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.120
 wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.960
 It's so funny.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.040
 - He's got the best, like he or she, I don't know,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.520
 he's got the best personal branding ever,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.880
 'cause it's just so mysterious and like,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.240
 I need to know more about Kiwi.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.160
 Or they'll just say, "I'm Kiwi."

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.320
 Like, that's the first message.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.880
 And like, it'll come every day and just say, "I'm Kiwi."

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.680
 But then, then I got to know Kiwi on Discord

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.720
 and Kiwi has all kinds of good insights.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.760
 Dax level insights, really.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.960
 Kiwi has been pouring it out in the Discord DMs,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.680
 and I appreciate it a whole lot, Kiwi.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.000
 - Wow. - You're the best.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.040
 But, oh, oh, but the reason I'm so torn,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.600
 and I've been just destroyed,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.840
 at the beginning of this episode,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840
 is Kiwi just prime subs to Dax.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.440
 And if you don't know anything about Twitch,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.360
 which I didn't, like a year ago,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.800
 prime subs, you get one of them.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.040
 If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber,

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.600
 which everyone in the world is,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600
 you get one free subscription on Twitch,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.200
 you get to give to a streamer.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.920
 And it's like, it's a special little gift

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.640
 that you can only give one of.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.680
 And Kiwi just gave it to Dax,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.800
 and it ripped my little Grinch heart out.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.440
 Okay, I'm done.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.600
 That's all I have to say about Kiwi.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.120
 As low as you are, I am very high right now.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.800
 I'm enjoying your pain.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.900
 I am enjoying your suffering.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.000
 This is a great moment for me to ripping him or her.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.680
 We don't know where they are, away from you.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.800
 - Oh, okay. - Well, thank you for that.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.040
 - Well, that was a good start.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040
 What are we gonna talk about?

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.840
 I need a Lara bar, actually.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.040
 Can we talk about how you eat Lara bars because of me?

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.160
 - No, I started that trend.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.000
 And then you got--

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.840
 - What?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.680
 - And then you started in-- - What?

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.600
 - Because of me.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.200
 - Theo eats Lara bars now.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.760
 I saw somebody else, Sam ordered Lara bars.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.600
 It's just spreading.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.960
 Alan orders Lara bars.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.800
 - Wait, Sam who?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.640
 - Sam Hulik.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.040
 No, I always get to mix up.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.640
 Huckabee, the one that didn't do Mass Effect.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.480
 (laughs)

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.320
 I'm sorry, Sam.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.400
 - Yeah, that's how Sam is known now to me.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.800
 There's the one who did the Mass Effect.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.800
 - Mass Effect Sam is a big SST user.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.720
 He's like, when I first joined SST,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.200
 he was doing a big migration

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.280
 and almost every day for a couple of weeks,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.560
 that was me helping him.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.480
 That was one of my first memories of working at SST.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.920
 And then I was like, wait, what?

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.120
 He did the music for Mass Effect

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.760
 and he has all these awards and--

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.600
 - That's wild.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.360
 - Yeah, it was really crazy.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.840
 - It's like Tomo.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.680
 - Yeah.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.840
 - It was like 30 seconds to Mars?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.080
 Did I mess that up?

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.160
 Okay, I'm terrible at pop culture.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.920
 But he's like super into programming.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.080
 Like, he's fully in.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.920
 - Yeah.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.840
 - He's like all bought in.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.680
 - I mean, if I was,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.080
 if I spent that much time with Jared Leto,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.400
 I'd probably wanna switch careers also.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.160
 (laughs)

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.520
 - Don't me tell me about Jared Leto

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.920
 'cause I don't know anything about him.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.800
 - Google Image Morbius.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.120
 - Do I need to turn off the Google Safe Search filter?

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.560
 - No, what is this?

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.400
 What is it?

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.240
 Morbius?

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.080
 - That's gonna love this.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.200
 - M-O-R-P-I-U-S.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.680
 Jared Leto was like the lead.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.520
 What is he?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.360
 I don't know much about that.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.200
 He's like the Mars.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.040
 He's, whatever.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.880
 He's in the face.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.200
 He was like the face or whatever.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.040
 - What?

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.320
 Am I looking at right now?

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.880
 - And he got super into acting.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.280
 And I swear every role he's been in

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.520
 has just been like,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.600
 click everyone to check it and crazy.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.280
 - What in the world?

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.800
 So I thought he was an actor that got into music

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.960
 'cause I didn't know anything about him.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.800
 (laughs)

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.640
 He's in the Mars.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.560
 - I think the other way around, yeah.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.160
 And then I just always,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.720
 I've just always found every role he's been in to be like,

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.040
 it feels like he's trying too hard to be an actor,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.400
 if that makes sense.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.240
 - Yeah.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.800
 - He played the Joker and then that was also,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.040
 this is a little weirdest Joker thing I've ever seen.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.680
 Like everyone has done it better than him.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.600
 - Yeah, okay.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.640
 Well, I wish I hadn't Googled these images

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.560
 'cause that's pretty freaky.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.480
 That's a Marvel movie?

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.560
 It's a Marvel movie?

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.400
 - Well, okay.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.240
 So here's a funny thing.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.080
 - Disney is showing us this?

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.160
 - No, no, no, no, no.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.280
 There's a clear line here.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.000
 At some point, Fox had a bunch of Marvel rights.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.040
 Things like X-Men, they had Spider-Man for a while.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.120
 And then Marvel blew up and became insane.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.640
 Like the rest of Marvel blew up.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.000
 But Fox still retains rights to like the worst characters.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.040
 So they just every once in a while make like a much shittier movie

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.040
 to just like try to like cash in on the hype.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.880
 - Yeah.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.440
 - So I'm Spider-Man, sorry.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.280
 There you go.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.280
 Morbius, Morbius.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.200
 Now you know that.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.840
 - What's Morbius?

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.920
 - It's Morbius.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.760
 - It's just a meme.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.080
 Like there's just a meme going on or the,

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.560
 'cause from the trailers in the movie,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.760
 everyone news is the worst movie ever,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.320
 but now there's this joke where people pretend like it's

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.120
 their favorite movie.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.400
 - Okay.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.760
 - Where do you, like I feel like I'm pretty plugged in

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.600
 on the internet.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.000
 How do you keep up with all this stuff?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.760
 How do you keep up with all the pop culture and stuff?

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.280
 - I just want to put it in nowhere else.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.680
 I watched a ton of, okay.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.920
 So I watch a ton of movies, I guess I have TV going on all day.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.760
 All day I have TV.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.600
 - Are you serious?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.960
 Wait a minute, seriously?

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.280
 - You didn't know this about me?

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.600
 - No, wait, hang on.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.920
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.760
 Like cable TV?

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.000
 - No, no, no, just like TV shows.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.920
 I'll have TV shows going on.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.000
 - Like what kind of TV shows?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.240
 - Tell me, or what channels?

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.440
 That's what I remember from TV is like there's channels.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.960
 - Yeah, what channels are you on?

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.800
 - No one's doing channels.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.960
 (laughing)

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.640
 - Honestly, there really aren't channels anymore.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.480
 Is that a serious?

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.640
 - It's funny, I'm making fun of you,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.520
 but I actually miss channels and explain why in a second.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.240
 - Wait, if there's not channels, what are there?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.680
 There's not, there's really not channels.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.000
 - You just find the show you want.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.680
 You want to watch and you just watch every episode.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.000
 - Like on Netflix?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.720
 - On Netflix, or like, you know, I have my own special setup.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.480
 - Wait, whoa, we can't just gloss over that.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.680
 What's your own special setup?

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.520
 What is that supposed to mean?

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.360
 - So there's just two things.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.600
 There's a company called Plex,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.280
 which is they're just like a straight up normal tech startup

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.120
 somehow.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.280
 I mean, they've been around for a while

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.720
 and they make a ton of money.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.880
 They like operate exactly a tech company,

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.320
 but technically it's like a server,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.080
 a server software that like runs your own Netflix effectively.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.120
 But they don't help you get the content.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.520
 So that's why they're not illegal.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.080
 But they do everything like making it

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.120
 so the apps work on Chromecast, on Apple TV,

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.440
 on your phone, you can cat, like they do all of that.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.800
 But it's against your own content

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.600
 and it's up to you to figure out where to get the content.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.640
 And even that part is like crazy productized at this point.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.920
 - So what are you watching right now?

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.400
 Like what's on in the corner?

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.000
 That's more interesting than me.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.080
 - Well, at this moment, no,

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.400
 I'm not watching anything at this moment.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.440
 - We said all the time.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.160
 - No, when I'm working all day,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.520
 like I'm not what I'm--

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.360
 - We're working.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.200
 - I can't when I'm streaming.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.240
 - This isn't work.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.080
 We're working.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.920
 - You know what I mean?

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.760
 When I'm typing the keys to make the code to make money--

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.440
 - It's very important to me that this is working

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.840
 because when my wife comes in and she's like,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.840
 what do you do all day?

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.520
 - I'm working.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.360
 - I'm talking to Dax, just work.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.360
 - You know, how they're kind of working.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.480
 You know, you're gonna go make me feel like that.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.320
 - But what do you watch?

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.160
 Like what shows are on?

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.240
 - So I've been doing this for 10 years.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.400
 So I've pretty much have seen like everything.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.600
 I've seen like, seen stuff multiple times.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.440
 I've seen like--

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.680
 - Why have you done everything for 10 years?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.640
 Can we talk about what was going on two years ago?

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.640
 - That's when I became an adult

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.520
 and when I became an adult and these are all my habits.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.440
 I'm gonna stick with them forever.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.800
 (laughing)

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.640
 I'm honestly out of like anything mainstream.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.960
 I've like watched every like really good mainstream thing.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.560
 - You would be.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.400
 - Yeah.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.240
 - If you've been doing it for so long,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.280
 I mean, there isn't so much.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.840
 And I've seen so many things multiple times.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.880
 Like, I just can't rewatch stuff anymore.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.520
 - Do you watch like indie films and like stuff

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.600
 that's in other languages you probably do?

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.520
 - No, I probably do.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.440
 - I don't really watch indie.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.680
 I watch, so when I'm working, I watch TV shows.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.520
 I don't really watch movies, sometimes I will,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.560
 but it's just TV shows.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.040
 But I've seen just like all of the best British comedies,

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.160
 so I like to just like foreign stuff, like I've found all this.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.000
 - Mighty Bush?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.960
 - I don't think I've heard of that.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.960
 What's Mighty Bush?

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.800
 - The Mighty Bush?

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.560
 I mean, that's from when I used to watch stuff

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.920
 in British comedy, British comedy is something.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.240
 - Yeah, it's very good.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.800
 - I was gonna say very different, but very good.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.640
 Yeah, sure.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.960
 - Very different.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.800
 I like it.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.960
 - You never heard of Greg?

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.560
 I'm old Greg, you've never heard of this.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.880
 Nothing. - No.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.480
 - It's pretty dumb.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.480
 There's like a giant gorilla.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.480
 I don't know, you should look into it.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.320
 - Diamond Boats and Chad.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.920
 - The Concord's, I'm sorry.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.680
 But the Concord's is very good.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.520
 I've seen that twice.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.600
 - Okay, there we go.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.680
 Wait, you've seen it twice.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.520
 There's like a, it's not like one thing, right?

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.360
 - No, I've seen the whole show every episode twice.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.360
 - You watch all of it through twice.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.320
 - Anything good I've seen more than once, yeah.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.040
 - What, how in the world, you do this while you're working?

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.600
 - Every single day, like hours and hours of time

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.400
 for me to do this, so it adds up.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.360
 - I guess I used to like listen to Audible Books

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.200
 while I worked.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.280
 - Exactly the same thing, yeah.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.000
 - And like, you only pick up on certain parts,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.960
 but it's like, you just kind of washes over you,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.400
 and if you do it enough hours, like you get enough from it.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.360
 - Yeah, and you just get better at kind of

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.640
 paying attention to both.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.960
 So right now, it's funny, so I'm gonna chat,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.800
 I guessed it.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.200
 So I haven't seen a bunch of like good anime shows,

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.080
 which, you know, I was gonna make fun of mazes

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.920
 every minute as up.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.520
 So I started watching this one called Attack on Titan,

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.720
 which I'm almost done with,

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.280
 but that's been like my thing for this past week.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.280
 These things only last a week.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.120
 - So anime?

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.480
 - Yeah, it's very good.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.000
 It's actually the perfect thing to watch in this way,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.760
 because my only criticism of it is,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.920
 the pacing is insanely slow.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.400
 There's like this really interesting mystery

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.680
 at the heart of it, and you're like trying to like,

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.000
 figure out what's going on.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.840
 - Yeah.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.920
 - But it is like, they're like,

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.080
 before they reveal a secret,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.560
 they like talk about how they're gonna reveal it

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.160
 for like 30 minutes.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.280
 And they're like, don't reveal it, it's the next episode.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.000
 So it's great to just throw in the background.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.440
 - So anime, I feel like there's a ton of people

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.120
 in our sphere, like in the web dev space.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.400
 Okay, yeah, trash.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.320
 I mean, prime, I don't know.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.600
 Like there's like wifu backgrounds.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.440
 I know what that means.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.280
 - I don't get that whole thing.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.440
 I'm not into that.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.080
 I hate how everyone has the other background.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.920
 They're near them.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.920
 I don't get it.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.440
 It, I don't like looking at it.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.560
 - So I don't get any of it.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.920
 I don't get the culture at all.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.280
 Could you please explain to me,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.600
 what is the draw of anime?

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.960
 Why do people get sucked into it?

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.480
 - Okay, so I have seen,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.760
 have you seen Miyazaki's movies?

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.600
 No, like people--

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.440
 - No idea what that is.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.640
 - Okay, so for a Western audience,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.760
 that's typically how they explain it.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.160
 - From a Western audience.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.280
 - From a, like from me.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.760
 (laughing)

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.320
 - That's just funny to me.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.360
 It's like, for you Westerners,

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.880
 you're gonna have to, I guess you're also a Western--

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.720
 - I'm including myself.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.080
 - You're saying, okay, yeah.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.960
 - I've seen a bunch of anime movies,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.400
 but just like the stuff that makes it over here.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.720
 And typically that's like this guy,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.360
 this studio called Tudo Ghibli.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.000
 They've won Oscars, like just fantastic movies,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.320
 incredible animation.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.480
 And I've always really liked it.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.180
 And I think it like, that stuff is one genuinely good

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.840
 and to like a peaceful white audience.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.960
 And through that, I've like watched some other movies

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.600
 that are also like highly ranked and like kind of related

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.440
 to that.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.280
 But I haven't gotten to the TV show stuff as much.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.280
 At the end of the day, it's just,

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.120
 it's not any different.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.680
 It's just like another TV show.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.040
 There's some like stylistic things

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.040
 that are a little bit consistent across them,

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.360
 but they can be about all sorts of stuff.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.720
 They can be about like crazy fantasy stuff.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.760
 They can be about sci-fi.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.760
 They can be about all kinds of stuff.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.560
 I am noticing with this one that there are some like

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.880
 specific styles that didn't like this pacing thing,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.160
 I think might be a little bit that's common, like where,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.680
 and these are like things in the show,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.720
 like a little bit dramatic.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.600
 Like characters are always going in this really serious

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.720
 rants, but they're like screaming while they say

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.360
 and they're like kind of crying at the same time.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.520
 It's, there's some like stylistic things,

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.600
 but overall, just like, you know, another TV show.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.280
 - Okay, is it just like the cartoons in Japan?

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.600
 And then we all got hooked on them.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.880
 Like is this what kids on Saturday morning watch in Japan?

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.880
 - No, it's not for kids, I don't think.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.720
 - Oh, it's not for kids.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.560
 - Like the one I'm watching around,

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.120
 I was crazy violent and like super dark.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.440
 There's some like scenarios in there

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.440
 that like like a crazy, existential like think,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.280
 make you think like a lot type is.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.600
 So I mean, they can be for kids in that kids like,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.080
 this stuff just goes over kids heads.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.920
 I wouldn't notice.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.280
 But it is like insanely violent.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.760
 So I don't think it's made for kids.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.600
 - Okay.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.840
 So I thought you were headed.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.960
 - I just knew knowing you, like there was a direction

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.680
 you were headed with that where you were like,

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.960
 there's this guy who brought anime over to America

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.720
 to Western audiences.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.120
 And it's the mainstream stuff, but that stuff's no good.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.560
 I only watched the stuff that's hardcore,

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.720
 like only people in Japan enjoy it.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.120
 - I don't like this with anything.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.640
 Like I don't get why that's, this would be ascribed to me.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.640
 - Neil Vim, Arch Linux, Keto, CrossFit, somebody's thing.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.600
 - The thing is not even my dad, that's good.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.880
 I just go to a CrossFit gym.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.840
 Like that one doesn't even count.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.000
 - That means you're, no, it does count.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.160
 If you go to a CrossFit gym, that is the whole thing.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.880
 That's old, anybody who's in a CrossFit,

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.720
 that's all they can claim.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.240
 They go to the CrossFit gym.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.640
 You are lumped in with all of them.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.280
 - I just go there 'cause it's the closest gym

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.280
 and I can walk to it.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.120
 I can run to it.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.960
 That's the only reason I go to it.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.600
 - But it's like a totally different kind of work at it.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.360
 - No, I don't do the classes anymore.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.240
 I did, I did it initially to try it out.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.080
 - Oh, you just work out on their equipment.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.280
 - 'Cause they have like two open gym sessions every day.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.120
 Like two or three.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.480
 So I just go there and I, all their equipment

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.480
 and stuff on the squat.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.800
 - Flippin' tires.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.640
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.040
 - Gotta flippin' tires.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.960
 - It's like flinging chains around.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.040
 - I'm not strong with the tires.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:05.880
 - Okay.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.800
 (laughing)

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.760
 - You can stick me with the other stuff.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.040
 The knee of him and the Linux CrossFit one, not so much.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.120
 - Put my crown on and off.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.400
 - But I love, I love mainstream stuff.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.520
 Like, I love like just mass appeal.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.840
 In terms of entertainment, I love just mass appeal,

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.840
 like just turn your brain off stuff.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.800
 I also like just really, really good stuff as well.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.560
 I like both, I just like it all.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.400
 I don't wanna have it all.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.800
 - Do you like like stuff that wins Oscars?

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.120
 Like, do you like the movies that are like critically acclaimed?

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.880
 But people are like, I don't know, I didn't get it.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.440
 - I have this weird relationship with them

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.920
 where I almost always like them when I watch it,

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.560
 but I like never wanna watch one.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.360
 But like, if I'm somehow in a situation

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.880
 where I'm forced to watch one, like I love it.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.600
 But like, it's just another thing.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.440
 Like, I always want like the junk food,

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.040
 but I do like the good stuff as well.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.400
 - Oh, just like the simple.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.000
 Do you like watching like comedy movies?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.880
 Like just stupid dumb comedies.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.760
 - I feel like comedy movies like don't even exist as much anymore.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.320
 I feel like it just doesn't, it just doesn't,

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.160
 it's not even a thing.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.760
 I think something about, I think blockbusters,

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.280
 those like big actions, serious blockbusters,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.960
 make so much money that I just don't think

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.200
 studios do comedies as much.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.040
 I mean, they still do.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.160
 It just, they just go straight to,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.960
 they're like more for like watch at home type of thing.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.440
 - So I don't like, I don't like the big action movies either.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.800
 Casey loves watching just stupid comedies.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.040
 She doesn't wanna think, she just wants to maybe laugh

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.520
 a few times and that's it.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:29.520
 - I like like intense dramas like or like not sci-fi,

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.600
 but like what would you call the movie inception?

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.480
 Like that's like-

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.320
 - Mind fuck.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.960
 - Yes, that kind of movie.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.560
 Those are my favorite.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.920
 I like to think a lot and then still not get it.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.320
 - Those are my favorite movies too.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.640
 So those are definitely my favorites.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.000
 I think they're a mix of two where they're like,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.800
 they are really good, but it doesn't feel like,

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.000
 it feels approachable just to throw on.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.440
 - Yeah, I just like the basic good stuff.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.280
 Like I love all the personal movies.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.280
 My favorite director, Oppenheimer's coming up with him.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.720
 - Which one is he?

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.560
 - Christopher Nolan.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.400
 - What's the name?

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.640
 - He did an inception, sorry.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.480
 - Oh, inception.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.720
 - Did you say inception or did you say?

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.560
 - I just said inception.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.400
 - Oh, okay, sorry.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.240
 This is Shutter Island, never mind.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.160
 - You said Shutter, what is that?

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.000
 - You would like it.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.840
 - It's nothing like an inception.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.800
 - It's like that same category.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.440
 It's just they aren't caprios in both

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.880
 and I mix it up and similarly like a mind fuck movie.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.360
 (laughing)

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.480
 Yeah, I mean, I think you would love all his movies basically.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.800
 If you like inception, all of his movies are like that

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.920
 and my favorite movies are by him though.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.320
 - I would like some more movies like that.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.760
 I sent you a list.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.600
 - Okay.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.440
 - Yeah.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.560
 - Yeah, I just don't ever, we haven't watched movies

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.480
 in like the last five years at all.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.520
 - Your kids will get into them at some point, right?

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.560
 - I think so.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.920
 I don't know, most of my oldest is eight now

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.120
 and I feel like he's probably old enough.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.240
 I talked about taking him to the movies

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.800
 like a little date night and instead we,

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.020
 what did we do instead?

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.360
 I don't know, Casey had a different idea.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.800
 Casey's not super into movies.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.320
 So I grew up like we always watch movies at home.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.160
 - Yeah, we do.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.000
 - It went to the movies.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.240
 Casey not into them feels like it's a waste of time.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.080
 So we don't watch movies.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.400
 We compromise.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.240
 - And we don't watch this.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.440
 (laughing)

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.280
 - I'm just kidding.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.120
 I really don't care anymore.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.040
 Like at first I was like, but movie theater,

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.400
 it's so fun.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.120
 The smells and the sights.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.560
 - I can walk to remember the theater.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.400
 I love it.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.240
 - Are you serious?

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.080
 - Yeah, we walk there.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:15.920
 - Okay, Miami.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.760
 - It's nice.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.600
 - It's not all Miami just.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.680
 - It's just like living in a city.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.720
 - It's just like, you live in a populated area.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.160
 That's the, sometimes I'm like,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.640
 why doesn't everybody live in the Ozarks?

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.760
 This is amazing.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.000
 It's quiet.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.200
 It's cheap.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.360
 I have fast internet.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.760
 And then I remember like people can walk to movie theaters.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.640
 That's probably fun.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.480
 You can't walk to anything in the Ozarks.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.640
 - Go Matt's anime thing again, for me,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.560
 I was saying this while you were peeing.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.960
 It's just like, because I've seen so much stuff,

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.280
 when I find like a new like area of entertainment,

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.120
 I haven't explored.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.960
 It's like very exciting for me.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.400
 'Cause I'm like, 'cause for me, the struggle is always,

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.160
 I actually at this point, can't really work

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.800
 without having something on.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.160
 But if I don't know what I'm watching,

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.040
 I waste like 30 minutes trying to figure out

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:57.880
 what I'm watching.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.160
 It's always a frustrating experience.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.760
 But now I find it's like area of entertainment that I,

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.000
 you know, I haven't explored at all.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.080
 Just like, I just have a giant list of things to go through.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.080
 - Yeah.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.280
 - Where are you getting that list?

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.880
 Are you like, ask 'em trash?

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.720
 - You know what?

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.800
 Chat GBT is actually really amazing for this.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.120
 'Cause I can, I can like have kind of interesting interactions

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.960
 with it, 'cause I can say like,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.240
 so I asked it about this show I'm watching Attack on Titan.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.400
 I was like, what are some criticisms of it?

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.880
 'Cause I was curious to see if other people

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.720
 picked up on the same thing.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.640
 And it did list like the pacing,

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.600
 a bunch of things that I had issues with it.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.040
 So then I could specifically ask for like,

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.200
 what are other shows that,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.520
 here are the things that I liked about it.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.360
 Here's the stuff I didn't like about it.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.800
 What are the other shows that like, you know,

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.960
 fit that criteria?

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.800
 - Yeah.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.640
 - And it's pretty good.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.120
 Like at worst, it's just googling randomly.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.680
 And at best, it finds like kind of tailored stuff to me.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.160
 So we've done the same for like books.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.800
 My son loves reading like big long book series.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.040
 So we're like, he read all of the Magic Treehouse.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.200
 What else is there like it?

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.600
 And there's like 10 different series

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.600
 that he's branched into.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.440
 It's crazy.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.280
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.200
 - I want to explain really quick the last episode.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.600
 I ended it by saying, what did I say?

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.760
 Love you by or see you?

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.040
 Love you, what did I say?

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.880
 Love you by.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.720
 Love you by.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.200
 That's because DAX made a tweet.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.200
 I feel like I should explain this

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.760
 'cause it was just a weird ending.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.040
 Otherwise, people were like, what do you want?

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:21.720
 DAX made a tweet where he went to the, what was it?

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.560
 You went to the--

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.120
 - I didn't go to the vet.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.160
 The vet called me.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.280
 - The vet called you.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.440
 And they gave you really good news about your dog.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.800
 And then when you were getting off the phone,

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.640
 you said love you by.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.520
 I thought that was so funny.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.360
 - Yes.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.480
 And it was, I was like, love you by.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.320
 - Love you by.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.920
 (laughing)

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.960
 - Who did you say the by loud enough

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.000
 that it'll like cancel out the love you?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.840
 - She had no reaction.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.920
 She was just like.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.680
 (laughing)

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.080
 - I was like, I know you.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.320
 - I actually, I hate being around people.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.720
 I'm more and more convinced I have like a social disorder.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.520
 Sorry, that was heavy for what we were just talking about.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.640
 - I'm gonna say the most like first world problem thing ever.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.280
 So I'm gonna preface it with that right now.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.320
 When I live in New York, I had a dorm in.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.840
 I lived in two different buildings with dorm in, okay?

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.720
 And this is a quote, this is like a luxury things have

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.080
 in your life to have someone to like greet you,

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.160
 get your packages, like to like handle your packages,

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.000
 like just call some things.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.400
 - Sounds fancy, yeah.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.800
 - It is the worst thing ever.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.200
 For me, because every, that means every single time

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.880
 I leave my apartment, I have to say a greeting

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.720
 or say something.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.560
 - Yeah.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.760
 - And for someone like me who always gets tongue tied,

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.080
 I always said the dumbest stuff.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.080
 It would be anything like, I would say good morning.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:33.920
 - See you, love you.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.440
 - Yeah, I would say something like that.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.760
 Or I would give me, you have a package.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.040
 I'd be like, thanks you too, like just every single time.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.120
 Maybe like 50% of the time, I would say something weird.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.480
 - And then you're getting your own head about it

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.120
 'cause you know it's coming, you know at the bottom

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.520
 of the elevator, you're gonna talk to the dorm

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.760
 and you're like, and I just stopped leaving my apartment.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.560
 I just stayed in my apartment and I just stopped leaving.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.840
 - That's awesome.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.680
 - Yeah.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.640
 - I mean, I don't leave my house,

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.120
 but not because I have a dorm in it.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.480
 - You should get one.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.320
 It's got a butler, I think.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.760
 - Can you have a dorm in at your house?

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.040
 - I'm surprised you don't have butlers.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.520
 - Stand out, say a butler, okay, yeah.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.920
 - If there were butlers in the Ozarks and I could find it,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.640
 you don't know how hard I've looked for good help around here.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.480
 Like we wanna hire a personal chef,

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.920
 or like make all of our meals.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.000
 Just like every single meal, we don't wanna think about it,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 we don't wanna clean up after it,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.120
 we don't wanna buy the groceries,

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.800
 we just wanna like hire somebody.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.720
 It is so hard, that's another thing.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.000
 If we lived in Miami, I'm sure we'd just be like,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.640
 I don't know, personal chefs are us.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.480
 We'd go to the store and pick one up.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.480
 - Is that what you do?

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.400
 - Yeah, that's how our things are these.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.440
 There's have people at stores you can pick up.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.400
 - Yeah, yeah, like I'll take that one in the green shirt.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.880
 - Yes, now we've tried, we wanna hire people

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.200
 to do lots of things around here.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.000
 We got the means, first world, problems, can't find people.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.640
 So if you live in the Ozark, I'm just kidding,

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.600
 I'm not gonna do that, I've solicited.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.400
 - I'm not moving to Ozarks, Adam.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.960
 - No, I'm not like, if someone's listening,

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.960
 there's people that listen to this,

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.120
 I don't know if you knew this is not just a phone call.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.480
 Did I tell you, I actually put these on the internet.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.440
 - Oh, well you do.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.480
 (laughs)

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.680
 - The comment about the thumbnail from last time.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.720
 - The thumbnail. - Remember someone was like,

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.000
 oh dang, you like used a stupid picture of Adam

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.360
 and a serious picture of yourself.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.560
 And I was like, nope, Adam did that to himself.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.280
 - I did, I just wanted to mix it up.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.840
 I was like, all these look the same.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.880
 I got to be one that looks totally different.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.680
 And I did, I did one totally different.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.680
 - Yeah, that was good.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.400
 - Did we finish the conversation about anime?

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.440
 I feel like most of this conversation's been about anime.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.520
 - I don't know, I'm watching it, make fun of me.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.640
 - No, I'm not making fun of you.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.360
 I don't make fun of people.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.080
 - Oh, okay, yeah, there's a crowd, yeah.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.200
 - The whole anime thing, I don't make fun of it

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.800
 because I don't understand it.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.440
 I want to understand it so I can make fun of it.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.880
 But I need to understand it first.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.040
 So if you could just give me like a primer,

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.360
 just like here's the first thing,

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.200
 just watch this and you'll understand anime,

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.040
 that would be great.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.880
 - Here's a thing.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.440
 I actually think I could give you great guidance on this.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.440
 The moment I do, there's going to be a thousand nerds

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.720
 that show up that are going to be like,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.840
 no, that's stupid, like that's not,

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.200
 that's not real anime, man.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.000
 - It's way too Western, that's too mainstream.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.840
 - The stuff you like, like you said,

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.840
 you like Inception, like those, like,

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.040
 I think people call them Cerebral,

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:07.960
 they're Cerebral movies.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.080
 - Oh, yes.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.760
 - There is a lot of stuff in anime category

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.640
 that is like lean towards that.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.920
 So I like that kind of content.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.440
 I think I've exhausted like movies

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.560
 and like just normal TV shows that do that.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.760
 That's like, that is my favorite stuff.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.440
 So that's why I'm onto this.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.640
 - Is there like a favorite TV show that's Cerebral

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.960
 that you could point me to?

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.800
 - A Cerebral TV show.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.480
 - Anything from the last 10 years,

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.320
 probably haven't seen it.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.560
 - So I love the first season,

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.720
 there's a show called Love Death Robots.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.040
 It's a first, it's him in an anthology.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.120
 So they basically take--

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.480
 - Hang on, what's an anthology?

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.320
 What's an anthology?

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.400
 - I don't know. - What is an anthology?

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.800
 - But I'm gonna guess,

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.160
 in case I'm what it is,

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.960
 I was gonna say and just gonna try to guess.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.480
 - You didn't say the word that you didn't know.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.160
 - 'Cause it says it and it's like,

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.440
 Love Death Robots, an anthology series, whatever.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.000
 But I think what it means is--

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 - I just caught you.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.160
 - You're just gonna go out and explain it.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.080
 - Every episode is unrelated.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.920
 It's like just like 10 different unrelated stories

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.880
 with 10 different animation styles.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.800
 And a lot of them are very good and very thought provoking.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.160
 There's one called Zima Blue,

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.240
 which is like, it's only like 10 minutes,

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.080
 you just go watch that.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.360
 - Zima, you said like the drink?

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.600
 - Yeah, like the drink.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.800
 It is like the deepest thing I've ever seen in my whole life.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.560
 It was like, it like stuck with me forever.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.960
 Like me and Liz have seen it twice

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.960
 in my-- - Really?

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.600
 - Yeah, it's like very thought provoking.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.840
 And a few of them are--

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.520
 - Zima Blue, did you say?

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.760
 - Yeah.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.080
 - Zima Blue, okay.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:45.000
 I think I know of another anthropology, anthology.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.080
 What was it, anthology is Black Mirror and anthology?

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.080
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.560
 So this is what it's definitely what, yeah.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.680
 Black Mirror fits in this category.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.760
 Have you seen a bunch of Black Mirror?

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.760
 There's a new season coming out.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.480
 - I've seen, I think I've seen one Black Mirror.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.520
 And so Casey hates my wife.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.600
 Casey hates like dark things, doesn't like--

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.480
 - Yeah, Black Mirror's pretty dark.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.480
 - Yeah, and she told me to watch Black Mirror.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.480
 She had watched one or two of them,

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.400
 and she's like, you would love this.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.920
 And she liked it, which I had heard from other people,

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.880
 it's super dark, you would not like it.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.240
 - There's some episodes that aren't,

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.500
 most episodes are like dystopian,

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.240
 but then there's some that are like really,

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.440
 like they make you feel good at the end.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.360
 - Oh, okay.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.200
 - Yeah.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.040
 - There's a few--

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.040
 - I generally like to feel good at the end.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.200
 I don't like to feel bad at the end after watching something.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.040
 It's like, why did I do that?

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.280
 I could have got on Twitter, but she wouldn't feel bad.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.960
 - I talk about watching sports when I care.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.800
 - Yeah, okay.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.560
 So that Miami Heat lost in the finals.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.040
 How many Miami Heat games would you say

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.120
 you watched this year, Dax?

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.560
 - Maybe like four?

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.600
 - Oh, you really watched some games?

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.440
 The four final games?

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.280
 - I went to two in person.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.120
 - Do they get one?

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:45.960
 - And--

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.880
 - You went to two Heat, oh yeah, that's right.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.840
 That's all the picture.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.680
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.880
 No, 'cause Liz's family has season tickets,

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.520
 so it's like, and just ends up being

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.280
 like a random thing to do.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.640
 - Yeah.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.600
 - Okay, so you are kind of a Heat fan.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.040
 I made fun of you when you're like,

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.480
 oh, the Heat lost, feel bad for me.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.640
 I'm like, I don't feel bad for you,

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.320
 'cause you don't care about sports, apparently.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.520
 - I don't really care about sports.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.680
 You're right, I just don't care about watching sports,

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.720
 but you know, I got sucked in.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.520
 - Yeah, did you like any New York teams

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.360
 when you lived in New York?

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.000
 Did you like go to Yankee games?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.200
 - No, I never really cared.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.640
 There's also two New York teams,

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.480
 so there's like--

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.800
 - And like every sport, right?

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:19.640
 It's like--

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.480
 - Yeah, so it's always like,

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.600
 that's like diluted for me when the whole city's not like,

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.960
 oh, and on one thing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.080
 What's that little green light behind you?

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.280
 There's a little green dot.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.280
 Looks like a Christmas light.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.880
 - That's my electric longboard,

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.920
 and it's a charger.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.600
 It's a charging light, my electric longboard.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.920
 - Okay, what is a longboard?

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.080
 And then we'll talk about what an electric longboard is.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.800
 - A longboard is like a skateboard,

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.640
 except it's longer and the wheels are bigger,

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.200
 so it's not optimized for tricks 'cause it's heavy,

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.080
 but it is optimized for going fast,

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.600
 staying really stable, and it's a great transport.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.640
 Transportation device.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.320
 - Like instead of a bike, you like ride it to town?

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.640
 - Yeah, so when I first moved to New York,

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.440
 I got a normal longboard, and it's super useful

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.960
 'cause it just increases the range

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.280
 that you can go in 15 minutes by a lot.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.080
 So I pretty much could go anywhere on my longboard,

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.840
 as long as it wasn't cold.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.320
 And then a bunch of electric longboards

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.080
 started coming out where it's exact same thing

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.000
 as a longboard except a battery attached to the bottom

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.080
 and motors on both back wheels.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.400
 And that comes with brakes also.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.240
 - How fast are we talking about?

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.240
 - This thing can hit like 30 something miles an hour.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.960
 - Have you ever hit anybody?

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.000
 - I've gotten seriously hurt once.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.760
 Not seriously hurt, but--

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.400
 - Like you ran into something?

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.760
 - A person.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.400
 - You ran into a person?

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.920
 - 100% was not my fault, so--

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.800
 - Does insurance cover collisions with longboards?

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.960
 - No, probably not.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.320
 (laughing)

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.000
 I don't have like vehicle insurance on my--

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.440
 - Yeah, I would mix them.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.360
 - Okay, so in New York, there's something called

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.400
 the West Side Highway, which is incredible,

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.520
 'cause it's a highway that goes all the way down the West Side,

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.480
 and there is a completely separate bike lane.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.400
 It's like a two-lane bike lane that's not even,

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.880
 it's not even like attached to the main road.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.040
 There's like, it's a completely separate off to the side.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:03.880
 - Oh, nice.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.160
 - Yeah, you can just zip down there,

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.400
 and it's like all bikes go up and down there is beautiful.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.800
 It's on the water.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.520
 The whole way up and down is like parks and trees,

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.560
 and it's really nice, one of my favorite things to do

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.280
 in New York, either walk up and down the West Side Highway

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.520
 or a longboard down, but it's for bikes

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.320
 and for longboards and for vehicles.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.560
 Someone stepped into it without looking like five feet

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.640
 in front of me, and I dodged him.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.800
 I actually didn't hit him.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.840
 I like maybe grazed him.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.840
 I dodged him, like I swerved around him,

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.400
 but then I couldn't retain my balance.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.920
 I just super manned out, like flew into the air,

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.160
 and then I landed, and just scraped my elbows.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.000
 And I was on my way to go see Alan,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.200
 'cause we're gonna play basketball.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.040
 - Yeah.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.720
 - And I showed up, and I was just covered in blood,

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.420
 and I was like, "Yeah."

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.400
 (laughing)

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.640
 - So probably not playing basketball,

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.520
 or were you just like unguardable now,

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.720
 'cause people don't want to touch you,

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.720
 or just cover it a little bit, but I was like, "Yeah."

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.080
 (laughing)

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.120
 - I mean, I can't imagine even going,

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.840
 even going like on a bike 30 miles an hour, sounds hard.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.680
 I can't imagine standing on a board,

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.800
 going that fast and not just falling off.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.080
 - It's a complicated thing where

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.320
 you're usually not going to how to speed always.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.600
 And quote unquote, falling is just like,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.440
 stepping off of like a four inch lift off the ground.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.600
 It's not like a bike where you're like,

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.880
 kind of like it's a complicated thing or something too.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.920
 So if I got to a situation, usually I could just like,

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.280
 step off and then, or hit the brakes and step off.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.600
 It like, it actually wasn't that sketchy.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.360
 The only time I got hurt was I hit a pothole,

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.920
 'cause I wasn't paying attention, which was really bad at me.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.760
 - Ooh.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.720
 - Were you watching something? Did you have your shows up?

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.280
 - This is a super embarrassing story, ready?

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.960
 You ready for the most embarrassing story ever?

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.280
 - Let me set this scene.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.480
 So I am 25 years old, maybe 24, 25.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.040
 I am in New York and I work in tech

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.760
 and I'm very much a software engineer

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.520
 and that's my whole identity, okay?

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.360
 (laughing)

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.240
 And of course, I'm writing electric long word.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.200
 Very, this is all fitting, right?

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.560
 Of course I'm in tech, I have this weird mobility device

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.400
 that I'm using.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.600
 (laughing)

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.880
 I am wearing a backpack,

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.480
 'cause all of our engineers wear backpacks

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.000
 and my stuff is in there.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.960
 So I go and I hit this pothole and then when I fall,

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.240
 my backpack flips open and all my stuff flies out.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.320
 So not only do I fall, all my contents flew out.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.160
 Guess what flew out?

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.000
 - Oh no.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.640
 - A MacBook, because I'm a software engineer,

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.480
 a MacBook flew out.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.320
 - Oh no.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.560
 - And two bottles of soilents and I was like.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.000
 (laughing)

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.840
 - It's like the biggest meme ever.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.360
 - Yeah, I know, I was like, man, if someone,

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.360
 this is literally a scene out of Silicon Valley.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.280
 Like someone got this on camera.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.000
 It's like just the most embarrassing situation ever.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.440
 - Soil it, you did the soilent thing.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:50.320
 - For me, it was like a good breakfast option slash like,

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.160
 if I'm like in between things,

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.640
 like it's like a good way to like get my calories, but.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.480
 - Yeah.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.320
 - Yeah.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.160
 - So.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.000
 - Sure.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.840
 (laughing)

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.160
 - So we'll go with the breakfast thing.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.480
 - Was it a Herschel backpack?

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.320
 Was it a Herschel backpack?

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.160
 - It was a Herschel backpack.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.000
 (laughing)

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.320
 - It was a Herschel backpack.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.720
 It wasn't, it wasn't like the normal one though.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.200
 It was one that had the flip thing on the back,

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.480
 which is why I flipped open when I fell.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.080
 - I love this story so much.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.520
 You've got to tell that story in some kind of like,

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.240
 I don't know, a tweet thread or something.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.680
 Do you have any pictures of your stuff

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.480
 laying on the ground now?

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.320
 - Okay.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.600
 - I still have a little bit of a scar.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.560
 - Oh wow, left a scar.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.960
 - And also, yeah, I guess it'll help me.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.080
 There's like big, tough construction worker.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.560
 (laughing)

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.120
 - Here's your soilent little boy.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.360
 (laughing)

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.000
 - He like gave me, yeah, the advantage ran away.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.840
 - Oh wow.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.680
 - Yeah.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.520
 - Very helpful.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.080
 Hey, what's going on with Reddit before we get off here?

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:44.920
 - I don't know.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.800
 - I heard those like 10 years ago.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.760
 - Yeah, me too, but I mean, I don't use it,

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.600
 but I've heard that like, I don't know,

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.520
 is it like, ending, is it over?

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.800
 - It seems, I mean, I think,

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.760
 did we talk about this a little bit in the last podcast?

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.600
 - I don't know.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.720
 I don't think so, but did we?

00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.880
 - Oh, maybe, I don't know.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.000
 - Yeah, we did.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.720
 - Okay, then nevermind, I'll listen to our podcast

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.560
 and I'll get caught up.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.400
 (laughing)

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.240
 I'm sorry.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.200
 - I remember. - It has ended.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.440
 - Maybe I'm thinking of something else.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.200
 I thought I didn't know anything about this.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.680
 So maybe I just wasn't listening to you.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.200
 - We were talking about Twitch.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.520
 - For sure.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.360
 - Twitch.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.960
 - We talked about the weird stuff Twitch was doing

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.800
 and then--

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.640
 - Yeah, and we talked about it.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.480
 - Did we talk about it?

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.800
 - Oh, okay, well.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.640
 - I don't know.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.480
 - I'll catch up later.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.320
 - I'll catch up later.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.280
 - The API pricing going crazy.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.120
 Oh no, we did talk about it.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:26.960
 - We did talk about it.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.720
 - Oh, we talked about APIs, yeah, people charging.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.640
 Why is everybody all of a sudden charging for APIs?

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.240
 - Just like, not free.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.080
 - Because these companies

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.160
 are taken over by Dummies, I think that's really it.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.000
 - Okay.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.560
 Okay, episode 30 in the books.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.120
 30, that's a nice round number.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.720
 Nice even number.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.360
 - We are halfway to our goal.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.320
 - Wait, our goal is 60?

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.160
 - I'm just kidding.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.000
 (laughing)

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:50.840
 - As far as your reaction.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.920
 (laughing)

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.280
 - You're talking about that last episode, dude,

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.160
 'cause I don't remember that either.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.620
 - Where was I last episode?

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.720
 All right, let's get off here.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.560
 - All right, yep.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.400
 - See you next.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.980
 (upbeat music)

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.660
 (upbeat music)
