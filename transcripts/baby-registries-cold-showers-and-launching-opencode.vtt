WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
 Yeah, I think like go ahead. Now you go. Who knows what I was about to say. Yeah, you sleep the private who knows

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.680
 Did you notice that the names stay the white? What a funny riverside feature. So under our names,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.640
 you see the descriptions. Yeah. Oh, that's from the stand up. Yeah, so they can change our descriptions

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.120
 and then they stick in the middle. I can't read yours because you're wearing a white shirt

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.080
 in the Texas light. And I'm so curious. I don't know. It says it says resident nice guy.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.280
 That's a good one for you. It's funny. I just says vegan vegan vegan vegan vegan vegan. Yeah,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.680
 which is accurate. Yours is accurate and mine is also accurate.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:18.560
 By the way, you and Casey sent us baby stuff. Yes, we did. Thank you for that. Also,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.680
 how did you even think to find her registry Casey's amazing. I'm assuming it was her. I did.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.280
 I didn't find out though before you did. So that was good. She told me she did it. I was like,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.040
 Yes, I can be like, yeah, you're welcome. And I'll be like, what are you talking about? Yeah,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.320
 the baby ratio thing was funny because so I never done anything like that because I have a small

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.680
 family. You never had a baby. Yeah. Yeah, just registry in general, like, or just your family buying

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.920
 you stuff like the more people you have, like the more stuff you can get, right? So we had a small

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.600
 family and we never had a we never did the wedding registry thing because we had a small wedding.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.720
 So Liz was like, man, my family owes me because we haven't done any of those things. And she's got

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.560
 a big family. So she started making this list and literally as she was making it, like, you know,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.120
 one of her aunts was like, Oh, like, let me see what you did so far. And she sent the list to her

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.280
 aunt, then it started leaking. Like the list started getting around and people started buying stuff.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.840
 And then my mom was like, wait, what? Like, I wanted to get that what I wanted to get that.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.560
 My mom felt like, oh, yeah, annoyed that she couldn't get anything that was like very meaningful,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.720
 you know, like all the good ones were taken. And I'm like, this is amazing. Like boxes were just

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.040
 showing up to her house and like, it's so expensive. It's really, it's a really great situation. Yeah,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.360
 it's a great situation. I can remember, but I don't know if we did the wedding I know we did for the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.400
 babies, but it's a good feeling. Yeah, you just got a lot on your mind. There's a lot going on and

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.240
 just having people buy you stuff and like be excited to buy you stuff is kind of awesome.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.840
 Yeah, like fighting over it. And then we have so much stuff and like,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.600
 it's spread out among like, you know, 50 people. So yeah, I'll do the most expensive baby honor.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.200
 Why not? Yeah, exactly. My expensive taste really shines.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.000
 We randomly came across the store like in like physically like we saw this like baby

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.640
 stroller and like car seat store. And we went and visited it to see like, oh, let's forget what

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.680
 shoulders we want to do. And they literally had like this strip of all the different terrains,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.200
 which I swear they like from our neighborhood. Like it literally covers all the terrain in our

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.400
 neighborhood. And you can try each stroller on it on the different terrains. That's amazing.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.280
 And then and Liz was like, you know what? So we tried a bunch and was like, you know what?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.600
 I really like this one. And I'm like, okay, cool. Like, let's look at the price. Of course,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.240
 it's the most expensive one, right? So I'm like, okay, whatever, like it goes in the red sheet.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.360
 I think her parents got it for us. And then I'm like, okay, I didn't have time to do the car seat

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.800
 and get it on a registry to do research. So let me like, so a couple days ago, I was like looking

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.000
 up car seat stuff. Of course, the stroller we have is like the apple of strollers where like,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.440
 nothing is compatible with it. Like you have to just be locked into their

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.360
 stroller ecosystem. And everything is like 30% more expensive because of that.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.000
 Yeah. Yeah, it's the it's a bugaboo Fox Pro 5, which it's a great stroller. It's a great product

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.640
 from what I can tell so far. We've we've taken it because Zuko is like a little afraid of

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.280
 he's like always been afraid of like shopping carts and shoulders and stuff. So we were

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.440
 practicing it with him. And we were with it. Yeah. But we like, we want to walks with it. And I'm

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.440
 like, I really hope nobody like tries to look inside and be like, Oh, let me see the cute baby.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.040
 And they're like, what? It's empty. Put a coconut in there.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.560
 Great stroller. But you know, it's a it's a

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.800
 strollers are a great investment. Like, I've got a five year old who still sometimes we go on

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.360
 family walks and he rides in the stroller. Like he's not too big to to sit in it. So we've got

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.840
 it. Is it like the same stroller that you had from when they were a kid and like convert to all

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.000
 these from stages or is it like a lie? Well, you know, I don't remember either. I don't think either

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.080
 of them really did the stroller thing when they were little, like we had babies that didn't want to be

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.480
 in car seats or strollers. Like we just we didn't do it much. I think in fact, I think Casey got this

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.360
 stroller when Archie was already like two or three. I don't think it was ever in use as a baby. So

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.080
 maybe it doesn't even work for babies. I don't know. Yeah, I guess our lifestyle's a little different

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.120
 because like we're going to be like going around our neighborhood a lot. So yeah, you can walk. Yeah.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:33.040
 And then for reasons that are not pointless. Not focusing yourself to walk. Just like why empty

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:40.080
 roads so you don't die at age 60. Yeah, exactly. That's the only reason we walk. Yeah. Speaking of

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.880
 walking, I have some things to share with you. I nice transition. This is I'm so excited. What is

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.320
 this going to be? Well, you know, it's a walking running and I've gotten into running two weeks ago.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.840
 Oh, really? I mean, yeah, I've been doing it in the mornings. Yeah. Yeah, me too. So here's a funny

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.360
 little thing. So I got I started two weeks ago. I'm I'm I just finished week two. And the first

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:10.000
 week I started our water heater broke. So we didn't have like hot water. And you know, as it's like

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 your house, like the power went out briefly at night and came back on and something about that,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.720
 like you need like a hard reset from inside. But there were three days where we didn't have it.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.320
 And as an art clinics user, normally I'm fine, not showering for three days. But given I just

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.120
 picked up running and it's a summer in Miami, I came home drenched in sweat. I'm like, there's no

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.480
 way I just have to take a cold shower and my whole life, cold shower, my whole life, I got

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.760
 my whole life being like, cold showers are so stupid. Like, why would I ever do that? It's just

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.600
 unpleasant. I just want to be comfortable. I don't give a shit. I want to take a hot shower.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:52.960
 And then I turn on the water and I was also like, no, I don't know how this sucks. And I get into it.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.400
 And it sucked for 30 seconds. And something in my brain flipped where it was like, yeah,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.280
 it's like being in the pool. It's hot. And you get in the pool and it feels amazing.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.280
 And now I'm like addicted to cold showers. Like I look forward to the run specifically so I can

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.520
 get this feeling about going into a cold pool. Yes. Like, I love sauna or exercise, get really hot,

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.160
 and then getting a cold shower, a cold plunge. Yeah, it feels crazy good. And I'm like, this,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.120
 like in hindsight, it makes sense. Because like, yeah, like when I get into a pool, I'm not like,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.920
 fuck this pool. I hate it. I'm like, this is awesome. Yeah, I get the ocean. I like it too. So it's

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.200
 just like, it's like what your brain expects. And that determines whether you're supposed to warm.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.800
 Yeah, it's like, it makes no sense that I would be drenched in sweat after running a 90 degree

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.640
 heat and getting to a hot shower. But I would like you guys. Well, that's what my brain expected,

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.760
 right? So if these two, but what's funny is if these two things hadn't happened in the same week,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.680
 I would have never discovered this. Like, it's a really happy accident.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.920
 So true. Like, if you hadn't been running, it hadn't been summer and you hadn't lost your

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.040
 hot weight or that's amazing. Yeah. Coincidence. I'm like a whole new person now. I feel amazing

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:09.840
 every morning. Yeah. It's great. I feel like garbage. But that's because I can't sleep.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.680
 It's been, I think I'm day three of like very, very low sleep.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.440
 Is it because you're sort of super excited about everything?

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:26.720
 Is it? It's a combination of personal struggles and work excitement. It's definitely stress.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.880
 It's like cortisol in my system in the middle of the night. I just can't, it's the can't stay

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.440
 asleep thing. I fall asleep great. I'm like a champion at falling asleep at the beginning of

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:41.680
 the night. Like world class, five minutes tops every time. And I sleep till about two

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:47.360
 really well every night. And then after two, it's just like coin flip. It could be a great

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.760
 night. It could be a night where I get up to P like last night at two thirty and I am up

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.920
 the rest of the day. I'm laying in bed till five, but I am literally awake.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.160
 And that's been like two or three days. So it starts to pile on and like,

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.600
 I'm dragging. Do you not crash at some point? I'll sleep really well tonight. Saturday morning,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.520
 because I don't work on the weekends anymore. Like I don't. And I used to wake up early on

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.200
 Saturday and Sunday and still in work those days. Now that I don't wake up to work,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.240
 I somehow mentally like my brain just says, now I can sleep and I sleep super. I'll sleep till

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.440
 like seven thirty tomorrow, which is like insane for me. Yeah. You know, it's, yeah, it's funny.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.160
 It's like when you get older to all this stuff, at least for me, it was, I don't know how you

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.520
 were like as a kid, but as a, when I was like a teenager, I could just sleep till like one p.m.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.640
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. The afternoon sleeps. Yeah. It's like the concept of like,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.200
 oh, no, I woke up. I can't go back to sleep. That's just like, was so like, like, what,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.880
 what the heck is that? I think about this all the time, how much like,

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.800
 just sleeping is such a hard thing in my life. And like, as a kid, how dumb that would have sounded,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:57.760
 like, what do you mean? It's hard to sleep. It's hard to get up ever. But like, when you're a kid,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.760
 and I'm still like, I still see myself as someone that like sleeps kind of like a rock, but even

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.840
 I've had situations now where I've gotten to this habit of like, when I wake up and like,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.080
 I wake up has a certain amount. My brain just flips into your wake, you're starting your day,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.800
 you're doing everything. And that gets triggered by accident sometimes like, like, let's have a,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.480
 let's change up to her alarm the other day. And she like, she got like much better than she normally

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.520
 did. And my brain just acted like I was waking up. And I like got like an hour and a half, let's

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:35.760
 sleep as I normally do. And it's like wild to me that this is like a problem. Usually like, my whole

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:42.480
 life waking up was the biggest challenge. Yes. Possible. Like growing up going to school every

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.840
 morning. I hated waking up and not going to sleep. Yeah, it was every single morning. I'd always

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.560
 miss the bus. It's just a huge thing. So yeah, I think when you get older, you're just like,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.320
 I'm working now or like, I don't know, maybe it's because this is like a positive way to spin it.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.800
 I just didn't want to go to school. So that didn't really. Yeah, right. Yeah, the positive way to

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.240
 spin it is that like, we enjoy our adult lives and we're excited to wake up and be awake for it.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.480
 Yeah, no, it's like most of the fun things in life happen when you're awake. Yeah, all of them,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.400
 maybe. I don't know. I had some breakfast. So I'm feeling a little better now. I was like,

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:26.720
 an hour ago, I was like, am I should I be on a podcast? I don't know. Yeah. So the other thing is,

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:34.000
 we launched open code yesterday. So congratulations to you and to all of us. It is our biggest launch

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.240
 ever. I think my tweet has 2000 likes on it. It hit 1000 like so quickly. Our biggest open code

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.800
 launch ever because I feel like we've launched three or four times. Yeah, I know. Now biggest

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.960
 launch. I think this thing I've ever launched ever. Oh, really? In terms of like speed of likes.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:56.400
 Yeah, in terms of initial like, just reaction. I will say it feels like this whole project,

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.120
 there's been so much pent up demand. Like every time there's murmurs, it feels like people are like,

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.840
 very anxiously awaiting this thing, which is interesting because there are established,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.920
 I mean, cloud code is, I guess, established in the AI world. It's like, it's been around for two

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:16.800
 months. I think it's a combination of, to be honest, a lot of stuff we release ends up feeling this way

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.960
 because I do not know how other companies do it. I just leak information left and right. Like,

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:29.520
 as I work on it, I share it. I like post stuff. We haven't even implemented yet. I like,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:35.280
 I'm so just watched how I do everything and I can't operate any other way,

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:40.560
 or as most companies like build in silence and then they like do like a big announcement. Nobody

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:46.160
 sees coming. But I think given that that's how I just, I just can't operate in the other way,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.760
 it naturally creates like this fervor around it, where everyone's like kind of watching it and

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.920
 they're like, keeping up with it and they're like kind of anxiously waiting for me to say like,

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.600
 okay, go. So that's one, that's part of it. So I feel like this happened a few times like when we did

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.600
 SCV3 felt this way, open off felt this way. I remember being on the other end of it. Yeah.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.480
 I remember being one of the people in the crowd like, yes, just being in the least. Yeah. Yeah.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.080
 And it all gets to a point where I'm like, I can't, I got to stop doing this. And I like,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.800
 just like the final week, I go super silent and then I release it. Yeah. That would always goes.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:28.160
 It's that multiplied by the fact that this is, and I was telling the team yesterday, like,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:35.920
 it feels so good to finally build something where I'm like 100% of the audience and reach we built

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.920
 up and worked hard to build up over the last five years can be tapped into for this thing. Like,

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.120
 this is something that truly anyone can use that's combined with that. And then combined with like,

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.160
 the fact that AI is like, everyone's a kind of really interested in figuring out where it flows

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.560
 right now. So I think all those being combined together is just making this much bigger than

00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.640
 anything else. Yeah. And it makes it so exciting to work on. I mean, I just like being at this

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.760
 moment in time in these careers that we have, like being software developers, I feel like it's a very

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.560
 critical couple of years where things are definitely changing. Like, you can say what you want about

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.440
 LLMs. I know there's still a lot of like, it's got that MongoDB thing where people like hate it for

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:21.280
 reasons that were like years ago. Like, whatever you think about LLMs, they're at the very least,

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.040
 they're going to be very good at coding. Like, they're already very good at coding. And I feel like,

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.320
 it's going to change software development in some meaningful way over the next couple of years,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.720
 it already has started. So I think being at this point in time and working on something at that

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.160
 intersection where you're actually getting to help shape what it could look like and think

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.480
 about what it could look like, just super fun. Maybe we're way off. Maybe, you know, in two years,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.760
 things change so much because the models are different and whatever. But it's just fun to be in

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.440
 this moment, kind of working on this problem when you've been doing this a long time. Like,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.560
 you've been working as a programmer for 15 years. It's just fun to kind of be on the front lines.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.400
 Yeah, I know if you saw my post where I said, I finally feel like I'm the right age for one of

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:08.000
 these big shifts because everything, you know, I think I technically lived through a few big

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.440
 things, right? Like, I technically lived through the internet thing. I was obviously way too young

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.480
 for when like the internet took off. I lived through the mobile thing. I lived through, I guess,

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.440
 just like, I would probably count just the SaaS thing, like just like the era where like a million

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:28.800
 SaaS companies shot up to like a billion dollars. And in all of those moments, I was literally too

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:35.840
 young or even if I was like working age, I was too stupid. Where even if I was trying to like,

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.320
 do something in it, I would just end up working on something dumb because I couldn't see that.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:46.080
 I think when these things happen, there's like so many things that you can do and 99% of it

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.400
 seems like a great idea, but it's kind of has a good obvious ceiling. I would have just found

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.760
 myself working on one of those due to inexperience. But now there's finally a shift happening where

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.520
 like I have enough experience to be like, I know I can identify the nine out of 10 good ideas that

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:09.760
 are actually bad. So I can actually work on the thing that makes sense. And I have like the reach

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:15.520
 to like actually, you know, market it, distribute it. And it's something like just like a skill

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:21.920
 experience, like build a good product. Like everything is finally aligning where in the past,

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.640
 it always felt way more like, Oh, that's like other people doing that. And I'm like, kind of,

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:32.400
 kind of like ride code tails, you know, yeah. Yeah, it's a good product. Like we made a good

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.400
 thing. It's really like, yeah, it's impressive in such a short amount of time. Like it was less

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:42.240
 than a month ago, started rewriting, right? That feels like forever ago, when you think of just

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.560
 the shift that it's taken, I mean, the direction it's gone. Yeah, do you find it weird? Do you find

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.920
 it like crazy that I think we work well together and like, we started a podcast way before we had

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.240
 ever done anything together? You know what I mean? Like, do we work well together, like programming

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:03.200
 wise because we had this going on? I mean, it definitely helps. But there's some weird overlap

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.960
 that is uncommon. And I would even say that the overlap is actually more true with Frank and Jay

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:16.560
 than it is with me and something that I had to like learn. So my approach to product forever was to

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:24.000
 like just get core stuff working and like never polish it or make it feel really good. And I would

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.240
 like kind of be annoyed doing those little details because it felt like a waste of time.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.520
 And that totally changed when I started working with Frank and Jay, because they like made me

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.640
 see a totally different way. And I understood that we're just, I understood all the reasons why that

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.280
 was wrong. Like you needed the polish stuff and put out stuff that's like really well tested and

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:49.680
 handled edge cases. And you naturally go that way. And I don't think most people do, especially

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.880
 most engineers, like I think most engineers are like kind of like how I was originally.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:59.280
 And that can be really frustrating when that doesn't line up on both sides because like

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:06.640
 everyone, if you don't believe in the underlying reason to like go that intense on some of these

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:13.360
 details, like it's just going to feel very annoying to work together. So I think that's just like a

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.800
 like a random coincidence or gift or maybe the explanation is like you've, you know, built

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.640
 stuff and have learned the same lessons. But yeah, I think we work together in like weirdly

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:29.920
 coincidental nice ways. Yeah. Yeah, I just I was just thinking about this morning trying to figure

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.800
 out like, like which came first or is it just a coincidence that we enjoyed talking to each

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.920
 other and have to have a podcast and then also happened to work well together and something about

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.880
 it. Like the programming thing could have been totally I'm just trying to remember when we first

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.760
 like even worked on the same repo together, did it was it super weird to go from it's like when you

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.680
 meet somebody in person that you've only DMed or something. It's like, oh, now we're writing code

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.200
 together. This is weird. I don't even remember. I guess it would have probably been rebase.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:06.000
 Shout out. I think it's funny because to me it just feels kind of like a miracle because I it's

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.840
 so easy for me to forget this, but my entire career every single day's emotion was I'm getting work

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:19.040
 done, but it's like so annoying and difficult. And I wish everyone would just listen to me.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:25.280
 And it was like always just like like constant friction. And then at some point when I started

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.680
 working Frank and Jay, that just totally disappeared. And I forgot that that's what work feels like

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:36.880
 for most people. And that was me finding like my right fit with other people. And the work I did

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.680
 was suddenly overnight like 10x better. Like I was always capable of that. It just I wasn't

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.840
 in the right environment. And if I had to like pinpoint specific details, I just don't it's the

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.720
 feeling I get when we all work together is I feel like everyone just goes off and does their own

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:58.160
 thing and doesn't really need a ton of help and doesn't care to like be overly opinionated about

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:04.000
 stuff outside of that. And even when there is like stuff that needs to be fixed, everyone

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.760
 we very quickly like even like I think this is the feeling of always felt working Frank and Jay is

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.040
 even when there's a conflict where we have a disagreement on how something should be done,

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.800
 which one happens rarely because we're almost always on the same page. But when it happens,

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:26.240
 it's resolved super quickly. Like within 10 minutes, we've we've worked out who's actually

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:32.720
 right. And everyone's like fully on board and not like well, I'll like I'll say they're right,

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.720
 but I'm still annoyed under the hood. And like, you know, I'm gonna have a heart

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.360
 versus excitement, which is usually how conflicts are resolved. Someone wins, but not everyone's

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:46.160
 on board. Yeah, so just dynamics I've gotten so used to, but it is rare.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.280
 It's very, very common on a team for there to be those things that drag on and there's like

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.680
 multiple meetings to try and figure out who's right and what's the direction that should be

00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.720
 gone. And then yeah, no one even feels good at the end. There's not total buy-in on the other

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:07.440
 thing. And I just take this so for granted, but it's very normal in a company for the whole like

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.760
 engineering team not to agree with the direction for like a year and to still go that way because

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.800
 they're like disagreeing like what was in charge has a different view. They might still end up being

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.600
 right, but they don't actually have buy-in. So it's just like every day is friction. These are

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.000
 like the details that make me like when I think about this and remember that situation I'm in.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 And I imagine adding someone new to the team or like selling the company and joining another team.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.040
 All of that is at risk and that like scares me so much, which motivates me to like try to like

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:44.160
 make the current situation continue to work. Yeah, because it is rare. That makes sense.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.440
 Well, I hope our podcast listeners have enjoyed listening to us just pat each other on the back

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:55.520
 for like 20 minutes. It's been fun for me. I mean, I'm enjoying it. Yeah. But I know I,

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:01.920
 but to continue patting ourselves on the back, it is a good product. I think people literally open

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:08.560
 it and they're just like, what the heck like this is crazy. And I'm really just proud and excited

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.600
 to finally have stuff out there where people have their reaction to. Yeah, it was not a good feeling

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.760
 before the release. Like it was not a good feeling when we were completely dormant,

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.240
 like a week and a half ago, not dormant. Like we were in that branch and it was just very

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.760
 confusing from the outside. Yeah. But it felt a little better when we kind of like,

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:32.240
 we merged that branch into dev and it became like there are actual releases of this thing.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.440
 And then after yesterday, man, I just feel so much better. Yeah. Just feel so good to actually

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.680
 have it out there and just be using it. I'm using it on all my work right now. And it's just,

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.600
 it feels good. Like I'm actually installing it on my machine instead of just running

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.520
 the tight script file directly. Yeah, exactly. And I know I woke up today and there was like a

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:57.920
 million messages that are almost like good. Just DM some like people we know, like well-known

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:04.560
 people being like, Hey, it was awesome. Congratulations. Like it's, it's always a nice day. I'll share

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.480
 some of those guys. I haven't had time to screenshot everything, but I'll share some of those with

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:15.440
 you guys later. So yeah, this is fun. But now we have, you know, another mountain of work.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.360
 Yeah, there's always things that could be added. And it's, it's interesting that like

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:28.880
 there's kind of this assumed roadmap where you're kind of like coming into a space where there are

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:35.120
 a few existing tools. And you just imagine like, we got to have all these features to like be

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.520
 at parity with everything else. And then we can innovate on stuff. But then it's like, and we don't

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:45.760
 need all those things. And you can kind of just like let your own open source, like noise,

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.760
 yeah, the signal coming from open source kind of drive. What's most important? Like,

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.720
 there's features that are pretty big features missing from something like called like permissions.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:00.880
 Like we're just right now it's full auto and you can't, there's no front end for the permissions

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.640
 yet. So you can't like actually opt into that. And we've had, I guess we've now had some people.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.640
 But it's kind of like waiting to see like how long before something happened, because I love

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.880
 it without the permissions. As soon as we have permissions, I'm, we're going to have an auto

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.080
 accept feature, because that's what I'm turning on. I don't want it to ever change.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:23.440
 Well, I, I actually given how, and this is what's awesome about launching and releasing, like,

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.840
 yes, like you have a bunch of people to use it. But it's such a crazy source of data that just

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.320
 reorient your priorities and your perspective on things. Like if you asked me a month ago,

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:37.680
 I would have been like, yeah, the default has to be really conservative and permissions prompt

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:44.960
 for everything. And then we have this version that doesn't do that. And so many people are fine with

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:52.400
 it. And when you like run cloud code now, and I go through the initial setup, it feels horrible.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:58.640
 There was like a million danger danger, accept this. Are you okay? And it's just like, just not

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:04.160
 a good feeling. So now given like, you know, the information from people that you ask people

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.720
 care about permissions, but it's not most people. I'm way more inclined to say that default should

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:14.320
 be off and people cannot into something more strict. And if you think about it, it's like,

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.080
 yeah, people can make people say, oh, that's like an unsafe default. Like, you know, that's

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.040
 gonna lead to bad things. But that's fine. You can have tools that optimize for different things.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.160
 Power user tools. Do not hold your hand every step of the way, right? Everyone talks about how

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.800
 Windows is like your mom. And it's always like, make sure you want to do that. Is that okay?

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:40.720
 Linux, if you do RMRF, it's just doing it, you know? Yeah. So there's just different

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.920
 tools for different people. And I think we're building for ourselves. And I think we,

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.120
 yeah, like we're power users and we don't want all that stuff in the way by default.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:58.240
 Yeah. Yeah, it's very nice. But then it is like, there is still just a ton of stuff that it feels

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:03.680
 like we do need to add. And I just so badly, I want to play with new ideas and like, other ways to

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.880
 get more performance out of it. I mean, there's just, there's a constant like treadmill that all

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.960
 these different tools the teams are thinking through and trying to just feel like the models

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.520
 are good enough now that there's still a lot of improvement to be made just on the tools,

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.200
 like the tool side, not like tool calling tools. I just mean like our tool, open code,

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.920
 cloud code. In fact, there's so much room still for them to improve and to do new novel things

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:34.000
 with the models to increase the effectiveness. So it's yeah, it's this cool, unknown infinite

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.920
 roadmap where like, you don't even know, could it be two times better? I don't know, maybe that's

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.640
 a stretch, but yeah, yeah, Frank was saying something roughly above it is saying like, he's like,

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.560
 I think we could do two times better, probably not 10 X better in terms of performance, but

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:54.960
 but two X seems like reasonable. Yeah, there's so many ideas given our positioning that we can,

00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:03.920
 we can play with. I'm mostly so excited about just the core packaging of it, like we're, yeah,

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.680
 we executed well on that. We're going to continue to execute well on that. You know, it's a I don't

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:16.800
 see how anyone catches up to that because it's like a pretty unique skill set. And I didn't have

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.760
 it five years ago, like I gained it over the work I've done for the past five years. So,

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:27.760
 yeah, so many little details that are like pretty delightful for people to find out, like,

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:33.680
 and it's cool to see people recognize it and call it out. We obviously put a lot of work

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:38.240
 thinking about configuration and how to make the whole initial flow, not require any config file.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.080
 And it's a great feeling you open it and it guides you through and it's ready to go.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:48.400
 Almost no CLI. CLI tools like don't think about those things generally. And so a few people were

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.040
 like, wow, no config. That's awesome. So it's cool to see like people recognize the effort.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:59.120
 It's been so long since I've run it from scratch. If you already have like an API key and you're in,

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.200
 does it even run through that wizard at the beginning to set up providers? It's just you're in.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:09.040
 Yeah, that's awesome. It just works. So it's literally zero config if you have API keys like

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:14.160
 anthropic API key and you're in. Yeah, yeah. And these are the things. Going back to what I

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:20.640
 said earlier about Polish, like yesterday I spent a bunch of time printing out really good,

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:27.680
 not really good. I'd put more time into it, but decent power messages for when you're config,

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:32.880
 we haven't even heard you're config. And this is the type of thing where in the past I've been like,

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.560
 who cares? Like people will figure it out and they will, you know, fix the config file.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:43.200
 Like I don't need to waste time like doing this random feature. But now I've learned a few things,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:49.760
 which is for every person that runs into that and brings it up to you, there's probably 10 people

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:55.120
 that ran into it and just never figured it out and gave up. And two, when people bring it up,

00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:01.040
 it's annoying and it's a distraction. It takes away from your time. So now I'm like, the more I can

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:05.600
 help people help themselves, like I'm going to do whatever it takes. It's just going to pay back

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.800
 in the long run. And this is not where my instincts were tuned like five years ago.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:16.560
 Yeah, I'm so glad you nailed that opening sequence because it does, it just makes a huge difference

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:22.240
 for people's first impressions. Yeah. Yeah, I'm feeling good about where it's at. I mean,

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:27.600
 there's obviously there's like a million long tail things with all the different providers we

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:33.120
 support because this is the tool that you can use a bunch of bad models. I mean, models that

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:37.120
 probably won't be very good at this task. But if you're doing like, I mean, like this morning,

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:42.400
 I had I opened open code to just make some changes to some little shell scripts that I run for like,

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:48.720
 managing T mucks and stuff. And in those use cases, like you probably can use cheaper,

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.040
 simpler, faster models. And it's, it's probably fine. So there's like, there's use cases people

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.880
 wanting to use this kind of stuff like in CI pipelines, just generate, get commit messages

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:02.480
 or whatever. There's always like weird edge case usages that having a configurable model is actually

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:08.640
 a meaningful feature. Like that, that matters. And it just opens it up to be used in so many other

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.800
 contexts. I think that's why it's always good to make stuff hackable, because you will be surprised

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:18.400
 with how people use it. And they usually gives you ideas. We had someone as a PR, I'll work on

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:25.280
 this after a after the podcast, but they want to, for us to be able to detect when a model does

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:31.440
 not support tool use and not submit the tool schemas in the requests, because in the model's errors,

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.720
 which is weird. Because like, what the heck? Like, what do you mean? Like, what are you going to do

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:41.840
 with a model that doesn't have tool use like open codes useless? But they have a model if they like,

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:48.400
 and they just want to use it. They just want to talk to it. And because it's not like from a big

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.360
 cup in like open AI or cloud, there's not a great interface. We're just chatting with it. It's like

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.160
 a crappy interface. But they're just using open code as a normal client for an L M, like a normal

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:02.480
 L M interaction, because they want to do it in the terminal. So interesting. Yeah, not use

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:06.000
 case. That's what I thought about, but it makes sense. Yeah, it makes a little sense once you see

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.240
 it, but we would never thought about it ahead of time. But like making this all customizable and

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.640
 and hackable, you start to see people do that. The other thing that was kind of exciting for me to

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.200
 see is I love seeing like the boring parts of the world prop up, because that's when I feel like

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:25.200
 we've really like tapped into a wider audience versus like the very internet oriented startupy

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:31.520
 people that we typically are around. A bunch of people are like, Oh, cool. I can use this with my

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:38.240
 like corporate approved Azure credentials. It's like they have like a lockdown laptop and they

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.760
 can't use any L M besides the one their company gives them. And now finally they can play with this

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:50.320
 stuff. So it was cool seeing just all those weird, weird use cases pop up, because in my head, I'm like,

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.000
 Oh, yeah, everyone's using cloud code. Like, yeah, you can all use code. But a lot of people like

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.960
 literally can't and probably, you know, it's so early as big as all this feels. The majority of

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.040
 people have not used cloud code. Oh, yeah, it's cool to see those people start to see this for the

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:10.400
 first time. Yeah, it's early is early. It's very exciting. I need to be a little less excited. I need

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:16.800
 to sleep. I need to sleep good. What? Yeah, what else is going on? I don't know. It feels like

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:23.280
 thing. It's been pretty consuming. I've been like head down. And I've just got, yeah, a lot going on.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.440
 So what's what's going on on the internet outside of or the world? I don't know,

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:34.880
 entertain me puppet. I'm just I'm just I'm trying to I'm trying to you've been head down too. I mean,

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:40.560
 okay, so here's the thing. You know what? I can't bring this up every episode. My whole Twitter

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:50.160
 rework. I'm continually be shocked at how effective it is. Because yesterday Jay was like, Oh, man,

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.920
 these like mid journey video things are really cool. I'm like, what are you talking about mid

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:59.440
 journey video? And yeah, mid journey launched like a whole video generation thing. And like,

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.840
 a month ago, I would have seen that in like four seconds that they launched it. And I went like,

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:09.520
 oh, like a whole 24 hours without seeing a single thing about it. They I mean, launched the same

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:14.480
 day we did. Oh, really? Yeah, I hadn't heard anything. But I guess I just haven't been on Twitter

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:23.200
 probably. But because I have not done a good job with like curating Twitter feed. It's mine's

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.600
 still a disaster. Yeah, I think I'm trying to get a few other things that popped up. There was that

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:34.400
 whole I think a carpet the Oh, yeah, gave that talk. I didn't watch it. But everyone was talking

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.800
 about it. They were like software 3.0. It's always he's jacked. What? Yeah, what was the

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:44.480
 talk? No, no, no, that jacked was a that was a that was that was car Mac. That was car Mac. Yes,

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:49.840
 sorry. Okay, so what was Carpathy's talk? I didn't hear about this. I think I have to see it. I think

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:56.800
 you give a talk just on his vision for software moving forward, given AI. I think he's like trying

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:03.600
 to cat call it software 3.0 and like define the shape of what that looks like. I haven't I haven't

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:10.160
 looked into it at all. He is the one that coined vibe coding. I know. Here's so here's my question.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:15.200
 I don't I don't know a lot about Carpathy. I know he very well respected. I know he's like an AI

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:22.800
 God, the Tesla self driving. All these places he's been he's amazing at it. Is he like actually

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:27.840
 plugged in as a software developer? Like does he make things that are meaningful or is he just

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:33.360
 like a more data sciencey kind of guy? Well, here's a funny thing that happened. He posted a few

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.560
 months ago being like, you're trying to build something like build like an actual web app thing.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.280
 And he was like really overwhelmed. He was like, Oh man, like what? What do I even start with?

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.520
 Like, where do I host it? Like, what do I do? And I found it hilarious because

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:55.440
 every dev tool CEO in the reply begging. Carpathy, please, please use my think please.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:01.360
 This is the best way to do it. And I was so proud that I had zero instinct to like

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:06.400
 get in the reply. That reflects, I think, the state of the overall industry right now, which is

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:12.400
 yes, he understands stuff really well. And he's got really good perspective. And there's a lot

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:19.760
 that we can learn from, but how good can it be when he doesn't understand when he's not an expert

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.480
 in this area? Not only is he not an expert, he's a beginner, right? Understanding what day to

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:30.960
 day building something from zero to one and launching it looks like. So most of the tools

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.720
 that have come out are coming from like that part of the world. Like, yes, it's coming out from

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:41.120
 software, but it feels still like external people building tools for us, the people that actually

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:47.360
 like would use them. So yeah, I don't know how much I would put stock in his vision for it. I

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.560
 can have to listen to it to see. But it definitely feels like that part of the world talking to us

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:58.960
 again. Yeah, the whole like vibe coding term is forever just tainted for me. Like, there's no way

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:05.120
 to redeem that phrase. It means something to me and like, I feel like some people try to like,

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.600
 oh, well, it can just mean using AI assistance in your programming. And that's very different

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.000
 thing. Yeah. Anybody that says, I just have this visceral reaction to somebody saying like,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.440
 can I vibe code with it? Is it a vibe coding tool? Like, no, you cannot, that is not what it is,

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:27.920
 is a super power user tool for experienced programmers. Okay.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:34.480
 What was funny is that the only time I've ever vibe coded was with open code, because like,

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.280
 I was like, okay, let me like actually try doing this, like everyone's.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:41.520
 I'm not actually trying. I should try. Yeah, that that Tetris thing that I share with you guys,

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.280
 like, yeah, that was impressive that it just made all that, huh? You didn't even look at the code.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.080
 Just no, still, I'm literally never open the file.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:54.400
 That is vibe. Yeah. So I was like, you did the thing. This is my first time actually trying it.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:37:03.040
 And it felt my feeling around it was pleasant. It was a positive feeling, but it wasn't work.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.520
 It wasn't different. It's just a different thing. It was place. Yeah, it was like,

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:12.480
 yeah, it's entertainment playing with Legos. It's entertainment. Yeah.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.360
 That sounds fun. I, you know, I was like, I've also been trying not to like,

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:22.480
 ever since I got like, you know, for a long time, I only had my desktop. And a year ago,

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:27.680
 I got the MacBook Air and that a side effect of that was like, I just started working in bed

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.880
 before sleep before I couldn't. So I just didn't. So now I'm trying to like,

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.760
 weed myself off doing that. So I was like, okay, I have my laptop, but let me like,

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.440
 try to wind down. And I would just drive the five cutting thing.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:45.680
 It was really nice. I was waiting for Liz to finish her shower so we could hang out,

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:51.840
 sitting in bed, just like messing with it, had music on. It was a nice, relaxing, like meditative

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.600
 experience. Like nothing I did mattered. It wasn't important for it to be good.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.240
 You can turn off your brain. Yeah. Create something.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:07.040
 Yeah. So it was like purely play, joy, fun. And I think there's a lot of value in that.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.720
 It's not whatever, you know, how I'm trying to use it, but there's something there.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.960
 Yeah. Like create a SaaS business.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:18.800
 I think the thing that I would like to use it for now that I've thought about it, I mean,

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:23.120
 play sounds fun too, like relaxing and doing something fun should try that sometime.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:28.640
 But the thing I'm thinking of is like making little utility, like Mac apps, like in the

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:33.520
 tray at the top or making like browser extensions that are just for me, like just making things

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:37.360
 that I don't know how to make a browser extension. But if I could make one that made Twitter better

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:42.800
 or something, you know what I mean? Like highly customized little like applets for those kind

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:48.960
 of contexts where I'd love to just like pull up in my tray and get XYZ this little utility that

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:53.360
 could show me some information I want and just use vibe coding to like make that kind of stuff.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.920
 I feel like it could be good for that use case, but that's I have no experience. So I'm out here.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:02.800
 I think we all need to like realize we have this thing we can do now and we need to like

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:10.320
 identify it so we actually do it. Like we should fix these micro cuts that we face all day because

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:15.600
 they're not difficult to fix. Difficult to have an element and build something to fix it and they

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.800
 don't need to scale. We're not trying to build the business of it. Yeah. Yeah. I think Lee Rob had

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:27.520
 I'm like jealous because I was thinking of like a similar term, but he coined it first. He was

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.880
 like, this is the arrow of like personal software where it's like, mmm, it's software just for you.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:39.440
 I think a really nice thing like kind of detailing that. I think the part that's confusing is

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:45.360
 I think it is true. We are like in this new era where we can all have personal software.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:51.840
 I don't think 99% of the world is going to do that. I think it's still going to be like a

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.840
 small percentage of people that do. And I think a lot of those are being built around the idea that

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.520
 everyone's going to have personalized software. I don't think that's a case. I think most people

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.320
 don't really want to do that. Just like how not everyone cooks, even though we can all cook. And

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:10.560
 there's like infinite machines to make it easy. But you know, for myself, like, yeah, like I think

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.600
 I need to like use this more and like build these little things that could fix a bunch of my little

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.840
 problems. Yeah, it kind of makes me think like, and I've always enjoyed this past time of like

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.880
 tinkering with my environment. Well, I enjoy the effects of it. I don't always enjoy how long

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:30.320
 I spend on it. So I feel like if I could use these models to just take over my dot files and like

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.800
 I just described what I want, that actually sounds kind of nice because I don't I don't think it's

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.960
 the actual typing that I enjoy when it's configuring my environment. It's just getting everything just

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.800
 how I want it. Yeah, I feel like these models could just be like, I just really want to know

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.880
 what my dot files look like. I just want to literally let them run wild and I just tell it

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.360
 exactly what I want. That sounds nice. Yeah, I'll try that. Yeah, I actually did that the other day

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:56.000
 with trying out Wayland on Linux, which I've tried a bunch of times and I've always like failed

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.800
 because the whole Wayland Nvidia stuff is tricky. But open code was good enough at that point where

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:07.760
 instead the last time I tried to I did try to use AI, but it was always like, talk to Claude,

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.640
 Claude, Claude, copy paste like that whole workflow. But now I just let open code access

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:18.800
 my whole system and like fix all the issues and I actually got like a very decent working setup.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.960
 Still stuff didn't work where I had to like build back into my old one. So I still failed to switch

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:30.880
 over. But yeah, it was like, great, because I could try this out and it can like debug all

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.280
 these things. And I don't really care about its knowledge. I don't care to have like, yeah, I don't

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:40.240
 I don't really care to to know some of these things. Like I still ended up learning a bunch

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.320
 because I was like watching what I was doing. Yeah, sure. You're following along. It is really

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.080
 effective to watch these threats. Like if you just think of the sessions that you can share

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:53.360
 through open code on the web, reading through those is very informative as to like, you can see

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:58.960
 all the cases it thinks through. And like, sometimes it's just like really nice to see how it thinks

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:02.480
 and how it works through the problem. I love it. I think it's very educational.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:06.720
 I'm gonna write up this thing later. The thing I was telling you about, this was such a funny

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.240
 workflow because I'm like, this is so crazy. We're in a time where this workflow exists.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:16.240
 And it seems so stupid, but it kind of makes sense. Liz was like implementing a feature.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:20.800
 And she got to the point where usually she has to stop because it's not she mostly

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:26.080
 does a pure UI part and then like doesn't do the data wiring or the logic. And she was like,

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:26.560
 it's like me.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:31.520
 Dax. I did the front end.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:38.640
 I made it pretty. Yeah. So she was like, okay, like, I want to,

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:43.280
 this needs to actually be wired up. And I was like, oh, you know, you can just tell

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:48.640
 open code, like tell to do this and then tell to do this. Like I knew how to break it up into two

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:56.000
 into two tasks. So I as a software engineer gave her roughly the prompt and she went and talked to

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.680
 the LM and execute and had it executed. Then she used a share link sent it back to me.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:07.040
 And I was able to review and she was like, did it do it right? And the reason this is a little

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:15.120
 bit different than a just a PR is what the LM does is every time it edits a file makes a change,

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:20.080
 it like kind of describes like why it's doing that. It's like, okay, now I'm going to do this.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.920
 And then you see the diff. So I was able to quickly look at it and be like,

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:28.160
 I very quickly understood that it went down the right path. Like this is what I expected.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.560
 And reading the text and looking at the diffs.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:35.600
 It's this really nice like verification of work. Yeah, like it's better than a code review.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.240
 It's it's like it's better than a code review. Yeah. It's better than a PR because it has that

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:44.800
 those like annotations of like the thought process and everything else. So yeah, initially the share

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.960
 page, I was always like, is this that useful? But then seeing that that moment, I'm like,

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:53.840
 this is a crazy workflow because this is still having an experienced software engineer in the loop,

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.400
 but getting more done than we would have otherwise with like a very minimal amount of my time.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.600
 And the output quality is still still great.

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:06.880
 So okay, can we just that little use case just made me realize we need to do like

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:12.000
 pair programming and open code, like have an invite command. And you basically can like

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.080
 both be in the same session. And so you could just like read through it and send your own prompt.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.360
 Maybe no one would use that, but I just it just occurred to me that we could totally do that the

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:25.360
 way we have things architected. Yeah, like the share page can have like right access. We can like

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:31.280
 also also be on the share page or it could be that we're both in the term. Yeah, and we're just

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:37.520
 connected to the same session. That's another funny thing. Because I also SSHed into her machine

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:42.560
 and just opened up T bucks and like it was like effectively a screenshot over terminal and she

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.880
 was like, I got a coffee shop. Yeah, you got the same. Yeah, you got the same effect. Yeah, we can

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:52.560
 make that flow like much more native. But yeah, so I'm like, this is really, I'm like, can work,

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:59.520
 look like this where it's a product person still working with an engineer, but like the process

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:05.600
 looks pretty different than the engineer literally. I'm getting obsessed with this idea. Why is this

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:12.480
 the low sleep inviting someone into your session to like help you drive the session forward? Like

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:17.360
 junior engineer using open code, asking senior engineer to come in and help him. Yeah, I mean,

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:23.520
 that was amazing. That was the original. For me, because we had some bigger companies talk to us

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:29.680
 and say, uh, we want junior engineers to see this transcript in the PR so they can learn.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:35.360
 And the senior engineers and how they're using these tools. That was one of the big things that

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.040
 convinced me to even do the share page. So I was like, okay, I see how bigger teams like they think

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:45.920
 like this, they think about growing talent like people teaching each other. So things that aren't

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:52.960
 normally on my radar, but I totally see it. Yeah. Yeah, I want to do this now. I don't know, maybe

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.400
 no, maybe if you're a podcast listener and you use open code, because I think most of the open

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:01.920
 code users listen to the podcast, not most open code users. I know a lot of our listeners have heard

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:07.680
 about open code to the podcast. Uh, maybe you use it and you could tell me this is a terrible idea.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:13.600
 Or yes, I want it. That'd be cool. Or just go to GitHub. Just tell us. I want to be able to invite

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:20.320
 people across the internet into my session to run stuff on my machine. It sounds kind of worse.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:28.320
 That's funny. It's a prompt in AI to run anything on the machine. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Like delete

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:34.000
 everything in the system route. Yeah. I just I just had just it's just occurring to me how much

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.720
 we are placing a bet on the terminal at this point. Like, I know it's so funny,

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:43.440
 developers get comfortable in the terminal. So they'll order our coffee and use open code.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:50.640
 It's uh, and it feels like this, like, if you take a step back, it feels like the dumbest bet,

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:56.000
 because like it just feels so ancient and like, yeah. There are people that I mean, like West

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.160
 boss had a post being like, why the heck do people prefer running stuff in the terminal? I know.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:04.160
 Yeah. And I found it funny because he posted a screenshot of cursor or something being like,

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:10.400
 look at how much you can do. Like, I saw that. Why would you do that on the terminal? And I had

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:15.680
 two thoughts. One, I'm like, that UI looks insane. Like there's so much stuff. I know we got it's

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:21.280
 really overwhelming. Like it looks bad to me. There's so much, but also like you can do all that.

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:26.240
 Yeah. There was nothing in that screenshot we couldn't do. Yeah. It's just like one screen,

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:31.680
 you know? Yeah, exactly. At the end of the day. Yeah. It's uh, so it does feel stupid in a way,

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:36.160
 because it's like, feels ancient, but somehow it makes sense and it's like resonating, which is

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:42.880
 also funny. Yeah. I mean, it's like it goes back to the first mentions on this podcast of like,

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.360
 you talking about, it just needs to interact with the file system. This is pre-cloud code.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:54.080
 That's true. Like we just need, I want cursor, but I don't want to use VS code. I want to use my

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.080
 current editor. And why not just have the file system as a source of truth? I got to pull up that

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:02.080
 episode. I got to remember exactly how that conversation went. Because it's so funny. That's

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.480
 exactly how things have trended. I mean, I say trended in our bubbles on Twitter. Yeah. Like,

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:10.960
 cloud code has kind of had a moment. And I feel like people will just continue to question like,

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:16.720
 do I need to download VS code to use AI tools? It just seems heavy. Yeah.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:24.400
 The other thing I brought up yesterday was a poor Frank because we all love the terminal.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:31.520
 Frank is a kind of person whose ideal UI is a button that is like 10 words long that does a

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:37.760
 specific task. That's like, get this button pushes to production and also like, you know,

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:42.880
 just like something big, but he wants to click on it. Like, that's just how he wants to work.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.800
 He needs some personal software. He just needs that to write his own with open code.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:52.880
 Like he just forced not with just open code. SST dev multiplexer. Like he had to like deal

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:57.360
 with using that the terminal and then like, yeah, open code using the terminal. He's like,

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:05.360
 he just wants to like, click on links, you know. Oh, it's funny. Oh, we would explain to him,

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:10.960
 like, Frank, like we can't, like when a link wraps in VS code, like there's nothing we can do,

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.480
 like we can't make a click. We have to like click and drag into him. It's just like the worst feeling

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:20.640
 ever. Oh man. The perception I had of Frank outside from the outside versus like getting

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.280
 down a little bit better and seeing you guys interact totally different. Yeah. And I just feel

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:30.320
 like I would have never guessed that he's the button pusher. He's just like a mix of

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:37.040
 contradicting things. Like he just is just like the dumbest user. Like he just wants the most

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:43.840
 basic thing. But he does the most like comp like his work is just so like intensely technical at

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:49.200
 times. Like out of all three of us and like, he just does like all this crazy stuff. But

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:54.000
 it's that and then you mix in his like whole outside of work personality where

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.320
 did you see what I posted that he his 5k time is 17 minutes? Yeah, that's insane.

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:07.440
 Yeah. I had no idea. Jay who's extremely in shape works out every single day at Barry's bootcamp

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:14.720
 runs like really in shape is like 20 is his times like 20 is crazy. And Frank is three minutes faster.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:19.360
 Which is like, yeah, I've never seen Frank say something that makes me think like

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:25.120
 he's in the fitness or he's, you know what I mean? Like he's not a thing he talks about or

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:31.680
 yeah, has that like persona online. He he just one of those people that I mean so going back to

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:40.560
 the tie with everything for him is if we give him a task, he will just like go to the extreme end

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:44.640
 of that task without even questioning it. Like, you know, like, that's why this model does this

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:51.440
 models that dev we like I joke that it's a frank task because the task there was like go find

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 all the providers all the models every single piece of information and like write it into a

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:02.720
 document like he will just go and like be spoke that and like not get tired and just like mine

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:07.600
 is like do it until someone tells him stop you're doing too much. Yeah. And now you apply that to

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.920
 like him working out and like running like it's it's the same thing like he just like pushes and

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:18.560
 doesn't overcomplicate it with his brain. I love models that dev by the way, I have nothing to do

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:24.720
 with this. I can say I just love it. It's well done. It's yeah, that's it's just funny. Like,

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:29.760
 we just always end up having these like side side side projects that spin out to the side of the

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:36.640
 side. Yeah. Yeah, we were talking yesterday about how like, okay, we're like gonna focus on open

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:41.040
 code for the time being. And I was like, yeah, we're gonna only focus on open code and we're just

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:46.560
 laughing like we all we never do that. Like, we always like, we're already doing models that dev,

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:53.840
 like it's just yeah, we just always end up having stuff. The favicon on models that dev is so good,

00:51:53.840 --> 00:52:00.320
 Jay. Good work. I love the styles he put in and he put into models that dev. Yeah. I have to pee

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:07.360
 really bad. I think we should just call it. Yeah. And we'll go back to work. Back to work. All right,

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:23.760
 thanks, Dax. See ya. Yeah.
