WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 I thought there was a copy machine or something next to you that was running I just took his food away just looking at me like

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.000
 This is the dog episode for sure

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.600
 So Adam you have a wife and two kids you live in this nice house with a bunch of land

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.600
 But you don't have a dog. So I want to know are you guys dog people? Are you gonna get a dog?

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.840
 Mike I said, I feel like you wouldn't have a dog

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 But I don't know tell me I don't know I'm hesitant to tell you because it's kind of fun to watch you try and think about this

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.680
 And decide whether I'm a dog person or not. It's kind of enjoyable for me

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.560
 I don't know. Can we just live in this moment for a little bit longer where you don't know whether we like dogs or not?

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.960
 Let me explain why I think you guys won't look like the vibe you guys have

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.840
 Something about it feels like you wouldn't have a dog

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.960
 I don't know is it because you guys are vegan like you think we hate dogs?

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.200
 No, not that you hate dogs because we're vegan

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.760
 You have to eat your dog at the end

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.720
 Yes, but I can't explain it. I feel like we just don't see my dog people to you

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.280
 Do we seem like cat people you don't seem like you'd have pets

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.440
 Okay, and maybe just because I picked up your house

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.760
 They're just like very like everything's like in the right place at all times. I'm a chaos of a dog

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.520
 I just don't know if that fits. I see that that so that we're a little ocpd. We're a little

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.280
 We have a clean problem like things have to be

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.240
 Just so which you could still maintain when you have a dog. So I don't know it's just like a gut feel

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.120
 I feel like no, you can't you can't I know this because we had dogs before we had boys

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.840
 We so okay, so we had a dog mostly. I'll tell you about both of our dogs

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.000
 Marley who my parents now have is a little miniature

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.800
 What are they called? Yorkie

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.400
 Actually the coolest dog in the world. So Marley is a Yorkie Yorkies are normally like

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.040
 Just a little high energy, you know

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.800
 Just a little too much this one totally calm the most relaxed they call they named him Marley literally after bob marley

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.560
 Because he's just so mellow. I could just lays around. He's just the coolest dog

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.160
 Uh, he's now like 12 13. I don't know we had him since he was little and then when we had kids

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.560
 Uh, he was peeing on everything in sight. I think they get jealous of kids

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.080
 I don't know and he went to my parents and that's where he lives now

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.760
 Uh, but we also had a boxer for like six months

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.480
 Uh, like a young

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.800
 Full grown but baby boxer and it was he had a lot of energy

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.720
 He needed to be like run around the neighborhood all day long to just like get it all out

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.120
 And we were not good at that

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.280
 Uh, well, this was also when we had

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.840
 Our first who's not eight

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.680
 So it's been almost a decade I guess since i've had dogs, but we did have dogs

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.880
 They were our little children. We had pictures of them on our phone. It was just constantly like look at what the dog did

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.680
 Uh, so I get dog people. I understand it

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.040
 Uh, but yeah, once we had kids it was just very hard to take care of

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.160
 The dogs as well. So they found new homes. I see but i'm still a dog person. I still like

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.280
 Are you guys gonna get one? It's somebody your kids want one

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.680
 This is a this is a conversation that started creeping up now that like the littlest is three and he's

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.360
 More manageable all the time. Uh, we started saying like are we gonna get to the point where we're like life is too easy

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.520
 We should get a dog and i'm afraid it's gonna happen. I'm afraid one of the boys is gonna get attached to some neighbor dog or something and be like

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.360
 Yes, we need a dog. I don't know. It just sounds like

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.280
 Actually, I could see myself being talked into it. I couldn't see my wife case. He's probably not gonna be down with the dog

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.800
 I see yeah, I mean Liz describes in the same way

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.480
 She's like our entire life is just we hit a point of stability then we just

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.720
 Bring on some like new form of chaos. Yeah, and then we're just back to exactly the same place over and over repeat

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.440
 Why can't we just have nice things? Why can't we just enjoy life? Why do we have to do this kind of stuff?

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.280
 Okay, interesting. So maybe but you have to convince casey

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.280
 Yeah, I mean I enjoyed like the boxer was actually the sweetest dog in the world and it was so much fun to have a boxer for a while

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.120
 We we let him in the how like he lived in the house with us. It was just a giant dog

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.320
 We'd always had little dogs like growing up. I had a little poodle

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.440
 I'm a miniature poodle all all of my growing up years

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.880
 Uh, so i've always been around small dogs to have like a giant

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.600
 Well, i'm sure zuko's huge like it's just a different experience big dogs are totally. Yeah, I will say i'm obviously biased

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.800
 But here's why I like having dobermans is

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.720
 So they're big and I think with a big dog you just get a bunch of things

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.440
 You don't want small dogs like you just like connect with them more and like they feel more like people oil in a way

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.920
 Um, and they're like they're definitely like more intelligent in general so you can bond with them a lot

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.800
 but dobermans are like

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.560
 They're like kind of like related to great Danes. So and you know how they're like super lazy like great danger

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.560
 Like super lazy and they're so big and they're lazy

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.080
 Yeah, they are kind of similar in that like ever even when he was a pup and he's still a pup. He just turned one but like

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.880
 He like is really chill when he's inside for the most part despite his size

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.920
 Like he's not like knocking shit over and everything of course

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.280
 He's still a dog so they're like to some degree like he will get his little burst

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.560
 But I had a lab growing up. I had like another rescue that was like a mix like a lab plus

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.240
 An Australian shepherd mix and those dogs were like insane all day

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.480
 Uh, so compared to that dobermans like you know very very calm and

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.040
 Probably the easiest dog I've ever had so do they do they shed everywhere though?

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.880
 Are they a shedding dog? Well, so that's another thing. So I had these like super shitty dogs

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.440
 Zuko does shed but for a while we actually thought he didn't because like we weren't really seeing it

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.760
 But his hair is really short and black so when he does shed, it's not like super obvious

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.800
 And it's really not a lot. He's like not zero shedding dog

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.560
 But he's like a very low shedding dog and

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.720
 Like my other dogs would like dump like entire sweaters worth of fur on the ground and so very different

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.520
 Um, yeah, so yeah, I think all around, you know calm dog

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.680
 Easier train super smart shedding is not a big deal

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.880
 The size is the only thing that is like, you know, some people can't manage a dog with a certain size

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.440
 But like, you know, you guys would be fine. So yeah, that's my recommendation plus you need security on that property

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.080
 I know the security element. Yeah, it's that that that aspect of it is very attractive

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.960
 And the honor of zuko zuko like I've never really had opinions about dobermans

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.200
 But seeing all the pictures in the video of zuko

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.320
 Uh does make them seem pretty cool. I've considered it. But yeah, you gotta talk it

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.440
 We'll see. Okay. I think I've just gone from like, no, we'll never have a dog. They're like, no, I just gotta talk

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:08.720
 Just in the space of his wife everyone's wives end up not liking me because I just create problems for them

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.920
 Could see that I could see that

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.320
 Speaking of dogs. Uh, did you catch the congressional hearing with uh, sam altman

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.720
 It was not like a slight pictures and like the memes and I saw like one or two lines

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.800
 But I will like for a reason. I just was like

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.440
 I don't want to see this, but yeah, I'm interested to hear about it. Like what did you take away?

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.720
 The main thing I took away or the thing I heard I did not watch it and I have not really

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:43.360
 Consumed much about it. But I did hear the line. He said about not having equity. He doesn't have equity in open AI. What's that about?

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.680
 Well, I know he's not just like altruistic. There's something we're missing

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.640
 No, I mean, I'm sure he has like a bunch of indirect stuff where like he invested in a

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.200
 Fund that invested in open AI. I just wouldn't be surprised if it was a setup like that

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:03.200
 Um, well, does it don't are do they have some plan for some cryptocurrency or something? That's a different company. That's the world clan thing

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.920
 Oh, okay. Not related to open. Yeah, so on one hand, I'm sure he has some connection

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.680
 But on the other hand, I can also kind of believe it because like he has more money than

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.960
 You ever can spend probably so

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.440
 That's true. I don't know. Why not? Um, but something

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:30.640
 I mean, the whole company's structure is so weird, right? Because there was supposed to be a good effect to be a chair. Yeah, and they transitioned to something else

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:37.120
 So it's because in a typical company you absolutely want the CEO to have equity because like

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.000
 That you need them and bought in and invested like it's like weird that they wouldn't have any

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.920
 Yeah, but given the history of this company. I'm like maybe that's why it ended up weird

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.080
 I'm sure there's some like he like how it benefits in something directly. I don't know. So you do you

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.680
 Just like do you like Sam Altman or you have problems with him? What are your opinions on Sam Altman?

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.280
 Uh, I don't I don't think I have much of an opinion because I don't think he is a very strong personality

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.760
 Not as on a criticism. I just feel like yeah, that's true

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.360
 There's there's like not enough there to either like or hate. It's not like paul graham

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.840
 Like paul graham has strong personality

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:15.600
 I think I just dislike anyone associated with white commonator. Why do I dislike everything about white commonator?

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.840
 Oh, you're associated with white commonator. I think I just dislike you and everything you're associated with

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.440
 It sounds like someone got rejected and has been salty forever. Listen. I did. Okay. Here's the thing

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.000
 I have applied to white commonator twice

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.440
 And neither time did I want to apply to white commonator. It was in both situations

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.040
 The person I was involved with really wanted to be in

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.000
 Accepted into white commonator and I have always had the similar the same stance

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.440
 That it's like the epitome of silicon valley to me and I hate it

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.640
 I hate hacker news. I hate white commonator. I hate everything. That's like you should hire people in the bay because they're better

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.000
 I don't know. That's just an Ozarks chip on my shoulder. Like I just don't like

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.480
 I don't know people in the big tech hubs. Basically. Yeah, I mean I get that too

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.960
 I've always kind of felt that way about San Francisco

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.640
 I like wanted to always do stuff outside of it

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.600
 But definitely get that. I think the the yc thing is I go back and forth because I

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.920
 Have applied several times and I've been mix of accepted and rejected

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:23.040
 Um and the times where they've rejected I've always felt like oh, this is 100% a lottery. Of course. I'm gonna feel that way

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:32.480
 Uh, yeah, but I don't know it to me. It is a lottery like anything at that scale just becomes a lottery like there's so many applicants

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.480
 Yeah, when there's yeah, so

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.440
 Like sst went through yc and that was before like they were in yc like right when I joined or they're the tail and the yc

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:45.600
 We're gonna join so I wasn't like part of it really. Yeah, I like franking j because they like it's almost a technicality

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.600
 That they went through it. It was not like

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.480
 Like people will never know that we're like a yc company. They're always surprised. I didn't know

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.840
 I mean, I think I was surprised whenever I did find out. Yeah, so they're both

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.360
 They were both like already very experienced and like building companies and they did appreciate the yc experience because like

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.520
 I can tell it's almost what they talk about they've learned there and it's all like like good stuff

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.840
 And I just removed like a whole class of problems in terms of when we want to raise like, you know, the initial steps

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:18.960
 Like it just like removes like getting those meetings and stuff. But yeah, they definitely get give off the vibe. We're like

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.600
 Yeah, it helped but like it kind of would have been if they never went to yc

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:28.640
 Like it just it kind of wouldn't have mattered in the history of the company. Yeah, I don't for what it's worth

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.080
 I don't just like people who participate like companies that get into yc

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.000
 It's more the leadership and the people at the top that bothered me interesting. Yeah

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.240
 Well, I think I was way wasn't end that was there are other companies that go through it where it just feels very much like

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:48.640
 They could only have ever existed if they went through yc and all their customers or other yc companies that are also vc funded

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.120
 And it's just like moving the same money around in circles

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:57.120
 There's definitely a lot of that in that world and I think all that law that's coming to an end because it just is not possible anymore

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:03.120
 But do I get it? What do you mean? It's not possible is is the is the venture capital thing? Is it actually drying up?

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.120
 It is. Yeah, it's like it's

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:11.920
 Especially mean by drying up, but well, it's just been like it's been a decade of like historic levels of capital injected into startups

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.680
 And I've felt like with the changing monetary policy and all the stuff that's happening macroeconomic whatever

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.960
 Uh, I felt like there's the venture capital market should be

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:29.120
 Tightening. Yeah, the first there was just like a big lag. It seemed like between the real changes and then what's maybe happening now

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.760
 No, it is tightening. It's continuing to tighten and I think it's reverting back to

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.200
 Okay, I just referred to the last five years like the weird years and if I look before then

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.800
 I'm like, oh, yeah, I'd like remember what it was like before then it was different and it feels like it's reverting back to that now where

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.640
 Yeah, when you're raising a series a like you need a business model

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.200
 And you need to have proved out that you can earn money and you need to be earning money

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.280
 Like those are all things that people ask about now and I was like, oh, yeah, that's how it used to be like

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:02.880
 People wanted to know if your business could be a business like yeah, it is like quote-unquote drying up

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.400
 But it's to I think technically it's just returning to a sane place

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.560
 Yes, relative to where we were it feels like oh, it's like, you know tightening

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.680
 but

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.840
 I think it was going back to normal place, but it is a lot harder for people to raise series A and A's now

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.680
 Especially companies that were set up to like not have to think about

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.320
 Making money to like a B or C

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:27.120
 Now they have to think about that for their A and they're not set up that well and their team is too big and

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.840
 Yeah, it's gonna be tough like

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.480
 I know of people's companies that are trying to raise like

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:38.160
 You know like a 20 million dollar round and they have like five figures of revenue per year and just like

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:43.680
 Oh, it's just not gonna be possible at all. Yeah, we tried to raise a 20 million dollar B

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.400
 When we had no revenue we didn't even have like a plan for how to to raise

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.480
 Or how to actually make money like it was it was laughable actually

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.160
 Did you guys have a lot of traffic at least at back then? No, I mean when we tried to raise our B

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.720
 This is like five years ago six years ago

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:06.800
 Uh, we had it was just our A was so easy to raise it like kind of let itself three months after we closed our seed

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.240
 Uh, it just kind of like we had multiple options come to us the A was so easy that it was just like oh

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.320
 We used up those two that 10 million dollars or we have plans to use it up pretty quickly

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.600
 So let's go out and raise 20. Let's just let's get back on the trail

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.000
 And then we were met with a rude awakening but they don't just hand you 20 million dollars

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.160
 In hindsight, do you think you could have made that 10 million dollars last

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.880
 To the point where you never had to raise again?

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.080
 Uh

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.360
 I don't know about never raise again, but we could have made it last a lot longer

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.400
 We definitely went out after we raised our A and just like played startup like hired 10 people immediately

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:46.800
 And we had no reason to hire 10 people like we didn't actually have it wasn't driven by good organic reasons

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.800
 It was just like we have capital

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.960
 We should use it and that's I mean to be honest

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.880
 That's like what the investors are telling you and the investors make up your board at that stage

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.680
 And it's like yeah deploy the capital hire people. I don't know market it do something

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.360
 Uh the whole like poking with stick thing just like do stuff

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:09.440
 Yeah, but we could have made it last a lot longer. Surely. I mean if we would have hired like two or three people and just stayed pretty small

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.320
 Yeah, so we're going to be raising an a round in the next probably start in the next six months or so

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:19.600
 And yeah, it is going to be tougher than it would have been before

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.640
 We're in an okay position though because we have just three people and we're making money

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.280
 And we're gonna like the next six months are all gonna be you guys have the dream

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.480
 Yeah, I think we we know we're like set up really well. So at this point

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.720
 Again, who knows what's gonna actually happen, but I think the range of possibilities are

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.760
 Oh, the next six months we can either like really grow our revenue because that's where we focus on and then they will grow

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.720
 It's a point where we have we technically don't need to raise

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.520
 And if we raise in a situation like that

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.920
 Then we're not gonna have to like give up

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.080
 If we do give a board seat, it's gonna be like very selective to someone that like we can really decide

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.600
 Yep, uh if we're in a situation where we have to raise, I think we're still gonna be okay and being able to do it

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:03.200
 But it might be that we have to like, you know, give a board seat to someone that we don't necessarily want so

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.560
 That's like the range of possibilities right now. I think yeah, it's just that's how life works

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.200
 It's that worry. It's that way for everything not just fundraising right like you want to be in a position of strength

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.400
 Whether it's looking for a new job or whatever

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.760
 They'll have better options on the table if you don't need it

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.080
 Yeah, so much is about timing like if you can wait like one or two months like your dream outcome

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.160
 Might be sitting there versus they having to like take whatever's on a table right away

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.520
 Yeah, it's crazy. I would all like comes down to that a lot of times

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.000
 You did you have something you gained from the the congressional hearing that we talked about like 10 minutes ago?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.240
 I think there's there's like a few principles that I just

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.280
 not many but there's a couple principles that I just like

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.080
 fundamentally believe in

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.880
 And I think I saw one of those kind of come out in this because sam altman was saying that

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.600
 you need to have

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.320
 He's going to the government and he knows when you're a company like that

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.040
 That big at the forefront of something

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.240
 uh, you have pretty much only one strategy which is

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.120
 The government is going to come and try to regulate what i'm doing

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.760
 so

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.000
 I can't really resist that like it's going to happen

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.720
 So you flip and you like welcome the regulation

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.840
 You're like I want regulation and you see it's like a lot of times with big companies

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.320
 And you can at least shape it to hurt your competitors that haven't even

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.240
 They don't even exist yet, right?

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:26.240
 Like if now that they're up and running if there's like a bunch of regulation like they're fine

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.880
 They've already raised money. They can do it all a new startup

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.440
 Is not going to be able to like get past that regulation and this happens in every industry

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.080
 Like facebook was doing the same thing when they were asking for regulation

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.440
 I really hate that i'm like extremely opposed to

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.280
 So knowing yeah, i'm really really opposed to that especially when it's a new industry

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.360
 We don't really know how anything is going to work

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.960
 Yeah, pretty much a regulation just means that oh, you just solidified the incumbent

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.880
 Yeah, you just picked the winner right there

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.760
 So

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:57.440
 Yeah, I didn't like that and I was like i'm like very skeptical of of any any like big company asking for that

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.080
 How how would they even now we're two people that didn't watch or listen to the hearing?

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.720
 So what do we know but that how would they even regulate AI like especially in these stages?

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.920
 What would that look like?

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.920
 Can you think of anything that would be actually good?

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.880
 I have no idea because one I don't really

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.320
 I don't even know what they would do. It's just so like

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.440
 Made up at this point that the problem is made up and the solutions are going to be made up as well

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.600
 um, so I have no idea and it's like it's just like technology so

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.400
 Anyone can open source something and someone you can't stop someone from running it on their own

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.040
 Like I don't I don't I feel like we're like really ahead of herself

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.120
 I felt that way with this from the beginning like we're getting like really ahead of ourselves

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.120
 We're talking about like

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:45.600
 Having to like drop bombs on other countries data centers because of this AI threat and i'm just like oh jeez

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.240
 I don't like it's all really cool. I actually I saw something today that was amazing

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:57.040
 So erin i've got his name erin buddaman. I phrase a CEO of this company called uh replicash, which i've talked about a lot

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.120
 I use it he wrote he really wrote hate to be another person writing a threat about AI

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.840
 But here my thoughts i had a really good point which is

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:09.040
 The feeling that we're all feeling right now is we saw a bunch of things that seemed impossible

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.680
 Go from being impossible to possible

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.000
 And the natural effect that we're that's that comes from that is

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.440
 Now we think that anything that's impossible is now possible

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.880
 So I think we're in that phase where like we just saw a bunch of creative stuff happen

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.320
 So now it's like

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.960
 Oh, we think this is going to lead to like everything, you know

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.080
 But there actually is no direct tie with the stuff that was accomplished is amazing and it's going to change the world a lot

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.920
 But this doesn't mean like

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.920
 We have we're like

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.800
 We're gonna have like squeaking his toy now

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.640
 It's a dog episode. It's fine. Good. It doesn't mean we're gonna have like, you know

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.640
 This is this is this might not even be the path to like sent to an AI or anything

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.440
 But we're like all operating as we know for sure it is

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.440
 Yeah, I know the the whole like microsoft research paper where they said sparks of AGI

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:59.200
 That didn't help because I've heard the the truthers now like that's the thing they're clinging to like it's already AGI

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.720
 We're already there. Yeah, and I don't know if it does anyone even know

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.680
 Yeah, what that would look like at the same time

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.480
 There's two things in my head. It's like we do need

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.200
 to like protect ourselves from

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:17.760
 I don't know AI doing things that it shouldn't do I guess but like is the government ever going to be capable of doing that

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.400
 I just don't I don't know how those two things

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.040
 Reconcile. Yeah, that's the other side of it

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.280
 Like I'm also I think it's like very few things that the government can solve

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.440
 I think government can like nudge things with incentives

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.720
 But I don't think they can like actively solve a problem directly because

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.600
 Those losers just just need to emerge from the people that are

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:41.600
 Yeah more entrenched in it. Um, yeah, like really like do you think like I don't even get what the point of these hearings

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:47.440
 Are like it's clearly like just like a show for show thing right like probably the politicians don't learn anything really

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.200
 They couldn't know right

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.760
 You know have their assistant tell them and like are they

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.160
 Actually gonna come with any any solution. I don't know. It's all like a weird

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:02.320
 Show thing. It's like yeah, but that's kind of what the government is. I guess. Yeah, it's all entertainment at this point

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.400
 Everything is turned into entertainment. Yeah

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.280
 I sound like old man

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:13.920
 I think I have a slightly less cynical view of it. I think the government is there and everything they do

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.000
 They do to make us feel like we're somewhat represented

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.680
 So we don't freak out and just start killing everyone and try to become the next dictator

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:26.560
 And as long as they're doing that like if they can just guarantee that we're not flipping that switch

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.000
 Yeah, like just if you can maintain that long enough. I think you just become a good

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Society because most societies are just like they do well for a while then like

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.480
 Some rebellion happens a new dictator that kind of reset and it could over over and over. Yeah

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:46.000
 What do you think the us is capable on that front capable of like do you think our society could ever crumble and go into just

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.840
 Complete chaos like the I don't know people talked about

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.320
 all the tensions

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.040
 You know with trump and with like his following

00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:01.200
 Do you think there's ever a world where there's actual like civil war in the us and governments are being overthrown?

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.880
 Or is that just like so out of the realm of possibility that it's never going to happen

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:10.160
 I don't know but like the system the job of the system is a mate to make sure that everyone feels

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.760
 Represented enough that they're not going to do that

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.280
 Like I think people think oh, yeah, democracy should figure out like

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:23.040
 They're they're optimized to figure out problem solutions. I don't think that I think there's optimized to like chill

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.800
 Everyone out for a long amount of time so that everything else can work around it

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.880
 Um, so from that point of view, I think yeah, there's just some works really well

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.760
 Uh, that said like it's all like we talked about the other day. I think it's all scale dependent

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.800
 You know at our scale of country that probably is the best system we can hope for

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:47.360
 That said there's like these mini dictatorships that exist like pseudo dictatorships that exist that are like kind of nice

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.520
 like singapore for example like

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.720
 That effectively is like like a fascist state in a way, but it's small and it's like well run

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.720
 So they get like it's it's like nice. It's like a kind of a paradise in a lot of ways

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.920
 And like everything works well and the infrastructure is great and and all this stuff is good

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.560
 But you couldn't just scale that to a country the United States size and have it all work

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.200
 Yeah, okay, that makes sense

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.840
 It will always kind of be jealous of other places like that are like specifically better

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.560
 But you know at our size like this is the best we can do

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.320
 Okay, this is this we started with dogs

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.200
 then we got into

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:29.840
 Geopolitics AI. I don't know where this episode lands, but I think it was better than the last one though

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.320
 I remember when we were in track when I was in track

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.840
 We when I was in the track team

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.560
 We would have like our normal workouts and then once every month or once every two weeks

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.600
 We do like a really insane workout that none of us were really suited for

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.920
 Um, so it would suck and we would just do terrible at it, but it was like it was good

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.240
 To like it pushes you a little bit. Yeah, but like it feels bad in a moment because you just suck

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.240
 I think that's what we just went through. I guess we didn't say ever on the podcast

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.800
 That we just recorded for this week because we're gonna be gone next week

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.720
 Well, I'm gonna be gone next week on vacation

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.920
 And our editor is also gonna be gone on vacation

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:10.320
 So i'm gonna be getting a ton of work done because of this and Dax is just gonna get stuff done because there's no distractions

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.880
 No podcasts. Okay. Bye. See ya

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.800
 You
