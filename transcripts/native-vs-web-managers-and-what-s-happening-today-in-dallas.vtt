WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
 Okay, do I sound normal it's giving I was very traumatized after the last situation bet

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.600
 I also really like that your background looks so much like mine now it looks like we really I know are coordinated

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.520
 I almost want to I think I want to move my camera further back. So like yeah, or I need the same sizes

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.800
 Yeah, I don't think I can actually move mine forward very easily. So if you could move yours back

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.060
 That'd be great. How much I can move it back, but oh, I'll try yeah for I head to the same size

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.800
 That would be perfect

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.560
 I think your framing is maybe better because sometimes like depending on where I'm like if I go like that

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.780
 See how my head the head the gets cut off. Yeah chair. So I think you're just more right

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.680
 Hope all the audio only people and really enjoyed that segment

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:12.940
 The randomness of when I click the record button and we're in the middle of talking about our AV setup every time

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.200
 Yeah, it's on this podcast a couple things well, it might be a little short

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.800
 I may have a cut off before we get to an hour, but - we got to talk a little bit logistics for next week

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.960
 we are going to Dallas and

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.960
 We're gonna double dip and use this podcast time as time to talk through a couple things

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.320
 So we did we figured some stuff out yesterday. Well, I have a little story about that. So you saw me yesterday message being like

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.480
 Can I do a call with someone and I'm like a confusing a few things. Mm-hmm

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.440
 so prime calls me a video call and he is

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.360
 Dending outside and it looks kind of sweaty and it's it's kind of choppy like the like the video quality initially

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.240
 So I couldn't fully understand what he was saying, but I was like, oh, we're doing outside. He goes. I'm digging a hole

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.200
 I'm like

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.240
 But he wasn't like I'm digging a hole and here's why he says that I'm digging a whole period. Yeah about to ask

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.760
 Why are you digging a hole?

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.400
 And this is a part I really cut up. So I like did I understand what he was saying for a bit?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.280
 And I like it was a big awkward pause, but I think what he said was

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.160
 My dog hasn't been running around her eating for a month, but I think it's time

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:41.440
 Gonna put the dog down and he already done a whole for it. He was digging a hole and he was like, okay

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.800
 Now's the perfect time to call Dax and talk about this

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.200
 Between digging the hole and putting his dog down and putting the dog in the hole. I thought yeah good opportunity

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.360
 It's like it's so hard to get ahold of him in general. Yeah, and that's like the moment he chooses to be like oh, yeah

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:09.200
 I love prime messages like on slack. It's the best like every one of their the voice dictated and it's like he has no idea

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.200
 What's going on next week? And I just love it. It's the best my favorite form of this is when

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.620
 Literally at the last second. He'll ask a question being like

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:30.400
 He's like like vaguely worried that nothing has been figured out. Yeah, but it's like way too late this point

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.320
 Yeah, he's like did we book hotels and it's like we're like tomorrow

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.400
 Well, you said tomorrow like

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.280
 You're flying tomorrow to Dallas

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.320
 No, no, I'm going to Maine for Alan's wedding

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.040
 Right, and you're flying from me

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.680
 Yeah, yeah, no, I just freaked me out for a second that I had the dates wrong or something

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.160
 That's the first thing I want to talk about is I'm flying in Sunday. I think everyone is flying in Sunday

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.840
 Yeah, I get there at 5 40 something prime also gets there 5 something okay, so

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.200
 We're gonna have dinner tomorrow night and then Monday is the basketball game. That's all it's Monday

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.400
 Okay, so here's a schedule from Monday. Well, this podcast doesn't go out after right on Monday

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.180
 I mean it'll go out Monday morning. What do you mean? I guess it's fine if we spoil a little bit

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.200
 It's fine

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.120
 Schedule is

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.520
 We need to be at the basketball venue around one because the thing starts at

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.760
 Two ish so we go there like set up figures figure things out

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.760
 So if we leave around one we'll get there at the right time. So that only leaves like from the morning

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.200
 Like round eight eight nine ish to to one for us to do other stuff. Mm-hmm. So I

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.200
 Think the plan right now is on Sunday. We'll get dinner and we'll talk through some

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:56.120
 Additional ideas we can do for the basketball stream. Yep. So TJ is gonna build just the thing that David

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.000
 Designed the overlay. Oh David is on an overlay. Yeah. He just posted it today. Oh

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:10.220
 Yeah, so bare minimum TJ is gonna build that in Laravel with five wire in all that stuff. Okay

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.960
 So at minimum we'll at least arrive there already having that so as I will have nothing and then we'll brainstorm some other ideas

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.280
 We can do on top of that to see if we can get some interactivity

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.080
 Okay in the overlay going and they'll they'll have like a couple hours in the morning to build that maybe we'll work on

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.880
 Some of it Sunday night me and you are not gonna be part of that stream in the morning

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.740
 Right because we need to go pick up something. Okay. I'm not gonna fully spoil it. We need to go pick up something. Uh-huh. Okay. I

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.880
 Really it's better to like half spoil it because then now people are gonna really really want to know

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.640
 Yeah, I know what we picked up. Yeah, you got to go pick that up

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.520
 We need to bring it back. I don't know if we'll have time to do to film with a thing

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.840
 We're picking up because that's the purpose of this thing

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.480
 We're gonna film with it in the morning because we might need to go to basketball game before we have time to do that

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.120
 Yeah, but the game ends at five and

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.920
 We have daylight until 8 p.m. So if we leave like exactly at five

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.040
 We'll have three hours to do a bunch of stuff and I think that's enough for

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.720
 Yeah, a few things that we want to do

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.560
 And then we'll go return it

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.720
 The thing the thing if you can't guess what it is when I say whether pick it up and return it like

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.200
 Okay

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.760
 And then and then Tuesday

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.120
 Yeah, and then we're pretty much done now for that like Tuesday. Wednesday is just uh hanging out

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.400
 So that's what I was gonna say is like Tuesday when is the conference when is lara calm?

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.800
 It's on it's Tuesday morning Tuesday morning. It's just Tuesday and Wednesday. Oh and Wednesday

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.560
 And then everyone's flying out Thursday. Yeah, I'm flying out Thursday morning

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.200
 Okay, I miss I hate missing out on hangout time

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.840
 But I'm probably gonna fly back Tuesday because I mean, I think I think realistically I'm gonna be working

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.120
 Tuesday Tuesday during the conference and I'll hang out in the evening

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.760
 Yeah, like what I mean, there's a serving coffee

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.520
 Is there any other responsibility that terminal has at the conference? Just

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.320
 Hanging out. Yeah, I think just because of the serving coffee bar is handled by the catering company

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.840
 So we just need to drop off. Oh, right. Yeah, drop off all the coffee. We should be there of course, but

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.640
 Yeah, there's not like active work

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.600
 Like there was a lot of time. Cool. Well, I was stressing out because it's like

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:35.840
 What what sat me use the NFL season is like our super bowl. Just when it starts. It's like a big deal

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.200
 We got all these releases going out with that and that's just

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.320
 Not this week, but next week. I mean, it's or not the week. We're there, but the next week

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.040
 uh first week of september

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.840
 And I was all stressed just like i'm gonna miss all of next week

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:56.160
 And I have stuff to get done and then I realized like I don't probably have to be there the whole time

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.200
 Yeah, it's a basketball games monday. That's the main thing I knew

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.480
 I've been playing some basketball and then getting back in basketball shape. Not really. I'm in terrible shape

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.520
 The basketball's different like running up and out of court

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:16.160
 Yeah, my word. The heart is pounding. It's my shoulder hurts from shooting really feeling like we should switch it to half court

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.600
 Yeah, maybe

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.040
 Or before because

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:25.120
 That my excuse is gonna be that it's gonna be way easier for where we're filming because it's kind of ridiculous to ask the person

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:31.200
 To run around and chase this. Yeah, so I also want to talk about the streaming setup because this is a big stressor at mine

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.200
 I've seen messages floating around so west and scott are gonna like commentate which is fantastic

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:44.880
 Yeah, are we gonna be doing the streaming from our laptop in the arena and we're gonna use something we have a hard line

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.960
 Yeah, so we're gonna use something like ping to get their camera feeds. Is that the idea?

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.160
 Yeah, okay, so I need do I need to be doing all that because I feel like

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.320
 They were wanting to do a test. No, you don't you have to worry about that. I know only thing that from you is the camera

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.560
 Yeah, I'm gonna bring the camera in a gimbal and we can use that for recording for the stream

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.640
 For anything we need a camera for right and all like the wireless stuff

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:13.120
 Yeah, and so big in bot can just carry it around it can be connected to our laptop and send the OBS stream

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.080
 Yeah, man. There's so much if we had a ton of time. There's so much cool stuff

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.160
 We could do with the OBS and like the scoreboard like we could there's just so much

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.480
 We are we are gonna make the scoreboard like we are nice. That's what tj's

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.160
 How's it how's it gonna be? It looks it looks like it literally looks like an NBA overlay. It's awesome

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.880
 I gotta see this. Uh, I'm pulling up slack right now

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.800
 How

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.440
 Oh, look at this. How are we gonna get the score?

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.920
 Whoever whoever's been in the laptop. We have one of uh tj's friends is coming

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.960
 He's gonna be working the OBS set up and you can just control the

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.160
 Oh, nice. Okay. Cool. This is awesome. These overlays look amazing

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.520
 If we had like a week of just all of us focusing on

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.920
 On this we could have done something even even cooler. Oh, yeah, I hope I'm sure we can figure out some small things on sunday and monday

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.720
 But yeah with the ads going on the bottom like I know it's so good

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.480
 David's just incredible that reminds me too. I gotta make this page for the website. Can I do it?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.880
 Can I do it probably? I mean, it's basically just like other pages we have so I can just

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.760
 Change the text. It's fine

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.480
 It's fine. Okay. Well, is that all the logistics for next week that we need to talk about?

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.640
 I I think so. So I'm mainly I think the biggest variable is

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:32.240
 Are we gonna be able to get good footage of the thing we're picking up? Yeah, the thing

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.560
 Yeah, we're gonna be able to get the wheels and that there's some basics that we can do

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.120
 and uh

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.840
 Just fun teasing this stuff out

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:49.120
 I wonder if anyone who listens to our podcast actually cares about any of this like I wonder how many of our podcast listeners like

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.960
 Know about terminal and well, they know about terminal because we talk about it incessantly

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.600
 But like actually have bought the coffee actually follow us on twitter. I have no idea

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.680
 I mean, I kind of know who listens, but like there's a big chunk of them. I don't know

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.520
 Yeah, it's it's really wild. I've had I keep having this experience this week where and this has been happening the whole time

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.120
 I've been working at SST, but especially the past two weeks because we had these releases going

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.920
 People talk to me about really obscure specific things and i'm like

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.280
 Whoa, you like went and really looked at it to go find that right so I

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.040
 Uh, so we open source of terminal codebase

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.000
 But I I opened the source that technically like days before I announced it and people found it

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.040
 I was already getting questions in the sst discord about like about stuff in there and I was like

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.360
 Wow, it's crazy that you were just

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.040
 What was like the trigger that made you go find it where you're just like casually checking

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.280
 I haven't actually you made a video too, right? I gotta pull this up. I haven't watched the video yet

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:51.680
 Yeah, I don't think it's gonna be that interesting for you. It's just like a 45 minute overlay of like every older

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.880
 45 minutes. Yeah, it was serious video

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.560
 Serious. Oh, how we saw coffee from the journal found it. Yeah, but the other I mean the video also, right?

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.560
 So it's just like a 45 minute

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.960
 It's not like one of our usual fun videos is like a yeah, it's more of a serious video

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:14.560
 Uh, but I posted it and like an hour later people were asking me like very specific questions from very specific parts of the video

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.720
 And it's just wild that people do yeah, it puts up out there people do like

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.360
 Engage with it. It's even craziest. You just a handful of people do that. Yeah, there's instead

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.160
 Did I see a read me update and a poll request? That's nice

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.520
 That was thanks. Thanks. Oh, we also know we also know we also had a typo fix from someone of course

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.240
 Yeah, yeah

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.840
 If you're listening and you write code what you probably do if you're listening to this

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.480
 Uh, hit up the terminal repo make some changes fix stuff for us. That'd be cool

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.440
 Open source is great. I also was getting

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:49.680
 So many messages people people being like you left the credentials in there and every time they would say that would panic because we have

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:55.360
 Some credentials that are like not changeable like we have because we do this as a sage thing like we have

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:01.920
 Yeah permanent credentials that cannot be rotated. Yeah, what what were they seeing like what I saw your message

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.200
 So I would freak out and we'll go check at what they were actually talking about and it was never a real credential

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.520
 It's just that the read me had information about rw s s o setup

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.440
 Oh, yeah

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.760
 Which I totally get because anytime you see the account ideas everyone's like oh, yeah

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.400
 People feel like that's scary, but it was a kind of these are not private

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.440
 For anyone that's interested in this very obscure fact

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.640
 They're not private. You don't need to redact them when you send them to people

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.400
 You cannot do anything malicious with an account ID. It happens a lot when I stream where I just let them be on screen

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.360
 I don't care and people are like just saw your you just leaked your account ID like don't care

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.840
 Doesn't matter

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.600
 It's kind of a fun trivia fact. It doesn't matter. Yeah, so let's bring it on with you

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.400
 Let's uh let's actually talk and not just plan. I mean, I've been so busy. So same

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.760
 Yeah, you've been you've like disappeared like I've been

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:58.720
 Really anywhere. Well, yeah, I dropped off twitter for sure. That's the first thing to go whenever I uh get really busy

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.720
 I think in general, I think I literally

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:07.120
 I just I just haven't heard from you. Um, that's what David just said. David sent me a DM and said hey

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.120
 You've been really quiet. You okay?

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.880
 Yeah, what was it? I've been really quiet like I'm realizing now that

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.760
 if I get

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.760
 10 or 20 percent busier

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.320
 That doesn't seem like that much of a difference to me

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.120
 But I see how my behavior totally changes from someone externally. So I think it just seems more dramatic to us

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:32.640
 Yeah, I was very chatty probably in the terminal discord before and I've not been as chatty or chatty at all

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.440
 I'm mostly just a moat. I just eem. What's the word?

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:41.360
 Emode those yeah, I do those I laugh at any things I see yeah

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:49.520
 Yeah, but uh, I've also been pretty busy because we finally got a cv3 out and it was just like

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.240
 Yeah, it's all that it was two weeks after we planned on releasing it, of course

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.920
 So do you do imports imports work now or they already did?

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:01.120
 Uh, yeah, we have we haven't been there for a little bit everything I need for stat news. I guess is there

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.640
 Yeah, we even have a migration guide. I like I said, it's all there

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.440
 but you might still run into some blockers that we

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.080
 Just haven't foreseen but like the stuff that applies to everyone

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:18.720
 Is there? Mm-hmm. I guess that migration is still is so pretty tricky. But uh, okay. Here's another thing. So

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.600
 Yeah, we've been working on ion for six months and yet it's been out and people have been using it

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.560
 but in my head, it's always like

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.640
 Software is slow like you

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.120
 People need to like

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.400
 Spend years before they actually start to use something. Yeah, I get I've had a few experiences a week

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:42.080
 Someone had an issue so I said, hey, can you send me your all of your st config like all the all the code?

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.240
 Yeah, all the all your files for sst

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.360
 They send me a zip. I open it 62 files

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:54.400
 I'm just like what how did people build this big like app already like their infra files

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.240
 Just just resources files not their application code at all. Wow

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.720
 62 yep, and we have someone with

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.040
 Thousands of resources and there's like they're hitting like a performance issue. Wow

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.400
 I mean, I thought I had a pretty big project. I thought we used a lot of stuff, but not like that

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.920
 Nothing like that actually it's it's really crazy and because I'm always like how people are really conservative

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.880
 with new stuff and like it hasn't been super stable and everything, but it's somehow

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:29.680
 People power through that to like get to this size. So yeah, I just keep having these experiences week where I'm like

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.920
 This is like way

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.240
 Just way outside of my expectations of what I what I thought people were doing which is it was really good

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.880
 Like it's great seeing that um, so we've just been

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.000
 just really

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.480
 On top of everything like github issue all the messages and in our discord

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.440
 So just been reacting to that. It's kind of nice though because it shifts from

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:58.800
 Like a lot of undefined abstract work and thinking to like a bulleted list of yeah fix this fix this fix this

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.440
 It's done wake up next day fix this fix this fix this fix this and you're looking back every two weeks and now it's suddenly

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:09.040
 Really polished. So yeah, it's a good nice face to be in. I love it. Uh, I love it as a user of

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.080
 sstv3 that

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:17.760
 Uh everyone's using it making it better now. Yeah, I mean like helping you guys make it better because there was something like when it very first

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:23.840
 Versions there were definitely some rough edges. Uh, I'm just realizing on this podcast. We've gone from sst1

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.200
 To two and now to three

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:33.680
 Wow, and that begs the question. What is what's what's the plan for sstv4 when are we writing again?

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.880
 Let's go

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:41.840
 It's funny because jay sent this screenshot of all our blog posts for the previous versions and they're almost exactly a year apart

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:47.520
 And every single time we released it. We're just like I can't think of anything

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:55.680
 They're like a giant release, but I will say this time around even though I said this before

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.240
 We are like out of fundamental ideas

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.400
 Like there were all these things that we wanted to do that we just couldn't in v2 even when we released it

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.120
 We knew that it was in support x y and z. Yeah, now it really feels like

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.160
 We can do everything and if this doesn't grow a lot bigger

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:17.120
 It just means the fundamental ideas wrong like we I don't think it's the execution. I don't think it's any of that

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:23.520
 So I'm glad to finally be able to be at a phase where it's clear that if it's working

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.520
 It's working if it's not working it means like

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:32.480
 And there's not like any mystery around why it's not working. Yeah, but like I said, even already the adoption and growth has been

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.440
 Much better than anything we've done before. So

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:41.760
 It feels right. I love it. I mean, it's my favorite way to build stuff. I could show it all day long

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.720
 Yeah, maybe we should do that sometime. Maybe I should just

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.960
 It's been all podcast talking through how much I love sscv3. Yeah, that's what I've been doing

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.840
 Yeah, that's what you've been doing. I'm but I'm working on a mobile app. I

00:18:53.840 --> 00:19:00.480
 I'm not a mobile developer. Is that the big release for the NFL season the mobile? Yeah, we're trying to get the the mobile app out

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.720
 We've had an iOS app for years

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:11.520
 We've never had an Android app. But the iOS app has been I mean, it's been out there and just not the same as our website

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.520
 It's just a very different thing

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.760
 And literally every time we tweet like

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.600
 Some cool new thing we did anytime we tweet like product stuff. It's like we need an app. We don't care

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.680
 We want an app. Give us an app, bro

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:30.720
 Like everybody just wants a native app and I I don't relate to that like I I guess like maybe because I'm a web developer

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.240
 I just want the web to be enough. It's like we have a website. It's great. It looks good on mobile

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:40.240
 She's website people don't care. They want an app and it's like normie normie people because people don't use their computer

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:46.800
 I guess a lot of normal people just do not use a computer. That's true. They just use funds now. They don't have to

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.560
 Get on a computer if they're not doing knowledge work. I guess

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.200
 Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I guess like

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:59.760
 Is what what is so this is a good topic? What is the fundamental difference between native apps and a good web app?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.000
 Like why does it just feel worse in a web browser? I know it does

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.320
 But I can't articulate why I think it's entirely around the touch and the scrolling

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.600
 That's that's my feeling

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:15.200
 So if you like if you build a good app like again, like take linear linear is a good app if you use it on mobile web

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.080
 There's like probably nothing better that they can do really at that point

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.840
 They just limit by the way it feels that that's what I want to know

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.160
 What is it limited by like what are the laws of physics if we go first principles here?

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.320
 Why why can't a browser have as responsive of

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:38.640
 Scroll and touch as the native app and I was joking about the first principles. That was I was maiming

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.640
 I'm not that guy at least I'm funny

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:46.960
 Sometimes I am that guy sometimes so I have to like

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.600
 I'm joking

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:55.040
 But then if you joke too much and you become that guy again, I know you have to start joking again on top of the jokes so hard

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.040
 Yeah, it's like inception. Yeah, so I think what I think about is

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.120
 there are

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.880
 People that work on high performance web stuff that drop down to canvas

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:10.000
 And initially, it's like why the hell would canvas be any faster, right? It's like you're still

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.440
 Rendering rectangles and like doing all the same stuff your browser does and your browser

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.840
 Yeah, natively. So why is dropping down to canvas at all?

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:23.840
 Faster like that like just never it sends to me, but you do get more perform at uis if you do that

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.960
 I think it's it must be entirely around

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.760
 The browser being a thousand percent backwards compatible with all the old

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.800
 Way out systems and all the old styling stuff and like just the decades of

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.320
 Things and I'm assuming that puts a ceiling on

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:47.280
 On performance, which is why when you drop down to canvas you like are not implementing the whole history of things

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.280
 There's money exactly what

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.360
 Uh, the type of stuff that your current application is doing

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.520
 so

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.080
 I'm assuming that native apps probably also have a history and have like similar issues

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.080
 But I think it's a little different because you can control

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.280
 versions of the os some apps don't work on older versions like they they like actually remove things

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.960
 So I think it's I think it's purely that I think it's a difference between an infinitely backwards compatible maximum

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.200
 accessibility and maximum whatever

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.080
 Versus like a more controlled thing. I think that's

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.920
 It's just that you're always going to have a gap there. Yeah, so

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.440
 I guess like if you implemented your so I've got like a react native app. It's actually expo

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.080
 and it's a like

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.880
 Whatever, it's got normal native stuff in it. It's got some web views

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.840
 But if I like somehow implemented the stat news website in a canvas

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.920
 Let's just assume I went through that pane

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.040
 Do you think it would feel as good as a native app or not?

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:48.400
 I think it could because like really people build games in canvas and like in a browser. It feels good

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.440
 Yeah, like to see framers are speaking at like okay

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.920
 Way more complex and so who's done this? Who's built like a normal like scroll view like experience

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.760
 You should talk to Ken. I'm pretty sure

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.680
 Oh, he has done stuff. Yeah

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:07.440
 I think a lot of their stuff is canvas driven because I think they deal with uh, they they deal with a classic like

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.400
 shit ton of data

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.080
 in

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:18.560
 Uh like in a table type of thing. Yeah, and that like very quickly hits the limits of traditional browser stuff. Yeah

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.560
 Yeah, the famous example is figma, right? Like they're doing everything

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.520
 That's like is that canvas or is that is web gl the same thing? Okay. Yeah, it's it's a mix of

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.760
 Or was there on canvas web gl at all kind of related. Okay

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:38.000
 So if you could just build like normal website functionality using those api's then you wouldn't need a native app maybe

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 I guess like yeah, and this is flutter, right? This is what flutter is what i'm sorry. What is flutter?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.280
 I thought flutter was just google's react native. Yeah, but I think the web version of it renders to a canvas really

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.520
 Yeah

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.200
 Interesting the performance is better. Like it could just be worse given what they're

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:01.280
 I want somebody. Yeah, somebody send me like an example of a web like a mobile web experience that feels like a native app

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:07.200
 I'm sure somebody's done this. Maybe I could just google it, but it'd be better if you just send us an email at

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.560
 really great mobile web example at tomorrow.fm

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:20.800
 I like just bit funny. Yeah, just aliases email aliases

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.200
 You know what? I don't know if i've set up an email

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.240
 It's just a black hole link

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:33.440
 That's funny. Well, we'll see. I'm not gonna look. We'll just we'll see if we get any emails who knows you should try the

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.680
 Flutter thing. I do wonder how do I think the other problem is web

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:43.600
 Once you go to canvas your operating system has no idea what's being shown on screen

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.720
 so a bunch of nativey things probably like

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.520
 Don't work like don't work anymore. You have to re-implement copy paste in like a

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.000
 Cheese manual way. Yeah

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:02.240
 Any accessibility stuff like hitting tab to like go to the next element all that all that so I see why people really only use it for things like

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:10.240
 That are really not document oriented at all. Yeah. Yeah, I'm probably not going to do this because I've mostly got the app built in expo and

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.640
 That's gonna stay that i hate it so much that you're like wondering about this

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.080
 Uh

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.320
 I didn't hate it. Okay. So mobile web development's interesting in some ways. I like it

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:26.000
 In other ways. I just missed the web stuff expo. I will say feels pretty similar

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.800
 To modern web development. I don't know if you've ever played with expo. Yeah, I suppose great

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.280
 Yeah, so it's great. I think like I get very confused about what's actually happening

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:40.560
 Like there's like a javascript bundle and it's doing some stuff. Is it using real native stuff?

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.640
 I don't know. I just kind of build with the normal controls that expo provides

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.360
 But most of the app honestly is just web views

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.120
 It's just coordinating a bunch of different web views because we don't want to build

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:58.640
 Every single page on the site all the different like scoreboards and just whatever standings and all the different visuals

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.760
 We have we don't want to build them all and like swift or whatever

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.320
 It's just like because then when we have new features

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:11.600
 Yeah, it's just it's a small team. It's kind of untenable. So we just we use the web view

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.600
 And maybe that's like a golden rule. You don't break like don't use web views

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.320
 I'm sure there's mobile developers who are like screaming at me right now on the other side of the podcast

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.560
 But I don't know it's working for us. Well, then I guess what's the what's the boundary?

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:30.160
 Like what did you decide to do natively and what's what's a web? Why why's not all web? Yeah, so there's a native

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:38.880
 Like nav bar at the bottom that has different there are actually different tabs that have different web views loading to different pages

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.480
 There's other things like we don't render the web ads

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.400
 In the web views so we got some trickery going on to hide some stuff

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:53.920
 If it's the native app and then we render native ads. There's like native ad SDKs. Oh, I see so there's there's stuff like that

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.400
 Uh, why not just yeah like originally the first

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:07.040
 Plan was like, well, we could just build this as a web view and like could it just load our site and then like does that actually improve anything

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:12.080
 Is that is that better than a mobile like a web app? I mean, it's at least it's in the app store

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:17.120
 So the people who are like give us an app. It's like here's an app. They just don't know that they got suckered into using our web app

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.760
 But then we thought of some stuff that like the search is more it's native like

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.880
 Using native controls and the neighbor native keyboard and all that

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:30.320
 Uh, just little things like that. It's mostly web views, but there's like the 10 percent that's

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.640
 That's native just nabbing around the stuff. Do you feel about the result? Like it's you feel good?

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.360
 It feels pretty good. Yeah, the app feels pretty good. Uh, there were things rough edges at first

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:47.760
 Uh that we we exposed like loading states feeling really slow on a native app because you're not used to that but

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:53.200
 Uh, we we stripped them out and it's it's feeling a lot better now. Yeah, I don't know

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.760
 I think I think the people who are asking for an app will be pleased. It is an app in fact

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.720
 And it's the current stat music experience. Like if you go to the www.statements.com

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:08.240
 Uh, it feels like that but just made from an app. So yeah, I think it came out pretty good

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.640
 Not quite done still a few remaining todays

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.600
 Uh, but we'll actually have it on the android now too. So that's nice

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.760
 Although I will say Expo does a lot to like make your life easier

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.760
 Across these different platforms. There's just all these little weird gotchas though. Like oh, you can't do that on android

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.880
 Oh, you can't use this api and i'm doing really basic stuff

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:33.360
 The the kind of things that are really annoying to then work around. So as an example, uh, form posts

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.680
 Can't include headers on android, but they can

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.080
 on ios

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:45.760
 So that's the kind of weird thing that you just ship it for both and i've got a team member that has an android phone and they're like

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.040
 Yeah, I can't ask any questions. It doesn't work. I'm like sure it does. I don't know what you're talking about

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.040
 Then I had to download the android emulator and all that stuff and then i'm out man

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.440
 Yeah, so there's still a little whack-a-mole stuff like that. This is one of those things where i'm like

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.160
 Expo has made it a lot better

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.920
 but

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:09.040
 It's still to me. It's just so painful still that I will just reorient what i'm working on to never

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:17.440
 Yeah, if you follow this logic ultimately, i'm going to end up sorting a company that only serves an api because i can't think of something

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.520
 Like that's how you eliminate anything. Yeah, anything that like sucks

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.280
 Yeah, if your whole product is just an api

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:31.360
 Well, that's I always said that when I was doing freelance work like the great thing about doing like back in the like dev ops

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.680
 Consulting is there's no like feedback. There's no

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:42.720
 UI complaints like if you build full stack websites, which I have for like freelance clients the work never ends

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.040
 They have opinions on literally everything

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:50.640
 You build like something for the cloud or you do like a security audit or you do something that's like

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:57.600
 Back end in for us stuff aws stuff. There's like no back and forth. It's like i did the thing

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.000
 Here's the thing everybody's happy

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.160
 Whereas you ship some buttons on a web page and there's gonna be opinions about every single thing

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.680
 Yeah, that's actually a really good point. It's uh, there's this tediousness of front-end

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.640
 And we both work on front-end a lot and we and we care about front-end

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:18.160
 But there's like a tediousness to it that just doesn't exist on back-end where I think this is where

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.920
 This sense that people have that front-end is quote-unquote easy

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:27.520
 I kind of get why people feel that way because you're not really using your brain that much

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.720
 Yeah, like a lot of the time you're morgers exerting a high level of like labor and just tediousness to get through certain things

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.120
 Mm-hmm. Um whereas back-end you almost have none of that. So it feels like you're using your brain all the time

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.680
 Yeah, I much prefer back-end. Have we talked about this?

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.640
 I really guess like does I dislike front-end so much and how do we keep end up?

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:52.080
 Like I keep ending up doing front-end work in my career. I don't know how to escape it. I do so much front-end

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:57.840
 It's crazy. It's it's insane actually for for what our skill sets are the amount of front-end work that we do

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.880
 It's kind of crazy. So I'm gonna explain this to me

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:07.360
 Does nobody else want to do it? What are we just too agreeable? You care you just can't not care about it

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.200
 You know, it's what it's like. I don't know. Maybe I want to not care. Can I not care?

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.240
 All the places that I do front-end development. What if I just don't want to care anymore? Can I do just do back-end?

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:21.680
 I'll talk to status. Maybe I could just but then like the but the front is gonna get worse like and

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.800
 Engineers, they're great. Why why do I get put on front-end teams? What is it about me?

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.440
 Do I just do skinny jeans?

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.600
 What is it about me?

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.560
 People like you should work on the front-end

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:42.240
 Nevermind all your back-end experience. Maybe it's a racial thing. I feel like maybe I think

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.320
 When someone looked at you and me they would guess that you're the front-end engineer

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:51.120
 At first glance, right?

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:57.760
 There's nobody there's nobody that we should actually do some kind of you know people know us too. Well, if we could just put our faces

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.760
 Side-by-side and run like a pole

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:05.680
 Can we just like kind of like use AI to modify the image so it doesn't look like us, but it's our

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.440
 Like our facial hair everything

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.760
 Yeah, it's actually really good. I would love to know what people say. That's really good

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.400
 Yeah, I do feel too like I'm getting a little old. I just turned 38 a couple of days ago by the way

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.520
 Uh, I just turned 38 grads. I don't know you. Oh, I don't know. Yeah, I don't really talk about my birthday

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.160
 Somebody told me it was a security risk. Do you and I don't have the same birthday?

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.360
 Maybe

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.320
 Oh, it's okay. I don't care actually. Do you tell me later what your birthday is?

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.800
 Okay, it ends in it none of us

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.300
 No, definitely give it away. Uh, but I'm 30. It has wheels and doors

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:48.000
 No, not at all. I'm 38. I do feel like is there a point where you age out of being on the front-end team

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.840
 It's always gonna be like me and like the 18-year-olds building front-ends

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.400
 And i'm gonna be 52 and it's like what is going on in my career? Why am I working?

00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:02.880
 It's like traditionally a junior thing to work on the front-end. You're right. It is a very

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:11.520
 Fun has a younger younger vibe to it for sure like you gotta say things like it's giving and it's bad

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:18.160
 You're gonna be on the front-end team. You have to know what it means to stay bet and ironically

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:24.480
 And I don't actually so someone get me off the front-end team because this is ridiculous. This is really funny

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:31.680
 Yeah, someone's gonna be upset. Yes. There are some roles that are very senior in the front-end. We acknowledge that sure

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:37.200
 It's also funny. It is funny. I was also talking to kasey just speaking of job roles

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.800
 Maybe I want to be a manager

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.200
 someday again

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.200
 Or I was only for like

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:49.120
 10 minutes and then I hated it and I wanted to go back to individual contribution

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.520
 Do you feel like you're always just gonna be shipping code as a job?

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:58.240
 I mean, I used to be I also used to be a manager here's I think it's I think it's like a weird if I like look at my own situation

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.240
 I think it's not exactly

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.600
 Like oh, I'm gonna grow out of it. I think it's more like

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:08.160
 So my time that I was a hundred I was a hundred percent manager zero code at all. Yeah, which

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.680
 It's pretty crazy awful and awesome all at same time. Yeah, here's the thing. I didn't think it was awful

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:18.160
 I did not think it was awful. My work was very very

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:23.520
 Extremely well-defined every single day I had to meet with x number of people

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:28.400
 Okay, once I finished that I had no other work to do literally nothing. There's no work

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.720
 I could have made up for myself. That's what I'm getting at. It's like the individual contributor role

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:39.920
 Is so tiresome. It's one thing to the next there will always be a thing that I'm trying to work for yourself

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.000
 You can always make work for yourself when there's when you've met with everyone. There's no work you can make

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.160
 So that's what I was feeling like if I was a manager, I would have a lighter load

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.440
 That's what I assume. Yes, it's an easier job

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.320
 at the end of the day it kind of feels like

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:59.200
 A fake job to me like it was a fake job. Is everybody happy?

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:05.200
 Is everyone still hired here? Anyone that needs to be fired has fired. Cool. Did my job. No, I'm gonna chill

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:12.800
 Here's what here's what the actual job is like. I think it's it's the perfect like black swan type of thing which comes up like every episode

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:21.600
 Every single day my role was extremely predictable extremely stable very easy very straightforward

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:30.000
 Give me a lot of time to actually I actually programmed a lot while I was a manager. It does not work stuff. I was able to like work on ideas or new things

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.480
 Et cuz my day-to-day was so well defined

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:37.520
 But every once in a while once a month once every two months

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:43.440
 there would be a couple days of like intense stress and discomfort because

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:50.800
 My team failed to ship something and the rest of the company is is really pissed or they're upset and like, you know

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.800
 There's a bunch of chaos and people want to know why and all the stuff and you the one has the answer for that

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.760
 Um, so there was that no joke

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.080
 There was also another situation where we were looking for a data engineer forever

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:07.120
 And it was like the big bottleneck for a company the cto kept getting bogged down in data engineering stuff

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:12.960
 Because he was one that built originally and we were like we got to find a data engineer to replace him because like so much is getting backed up for this

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.960
 We found one

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.320
 Great great prior finally we unlocked this problem

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.160
 two weeks in uh, he was on a call with

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.560
 Someone else and there was three on the call. I think one might have been external

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:31.440
 One person left the call and he said something like insanely racist in front of the other person

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.120
 And then now it's like

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.040
 Okay, well

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:42.800
 It's like messed up if we like would let him go but only keep him because yeah

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.360
 This is like a very stressful situation for us

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.800
 Uh, another person was like really upset by it. So

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:53.280
 Yeah, now the back so it's like stupid stuff like that

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.400
 You know, it's it's like it's when you run to stupid stuff and code it almost feels like

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:04.720
 Understandable the world is how the world works when you run to stupid stuff like that. It's just like it just feels unnecessary

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:09.520
 It's kind of like genuinely stupid, but I would say overall it was

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:15.280
 Better and it just like in terms of like workload being predictable and stable and everything. Yeah

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.720
 Do you ever see those twitter threads? Not as much lately, but I feel like there was a heyday for this

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:25.760
 Maybe a year or two ago threads from like engineering managers very serious influencer types

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:31.680
 They're like here's how you get the most out of your team and if you're just managing and you're not thinking about these things

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.400
 Blah, blah, blah, blah. I think it's all fake. I think like

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:40.560
 How do you even measure a good engineering manager? I don't think managers should exist. So it's hard for me to imagine like

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:47.440
 Did your job you figured it out and you're gonna teach people how to manage people so that they're happy

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.880
 There's nothing a manager could do or say to me that would make me better at my job

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.120
 Like I'm either good at my job or bad at my job

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.640
 And I just think I'm probably overreacting here and getting way too aggressive

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.280
 But the whole thing just smells to me

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.880
 It just seems weird to like obsess about this engineering manager thing

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.080
 Like it's this high calling and you can get so much out of a team

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:11.840
 Show me one like way to measure that that your job was so important that the team did xyz

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.600
 I just don't get it. Yeah, I think I agree with you that the majority of the people posting that stuff in these mid-level

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.040
 Manager roles at big companies

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:25.200
 Like they're just following some template of like this is what a manager is like and they think that it is impactful when it's really

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.280
 A technically useless job. It only exists as a side effect of

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:35.840
 You do need someone to be a router and coordinate. Yeah beyond that. It's like it doesn't really have to exist

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.640
 But that said the previous role I was in I was also technically a manager

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:46.720
 But it was I was on middle manager. I got like I built the team from the company being zero people

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:53.680
 This was a very different situation because it involved getting people motivated

00:38:53.680 --> 00:39:00.080
 To do stuff that was like well beyond what they thought they could do or like

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.840
 kind of like irrational at times like working way harder than

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:10.000
 They technically had to just having a team that's like really motivated really excited but like run through a wall

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.920
 That like just say like we need to do this and they would just kind of like run at it

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.920
 Yeah, I think they're that there's something real there. There's like an actual like leadership

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.240
 dynamic there

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:24.240
 I don't think it shows up in middle managers and now so it's the difference in like

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:30.320
 The one manager to start up because somebody has to manage to start up the leader of the engineering team

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:36.560
 Versus big company or middle size company with lots of middle managers. That's what you're saying. Yeah

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.760
 Yeah, so if I mean if I go my current role, I'm no longer in a leadership role

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.000
 But and we're only three people

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.760
 Even though we're only three people like jay is technically the CEO

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:51.360
 Yeah, and he does pay a crazy amount of attention to all these micro things

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.400
 I'm not even thinking about and it adds up a lot and I definitely he like definitely like pulls

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:02.560
 Like really really great effort out of me. So yeah, I mean you play sports

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.520
 Like you you get like what i'm talking about like there there is like

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.800
 An invisible thing that can happen when you have a good leader

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.920
 But it's not this stupid like

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.640
 Check in with your team every two weeks to see how they're you know, it's never that special for your one-on-ones

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:22.080
 Here's what you should cover. Yeah, I'm realizing like I do this thing where I go really extreme

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.360
 And I just I completely like discount an entire

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:30.800
 A profession or role and I say thing. It's not just that sometimes it's people sometimes whatever

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.880
 Uh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't do that. It's you're fine. If you're a middle manager, you're a developer manager, whatever

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.040
 Whatever they're called. I'm sure you're doing a great job. Keep doing it. Keep doing your thing

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.760
 Don't listen to me. I don't know anything

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.960
 Great. So I agree with everything you said and use a walk that all back. So

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.400
 Well, no, I feel like you were like on an island. No, no, no

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.600
 I think you were like being kind and you were like, yeah, yeah, I agree

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:59.520
 But then you're like but actually it is a real thing and it no, but I mean I I didn't I I said this other thing

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:04.720
 Is something I value and don't value this this middle manager thing. It's I got you

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.560
 I here's a thing

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.560
 Everyone can do whatever they want

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:14.160
 But I don't believe in glorifying everything. I'm gonna still have my opinions and values on what I what

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:19.840
 Is worth glorifying and aspiring to and being like that's really great. Yeah, it's not everything

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:25.600
 It's it can't be everything. What is worth glorifying last question and then I get personal. It's a personal question, right?

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.480
 Oh, you don't want to answer personal questions on the podcast. I'm saying

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:33.920
 I'm saying I can answer no, I'm asking you. Yeah, I'm asking Dax. What's worth glorifying? I

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.560
 I have this very

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.760
 You know, here's a good good way to here's a good way to

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.760
 Figure it out

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.480
 Everyone will cry at some kind of movie situation. Uh, yeah, there were some tears the other night

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:51.520
 We watched inside out too and I didn't cry but people in the family not that it was bad to cry

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.840
 Not that it would be bad if I cried. I should have cried. I don't have a soul. Anyway, continue

00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:01.120
 No, but there are some things that will bring I don't think you would like cry, but some things like bring yeah, yours, right?

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.800
 To your eyes, whatever

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.200
 I think you can derive what you care about from that. So for me from that

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:12.960
 Uh, the thing that always gets me is anytime someone's being like extremely honorable like beyond

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:18.160
 Yeah, what you could like imagine someone doing or like doing some kind of crazy sacrifice

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.720
 Uh, that's what I

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:25.920
 Really like value like that always brings a tear to my eye and I think I really value that if you derive that further

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.320
 Like a lot of those things are rooted in leadership

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:33.360
 It's usually like a leader that is going above and beyond for a group of people that are leading

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.000
 And that's why this flows all the way down to

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.120
 Like yeah, I do really care about great leadership

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.440
 I don't think middle managers are represented that but I do think there are people that are

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.520
 That's my thought that's a good answer

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.240
 Uh, there is one thing. There's one thing that makes me cry all the time every time it comes up

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.640
 And I'm gonna save it for next podcast

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:58.400
 I love it. I really do have to go

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:04.800
 Okay, I'm gonna forget and someone's gonna have to remind me to tell you all on the next episode

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.160
 Dax try to remember. I'll tell you guys what makes me correct

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.600
 Is it when people don't have good lighting in their shot? No, but that's a good one too

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.280
 When people don't have the bokeh on their camera just right

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.560
 Anyway, I'll see you in a couple days. Yeah, wow

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.920
 Yeah, when people are listening to this we'll be getting on planes to the alice

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.280
 We did that once before we're making fun of Adam. We're probably posting funny pictures

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.440
 We're probably taking

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.600
 To places in situations that he's very uncomfortable with he's probably gonna be having weird interactions with people

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:41.600
 Uh, I just saw by the way hacks or I don't know if he listens to the podcast, but hacks were just pushed to PR to the terminal repo

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:46.080
 It's actually a bug fix. Whoa. No, it's an issue. I'm sorry. It's not a PR

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:54.240
 He posted a screenshot of a chat with me where he was like, could you please do this?

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.760
 And I was like, yes, sorry lll and I haven't done it. So

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.320
 That's funny

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:08.000
 Anyway, are you just looking at it? Yeah, that's funny. Yeah, my bad. I thought it was a force. I was so excited. Okay. Well, whatever

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.800
 All right. All right. See you

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.840
