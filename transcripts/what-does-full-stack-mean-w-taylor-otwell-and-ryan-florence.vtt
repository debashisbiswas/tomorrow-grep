WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
 - No, I don't think I've ever met anyone, actually,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.160
 from the skull.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.800
 - Okay, well why would you, we're all, you know,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.040
 JavaScript developers, so.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.800
 - Filthy JavaScript developers.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.120
 (laughing)

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.700
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.880
 (upbeat music)

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.080
 - I would like to get out of this call

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.860
 and understand what is full stack.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.000
 Like, what does that actually mean?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.960
 Maybe everyone else on the call knows,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.920
 but I'm more confused than ever.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.640
 And mostly from Twitter.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.120
 I think I thought I knew what it meant,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.920
 but I think everyone probably has different takes on it.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.160
 And maybe it's just a dumb word

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.640
 or a dumb term that we don't need.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.880
 - And just to set some context,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.640
 the reason we're even doing this is,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.560
 so last we, what's his username?

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.480
 WebdevCody, he was trying out Clarabel,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.520
 and his initial reaction was like,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.920
 ah, there's so much stuff here.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.800
 Like, why there's so much stuff that feels bloated, you know?

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.440
 Is it really overwhelming?

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.560
 And Taylor, quote, tweet it, adding some context,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.600
 which is, well, you know,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.400
 we focus a lot on backend needs

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.240
 and backend needs a lot of stuff.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.200
 Doing stuff asynchronously, job processing,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.280
 queues, like, everything that you find

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.960
 in any like moderately complex app.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.400
 And there's a whole bunch of discussion around.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.840
 - Mailers, roles on users.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.680
 - Yeah.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.720
 - Middleware, yeah.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.280
 - And in that tweet, I didn't say that I contrasted it

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.760
 with things like Next.js and Remix,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.360
 where it has almost none of that.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.480
 And they focus in a completely different area.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.280
 And the claim was those aren't full stack

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.800
 because it's missing these things that are,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.320
 like you said, like every application

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.120
 eventually ends up having some of those.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.040
 - Yeah, I think that makes sense.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.560
 Although I'm willing to actually concede

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.720
 that I think those things are full stack

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.720
 in some sense of the word.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.440
 And it's maybe better to talk about Laraval and Rails

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.040
 as like a different word, like batteries included

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.880
 or some other term, you know, that is more than full stack.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.520
 - I think the default is what Rails and help me out.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.360
 How do you pronounce the name of your framework?

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.400
 - I say Laraval.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.720
 Some people say Laraval.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.760
 Some people say Larval.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.440
 Larval, larval, like a thing coming out of an egg

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.360
 or something or an insect.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.440
 - Taylor, Tyler, what else is that?

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.760
 (all laughing)

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.760
 - You can butcher everything.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.280
 - Okay, so you say Laraval.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.200
 - Yeah, that's how I say it.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.160
 - Larval, okay.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.720
 That's the best pronunciation.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.960
 - I feel like you get to decide, Taylor, how it's said.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.880
 - Yeah, you can just make everyone do what you want.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.760
 - I mean, to do?

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.960
 - Yeah, our framework is called "Remeeks."

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.800
 It's not...

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.960
 (all laughing)

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.280
 But everyone says it wrong.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.480
 Even though it's that Elon Musk calls it Tesla

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.040
 with like a Z Tesla.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.520
 - Oh yeah, that's funny.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.720
 Nobody else does that.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.800
 I think the default definition of full stack

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.560
 is basically what Rails and Laraval are.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.760
 Like, I don't think that should change

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.040
 and they should have a new name.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.320
 Like, we're the weirdos coming in

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.280
 and being like, "Hey, I'm running JavaScript

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.240
 "on the server, it's full stack."

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.080
 - I think historically it was like Rails, for example,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.920
 was full stack and something like Sinatra,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.320
 people called like a micro framework.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.160
 - Yeah.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.480
 - And those were sort of the two distinctions.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.000
 But now, like, I do think the word full stack

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.400
 has kind of changed a little bit in the JavaScript world

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.680
 to mean just the ability to run code on the server

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.080
 or the client.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.800
 - Which, like, I think that's not wrong.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.920
 I don't think it's totally wrong.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.880
 It's just different than how it used to be.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.280
 - Yeah, so I'll give you a little background

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.560
 on why I used the term on the remix website

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.400
 when we first launched.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.520
 And honestly, this last week has been kind of funny

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.560
 because internally on the remix team

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.920
 we're like arguing about, is it actually full stack?

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.640
 But my personal definition,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.120
 this isn't like the remix team

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.600
 and as much as people like to think that Michael and I

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.240
 are the same person, we're not.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.840
 And that's where the magic happens, right?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.160
 If you just agreed on everything,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.800
 you'd probably end up like selling coffee

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.240
 through a terminal and requiring people to do their IDRSA key

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.240
 to buy something.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.280
 - We are all very aligned on that.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.000
 (laughing)

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.080
 - No, my definition of full stack is,

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.840
 you can run code on both sides.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.760
 Actually, I have two things I want to say right off the bat.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.200
 First of all, butcher box.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.760
 I think Taylor and I know this about butcher box.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.120
 I don't know if anybody else does.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.880
 - I'm a vegan, so no.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.400
 - Actually, I'm a butcher box customer.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.720
 I've been a customer for an extremely long time.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.760
 - What do you think butcher box is?

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.080
 A remix app or a larval?

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.240
 Larval, oh, I did it wrong.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.720
 - Larval, a larval app, my experience with butcher box

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.880
 is when they first started.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.200
 This site was the slowest site I'd ever used in my life.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.840
 Like, just crazy, crazy slow.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.160
 So I don't know what they were doing.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.440
 And at some point, it got a lot better.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.360
 That's my only experience.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.600
 And I have no idea what the reason is for that.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.920
 I'm sure it was user error.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.080
 Like, it was like way too slow.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.440
 But I don't know.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.400
 I have no idea about it.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.560
 - So I don't know what it was before it got fast,

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.880
 but I know today it's a remix app

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.680
 that talks to a larval backend.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.440
 So first of all, like our two frameworks are not like

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.600
 always competing, right?

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.560
 They work together really well.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.720
 And lots of people to play stuff like that.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.600
 So that's the first thing about this whole thing

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.240
 is that it's like, we have focused on different things

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.160
 to the point that some people want to put a big line

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.840
 between it and be like, all right, everything backend

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.320
 is larval, everything front end is remix.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.400
 And then in remix loaders, they're just gonna talk

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.800
 between the two things, right?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.960
 But the other thing that kind of bothers me,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.120
 especially in your Tweet Taylor is,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.360
 and has nothing to do with you,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.440
 this has happened to us since we launched remix,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.520
 is that everybody just saw remix, they saw React,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.800
 they saw an X in the name just like next,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.120
 and they're like, oh, this is like next.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.040
 And in your Tweet, you were talking about in next remix,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.240
 it seems to mean that there's simply the bare ability

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.320
 to run code on the server at all

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.200
 and an advertisement for clerk.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.520
 (laughing)

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.560
 - I love that line.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.880
 (laughing)

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.720
 - It's so good.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.480
 Which, so first of all, like when we launched remix

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.480
 I was like, how do I do off?

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.800
 And we're like, just make a table and hash the password

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.000
 and put it in there, like, just give it a shot.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.600
 Don't go to clerk, or sure, go use clerk.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.720
 And then the second thing was,

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.040
 next and others are really, really great at the get.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.000
 They're not mature for post, put, and delete,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.600
 especially when things start getting non-trivial.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.440
 So this is like a huge badge of pride for us with remix,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.200
 is that we're old school PHP,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.840
 I did code igniter in symphony and Kohana,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.000
 Kohana was my favorite one, actually.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.080
 And then, and I did like just bare bones.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.480
 Like, I was setting up line notes,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.360
 like setting up IP tables and stuff.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.760
 And then lots of real stuff.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.240
 So we kind of brought a lot of that to react.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.040
 Like we just, just like,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.000
 it's like it's this whole community of reactators

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.480
 that look at react, like all those idiots

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.320
 that don't even know how the web works.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.160
 And we're like, ah, we actually like,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.520
 we're in that group with you.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.520
 (laughing)

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.240
 And remix was our attempt to be like,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.000
 let's bring HTTP to react.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.080
 You can render it on the server.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.680
 So remix from the start has had,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.000
 we did a convention where you can stick

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.640
 an extra component where you get your component,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.560
 loader, and action.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.440
 Loader is what we do when it's a get with the component.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.720
 And then action is when we respond with a post.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.080
 So we've always supported that stuff.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.920
 Mm-hmm.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.160
 And it's always been frustrating,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.200
 like getting lumped into like,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.440
 oh, I bet you just statically generate stuff.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.320
 To the point that we kind of purposely

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.040
 didn't do static rendering,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.160
 just like keep that difference very, very clear.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.880
 They're like, no, we want you to run a server

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.400
 and we want to speak HTTP.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.000
 Yeah, that makes sense.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.720
 I mean, I think like,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.080
 I honestly think this entire discussion,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.920
 the most interesting part to me is not really the full stack,

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.200
 the what is full stack stuff.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.640
 It's more like, what is the easiest,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.400
 I guess you would say ecosystem or platform

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.680
 for actually shipping a real product, a real business.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.640
 Which is really the most,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.720
 like the whole thing I'm interested in

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.240
 because that's why Laravel was built

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.040
 was so that I could build startups faster

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.680
 and ship them out of the web and make money.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.920
 And I think that's really why Rails was built too.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.080
 And it feels like Laravel and Rails

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.960
 are just more fleshed out in a way

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.400
 where if you want to sit down as one person

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.040
 and build an honest to God product that you can ship,

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.800
 it just feels a lot faster if you're using something like

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.440
 Rails or Laravel versus like a JavaScript framework

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.280
 where you sort of have to like reconstruct

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.640
 a lot of those opinions from scratch.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.040
 Which tends to, I think I could be wrong,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.480
 tends to mean that like all of the apps look pretty different

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.960
 in terms of how they're architected and set up

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.280
 and there's versus like Laravel or Rails

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.520
 where from app to app there's some pretty good similarities

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.880
 and understanding of how you do a lot of things

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.720
 on the backend that a lot of products need.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.320
 So I actually find that actually more interesting,

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.880
 you know, than the sort of like what's full stack,

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.240
 what's back in, what's front end and all of that.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.640
 - So I like I could say all the exact same stuff

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.960
 but like in reverse where it's like,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.000
 I'm interested in, so you're talking about all the stuff.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.240
 Like if it's a gradient, right?

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.080
 A full stack is a gradient and on the,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.560
 on this side we've got your database, your mailers,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.360
 your queues, all that kind of stuff.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.280
 And then like you come over here,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.560
 you get to the network, you send HTML and JSON

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.720
 and then you start sending JavaScript

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.040
 and then you start building like a pending UI

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.720
 or an optimistic UI or, you know,

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.200
 just a really dynamic experience.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.440
 I, remix wants to come as far back

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.600
 as controllers basically.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.680
 Then we're like, ah, there's a ton of databases.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.880
 You've already got your Rails app.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.480
 You've already got your Laravel app.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.400
 Like you've got that part done.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.220
 This stuff is where we're trying to push

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.720
 the ceiling of a user experience.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.200
 You know, that's where we've approached this is it's like,

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.200
 how do you build that really, really dynamic experience

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.360
 and bend the, bend the trade-offs of like,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.280
 how much you do on the server for that UI

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.200
 and how much you do on the backend?

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.720
 I asked for a few Laravel apps just to go and like click around

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.080
 in the network and look in the browser

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.320
 and see if I could kind of reverse engineer

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.160
 how it was working.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.380
 But all of the sites that people sent me were react

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.940
 and view and stuff.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.040
 But I understand that Laravel has stuff to do

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.880
 in the browser.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.000
 So like I'm more familiar with Rails with like Turbo

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.280
 and Hotwire and Pjax a long time ago.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.440
 So what does Laravel have?

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.000
 Like I want to make a combo box, right?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.960
 I want to do a type ahead and I want to search

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.080
 my user table and drop something in there.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.720
 What is there in Laravel for that?

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.200
 - So I'll kind of back up a little bit

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.240
 and kind of explain how Laravel got to where it is today

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.720
 and how it's different than something like Rails

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.200
 because I think it's mainly differences

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.160
 between like me and DHH.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.520
 You know when Laravel first came out,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.800
 it was just straight up PHP rendered templates

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.320
 sent to the client just like ERB templates in Rails

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.160
 or something.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.840
 That was like 2010, 2011.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.680
 I actually got really into Vue.js around 2015, 2016.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.120
 And I think this is one of the key differences

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.320
 between us and Rails is that it seems like DHH

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.600
 is like very anti-JavaScript at all.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.600
 You know, just wants to do as minimal JavaScript as possible

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.120
 whereas we've actually always been pretty open minded

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.960
 about different kinds of frontends

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.000
 that are paired with Laravel.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.520
 So eventually this library called inertia.js was written

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.520
 that basically lets you tie a React, a Vue, a Svelte frontend

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.480
 to your Laravel backends within like a monolithic Laravel app

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.160
 that's all in the same GitHub repo, for example.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.220
 And so what it looks like actually is

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.040
 all of the routing is handled by Laravel.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.520
 So you hit a controller and then you return

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.120
 in a nursery response that corresponds to like a React page

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.800
 or component and you actually pass the props and data

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.440
 from the server side controller to the Vue react page

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.800
 and it's all hydrated in.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.960
 You know, I don't actually know exactly how inertia works

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.320
 because I didn't write it.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.320
 And then once you're, once that renders, you know,

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.640
 like as far as like a combo box or whatever,

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.280
 you could use whatever React or Vue

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.200
 component library you'd like.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.880
 So if you like, you know, Shad CN or the new catalyst stuff

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.080
 from tailwind or whatever, you could just drop that in.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.640
 And then to hook it up to the back end, you know,

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.440
 it's just a matter of, you know, I guess just making either,

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.120
 you know, fetch requests to the back end

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.280
 or inertia has their own kind of built-in mechanisms

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.120
 for pulling data as well.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.560
 But once you're on the front end, you know,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.880
 you can kind of use whatever you want.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.240
 So I would actually say, honestly, I wouldn't be surprised

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.040
 at this point of 50% of Laravel apps, new ones are built

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.400
 with like a Vue or React front end.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.040
 And maybe the other 50% or something like Laravel Livewire,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.080
 which is basically like our version of Elixir's,

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.520
 or Phoenix's live view or it's a little bit different

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.400
 than Hotwire, I wouldn't fully compare it to that.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.880
 But so I think that's kind of the current state, you know,

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.040
 a front end in Laravel.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.480
 - So I'm looking at the inertia website.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.200
 So when I say return, inertia render users,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.480
 or if I'm doing like a combo box.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.840
 So is this is just passing data to the front end?

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.680
 Or is it like rendering that React component

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.120
 and sending HTML like of the component?

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.960
 - Yeah, so I mean, I know they have a server,

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.280
 there's a server-side rendering part of it you can run,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.640
 but let's say you're not doing that.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.360
 It actually just sends like JSON data to the front end,

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.680
 which is then hydrated into the, you know,

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.200
 the Vue or React components.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.360
 But I mean, inertia is kind of like a wire protocol.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.920
 You almost might think of it as something like that

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.040
 that ties together these different front ends

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.080
 with Laravel on the back end.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.840
 But again, I'm not really the expert to talk to

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.920
 on how it works, but just that a large percentage

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.080
 of Laravel apps are written this way now.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.680
 - Okay, that's a pretty important part for me

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.560
 coming out from front end is that I want it

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.760
 to actually send the HTML for that combo box.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.120
 I don't want just like a div that's empty that then,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.320
 okay, JavaScript showed up.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.520
 I got like a spinner or I get layout shift

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.480
 or I got like, or JavaScript hasn't loaded yet

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.920
 and they like submit a quick little logarithm.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.080
 - No, it's not like that at all.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.080
 So it's not sending HTML of all your React components.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.600
 - I just know there's no layout shift,

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.640
 there's no loading, there's no weird stuff like that.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.880
 - So that would require a node process though

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.040
 on the back end somewhere.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.600
 - Yeah, yep, correct.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.640
 - Okay, so inertia.js, if you want to get HTML rendering

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.120
 of your front end, you're gonna plug in

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.400
 some kind of node React request handler.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.760
 - There's a console command like artisan inertia colon SSR

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.640
 which starts off like a node process

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.320
 that does server-side rendering and all of that.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.200
 And then it all just like works automatically.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.400
 You still return the same thing from your controller

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.600
 and inertia will handle like rendering that

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.920
 using that node process.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.760
 - That's interesting.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.960
 - Yeah, it's probably like Astro in a lot of ways

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.800
 where it's just doing the rendering part

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.080
 but the actual framework doesn't matter.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.680
 - On Forge, we actually don't even use

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.680
 the server-side rendering

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.160
 because it all works fine actually without that.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.800
 If you don't care about kind of not sending HTML

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.320
 to the client like fully rendered.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:24.240
 So I have a personal gripe with what happened in my career.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.560
 - You don't have a Lambo?

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.960
 - Well, I should sell that guitar

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.560
 and then we'll get like a really old 82

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.360
 or something that barely works.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.600
 I always felt like a full stack developer.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.320
 I liked, I liked, like I told it before,

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.800
 I even enjoyed setting up IP tables on my line-out VPS.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.040
 I ran a website from my office on like an old iMac

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.360
 for a while but I also care a whole lot

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.560
 about the user experience.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.760
 And in fact, I probably geek out a little bit more

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.200
 about the buttons and the styles

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.560
 and the like stripes checkout button

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.560
 where like the little word inside the button

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.240
 is animating in with the spinner

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.520
 and then like it animates out, right?

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.160
 Like that kind of stuff is so much fun to me.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.560
 I ended up at a startup a long time ago

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.400
 and because I was super interested

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.800
 in building a great user experience,

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.400
 I just kind of got pushed more and more

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.760
 and more and more away from the server.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.880
 And this happened across the whole industry

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.560
 where you end up with these two teams eventually.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.720
 You got the backend team and you got the front end team

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.680
 and you click going to lunch with some of your friends

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.040
 'cause you just go to lunch with the front end team

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.160
 and apps started to get really crappy.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.800
 Loading spinners, content shift, like there's just a mess.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.960
 And then I need to take no offense to designers

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.720
 but like a lot of designers started to write

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.160
 a little bit more code too without,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.600
 this is going to sound totally wrong or rude

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.840
 but like not as much programming experience

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.760
 and a lot more just slap a thing together

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.600
 because it looks great.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.200
 And I'm one of those people too.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.000
 So how dare you, Brian, how dare you?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.040
 Someone who has been quietly canceled over stuff

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.000
 I didn't do, I'm very careful now.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.400
 Anyway, so I hated that split.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.160
 The architecture you're describing continues

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.320
 to I think create that kind of a split.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.160
 And I think the best user experiences are built

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.480
 by people who like can cross over that line really well.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.840
 And when it's like, oh, inertia is going to render

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.320
 the React app for you.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.880
 So put all the weirdo front end people over there

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.760
 and all of us real programmers who have CS degrees

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.520
 or whatever and talk to databases, we're going to go do this.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.160
 And I hate that split both on a personal level

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.400
 and I think it's made websites a lot worse.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.480
 Like I should not log into my bank

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.480
 and it's making a bunch of fetches to some JSON endpoint

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.360
 and like bouncing spinners all over the place.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.920
 You know, do you feel that at all or?

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.760
 You know, I don't know.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.800
 I think the Laravel ecosystem is sort of unique

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.840
 where most of the developers building Laravel apps

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.360
 I think would truly consider themselves full stack developers

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.080
 mainly just because of the historical context

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.440
 of Laravel being geared towards like bootstrappers,

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.480
 people that want to launch things

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.360
 and kind of have to do everything themselves, you know?

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.840
 Obviously it's been adopted into larger organizations

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.520
 and enterprises and stuff, but just the vibe

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:29.520
 of Laravel has always been a toolkit for launching a product

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.600
 is quickly and efficiently and as high quality as possible.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.000
 So most developers kind of know view.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.800
 They may not be as good as like someone

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.520
 that's just a hardcore front end developer full time

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.000
 but they're serviceable, you know,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.360
 and view or react or something else.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.200
 - I think that's probably how most people would think

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.680
 of themselves in Laravel.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.520
 - Yeah.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.160
 - Something else I think kind of interesting to discuss.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.600
 I think DAX may have tweeted this is, you know,

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.920
 we mentioned that tools like Next and Remix

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.080
 kind of stop at that controller level

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.840
 and there's not a lot of like opinions or conventions

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.040
 beyond that as far as, you know, user roles,

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.400
 what database to talk to, how you're going to send email,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.160
 how you're going to do background work.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.880
 And I think it's the one brought up on Twitter.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.520
 It's not for like lack of trying.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.960
 Like people have tried to build those kinds of tools

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.560
 for JavaScript before and they just have never seemed

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.440
 to achieve any sort of critical mass.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.920
 And why do we think that it is, you know, like,

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.120
 is it just a cultural thing within JavaScript

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.840
 that it's just seen as better to like kind of roll

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.760
 your own way of doing things or what is it?

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.840
 - I got two thoughts on that.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.560
 I went for a run this morning so I gathered all my thoughts.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.240
 I got like a whole outline in my head.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.880
 The first is, and I've talked to Adam about this,

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.880
 there is no JavaScript community, like that doesn't exist.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.680
 JavaScript is this island because of the browser

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.560
 where every other community comes

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.680
 and just has a battle royale, right?

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.720
 It's like it's Fortnite for developers.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.560
 And so it's a lot of people are like,

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.800
 oh, how come the JavaScript community hasn't ever landed

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.640
 on whatever?

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.240
 It's like, well, 'cause I'm a real, I'm a, I'm Ruby.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.240
 Like, Remix comes from Ruby and Ember and PHP,

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.080
 Laravel people come in, that's Laravel coming

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.400
 into JavaScript and then someone's really interested

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.000
 in the front end and they start doing more of the React stuff

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.240
 and then maybe they start getting interested

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.800
 and then you start pointing at them like,

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.360
 oh, that developer is in the JavaScript ecosystem.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.360
 It's like, no, no, no, they came from Laravel.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.120
 So that's my first thing is it's like,

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.000
 it's just a big battle royale on the island of the browser.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.680
 And so, we're all coming at it from different angles.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.880
 I think one is kind of forming,

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.920
 but I don't think there is one.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.440
 So it's a lot easier for Laravel to build a community

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.480
 and PHP where everyone can look at Taylor

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.480
 and be like, yeah, we trust him or look at DHH

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.320
 and be like, yeah, we trust him.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.160
 We're gonna do this.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.400
 You get to JavaScript and it's like,

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.080
 which Ryan are you gonna listen to?

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:07.520
 The second thing is kind of what I was talking about

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.400
 before, how the industry has ended up

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.480
 with the split of backend and front end

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.080
 and like this jam stack wall in front of it

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.680
 that kind of showed up or in the case of Laravel,

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.440
 you got inertia that it's a great scene between that,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.720
 but like you're either writing PHP

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.840
 or you're writing React or Vue,

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.520
 but it isn't all Laravel, right?

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.960
 There's something that connects it

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.360
 and so it's very easy to split those two things up.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.040
 And so because we have that split,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.800
 you can't look at Laravel and Rails

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.640
 and JavaScript frameworks in like a snapshot

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.760
 in time of like right now,

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.400
 you have to take it all in context and be like, okay,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.720
 back when Rails was created,

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.920
 I don't even know when that was.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.960
 I felt like I was a little kid.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.360
 I don't even know if I had any kids yet

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.440
 and my daughter's almost 17.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.200
 Everyone was pretty much issues in MySQL

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.800
 or I don't know how to pronounce that.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.040
 I'm a front end developer.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.520
 And so it's like, yeah, we can build an arm on that

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.680
 and everyone can agree.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.480
 Today, there's eight million databases.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.480
 So if you kind of take the context of like, okay,

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:14.880
 in what environment were these JavaScript

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.360
 full stack frameworks created,

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.440
 people already have their 15 year old Rails app.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.800
 And we got this split, right?

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.240
 So that's the way the world looks today.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.240
 There's a split of front end and back end.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.600
 And so if people are like, you know what,

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.760
 we need to get back to server rendering this stuff.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.720
 You don't go back over to Rails and start doing that

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.880
 'cause then you're gonna lose all the combo boxes

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.000
 and all of the great UX that you did in React.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 You gotta figure out how to bridge that gap differently.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.680
 And so React apps are not looking for a database.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.080
 Maybe an indie developer who's like,

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.120
 oh, I wanna start my app with React like they would be.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.920
 But for the most part, the current state

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.080
 of web development is we've got these Rails apps,

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.960
 these PHP apps, they already have everything they need

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.280
 on the back end.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.840
 And so the React frameworks just need to cross that gap

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.360
 and then get them there and then it's like, okay,

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.080
 now go talk to your Rails app.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.480
 That's another reason why nothing ever really like sticks

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.480
 in the JavaScript community

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.880
 because they've already got the backend over there.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.160
 - So Ryan, what about you?

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.320
 Like a new project, you're building a new repax app

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.560
 or React router seven or whatever.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.640
 Like what do you like to use for mailers

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.200
 and databases and queues?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.120
 And like, is it all kind of patched together?

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.000
 Is there a go-to thing that you use?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 - My full-time job is work on a framework.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.520
 - Yeah, maybe a better question is like,

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.520
 what do you prescribe?

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.840
 Like if a remix user asks you like,

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.840
 is there a recommended thing for all those things?

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.320
 Or is it just sort of like,

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.800
 that is the stance of most JavaScript front-end frameworks

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.760
 is you get to choose?

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.360
 - Yeah, well, my first question to somebody,

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.200
 do you already have infrastructure?

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.640
 Like, do you already have the Rails app?

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.840
 Do you already have the Laravel app?

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.680
 Do you already have that stuff?

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.040
 And if they do, it's like,

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.960
 just deploy them on the same server

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.000
 and talk to them through HTTP and tell it to send an email

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.200
 for you or queue a job or something, right?

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.080
 But then from there, I think it's like,

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.200
 well, go look at, where do you intend to host?

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.480
 Are you hosting on CloudFlare?

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.520
 Are you hosting on Bursale?

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.080
 Are you hosting on Netlify on AWS?

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.360
 Especially AWS, they have everything you need there, right?

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.160
 And so it's like, well, use Cognito,

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.080
 use, I don't even know what they're all,

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.640
 use DynamoDB, like use the platform that you're on.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.440
 - Yeah, the infrastructure thing is interesting.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.320
 I think Bax, you need to talk about something here,

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.760
 I don't know, the timeline of like,

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.200
 how these things all evolved

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.680
 and how infrastructure has changed in the last five years.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.680
 - Yeah, yeah, so I think we, just from working on SST,

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.120
 I think we come across a portion of the community

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.560
 that's maybe not as visible,

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.800
 which is people building back ends with JavaScript.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.520
 So I think whenever we talk about

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.040
 people building JavaScript stacks,

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.360
 we always start with remakes and XJS,

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.680
 like just the front end portion of it.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.520
 But there are like, there is like a backend community

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.600
 that builds back ends in JavaScript.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.800
 And they might not even,

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.520
 and all these people don't know front end,

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.600
 like they're not even front end developers

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.480
 'cause if there is a split there.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.480
 So the question is, why do these people even exist?

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.840
 Like, why are they choosing to use jobs that are on the backend?

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.440
 The majority of them do not like JavaScript.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.040
 Like, that's not like their first pick.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.000
 They didn't start in JavaScript.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.040
 They come from other environments.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.640
 Myself personally, prior to,

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.840
 for me doing jobs on the backend started three years ago.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.640
 Prior to that was doing Elixir.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.720
 Prior to that was doing Go.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.680
 Prior to that was doing C#.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.000
 So what like made me end up in a language

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 that I don't even like that much on the backend?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.320
 It's specifically how infrastructure evolved.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.640
 I think there's a portion of people,

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.920
 like not everyone has to buy into this,

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.440
 but there are a portion of people

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.560
 that understand that if you commit to an environment,

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.840
 whether that's AWS or CloudFlare

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.520
 and you like do things exactly the way they want you to,

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.160
 there's a bunch of benefits from doing that.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.000
 Like, I haven't used DataDog

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.560
 or like had a monitoring service in years

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.200
 because I use like extremely managed services

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.720
 that scale themselves, model themselves, run themselves.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.680
 - A.J.'s and shambles.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.000
 - Well, it's our friend A.J. works at DataDog.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.280
 - To be fair, I did sign up for DataDog recently

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.240
 because it's the SSH app, that needed.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.240
 - He's backing up.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.920
 - That needed monitoring.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.840
 - But, mine is that one, everything I've built in the past,

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.920
 you know, three or four years just did not need

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.960
 the usual babysitting that I normally have to do.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.560
 And if you wanna make that trade off,

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.360
 these Cloud providers pretty much ask you to do JavaScript.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.000
 That's just kind of the reality of it.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.120
 Like, you can do other things, of course, on AWS.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.120
 You can write other languages,

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.240
 but the support for certain things just isn't there

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.440
 to the level it is in JavaScript.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.480
 And if you take something like CloudFlare,

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.400
 it's even more extreme, right?

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.960
 Like, you literally can't do anything else.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.400
 This is all a JavaScript native.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.800
 And they kind of, they gave this decision to you

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.960
 where if you accept these, like, pretty hardcore constraints,

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.280
 we can do all this stuff for you

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.720
 that you pretty much can't find anywhere else, right?

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.960
 So most of the backend community is reluctantly

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.080
 using JavaScript because they're committing themselves

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.840
 to this other thing.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.640
 And it's not that everyone has to, like, do that.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.000
 And it's definitely the way everyone has to go,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.680
 but there are just tangible trade-offs and benefits

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.520
 from doing that.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.800
 So the needs of this group of people

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.040
 is quite different than just cloning,

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.560
 like, what Rails, Phoenix, Laravel has,

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.960
 because a lot of the dynamics there are,

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.200
 we create this really nice bubble for you to live in.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.480
 And pretty much wherever you want to deploy,

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.200
 we'll give you a way to do that through adapters

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.400
 or whatever, like, you kind of just live

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.640
 in the Laravel bubble and you have to worry too much

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.400
 about where it eventually ends up going.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.200
 Whereas this is the opposite setup.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.000
 If I wanted something like that in JavaScript,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.280
 like, I just wouldn't, right?

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.360
 If I wanted something that was, like,

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.480
 a nice, full-featured, like, agnostic environment,

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.360
 I would just go back to using Elixir or whatever else.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.040
 So I think a lot of these frameworks are just kind of,

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.280
 like, one-to-one copy.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.080
 And I'm not, like, talking down in the middle,

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.520
 like, there's Adonis and there's, like,

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.400
 newer work with Redwood that are trying to hit

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.000
 in that direction.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.640
 I just don't think the market is there

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.120
 'cause no one is like, I absolutely love JavaScript.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.960
 I'm gonna write jobs in the backend no matter what.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.760
 I just want, like, a full framework for it.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.560
 That's at least my perspective on why I'm here

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.600
 and why a lot of the people that we, you know,

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.440
 work with are doing jobs in the backend at all.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.560
 - Are you saying there's no JavaScript community?

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.120
 (laughing)

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.160
 - Yeah, I mean, I agree with you.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.760
 It's like, we're all coming from something else

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.120
 for the most part.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.920
 I think there is, like, what gets confused is,

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.880
 I do agree with Taylor that there is a portion

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.880
 of these, like, indie hacker, indie maker-type people

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.560
 that are trying to do that type of thing

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.200
 in the JavaScript world.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.240
 And it's like, you can't start from,

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.760
 I'm, like, I'm definitely gonna build a React app

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.040
 and then, like, then I'm gonna figure out

00:28:59.040 --> 00:28:59.880
 everything on the backend.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.720
 Like, that's gonna be a tough situation

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.960
 and you either have to do, like, what me and Adam

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.280
 are doing to commit to infrastructure

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.920
 or pick one of these other options in different languages

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.080
 that are really geared towards that.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.960
 Like, that just doesn't, there's not really a market

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.080
 for that in the JavaScript space, like, that's how I feel.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.560
 - Yeah, that's interesting.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.800
 I mean, yeah, I mean, I think that's kind of, like,

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.320
 the summary of where I've been at the past couple of years.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.920
 Like, one of the people I talked to the most

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.360
 that I guess would be adjacent to the JavaScript ecosystem

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.520
 is Adam Wavin from Tailwind,

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.880
 who started in the Laravel ecosystem.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.320
 You know, and when we were looking at tools like Next.js

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.920
 or whatever else, it was just very hard for us to imagine

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.320
 how we would build something like, I don't know,

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.800
 any sort of, like, robust web app.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.920
 It could be, like, Laravel Forge, something like Basecamp,

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:51.200
 something like Linear, using, like, only these tools

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.160
 and those alone.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.720
 But I guess if it's like, sort of accepted

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.960
 that, like, of course you wouldn't do that,

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.800
 you would just call some Rails or PHP backend

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.120
 to do a lot of the, like, the back-and-heavy lifting

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:01.960
 than fine.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.320
 - Or what your host provides, yeah.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.400
 - Yeah.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.160
 But it just felt like a lot of, some of the messaging,

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.680
 I guess, was like, yeah, I guess just, like,

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.560
 almost like, Next versus Laravel.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.840
 Like, it's like a real alternative to that robust,

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.200
 full-stack experience when, you know, I don't know,

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.760
 it just didn't feel that way.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.000
 So we were, like, perpetually confused of, like,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.960
 how would we ever ship a product like this?

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.720
 But maybe we're just, like, kind of coming at it

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.240
 from the wrong angle, I'm not sure.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.200
 - So I will say, a big portion of what we do

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.280
 is help companies ship the front-end portion of it.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.840
 Very few of them is that thing, their whole app.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.320
 They have, like, a completely separate backend

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.040
 that does typical backend things.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.280
 They're also written in JavaScript,

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.600
 but to me, at least right now,

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.120
 and I don't see why this really changed.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.080
 Like, I don't see many projects,

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.920
 even early stage ones that are just, yeah,

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.360
 just this, my whole system, it just lives in this.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.200
 Next JS app.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.480
 - But on Twitter, you would think,

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.000
 it seems like Next JS is all you need.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 Like, you're good.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.240
 I mean, that's what VersaO would kind of make you think.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.400
 - I do think it comes across that way, you know,

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.760
 like, is VersaO written with Next JS?

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.680
 Like, I don't know, like, the whole app, you know,

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.920
 it seems unlikely, you know,

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.800
 I don't know that the whole, like, deployment pipeline

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.120
 is in Next JS app.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.040
 - It's up to, like, Kubernetes and stuff, right?

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.880
 - Yeah.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.960
 - Guys, I'm right here.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.800
 (laughing)

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.880
 - Oh, yeah, sorry, we have an ambassador

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.040
 from the JavaScript framework,

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.160
 but you're not even a framework anymore.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.400
 You're just like a library, right?

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.240
 - There's differences or something.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.840
 - We're talking about Next JS.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.160
 Like, saying over here.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.640
 Oh, yeah, yeah, no, that's a good point, yeah.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.520
 - In the beginning, Remix is the Next JS,

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.120
 and here we are talking about Next JS.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.280
 (laughing)

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.680
 And Next is in TypeScript, it's not even Next JS,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.760
 it's Next TS.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:47.600
 - I don't think--

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.080
 (laughing)

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.280
 - I don't think Remix is as big a fender as Next

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.120
 in that regard.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:53.960
 Like, I don't--

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:54.800
 - That's what I was gonna ask.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.560
 Like, Taylor, have you felt anything

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.080
 from the Remix community that's like,

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.000
 oh, we can totally, we're the whole stack for you.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.600
 - No, I don't really get those vibes.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.440
 I think that mainly seems to come from, like,

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.000
 Twitter is such like a weird place,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.080
 disconnected from reality.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.240
 But like, the vibes I get are that like,

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.600
 all you need is Next, and it's mainly from that community.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.440
 - Yeah.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.280
 - I don't know, so that's the main vibe I get.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.080
 Dax, like, on the back end JavaScript,

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.600
 like, what's kind of the thing there these days?

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.280
 Like, is it Express JS, or is it something,

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.200
 like, what are they calling?

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.520
 - I was gonna say, it's like Cloudflare,

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.080
 you put a bunch of files in a folder,

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.400
 and they call 'em, right?

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.320
 Like, you don't really--

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.080
 - There isn't, there's a spectrum here.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.080
 So if you're like, infrastructure heavy, right?

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.480
 So let's take AWS, you use something called API Gateway,

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.760
 which is a router that's like a service.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.680
 So you're not like, you don't need something to route

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.720
 in your application level to handle the infrastructure level.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.120
 It's a bunch of benefits from that.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.280
 I actually don't like that much,

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.680
 'cause I don't like that specific service.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.200
 - And does that route to like a Lambda

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.400
 that's running some JavaScript?

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.760
 - Yes, one or many Lambdas,

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.520
 you can also tell it, here's the schema that I expect,

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.280
 and it'll do validation before it even hits your code.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.960
 So obviously, you're paying less for that.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.960
 It's written in a really efficient language.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.880
 There's a bunch of benefits to doing that stuff.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.160
 Again, I personally don't love that,

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.680
 but there is a section in the AWS community

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.760
 that like really takes advantage of those primitives.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.080
 - It goes even further, right, Dax?

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.320
 Like the more extreme example would be like step functions

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.000
 where you're not even writing loops anymore or like--

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.960
 - Traditional code, yeah.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.440
 - Yeah, back off mechanisms.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.440
 All this stuff is like in the infrastructure,

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.120
 and you're writing these tiny little,

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.720
 if you're even writing any JavaScript,

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.640
 you're writing these tiny little functions

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.000
 that do single purpose stuff.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.520
 So there's like this very extreme case

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.000
 where people think you should take advantage

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.600
 of the extremities of AWS.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.360
 - It's like AWS becomes your programming language

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.600
 in a lot of ways.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.720
 Like I said, I don't know if that,

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.760
 there are a lot of companies that are super into that model

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.640
 and they built big complex things with it

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.160
 and then they make it work.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.440
 It just doesn't click for me personally

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.120
 'cause I like programming languages

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.520
 and I don't wanna get away from them so much.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.720
 Then you take something like Cloudflare,

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.880
 which is a little bit kind of in between.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.400
 They don't provide you as much,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.680
 and you're still running like your application codes

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.880
 doing the routing.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.000
 And there you have some options like HONO,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.160
 which is like, it's very much like express,

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.000
 but just runs across all these different places

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.040
 and takes advantage of the infrastructure-specific details

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.200
 that exist there.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.360
 But yeah, beyond that,

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.680
 you just don't need as much application stuff.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.160
 Like wherever you end up falling on this spectrum,

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.240
 you just don't need it.

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.280
 If the services are designed, well,

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.120
 and you wanna use it.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.760
 - Ignoring the marketing that feels one way or another

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.200
 from Versailles and Next,

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.120
 where we're coming from remixes,

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:34.200
 it's like we recognize that there is this

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.160
 different way to deploy apps

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.320
 and that there are these infrastructure companies now

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.640
 that have all of this stuff for you.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.880
 So it's like, we're not gonna show up and be like,

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.720
 hey, guess what?

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.720
 Yeah, deploy this to...

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.080
 I forgot what the name is.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.400
 Not Heroku, the other one.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.000
 A digital ocean droplet like that's how remix works.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.960
 It's a node process.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.240
 If we were just a node process,

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.600
 then yeah, we could do a whole bunch of the,

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.800
 we could do a bunch more abstraction for people,

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.880
 but we were born in a different era

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.720
 where all this infrastructure exists

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.320
 and people's own personal infrastructure also exists.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.840
 So it's definitely different target audiences

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.840
 that I think we're going for.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.200
 - Yeah, and I think a lot of this stuff,

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.600
 I think people look at it externally

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.320
 and it feels like it should be able to be replicated,

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.080
 but since the other day,

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.720
 where there's brief moments of time

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.240
 and there's like comes down to like singular individuals

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.400
 seeing something and executing it on it well.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.040
 And I think a lot of what we're seeing with Laravel today

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.920
 is a result of some decisions you made 10 years ago

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.240
 that were correct that are just panning out now, right?

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.520
 So it's really hard to like exactly recreate it

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.800
 'cause there's just sort of brief moments

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.200
 where everything aligns and there's the right environment,

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.560
 there's a right appetite for something,

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.120
 there's the right opportunity to the right people leading it.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.240
 Yeah, these things are kind of like miracles to me

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.600
 when they actually pan out.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.120
 So it's hard to recreate.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.760
 - Dude, in Laravel, oh my gosh, dude,

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.320
 I have so much respect for what you've done, Taylor.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.800
 When we started Remix, it was like,

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.520
 VCs wanted us to be versatile.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.720
 Everyone was trying to give us money

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.760
 'cause like, oh, we missed out on them,

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.960
 so maybe we can give it to these guys.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.600
 We didn't really wanna do that.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.680
 We were probably going to do something

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.680
 a lot more like what you did.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.840
 I love when you go to Laravel and it's like community

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.680
 and you click and it's like, here's 18 things right here

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.920
 that are gonna like solve the problems

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.200
 that your app actually needs to solve.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.640
 That's before we open source and stuff.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.280
 That's kind of what I was imagining we would do.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.960
 So huge respect for what you've done.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.680
 I have a little bit different topic I wanna bring up

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.960
 if everybody is ready to move on from this.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.800
 - Yeah, let's do it.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.040
 - I think JavaScript frameworks are the only ones

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.760
 in position to be the fullest stack.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.140
 - Keep going. - Interesting.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.160
 (laughing)

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.360
 - I think I agree, but I'll let you continue.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.360
 - Like we talked about before,

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.720
 there's this line between like,

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.120
 I'm writing the PHP and now I'm writing

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.920
 the JavaScript side of the app, right?

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.840
 React server components that we've been excited about

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.600
 the whole time, but also critical of as we're doing it

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.200
 because a lot of what React is doing

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.760
 is creeping into the remix problem space,

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.320
 which we're fine now.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.200
 Anyway, nobody cares about the React stuff in here.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:16.320
 But what it does, it's dissolving the network, right?

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.280
 You got your back end code,

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.120
 you got your front end code

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.120
 and then there's like a network in between there.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.440
 Prime example of this is if you're always rendering

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.760
 on the server, the hey calendar.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.080
 If you go to the hey calendar,

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.920
 I don't know if any of you've played with it,

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.280
 but there's so much-- - It is slow.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.480
 - In every single user interaction.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.320
 - Yeah, it's not good.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.480
 - It's not good, inertia is super cool

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.120
 because it lets you render that stuff on the server.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.280
 But so we'll go back like a step even farther back

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.480
 that I think isn't good with Rails.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.840
 And it's like the calendar pop up

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.960
 is was the first thing I noticed.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.040
 When you click on a day to like get the calendar pop up,

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.520
 there's latency there because they gotta go to the server,

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.920
 render the HTML and then send it back, right?

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.480
 And then we drag events back and forth.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.360
 You drag it, let go, and then it pops back

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.000
 exactly where it was.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.120
 And then after the network's done,

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.600
 it shows up over in the new spot.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.600
 So these problems, you have to render in the browser, right?

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:16.280
 So you've got to have a JavaScript template somewhere

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.400
 that when you click the button,

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.440
 you can just tell the browser render this thing.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.280
 We used to like send hidden divs

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.320
 and like show like pop them up and stuff.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.800
 Like I think everyone is kind of beyond that phase of it

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.480
 with all the problems that it caused.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.600
 And so that movement of like, okay,

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.240
 this interaction, the latency's bad.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.040
 We need to render this in the browser.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.040
 With inertia and Laravel and React,

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:44.040
 you're gonna move that pop up from PHP over to React, right?

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.520
 You know, you're gonna cross that gap

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.000
 and now the person in charge of that

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.640
 is the guy who went to eat at McDonald's for lunch

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.280
 instead of the guy who went over to wherever else, right?

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.840
 But it's now a different team in charge of that template.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.120
 Or just in your own mind, you're an individual.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.520
 - I would like to believe

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.560
 if I could get DHH to try inertia,

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.240
 he would just delete Hotwire.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.060
 (all laughing)

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.120
 Because I think I do think like he's,

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.360
 it's holding Rails back.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.360
 And I loved DHH is my hero.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.920
 And I hate to say it pained me to say this,

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.240
 but it's holding Rails back and you can,

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.200
 hey, calendar is a perfect example of how

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.860
 and why it's holding Rails back.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.960
 - It's an amazing product.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.220
 The team there is so good at building great products.

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:36.220
 But the UX, it seriously feels like I woke up in 2010

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.720
 and it's like, what is this?

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.360
 Like this is crap, like go use linear

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.400
 and you'll see what is possible now.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.280
 And they're just still, anyway.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.680
 It's, I feel the same way.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.960
 - Dax just perked up, linear mention.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.560
 - I'm glad someone else brought it up and down.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.040
 (all laughing)

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.640
 - I feel like it's like, I don't know.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.840
 Yeah, it hurts me.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.960
 It's like Michael Jordan, when he played for the Wizards,

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.020
 like it's just, I don't know.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.860
 (all laughing)

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.760
 It's just, I don't know, it's not good.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.080
 And if I could get him on inertia,

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.360
 I just feel like he would see the light, you know?

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.160
 - Yeah, so I think inertia is a great step

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.600
 in the right direction.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.760
 But you still have to like,

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.680
 you still have to constantly make this decision

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.560
 of like, is this a thing that I do in Laravel,

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.960
 in a PHP template or is this a thing

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.360
 that I move over to the JavaScript app, right?

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.600
 And that, for an individual, that is a lot of friction.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.760
 And for a team, that's enormous friction to the point

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.480
 where like, they might not even deploy these things together.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.960
 How is someone, a designer going to be like,

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.680
 "Hey, this interaction sucks, let's fix it."

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.840
 And it's like, okay, let's get two product managers

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.080
 in the room and let's get the team lead of each of these

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.280
 and let's figure out how to move this template

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.120
 from PHP over to JavaScript, right?

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:56.440
 And so, what React, what we've been doing with Remix

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.920
 and now what React can do on its own,

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.760
 I think is so interesting with the use client directive

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.040
 for a React component.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.400
 You can have that calendar pop up

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.720
 and it's just rendered on the server

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:13.800
 and you can click on click, go fetch that RSC stream

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.640
 and then hand it back to React and it'll render it.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.360
 And it's a really easy little one-line thing to do

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.800
 and you're keeping rendering on the server.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.640
 And then you're like, you know what?

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.000
 This interaction sucks, let's get rid of the latency

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.880
 and let's move the template to the browser.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.480
 You literally just put use client

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.680
 at the top of that thing of the module.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.160
 That's it.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.400
 And now that is part of the JavaScript bundles

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.760
 and then when you click, you just say

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.040
 set state open true or whatever, right?

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.360
 And now boom, it's there.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.640
 That's what I mean by like, we're dissolving the network

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.400
 in a way that I don't think you can do

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.200
 with any other framework than a JavaScript framework

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.000
 because your template never has to really change.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.960
 You just put use client at the top

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.720
 and you can teleport it over the network now,

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.040
 which I think is super interesting.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.160
 So that's what I think all of us weirdos

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.680
 over in this React world are doing.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.840
 I know that it's really easy to look at from the outside

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.280
 and be like, what kind of Rube Goldberg machine

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.200
 are those weirdos making?

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.320
 But like, that's it.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.040
 I want that hate calendar pop up

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.680
 to be rendered in the browser,

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.840
 drop a use client at the top.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.040
 That's it.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.920
 I think it's super compelling.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.720
 And with that, thanks for coming to another episode

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.800
 of tomorrow with them.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.120
 (laughing)

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.120
 - When do you think like, I mean,

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.920
 JavaScript's been around a long time.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.920
 When will it, if ever have sort of the robust full stack

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:39.440
 product building tool to match something

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.360
 like Rails from 2006?

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.960
 - So this is what I think is, yeah.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.080
 So I think that this is where I get really excited

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.520
 'cause I'm like, okay, all of us weirdos in React.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.560
 We're like, we're solving this really, really weird

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.000
 difficult problem of dissolving the network

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.720
 that I think a lot of other people are like,

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.760
 ah, whatever, it doesn't matter.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.720
 Just like move it over through inertia,

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.640
 put it over in React app.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.680
 Like just keep doing that.

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.920
 But we're like obsessed with this.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.760
 Like, no, we're going to fix,

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.360
 we're gonna change this thing.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.800
 Once we get that done,

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.960
 once we're done just hyper focusing on this,

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.640
 like crossing that network gap,

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.720
 we've been doing delayed jobs and mailers

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.720
 and databases for decades now.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:21.120
 So I think, I think in the next few years

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.840
 in the React ecosystem, you're gonna see an explosion

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.440
 of amazingly composable backend functionality

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.940
 that is just so easy to add to an app.

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.760
 Like easier than Rails or Laravel

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.360
 or any other non-JavaScript thing.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.440
 We're not there yet 'cause we're just so hyper focused

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.920
 on this one problem.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.600
 But I think we're gonna be able to backfill that stuff

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.160
 really fast and they'll be platform specific.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.560
 It'll be like, this is for SST and AWS or CloudFlare

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.960
 or your own node process or Prisma,

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.080
 Mailgun, whatever, right?

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.080
 We got that kind of stuff.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.600
 I think it'll fill in quickly.

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.520
 - I think the other dynamic that is annoying

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.720
 but does have a big impact is jobs

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.000
 we did have a reset with TypeScript.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.680
 I know like it's just effectively a linter

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.880
 at the end of the day, but it did change a lot of things

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.280
 and there's so many versions of TypeScript

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.720
 before it became what's concerned modern TypeScript.

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.080
 I would say 4.0 plus is when it was like,

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.800
 okay, this is like, now we get it now.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.800
 But when I say we get it, it also took a couple years

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.520
 for people to really get it and for libraries

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.000
 to pop up really taking advantage of TypeScript correctly

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.840
 so that the end user isn't bogged down

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.400
 by all the concepts of types and everything.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.600
 And I think in the past year, I feel like

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.040
 there's finally like enough understanding around these things

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.760
 that we're seeing libraries and tools come out

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.920
 that properly do stuff.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.320
 So this is like a big reset.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.800
 There's also a whole like stupid things

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.360
 like the CJSSM thing.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.280
 Like there's a lot of like dumb,

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.400
 like historical bad decisions problems

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.360
 that the ecosystem is just saddled with.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.240
 And these are all just headwinds that do exist.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.640
 And there's like a way out of it,

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.880
 but that kind of explains why it seems like

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.080
 it's taking forever.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:02.920
 - Makes sense.

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.400
 But before we move on past that one,

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.240
 I guess everything you said, Ryan,

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.880
 about you guys all obsessing about

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.600
 the dissolving the network and all that stuff,

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.960
 once you figure that out and you guys like,

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.640
 you crack the code and it's all done,

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.800
 could Laravel just like use that?

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.880
 Like instead of inertia, could there be a third option

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.520
 where like Laravel bolts on all this decade

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.160
 of backend stuff and says,

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.920
 well, now we're gonna use that cool thing

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.880
 on the network dissolving thing.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.200
 - And that will always be a part of the React world

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.640
 or the front end jobs for framework world.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.640
 Like they're like butcher box,

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.080
 they're not gonna go back to Shopify.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.520
 We've got a five million line React app.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:45.120
 And I don't know, it's like 15 million line rails app behind it.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.000
 No one's gonna move that to node.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.840
 (laughing)

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.880
 That is what it does for a very, very long time.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.000
 - Yeah, most backends are not

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.440
 and it's gonna be the case forever.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.960
 - But yeah, I think what you'll see is

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.080
 you'll get rid of all the templates

00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.640
 from that backend framework.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:03.040
 Like you're not gonna do any rendering with that thing.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.080
 There's just gonna be in your server components,

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.200
 you're just gonna be talking either through the local network

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:11.040
 or in some cases you'll go straight to the database.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.720
 Oh, but yeah, it's designed for that, I think, Adam,

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:17.200
 to, that's why we don't prescribe the backend stuff

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.960
 'cause it's like we wanna work with your existing backend.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.520
 - You know that Blitz.js thing, do you all remember that?

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.360
 - Yeah.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.480
 - I mean, I guess the website is still up.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.920
 Do you think, I mean, that's an example of someone

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.680
 that tried to sort of bring this missing full stack toolkit

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.920
 or whatever, in their words, to a next JS?

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.880
 And do you think that didn't really take off

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.320
 kind of going back to what you said, Dax, about like,

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.120
 people just don't, there's just not a market

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.920
 for people looking for this, like in JavaScript.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.240
 - Yeah, I think there's, there's just, again,

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.040
 with all these things, there's so many variables,

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.400
 like time, place, people, all of it.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:52.800
 Blitz, let's say, let's take for granted that they did want

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.040
 to, like people did want it and there was value.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.320
 And I know a lot of people did use it.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:02.080
 But what hurt them a lot was next JS evolved really rapidly

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.320
 and they were building on top of a framework

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.160
 that they didn't really control or like, you know,

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.000
 have influence on and they were constantly chasing

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.600
 breaking stuff and they had to like tap into next

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:16.320
 in ways that I imagine the next developers don't tear out,

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.160
 actually.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.000
 - Oh yeah, did they?

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.200
 - Yeah, he eventually forked it

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:23.160
 and that'll kill any communities, like trust in it, right?

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.320
 Like, oh, you forked next?

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.160
 All right, never mind.

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.000
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.840
 - I mean, we get that with Remix where it's like,

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.920
 oh, next has a couple of people

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.440
 from the React core team working on it.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:36.000
 Therefore, it's the only one that you should use.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:36.820
 - It's more pure.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:43.560
 Yeah, so it's just, it's really hard in this space to,

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:48.200
 like, I think what's in all these other spaces,

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.800
 someone dominant kind of emerged,

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.920
 some dominant framework, something,

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.600
 they reach a level of dominance.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.920
 What really kills you is if you bet on something

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.920
 that fails to reach that.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.080
 Because if a bunch of people use Laravel

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.760
 and Laravel didn't become as big as it is today,

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.280
 you're in like a horrible place.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.600
 And I think in the JavaScript space,

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.560
 it's like, because of what Ryan said,

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:13.000
 there's so many different communities in it.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.200
 It's really hard to achieve deep dominance.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.040
 It's really hard to like deliver something great

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.600
 when you don't really have full attention

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.800
 of everyone in this space.

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:26.080
 And the other thing with Blitz is it's very geared

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.840
 towards people trying to have,

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.880
 next day has to be their whole system,

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.540
 which, you know, they're just, it's tough.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.760
 So that's like a very small market.

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.000
 And there's existing backend,

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.480
 there's people that don't want to write

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:40.080
 jobs on the backend, all kinds of reasons.

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.200
 But I actually think everyone would be happy with this future

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:47.440
 where if Remix solves this really nicely,

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.160
 this whole problem of get the data, render something,

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.840
 deliver it to the end user,

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.680
 but then have a really snappy feel on the app

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.960
 and you actually use it.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.480
 And everyone can just use that, like Laravel can use it,

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.320
 Phoenix can use it, like everyone can just tap into that.

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.560
 That kind of nicely splits the responsibilities, right?

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.840
 Where you guys don't have to try to resolve that,

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:08.800
 you can just use it,

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.800
 which I guess is like the idea behind inertia to begin with.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.720
 Like we're not trying to build the competitor react,

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.640
 we can just tap into everything that they do.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.520
 - Yeah, the difference is probably that the requests

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.800
 come to Remix at that point.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.920
 And then Remix calls out to Laravel to get the data,

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.760
 instead of Laravel handing the requests

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.520
 and then calling out to node to render, right?

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.360
 - Yeah, right.

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.680
 - Yeah, that would be pretty sweet.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.520
 - Yeah.

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.340
 - Yeah, I mean, it would work with inertia too.

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.680
 I would imagine anyway, I'd be surprised if it didn't.

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.640
 - Taylor, what do you want to see

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:40.280
 from the Remix community on Twitter?

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.680
 - I think we need to do better on, at least on our side,

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.160
 we've made small attempts at this with Next,

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.720
 but we should probably look at Remix too,

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.880
 of like how to best pair these technologies, you know?

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.100
 Whether that be, I know this is kind of on trend right now,

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:59.600
 but starter kit, starter kit for, you know,

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.780
 because when you said you've got someone pairing

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:04.360
 a Laravel back in an a Remix front,

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.200
 and I was just actually very curious to see

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.920
 like how that all works together,

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.320
 how the authentication works,

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:12.440
 how they talk to each other, how they structure all that,

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.840
 because I actually don't have a great idea

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.480
 in my head of what that looks like,

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.680
 just 'cause I'm not a super expert, you know,

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.000
 front end developer.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.360
 I think we just need to do better about educating people.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.440
 - They're an awesome team.

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.360
 I can put you in contact with them,

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.360
 and I'm sure they would love to chat with you about it.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.680
 I worked with them,

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.440
 I was having like bi-weekly meetings with them

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.240
 as they were moving over to Remix for a little while.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.240
 Yeah, though, they would love to talk to you, I'm sure.

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.480
 - Yeah, because like I said, I've always been very,

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.920
 I like JavaScript fine, I like view, I like React,

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:45.840
 so I would actually like to flesh out our just kind of

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.840
 documentation and educational material

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.840
 about how to pair some of these frameworks like Remix

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.000
 with Laravel in the most sensible and like productive way,

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.600
 'cause I haven't seen a lot of that out there.

00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:59.200
 - Yeah, yeah, that'd be cool.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:02.960
 - The other thing is any backend can return

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:06.120
 like an RSE stream hypothetically, right?

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.680
 Like technically you could have that stream coming

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.080
 from a Laravel application, I don't know if it makes sense,

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.560
 but my understanding is it's possible.

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.240
 - So yeah, yeah, so that's actually interesting, right?

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.120
 Are you kind of talking about like,

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:23.120
 I wrote a Laravel component, it's in PHP.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:26.120
 Like I didn't write any JavaScript,

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.600
 I wanna build this whole thing with PHP,

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:33.600
 send some sort of PHP thing through the RSE wire format

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.600
 and then dump it in the page.

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:42.600
 So the trick there is how do you turn your PHP module

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:47.200
 into a JavaScript module for the browser, right?

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:51.560
 Because if you're gonna do the proverbial counter button,

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.920
 right, and you're gonna click that thing

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.680
 and the count's gonna go up and it's 100% just in the browser

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:00.280
 or the pop up on the hey calendar,

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.360
 how do you convert that PHP template to a JavaScript template?

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:05.160
 So I don't know if that's Wasm

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:08.160
 or it fits a crazy PHP transform.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.680
 - Everyone says Wasm everything.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.040
 Wasm was supposed to fix every problem for the last 10 years

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.920
 and it's the only thing about using it nowadays.

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:19.360
 - But reason ML, did you guys ever look at--

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.200
 - I love reason.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.200
 - Yeah, so Jordan Wock made React

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.520
 and then he went and made Reason ML

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:29.520
 and it compiled down to React components.

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.640
 So totally different language.

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.200
 So I mean, it should be possible,

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.640
 but that would be the trick.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.640
 And maybe that's what you're asking more earlier, Adam,

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.800
 of like, can't you just use RSC in Laravel?

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.520
 Yeah, if you build a thing that can,

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:45.480
 if you build an API and PHP of like,

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.800
 here's what a component looks like

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:50.920
 and then you build some sort of compiler

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.600
 that can turn that into a JavaScript module

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:58.840
 that then targets the React runtimes like you stayed

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.080
 and use effect and all that kind of stuff,

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.880
 you could totally do that.

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:03.840
 That'd be super cool.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.680
 - Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.400
 I like how throughout this entire discussion,

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.400
 we just sort of taken for granted the PHP's a serious language

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.040
 that people should be using.

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.120
 - We're just funny.

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.120
 (laughing)

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.000
 - We never stopped even questioning that

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.480
 from first principles or anything.

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.480
 (laughing)

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.320
 - Is that what you expect?

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.960
 - Thank you all and appreciate that.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.000
 (laughing)

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.240
 - Michael and I always say that we've just been chasing

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.360
 that PHP high our whole careers.

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.200
 - Like math.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.520
 - Yeah, when React people are like,

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.200
 this is like PHP, like we mean that

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.000
 as endearingly as possible.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.840
 (laughing)

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.080
 - I've definitely heard you, Taylor.

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:42.800
 I've heard you like say derogatory things about PHP

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.040
 and I can tell you've got more to say on that front.

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.880
 - No, I mean, I like PHP fine.

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.840
 Like it's not like the prettiest,

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.400
 most elegant language or whatever, but like it's fine.

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.240
 I'm only accidentally a PHP developer.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:57.600
 I started as a cobalt and C-sharp developer.

00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.600
 - Me and Adam also.

00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.480
 - Yeah, same.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.320
 Well, not cobalt. - Not cobalt.

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.320
 - C-sharp, no, no, sorry, thank you.

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.160
 (laughing)

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.000
 - C-sharp.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.680
 (laughing)

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.720
 - And I just wanted a way to build products faster

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.680
 and PHP was easy to throw up on a host.

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.400
 So I just created a framework for doing that

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.800
 and other people started using it.

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:15.960
 - That's interesting.

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.480
 Oh, that's super interesting.

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.840
 Because that's kind of what me and Dax were getting at

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:24.640
 of like, well, today AWS and Cloudflour

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.880
 are like these whole platforms, right?

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:29.200
 So like we're building a framework to take advantage of that

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.320
 where you're like, I want to like PHP hosting was super easy.

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.640
 You just throw the files up there

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.400
 and then the host knew how to do stuff.

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.240
 And yeah, that's interesting.

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.240
 - I mean, to be honest though, like,

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.160
 I feel like even that API gateway story

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.680
 and that Cloudflour stuff still sounds worse than Rails.

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.320
 Like, is that better?

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.240
 Like then just like building a Rails app?

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.280
 - Oh, the DX is absolutely worse, it's way worse.

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.120
 Yeah, it's way worse.

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.080
 - The DX is really bad.

00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:56.920
 It's immature.

00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:00.920
 We're at the point right before a DHH was like,

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:02.000
 I'm done with this crap.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.480
 Like let's make this good.

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:08.280
 Like, we're at that point still.

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.360
 The capabilities are there,

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.240
 but like piecing all together still totally sucks.

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.080
 - Yeah.

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:13.920
 So what is it unlocking then?

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.080
 Is it unlocking scale?

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.840
 Is it, what is it, what is it giving you?

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:22.240
 Reliable, it's just reliable or easy to run and scale up?

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:25.520
 - It's, I would say it's very low long-term ops.

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.600
 So I think typically when you were talking about building

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.840
 something from zero to one, it's not as fast.

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.160
 You're gonna go a little bit slower.

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.360
 But the number of surprises you'll run into

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.720
 week to week, month to month is a lot lower.

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.720
 You're offloading a ton of stuff that you wouldn't normally do.

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.600
 Like my team is three people.

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.240
 We have a ton of products that we run and maintain.

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.160
 One of them is a full-blown CI services.

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.960
 Like CI services are notoriously like annoying

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.760
 and difficult to run.

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.520
 But if you look at how we designed it,

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.200
 you would be like, why the hell did you guys build it

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.160
 in this like really weird way?

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.680
 It's 'cause we maximize this other property of like,

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.680
 this is the lowest overhead for us to run.

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.200
 So yeah, I think it's all about operations

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.760
 and reducing that.

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.280
 And like I said, you don't have to buy into that.

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.400
 And that's not like what everyone,

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.040
 that's not what everyone's like number one pain is.

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.720
 But for, let's say to make inside of people,

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.200
 that's kind of what they care about.

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.200
 - Yeah, makes sense.

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.840
 Lowest operational complexity, I guess.

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:19.680
 - Yeah.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.520
 - Or a pain.

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.480
 - And I agree that DX right now is not great.

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.160
 It is like I said, that zero to one,

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.640
 even just learning which one of these things to use,

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.480
 like how do I play them together?

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.440
 It is a long journey and it's way longer than it should be.

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.520
 But again, I think we're still like kind of early

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:38.440
 in that process.

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.880
 - So this is a slight, I don't know how much longer

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:44.280
 we wanna talk, but maybe a slight change of topic.

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.840
 Something I've thought about is, you know,

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.760
 when I first started building Laravel,

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.840
 I feel like the top of the web developer funnel,

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.400
 it was very common for people to enter

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.600
 web development through PHP.

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.160
 It was not definitely not rare, you know,

00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:59.120
 either through WordPress or some other framework

00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.040
 like Codeignite or like Ryan mentioned.

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.720
 - Kind of for Bluehost and they're like,

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.840
 which meant that incoming new developers

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:09.640
 to web development inevitably ended up learning things

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:13.000
 like SQL, some amount about how databases work,

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.680
 how sessions work, you know, like all of that stuff,

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.800
 more back in knowledge.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:21.360
 Whereas, you know, now it feels like the top of funnel

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.400
 for people coming into web development,

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.120
 at least again, from my perception on Twitter,

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.040
 seems to be almost exclusively JavaScript,

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:32.040
 typically through something like remix or next

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.840
 or solid or whatever these other,

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.360
 what other frameworks are out there.

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:39.040
 Do you all feel like that sort of like created

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:42.720
 a generation of new developers that is not as familiar

00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.760
 with backend web development as they should be?

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.800
 And is that a bad thing?

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.920
 Like, do you feel like most people coming

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:52.400
 to web development now know how to write SQL?

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.360
 Whereas that would be very common to know that,

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:56.040
 you know, 10 years ago.

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.720
 Whereas today, is that the case, do you think?

00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:58.880
 And is that bad, if not?

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.960
 - So this is like, this is like what I was saying earlier

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.600
 where I was like, I feel like sometimes people look at remix

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.200
 and put it in this lump of like,

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.920
 those kinds of developers that you're talking about

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.520
 or this top of that funnel and I'm like,

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:12.640
 no, no, no, no, no, we're with you on this.

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.800
 See, I generally would agree with everything you just said

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.600
 and remix is honestly kind of, I can't speak for everyone else

00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:22.200
 who's designed and built it, but for me personally,

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.720
 it was an answer to that.

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.760
 Back in, if Elon hadn't deleted my Twitter account,

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.480
 I could go pull up some old tweets.

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:33.400
 When we were about to launch remix,

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.120
 I started making a bunch of tweets about,

00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:39.200
 hey, remember HTML forms?

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.320
 Most of you probably don't even know what these do anymore,

00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:46.000
 like, and 'cause our whole mutation API

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.480
 was built around forms for both progressive enhancement

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:50.280
 and it's just a good API.

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.040
 And so I held a whole bunch of tweets

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.360
 like showing people how forms work

00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.120
 and tons of people don't even know.

00:58:55.120 --> 00:59:00.120
 So ignoring SQL, they don't even like three, four years ago,

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:04.880
 I was arguing with people not arguing and lightning,

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:07.400
 it looked like arguing, people that like forms

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.160
 actually cause a navigation.

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.440
 Like, there's this one guy where he was just like,

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.400
 trying to tell me that they don't cause a navigation,

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.320
 I'm like, dude, put a form in an HTML file

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.000
 and hit submit and watch the URL, it's gonna change

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.080
 and then click the back button.

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:25.800
 And so, yeah, there's a huge, and I think,

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:26.840
 this goes back to where I'm like,

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.480
 this kind of split happened where it was like,

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.200
 all right, people who kind of know HTTP in the web

00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:35.280
 and sessions and cookies and databases

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.880
 went over to lunch over here

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.680
 and then they had all the front end people

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:40.880
 go to lunch over here and yeah,

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.240
 this is kind of the funnel now.

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.200
 And I think that's, I personally think that is.

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:45.960
 - I don't understand it at all, I've talked about this.

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:48.680
 I don't like, I don't think there's anything more complicated.

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.120
 In terms of the number of concepts

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.480
 than like modern front end, I feel like

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:53.760
 we should start even simpler.

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.560
 Like people new to programming should be writing

00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:58.800
 like little CLI apps and they're just like taking input

00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.360
 and doing something with it and now putting it.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:04.400
 Like I just, to me, I can't think of a worse starting point

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.400
 in software development than being dropped into like,

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.520
 there's bundlers and there's TypeScript and EJS and CJS

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.600
 and whatever, like all that stuff.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.160
 I made one out of PJS and it was like,

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.000
 I feel like it's a lot, right?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.480
 Like to like figure all that stuff out.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.960
 - When you get an error and you got this discussing stack trace

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.480
 that's in the middle of the guts of React's render cycles,

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.840
 not even your code.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.680
 - Yeah.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.520
 - Yeah.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.680
 Back when I was at, so I spent a lot of time

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.080
 consulting prior to my current work

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.920
 and I felt like a lot of my job was making,

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.640
 helping people realize like programming could be fun.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.480
 'Cause a lot of them were just in these like nightmarish,

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.680
 entirely front end code bases that just did not,

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.160
 this weren't designed well and everything was difficult to do.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.560
 And anytime you built a feature,

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:50.760
 they were just trained to expect

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.000
 like every single thing to go wrong.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.880
 And like nothing can ever really work correctly.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.200
 That's kind of their perspective.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.720
 And showing them that, oh, like, you know,

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.000
 it doesn't really have to be like this.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.200
 That is like a very common thing.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.960
 And I think that might be, it's unfortunate.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.760
 I feel very lucky that I got started programming when I did

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:09.160
 'cause it feels like the world was simple.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.440
 It got more complex with me.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.520
 So I just learned like one new concept every couple months,

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:17.240
 whereas now it really feels like the entry point is,

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.120
 is quite difficult.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.560
 And maybe everyone always feels this way,

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.920
 but it really feels kind of crazy right now.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.880
 - I think user expectations are a lot different now

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.760
 than they were 15 years ago too, right?

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.240
 Like before it was fine when used like,

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.720
 do you remember Lighthouse, the Rails app

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.680
 for like issue tracking?

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.200
 It was just like, it looked like a straight up rail scaffold

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.600
 with a little bit of extra thoughts on it.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.400
 You'd fill out a form, you'd click submit,

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.320
 the browser would spin and then you'd go to the next page.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.960
 And then the other thought is, in the front end we're really,

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.320
 first of all, the platform's not designed

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.120
 for what we're trying to build in it, right?

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.240
 Like it's not designed for apps

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.680
 and we're trying to build apps in it.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.880
 And so that's already kind of a hostile environment.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.360
 And we're really on the front end

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:03.360
 trying to like, we're pushing the limits of it right now.

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.080
 So new developers getting dumped into like,

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.360
 I don't even know, like the,

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.040
 they're dropped right next to the dynamite

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.280
 where we're blowing up on mine,

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.480
 was like, oh yeah, we think that there's gold down there.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.680
 Instead of like putting them over

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.960
 on the monkey bars or something, right?

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:18.920
 Where it would be fun.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:24.560
 And so I think, I honestly think a lot of developers

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.760
 should start with Laravel.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.920
 They should start with Rails.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.520
 They should start with, without any front end anything,

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.640
 just do document requests, talk to a database.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.960
 Like you can build a product like that.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.600
 You don't need super high fidelity user interactions.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.160
 And so what I hope, what I hope we're doing

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.680
 in the React world over here,

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.920
 and tell you should know in the React world

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:47.040
 like it's, there's factions in here

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.920
 that like are always battling as well.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.000
 So like we aren't this big cohesive group.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.480
 But in the, right now I'm representing the React nation.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.000
 What I hope happens with what we're doing

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.240
 is that we can actually get back to like,

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.600
 you can use React in this really simple way, right?

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:09.600
 Imagine a React server component framework, a world

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.640
 where you don't even send any JavaScript.

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.240
 Everything is just a React component.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.240
 It just runs on the server.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.720
 You have no use client, you have no use state.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.200
 You don't have any fancy stuff like that.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.160
 Just forms and actions and data loading from a database.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.200
 I think, I think we're right,

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.080
 we're right up like to that line

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.480
 and we're just about to cross it to where,

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.640
 okay, everything can be simple again.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.400
 But yeah, we're pushing on that edge right now.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.240
 I think we're almost there.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.960
 - The one other thing that comes up is,

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.720
 again, like for the people that are trying to push,

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.960
 what can we do in the browser?

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.560
 Like how can we, there's kind of forever been this,

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.560
 at least for me, how can we make the web feel

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.680
 as good as a native app?

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.280
 And there's been people pushing that for a very long time.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.240
 There's no way to do that without writing a lot of JavaScript.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.040
 Everything from getting accessibility right,

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.920
 all the little details right.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.360
 Now taking advantage of like the browser storage,

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.960
 that's like critical for building anything

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.960
 that feels as good as linear.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.120
 That just makes you have to write a lot of jobs.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.800
 There's like no avoiding that.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.600
 Not every app needs to go to that degree.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.160
 I think it's productivity apps that people use every day

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.000
 for their work.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.520
 I think all of those should be going to that degree

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.080
 and I think a lot don't.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.560
 But that's maybe a small subset of what everyone works on.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.600
 You just can't avoid it.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.840
 So again, reluctantly doing this stuff,

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.600
 not because we enjoy it, but because it's the only way

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.840
 to kind of deliver a certain experience.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.320
 - There is no JavaScript community.

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.160
 - Right.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.360
 - That's what I think of it too.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.360
 That's why it all looks like such a mess

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:45.200
 is it's like we're trying to build really,

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.720
 really great user experiences

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.560
 and that requires a ton of JavaScript.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.400
 - I mean, that makes sense.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.520
 If everyone was going to build an app like that with Laravel,

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.680
 they would definitely choose inertia every time.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.640
 Like they would never try to do it with PHP

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.840
 or even with Live Wire.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.360
 I think if you're going to try to build something

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.680
 like as high fidelity as something like a linear

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.200
 or a real, a good calendar, you know,

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.840
 like you would always start with inertia.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.480
 I don't think any Laravel developer really

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.080
 would try to do otherwise.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.080
 - Have we said it all?

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:14.920
 - A little over time.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.400
 Any last thoughts anything we didn't get to?

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.720
 - Rhinas notes from his jog.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.240
 - I always have notes, man.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:24.120
 I'm coming to these unprepared.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:24.960
 I got a win.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.720
 (both laughing)

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:31.840
 No, no, I just, just huge respect for you, Taylor.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.280
 I absolutely love what you've done with Laravel.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:38.000
 And I, your target audience,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.200
 they should absolutely start with Laravel

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.200
 instead of a cobbling together,

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.240
 some crazy back end with remix.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.480
 100% I agree with that.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.320
 - Yeah.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:49.560
 - And we, like, as a C, we study the Laravel docs,

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:52.000
 a ton just to understand everything,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.760
 just from like taste to scope to how you communicate things.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.920
 So it's been a huge influence on us as well.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.000
 Obviously, for the reason I said,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.160
 we're not like trying to do exactly the same thing,

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:08.160
 but the goals of what you guys have done

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.280
 and are trying to do, definitely going to appreciate it.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.040
 - We should get a definition of full stack.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.120
 - Yes, a humble circle.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.080
 - I've talked way too much,

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.440
 so I'm not going to give the definition.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.000
 - I'm actually fine saying it just means the ability

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.880
 to run code on client or server,

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.960
 which I think honestly qualifies like, you know, remix

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.240
 and next, and those tools is full stack.

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:34.040
 I think like, I'm fine with that as like a definition.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.920
 - Are we losing batteries like clav on rails

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:41.040
 or something more, yeah, as something beyond that.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.520
 It goes deeper, one direction or the other.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.440
 - Yeah, and that's kind of why--

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.000
 - It's kind of like that definition.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.240
 - That's kind of why I brought the way it's all started

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.880
 because it really wasn't about that.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.520
 The original thing was like,

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.720
 this implication that we're about was bloated.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.440
 And, you know, there's an explanation for why the goal is there.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.520
 - I only responded to that because I saw Theo retweeted it.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:04.000
 And then I knew it was like, it had to be addressed at point.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.320
 - He's always like, oh, every single thing.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:10.560
 It's like a little like, oh, Theo involvement, of course.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.120
 (laughing)

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.840
 Oh, hang on, I got one more thing to say.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.280
 I have one more thing to say.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.760
 A little bit spicy.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.080
 My whole impression forever is that,

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.280
 and Adam, you got at this too.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.920
 We're like, the Laravel community is amazing.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.120
 They use tailwind and they don't talk about it.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.520
 (laughing)

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.320
 Everyone, it's like, it sounded like Laravel was like Canada.

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.760
 We're like, everyone is just so nice

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:39.720
 and so even Theo and nuanced and like this big kumbaya.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.200
 I got some like funny people in my replies

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.760
 with just a couple of things I said.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.280
 And I don't feel like I said anything spicy

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:49.680
 'cause I don't like, I have tons of respect for Laravel.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:54.240
 So anyway, I got lots of Laravel fans in my mentions

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.280
 that were not Canadian.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.800
 (laughing)

01:07:58.800 --> 01:07:59.840
 - In any sense of the term.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:00.680
 - Yeah.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.000
 (laughing)

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.120
 - Oh, you're not better than us.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.480
 (laughing)

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:10.480
 - Like you get pumped a little bit and it's just as bad

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.680
 as the JavaScript world.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.280
 (laughing)

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.440
 - No, yeah, that's probably true for sure.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.720
 (laughing)

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:17.560
 - We're all the same.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.480
 - Don't justify it from the worst.

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.680
 I will acknowledge I think the JavaScript community

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.720
 is the worst of the worst, but it's the worst.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.560
 - It's the worst.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.400
 (laughing)

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:26.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a agree.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.240
 - 100%.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.080
 - Well, the JavaScript community,

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.120
 does it even make sense to think that it would ever be

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.600
 like unified in the Ruby or the Rails

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.640
 or like Laravel sense?

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.680
 Well, that just like never.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.120
 - No, I argue more with the JavaScript people.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.840
 - Yeah, I argue more with the JavaScript community

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.440
 than any like any other community.

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.240
 Like I have more issues with what's happening internally

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.480
 than anything against some other thing.

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.640
 So yeah, I just don't think it's gonna happen.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.640
 We all come from too many different backgrounds.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.400
 - It's the island of the JavaScript browser.

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.600
 - It's a good metaphor.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.600
 It's a deadly island, violent, deadly island.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.600
 (laughing)

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.360
 - And even in the camps we're battling, it's crazy.

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:08.480
 - It's hilarious.

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.040
 (laughing)

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.040
 - It's good for people that are retired, I think,

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.560
 that are like kind of retired, I would say.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.560
 - Yeah, one day.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.480
 - It's not great place to spend if you're early in your career.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.120
 Just, it's a great place to waste time.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:19.960
 - All right, full stack.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.360
 You can run code in both places.

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.200
 - There you go.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.560
 And Laravel's battery is included.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.160
 - Makes sense to me.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.000
 - Okay.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.160
 Well, thank you both for joining.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.240
 - Thanks for coming, guys.

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.080
 - Yeah, I appreciate it.

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.280
 - Yeah, fun times.

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.120
 Thanks for having us.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.120
 - That's fun, sorry for having to push it back.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.760
 - No worries.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.280
 - Have a good time. Well, let's say we're gonna see Taylor

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:40.400
 in August officially in Dallas.

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.840
 We're super excited for that kind of getting planned.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.720
 - Why are you guys getting to go to another con?

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.320
 As total, as part of the coffee thing.

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.280
 - Oh, okay.

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:50.120
 - One's Laracon.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.360
 - August 27th and 28th.

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:54.320
 - I'll be camping with a bunch of kids.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.800
 - Us too.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.640
 - Getting.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.480
 (laughing)

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.760
 - I got to come down to like a React conference at some point.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.680
 It actually seems pretty lit at these conferences.

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.120
 I compared to a lot of other dev conferences.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.360
 (laughing)

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.040
 - Yeah, the React mining one especially,

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.400
 it's like, it's so loosely tied to React.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.640
 - Yeah, the React's mining is just like,

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.880
 it has nothing to do with React.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.440
 It's just a big like party.

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.280
 - Yeah.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.640
 - I'm coming to that next year for sure.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.480
 - Yes.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.080
 - That'll be great.

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:22.920
 - I'll be there.

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.280
 So we'll finally meet, that'll be great.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.120
 - Yeah.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.320
 The percentage of people that go to React

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.040
 mine me that don't use React is just increasing

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.320
 every single year, so we got to keep that going.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.320
 (laughing)

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.160
 - Yeah.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.040
 - All right, well, thanks everyone.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:35.880
 You wanna end the recording on it?

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.720
 - See you guys.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.640
 What'd you say next?

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:38.920
 You wanna end the recording?

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.640
 - Oh yeah, yeah, that's a great way to end it.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.200
 I'll click the button that ends the recording.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.780
 (upbeat music)
