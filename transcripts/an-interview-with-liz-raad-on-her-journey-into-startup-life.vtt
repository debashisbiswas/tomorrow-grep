WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 $10,000 for a goatee. No. No. I'll take that money and I'll go stay at a hotel while I

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.400
 wait for it to grow bad. Is that bad for you? It's like a different person. It's like a

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:38.600
 stranger man in my house. A stranger man.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:47.760
 So today we have a guest. Our guest today is Liz Red, who I'm married to, but more importantly

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.960
 she is a founder and has been in tech for a while. And unlike most of the people we talk

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.240
 to, she's not an engineer. So she does everything else besides that. And she listened to the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.400
 podcast that the episode me and Adam had about being a founder.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.400
 The startup one. The startup one, right? And she said, it was pretty good, but you guys

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.520
 didn't talk about any of the good stuff. I was like, okay, then you come on and you talk

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.440
 about the good stuff. Just so everyone has a little bit of context, give us a little bit

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.800
 of background on yourself and like how you got into tech and so I'm not an engineer, but

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.520
 I'm also not originally a tech person or a startup person or a business person. I wanted

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.040
 to be a therapist. I wanted to be a psychologist, I think because I just wanted therapy. So

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.800
 I studied that in college and then I ended up kind of working in a couple of research

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.600
 labs because everybody was like, well, if you want to be a therapist, you need research

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.520
 experience, you need research experience, whatever. So I did that and ended up liking

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.560
 that a lot more. So I remember a while there, I was like, I want to be a researcher. And

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.360
 I did that for enough time, be like four or five years where it was very clear, no, I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.680
 do not want to be a researcher. I definitely do not want this. But at that point, it was

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.120
 pretty hard because I had gone like so far down that path and I was so set up to like

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.840
 keep going and be in that world. And I really didn't have like, I thought I didn't have

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.240
 any other skills or experience and I didn't even know people in other industries. I didn't

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.840
 even know what a startup was. I did this stuff like did not exist in my world. But I had

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.680
 one friend who like pointed out like, hey, like a lot of the stuff that you like, there's

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.080
 this thing called like a startup and like you might be a really good fit for it. So I

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.680
 just started learning a little bit about that, talking to whoever I could talk and then I

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:54.800
 whoever I could talk to. And then I convinced myself that I could do it, but I could like,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.200
 fully pivot my career. And I did. But it was really hard. And it took a really long time.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.440
 And I ended up moving from Miami to New York and trying to find a job and I couldn't. And

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.720
 so then I had to keep being in that it was like a whole situation.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.880
 Yeah. So I think one of the things that's interesting is you had to discover that tech

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.000
 existed and that startups existed. It's a little different for myself because my family

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.180
 is in that my dad's a software engineer. So I kind of grew up knowing about all that.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.440
 So that's very weird for me to hear like, how could you not know existed? Because it's like

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.200
 with so in my face all the time. So when you were growing up, like what, like what did

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.320
 you perceive the world as like, did you not even know that was a thing? Like what was it

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.760
 more the options for your career didn't even know that a software engineer was a thing.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.800
 Don't even get me started on like a product manager or a designer. Like I didn't. This

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.680
 was also like, I think a little bit earlier. Like I know this world already existed in

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:00.680
 like 2011 to 2015, but I think now it's like definitely everywhere. And before it like

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.920
 it hadn't hit Miami yet. So to me, the world was like doctors and lawyers and small business

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.120
 owners. And that's it. And then I discovered academia and I was like, Oh, I didn't know

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.320
 this existed. So it was pretty small. You mentioned like your family. So my family, all

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.640
 small business owners, all immigrant small business owners. And later in my life, I came

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.120
 to realize like how important that has been for my psychology in the way I see the world.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.560
 I didn't really appreciate it at first. But I think we've talked about how now I appreciate

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.280
 like, Oh yeah, like I'm comfortable with responsibility. Like I feel weird feeling out of time sheet,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.960
 you know, things like that. So if your family is all small business owners, did they? Is

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.400
 it one of those things where they didn't want you exactly? What were their hopes for you?

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.320
 Like, do they want you to also be a small business owner or do they want you to get like

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.360
 a professional job? Because they kind of saw that as like the next level. It was very important

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.200
 to them that I get like an education, like getting into college, getting a college degree.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.000
 That stuff was really important to them. My dad kind of said he like wanted me to take

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.240
 over the family business, but you know how he is. I think he was just kind of like playing

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.800
 the character of someone who wants their daughter to do. I don't think he like really wanted that.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.720
 And then I think that they wanted me to be like a professional with a title and with job security.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:29.240
 And haven't given me too much of a hard time, but we're not into the idea of I'm gonna switch

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.560
 careers. I'm gonna quit my job. I'm gonna move to a new city. We're not into the idea of I'm gonna

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.280
 start my own business, even though that's what they did. But once the ball got rolling, I think

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.000
 they get it. Yeah. So once you did this, I had to like switch careers, I think in ice and like,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.280
 you know, the things that we generally talk about, we talk a lot about engineers or people that are

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.960
 new to engineering, trying to get their first job, how to bring the tech. And that's discussed

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.320
 to death, I think. And there's a lot of challenges with that. But I imagine, do you think it's even

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.840
 harder as a non-engineer to get into tech? Like, what was that process like? I wouldn't know how to

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.240
 compare, but it was really hard, but not impossible. And I think there's two things I took away from

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:22.280
 it. So one, like, you always have something like you always have a way to like fit yourself into

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.960
 whatever the new thing is that you want, even though it's not straight up to tech. So for me,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.520
 I like looked at the experiences I'd had, and I found a way to like kind of shape it into a

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.400
 narrative that made sense for why I want to be able to start up. So like the lab that I worked in

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.120
 was brand new. The professor I had worked for had just moved down to the university where I was,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:49.160
 and we had to set everything up from scratch. So it was like me and another professor and him

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.240
 for a really long time. So it's kind of like a startup where I'm like the third employee.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:59.240
 And I had to set everything up by myself, and we grew the lab from just me to like 20 to 30 people,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.640
 and I was involved in all of that. And so if I tell you the story in that way, all of a sudden,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.880
 it seems like really, really relevant. So that's one thing you can always just kind of understand

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.080
 like this new industry you're trying to go into and find ways of like seeing your own story

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:22.360
 in a way that fits. Another thing is I was kind of constrained, and you know, maybe this is something

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.080
 people should think about, and maybe it's okay for that first like move into the industry. So

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.880
 I really couldn't make progress in anything that wasn't healthcare related or psychology related,

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.760
 because it needed to kind of fit in that way. Like I just I tried, I tried, and I really only

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.640
 clicked with startups that were doing something related to healthcare, and that valued that.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:50.200
 And that was a constraint. It was also, you know, fine by me. And the other constraint was I

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:56.040
 couldn't just like get whatever job I wanted to start up. And that helped. I was clear on that,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.000
 right? I was like, I just need to get into a startup. That's all I need to do. I don't have

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.280
 to have like the perfect job. I don't need to have a cool job. So when I joined Bright Health,

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.680
 which is where I met you, and that was my first startup, I just did customer support. And then

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:16.120
 I worked my way into where I am today. And I can talk about that too. But yeah, I mean, I could

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:22.360
 tell a little bit of that from my side. So I met Liz at a startup as a company there. It was just

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:28.840
 me and one other person to start. And we started after the first like maybe like 10 months or so.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.920
 It was I think it was still under a year. We started hiring more people. It was a company that did

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:38.200
 transportation for medical situations like non-emergency transportation. The people needed to get to

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.000
 chemo appointments and get to surgery. They didn't have access to transportation. The hospital would

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.400
 pay for it, but it would be fulfilled by like Uber or like something that was non-emergency.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:54.040
 And we did have a pretty heavy support burden because we were transporting older people without

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.160
 like less depth with technology. So there were always things going wrong or like slightly wrong

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.240
 with the rides. People call in and we had like a support burden. So as we scaled, we needed to

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.040
 have more customer support people. So that's all we were hiring for. We were just hiring for

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:15.640
 two more support people. And Liz was one of the people that interviewed for it. We decided to

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.840
 hire her. I was pretty excited because she came across really competent. It definitely in hindsight,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:26.760
 like I think it was clear that she would have always outgrown that role. But we did hire her and

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.400
 then when she came in, that was like her foot in the door. And it was clear that she was using this

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.560
 support role to get what she actually wanted, which was like a bigger role at the company.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:41.960
 And that was also the day we met the day of my interview. Yeah. And I also almost didn't take

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:48.040
 the initial phone call with the founder. It was like a very, because the way he reached out was

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.680
 kind of weird. And I was a little weirded out. And so it was like a very, very last minute decision

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.280
 to like pick up the phone. And that hates this like,

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:04.920
 let me explain. So Liz is like playing it down a little bit. But our founder was really weird,

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.120
 really, really weird dude. And most people could tell right away when they spoke to him. So I

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.920
 think that's what happened, right? You were kind of weirded out? Yeah, I got in the psychology world,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.560
 you call it the access to tingle. I got the access to tingle. And what's the access to tingle?

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:27.800
 You can't just say it and not explain it. All right, it's a weird, it's kind of like if

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.400
 you know, you know, kind of thing. It's a weird feeling you get when you're around somebody who

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:41.160
 probably has a personality disorder. And the diagnostic thing access to is like a personality

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:48.680
 disorder. So we call it the access to tingle in the field. So Liz got that and almost,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.920
 she almost didn't take the call. And then I would have never met in my whole life as it is now,

00:10:52.920 --> 00:11:00.040
 which I love wouldn't exist. So I always freak out when I think about how small of a choice that

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.040
 you would use a bullet off for no reason. Like you probably were just like being lazy. I would.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.280
 Yeah, I was running late because I'm always running late to everything. But I also feel

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:15.480
 embarrassed about running late. And so I was like, I'd rather just bail on the call than show up to

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:21.560
 the call late. Yeah. So lesson of the story, don't bail on stuff. It could literally ruin a great

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:28.840
 life. So stop bailing everyone. Yeah, I'm like annoyed at you somehow. I'm annoyed that you're

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:35.000
 someone that is late to things and potentially almost ruined my life because of that. All right.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.680
 Okay. Yeah. So you were saying you got so what was like, so you finally got a job in tech. Again,

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.600
 not the role is just it was a customer support role. It's not the role you were looking for.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.720
 But yeah, well, how'd you take it from there? Yeah. And just going back a little bit, the last

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:57.240
 like piece of advice that I would give is you can like read about the industry you want to go into

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.400
 and research it a little bit and understand it. Not because you're really going to understand

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.800
 it until you're in it. But just so you have like at least a common language that you're

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.120
 speaking going into it. And I think that really helped a lot. I think it was those three things

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:15.560
 coming together that helped me actually make the pivot. But yeah, once I was in ride health,

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:21.400
 doing customer support, these things were just very like instinctive and like very clear to me.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.120
 Like very clear to me, like I didn't join this five person startup where I'm getting paid nothing

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:33.320
 to do customer support. Like it's very, very obvious, very obvious that it was a situation

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.440
 where a control free just needed to take control and like fix a bunch of stuff and set up a bunch

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.480
 of stuff. And if you did that, you become indispensable and you get a lot of options.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.720
 And so I just got to work on that immediately. Like I would do my customer support stuff,

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:53.000
 but I would be setting everything up so that, you know, I was creating systems that other people

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.440
 could use started working with you immediately and discovered product management, which was

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:04.680
 awesome. It was so fun. It was very like, very pure, right? It was like, I would get a customer

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:10.600
 support thing. And like you deal with it, but the way to actually fix it is to like change

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:17.240
 something about the product. And so then I started working with you on some product specs. I didn't

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.600
 know what I was doing was a product spec because I didn't know what a product spec was. But

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:26.280
 that's what it ended up being. I impressed you with a float chart. Do you remember that?

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.240
 Yes, I do remember that. Well, I think I technically showed you the tool, right?

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.280
 It was whimsical whimsical. You did. And I love whimsical now. Yeah.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:40.280
 Yeah. So we were getting a lot of this complex, important cases. And Liz was handling them all.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:46.760
 So she came back to us with, you know, this tool whimsical, like let's you diagram like

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:52.280
 a float charge, things like that. She came back to us with an idea for an automated

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.320
 system that could like that can handle some of these complex flows. And yeah, like I remember

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.160
 thinking like, wow, this is like really well thought through it like handles all the edge cases in

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.280
 the places where we can't handle it like nicely ejects. It's not too annoying for the user. So

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.000
 yeah, I think I remember thinking, you know, like really good instincts and thought through

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.640
 this really thoroughly. And again, remember, because from our point of view, we had just hired a

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:21.800
 customer support person to answer the phones, we didn't really expect this level like this.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.920
 So no one told you to do that. No one asked you to do it. It was something that kind of you just

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:32.520
 saw and grabbed. Right. Because I had like a master plan, like little did you know,

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:39.640
 I had it. I had just like snuck my way in and I had like a plan for what I was going to do there.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:47.640
 And if I'm being like totally honest, I don't see any other reason to ever join a startup. Like,

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.360
 I do not. I don't get it. Like, I don't understand why you would just like go join,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.880
 especially a very or because we say startup, but like I'm not talking about like a hundred

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.880
 percent series. I'm talking about like, there's five people, there's 10 people.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:06.120
 I don't get why you would ever do that to yourself unless it's because you're going to take advantage

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:12.280
 of it in this way. You want to pivot careers. You're very early on and you want to get a ton of

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:18.360
 responsibility, which I think you've pointed out, Dax, or you want like you're really going to like

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.560
 get something out of it. And you're not going into it expecting that anybody is going to tell you

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.280
 what to do. Like, that's the opportunity. The opportunity is no one's going to tell you what

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.120
 to do. And you go and figure it out. And all of a sudden you're like the most indispensable

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.160
 person in the company and you work your way into whatever job title you want. And then your next job

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.920
 is that career that you basically chosen for yourself. If you're not going to do that, like,

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.120
 don't I don't know what you're doing at it. Don't go to a startup because also you're going to

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:51.160
 annoy people like me, right? Because you're like, oh, like what do I do? Like, where's the docs? And

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:56.120
 I'm going to be like, why are you here? So just only go into a startup if that's how you're going

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:02.280
 to approach it is my hot take. It's a it's such a huge opportunity to lever up. Like, so you

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:08.840
 literally had no experience in tech. And after that job, you were set up to basically get any role

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:16.440
 you wanted. Yeah. So I do this is really funny. So I entered during customer support and I exited

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:24.120
 his head of product. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So it's just like the opportunity is so there because when

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.720
 things are early, there's just so much it's like a land grab. It's like the startup itself

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.320
 is trying to be early as something and grab a bunch of land. But similar to like internally,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:38.360
 that applies as well. Like you can go and grab stuff because no one has grabbed it yet. And the

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.160
 way I always phrase it because I find it funny is the whole thing with startups is when you're

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.600
 trying to get a job there, you're trying to trick someone to giving you more responsibility than you

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.440
 should have. And you probably don't know how to do half of it, but you're gonna someone's gonna

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:55.000
 pay you maybe not a lot, but you're gonna get paid something to do to do that. And then

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.240
 once you've done it once, you have that experience forever. And that's how you like launch your career.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.680
 I think this path is like a fantastic path. And I think it gets you really, really, really far ahead

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.760
 compared to some traditional paths. And if you look at, let's say someone that, you know,

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.800
 knew they're going to go into tech, you know, went to school for for X amount of years and got

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:22.200
 like an entry level position already at an established company, you can only go up so fast. Like the

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:27.720
 best person, maybe he's going to move up like 20% faster than like average person. But when you

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:33.960
 join a startup, you can like skip four or five years of your career. If you, if you do take advantage

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.360
 of like, you know, working really hard and being able to operate on your own without someone telling

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.520
 you what to do. Yeah, I think that's the key thing. I mean, everybody works hard and everybody suffers,

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:49.640
 but it's like the part where you're okay with taking responsibility. And you're okay with like

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:55.320
 and the ambiguity of like, what do I do? What do I work on? I think that's the key part. Yeah. So,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.920
 yeah. So what happened after you left that first, first role, would you were there for like two

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:05.400
 and a half years? So I was at Red Health, first startup, started customer support, did like a

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:11.560
 bunch of stuff in between and eventually ended up in a head of product role. So I was head of

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:17.080
 product experts, head of engineering, and then we started dating. So that's surprise now one. But

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:25.800
 after after I left Red Health, yeah, I joined this other company and this was like March of 2020,

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.680
 March, April 2020. So the pandemic has just hit everybody was working from home. And then these

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:36.840
 like digital healthcare startups were like all the rage like the hymns and hers and the row and

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:42.840
 like everybody was like taking some thing in medicine and like creating a startup around it.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:48.840
 And I went to one of these places that was focused on psychiatry and it's kind of embarrassing to

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.560
 like say that now and to talk about it because there's so much like at this point, there's like

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:59.160
 so much negative press with that like so everybody thinks cerebral and it's that was a disaster and

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.640
 it's like so embarrassing. And to be honest, like a lot of the shady things that are in the news are

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:09.640
 like kind or right when it comes to this space. So I did not enjoy my time there at all for like

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:15.160
 so many different reasons. But I got the idea for my current company, which is great. So I think

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.120
 I ended up being there for maybe like less than a year. Was it really less than a year? Oh my god,

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:27.240
 that felt like forever. Yes. So my role there was, so okay, just picture like an online psychiatry

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.920
 practice. So just like a regular doctor's practice, but instead of in person, it's online. So you

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.880
 have your patients and they wanted to create a product that the patients could use. But you also

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:43.000
 have like doctors and nurses and admin and you need a product that they can use to actually see

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.840
 the patients and provide the treatment. And that was the product that I was in charge of. And what

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:55.400
 I learned is that first of all, building that product, no matter how small and minimal you're

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:00.920
 trying to keep it, is a beast. So if that's not the focus of your company, you should never

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:07.160
 build that. But second, there's no good options in the market. So I like really no good options.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:13.400
 Like this category of software is horrid. So I understand why people end up building their own

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.680
 thing. It's because what's in the market is like so crappy. And so I thought this was a great

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:22.120
 opportunity because I'm an idiot. And then I realized how hard it was going to be. But

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.040
 yeah, that was the idea for booming. I mean, we can talk about it a little bit. So it's

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:31.960
 build versus buy thing. It comes up across any business and engineers sort of think about this,

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.760
 non-engineers are thinking about it as well. So in that case, the process was you guys did try

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.280
 to buy something, right? You guys went and evaluated everything that was out there.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:46.120
 We actually did what most people do, which is we did a combination approach. So we took some things

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:53.800
 off the shelf. And then we created our own tooling on top of that to just kind of like compensate for

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.040
 the things that we needed that it didn't have. So what most people actually do is they'll buy

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.280
 a bunch of different things and they'll glue them together. And or they will also build their own

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:08.040
 little tool to compensate for like all the issues that the tools that they bought have. So it's sort

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:14.280
 of this like hodgepodge approach. We just glue stuff together. Yeah. And do that work well? No.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:22.600
 And why not? Well, because when you glue a bunch of stuff together, you're just,

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:28.120
 you're never going to get a good outcome. Like we love APIs. We love integration. But when it

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.840
 comes to a tool like this, that's running your business. It's your operations tool. It's like how

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.960
 everything runs and works. It's just that there's always going to be like something stupid, like

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.200
 a date of birth got updated in this tool, but not in this tool. Now you're working with two different

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.200
 types of information. There's always going to be reporting as a nightmare. I think we've talked

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.920
 about this, but the people who end up doing the reporting are the ones that know exactly how much

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:56.120
 this doesn't work, because everything is going to end up showing up in the reporting as like,

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:01.480
 why do I have like five instances of this patient? Like, why does this look so weird? Like, why did

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.880
 this weird thing happen? Like, you know, all the ways that people are compensating for the

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:11.800
 shortcomings of the tool, if you do the reporting. So it's just for a tool like this for the thing

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.120
 that operates your business that runs your business, you need something that's greater than the sum

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.840
 of its parts. You can't just be like, well, I need to schedule something. So I'm going to use

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:25.560
 this scheduling tool, and I need to take some notes. So I'm going to use this charting tool,

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.560
 and I'm going to glue them together, because now I have the capabilities of scheduling

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.480
 and of charting. Like, yeah, you have the capabilities of scheduling and of charting,

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:39.160
 but when it comes to like a nice workflow and like clean operations, you need something where

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.480
 it's greater than the sum of its parts. Like, when something happens with scheduling,

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:48.440
 like this other thing happens and it all kind of flows nicely. So that's just like the beginning of

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.520
 why I think that doesn't work. But yeah, I think going back to the company a little bit more. So I

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:59.400
 think you you like set a little bit politely, but I like recall from my memory, Liz's entire time

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:05.400
 there was a disaster. I remember just every week, there was just like some other thing going wrong,

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:11.480
 and just kind of all enforcers, like it wasn't like the business was getting hit by a bunch of

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.760
 externally just internally. It just could be like, you know, we're just a lot of things going wrong.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:22.120
 And it got to the point where it was it was like bothering me. Like I was spending my time

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.400
 thinking about it being like, that's so stupid. Like they should do it like this. And I was getting

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.320
 frustrated. And I'm like, I got to the point where I was like, I want to go talk to people there and

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:34.760
 tell them what to do. So yeah, like, you know, months and months of this just was not working

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:40.360
 well. And I think at some point, I was just like, why are you doing this? Like, what are we,

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.440
 what are we like getting out of it? I'm going to spend a, you know, you can spend a couple years

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:50.520
 here. Even if it's successful, if all this like pain is is worth it, and then produce something

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:56.040
 successful, it's not going to be like a life changing amount of money or anything. Maybe you

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:02.840
 get set up for like a better role next. So I do think I remember me saying that you should go

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:08.600
 try to start your own thing. Right. Is that how you remember it? Yep, it was your idea. Yeah,

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.440
 I remember so annoyed by I was like, we need to find a way out of this situation.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:18.760
 Yeah, we're a dinosaur barbecue in Brooklyn. Oh, yeah. So how was that like, how was that

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.960
 thought process of deciding to leave and start your own thing? I kind of felt like I definitely

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:31.480
 wanted to leave because a company was a disaster and it was a whole thing. But yeah, I definitely

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:38.840
 wanted to leave and I just couldn't think of what the next thing would be. Like, I couldn't

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.840
 imagine like what company I was going to work for next and what role I was going to have next

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:51.080
 because anything I could think of kind of felt like just going around in circles,

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.960
 like just doing the same thing all over again. And I think when you get to that point, like,

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.680
 that's probably a pretty good signal to go and start your own thing, especially if that's

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.760
 something that you've always wanted to do because yeah, any other job I went and got like,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:11.800
 it wouldn't just been the same thing as before. And, you know, we had a good idea with Boomi.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.880
 We weren't like really grasping for ideas. Although I remember at the time we were exploring a

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.000
 couple of different things, which I forget now, we were thinking about like a finding a therapist

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.720
 type business or tool or something like that. But yeah, I got really excited about Boomi.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:34.360
 I think that ultimately, like, I am an operations person. That's how I think. That's what I like.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:40.760
 But because it's the year 2023, I'm an operations person with access to an engineer.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:45.240
 And so the way that I express all of that is like through products that support the operations of

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:51.160
 the business. So the type of product that Boomi is was like a really good fit for that. And

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:58.920
 it's like one of the hardest products you could choose. And I like kind of knew that, but I was

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:08.120
 like ignoring it. And now I really understand that. So it's been just massively painful,

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:15.960
 but also really fun. Because selfishly, like, I like thinking about these problems. And like,

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:20.760
 I like working through this stuff. And like, I find it really fun. Sometimes I feel a little

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.240
 guilty. Like, oh, maybe I should have like, because this is like my business and my livelihood. And

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.880
 I should have picked something that was easier and more straightforward. But I'm like enjoying

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:35.560
 how hard it is. So I feel a little weird about that. But yeah, I mean, it's like a massive product.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.720
 It's vertical SaaS. So you have to build like all the features and it's in health care, which is

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:46.280
 one of the most highly regulated industries. And that's just the beginning of what makes it hard.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:52.360
 Yeah. But the good side of that is if you, and that's why I tell people all the time, like,

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.920
 I think a lot of advice gets mixed up together and applied the wrong way. You do need to build

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.560
 simple products. You need to like start small and grow and like learn and do all that. But I think

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:08.840
 people can flate that with just picking like a very simple ambition. So I think with this,

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.560
 it's like a very ambitious product, very difficult. The upside, the downside of that is like very

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:18.680
 hard and it takes a long time and as pain can be painful. But the upside is like, you're really

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.320
 not going to run into a competitor. Like, who is willing, whatever pain you had to go through,

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.280
 someone else has to go through as well. And at the end of that, like, you can sit on,

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.320
 like, let's say, took you like two or three years to get it to a place where it's usable.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:36.840
 Someone else more or less has to go through that same pain. So yeah, it's hard to create things of

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.320
 value. Well, something is valuable because like a lot of input went into it. If something could be

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:47.160
 built in one month, you know, it has one month of value behind it. So yeah, I generally don't mind

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:53.720
 stuff being really hard. And I think I've changed my mind on this over time. I think I definitely

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.920
 initially was like, I would kind of see like these simple little tools that make money. And I would

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.640
 think like, that's what I should be doing. I should be making like 10 of those. But there are people

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:09.320
 that find success with that. But motivation is a big thing. And if you're trying to, if you're

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:14.840
 going for something way, way, way more ambitious, like, it's just a lot more fun to work on much,

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:20.360
 much bigger problems. And even an SST, like we're always thinking about like how there's like a

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.880
 current market we're focused on, but like, what's the next one? What's the next one? Like, what's

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:29.320
 the craziest version of what this all could look like? And that excitement, I think is,

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:35.240
 is helpful in keeping you motivated. Yeah. So let's talk about this for a little bit,

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:39.560
 because there's an interesting like me and you dynamic here. So we were talking about this the

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:46.520
 other night, but I'm somebody that I can only do something if it's going to be like the best

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:52.520
 and the most exciting and the most challenging to the point where you can like make fun of me for

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.960
 being like extremely delusional about where I think boomy is going to go. And we talked about

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.720
 it for the first time the other night and you were like, no, like, I'd never thought that that's

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.400
 where that would go. And I'm like, yeah, no, like we'll replace the salesforce tower. Like,

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:11.160
 that'll be like, but it's important for me because if I don't think that way, like, I'm not going to

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:16.040
 do it. Like, we joke about this, but this is the way I am with like preparing dinner. Like,

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:21.080
 your approach has been like, Liz, just make it simple so that you can do it more consistently,

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:25.640
 like just this and that. And then I try that and I'm like, I just don't want to do it if it's not

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:31.080
 going to be like really great and perfect and delicious and beautiful and like going to take a

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:37.560
 little bit of time. So I need that to be motivated. I need that to do things. I like need it to be

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:45.720
 like the highest version of itself or whatever. But I felt bad about that for a long time because

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.640
 I was like, what if, you know, I want to do this grand thing and in trying to do the grand thing,

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:55.880
 like, I totally flop and we could have been spending our time on something more straightforward that

00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:01.560
 would like make us more money and all of that. And yeah, I think you've kind of come around to

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:06.360
 this way of thinking a little bit more, but I used to think that the ideas you had around just

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:11.960
 make like a little simple tool and make a ton of money off of it. I used to think that I used to

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.040
 go bad about not taking that approach, basically. Yeah, I think the thing you described, I've said

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:21.640
 this before, like, I'm definitely a founder persona. But I think you are even more so a

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.520
 founder persona, specifically for the thing that you described, I kind of like delusional. Yeah,

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.920
 yeah, but it's important. It's going to pour in trade. And I feel like for me, I kind of had to

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:38.680
 learn it. And I realized at some point, I was kind of artificially capping my ambition,

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:43.320
 because at some somewhere in the back of my head, I was like, the thought was something like,

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:48.040
 who am I to be the one that does something like that? Like kind of overly practical to the point

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:53.880
 of like maybe being cynical or like pessimistic. And I think over time, I just started realize like,

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.920
 even the people that have done like the craziest things, they're actually not that different.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.440
 Like, of course, like, I'm not going to, you know, be like a crazy NBA player, right? Like,

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.840
 there's just like some people like truly gifted and special. But for a lot of the things that

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.960
 are within my realm of like in my space and kind of stuff that I could do, a lot of people that

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.800
 work on that stuff are just normal and it's kind of decided to do it. So I think it took me a while

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.760
 to think more that way. And I think I've landed somewhere in the middle. You much more naturally

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:27.800
 think that way. Yeah. And I also feel like, who am I to think that I can do that? And I find I find

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:34.840
 this trait that I have like really embarrassing. Like, it's embarrassing, right? Because if you

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:39.080
 don't get there, then it's like, yeah, like, of course, you didn't get there. Like, I can't believe

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.240
 you thought you're going to get there in the first place. But I'm feeling more comfortable,

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.080
 like saying it out loud. Like, there was a time where I would never share this with anybody,

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.840
 like not even you. I would just silently be like, I think it's really going to like work out for me.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:57.240
 Like, I think I'm going to like, I think I'm going to replace it before. So I both have this

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.880
 like delusion and then the self consciousness and just the way it is.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.960
 Yeah, yeah. So I mean, I've talked about it before, but obviously when you are a founder,

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.640
 some days you wake up crazy motivates and as you wake up, think you're doing everything wrong.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:16.760
 So we were in a phase where we were working on like this pretty complicated table,

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:21.640
 just like, you know, filtering, sorting, all that stuff, grouping, views, all that.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.520
 And it was already pretty complicated despite being MVP. And I was like,

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:31.960
 can this really be sometimes you like step back and you get a sense of like,

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:36.760
 I'm working on a table. Like, how is this the thing that's going to get us to like,

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.560
 all these crazy dreams and everything? And I just couldn't see it. I just couldn't see how

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:47.480
 like continuing on this path like gets to the place where we needed to go.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.800
 Yeah. I think that was that was my head was that.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.960
 Yeah. And then the interesting thing is that you came to me and we both,

00:32:53.960 --> 00:33:02.200
 I was also feeling it like I was also feeling like a lack of motivation and some insecurity

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.200
 around that. And so when you brought it to me, I was like, my like, my insecurity is like,

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.360
 correct. Like, I don't know what I'm doing. And I don't know if this is the right thing to work

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.440
 on. And what if like, we are putting in all this effort building this stupid table and that like,

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:19.000
 amounts to nothing. Like, I was feeling the same things that you were feeling. And so when you brought

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.240
 it to me, it was like a confirmation. And I was like, Oh, no. And I think it's interesting that we

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:30.760
 took it to a place where we just immediately started like fantasizing, fantasizing and negotiating,

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:35.640
 right? It was like our brain needed to like find an escape hatch from this thing that we were stuck

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:41.080
 on. And we started fantasizing about like little products that we could build and like things we

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:46.120
 could turn boomy into so that it wasn't boomy anymore. And we were just fantasizing about ways

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:52.440
 to give up. And it kind of made us feel better because it made us feel like we had an escape route.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:59.960
 And but they didn't feel good. Like, I knew it was wrong. It just didn't feel good. And then I think

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:06.120
 I took a step back and I literally googled, I literally googled like how to not give up.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:14.440
 Is that how you found that program? Yeah. Yeah. And like the first search thing was that

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:19.320
 Paul Graham essay titled, I think it's titled like how to not give up or something like that.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:25.640
 And I read it and I was like, and I mean, the takeaway is like, if you just don't give up,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:34.040
 you'll be successful. All you have to do is just not give up. And I was like, that's right. And so

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:41.000
 then I messaged you that whole thing about how, okay, we were clearly just like fantasizing and

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.240
 we're not going to give up. And here's all of the good things that we already have. And if we have

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:50.280
 all of those good things, there's no way we don't turn that into something eventually.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:55.640
 And ever since that day, I've given myself some version of that like once a week.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:03.240
 Because it's really hard. Yeah, it's funny because like you did it. I think it literally said like

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:07.240
 if you if you don't die, you get rich. So it's something like that. As long as you don't die,

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:12.680
 you get rich. Of course, you like that angle. Yeah, I know. I love money. I'm only doing this

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:17.640
 for the money. Yeah, it's as stupid and simple as that sounded. And as cliche is like quoting a

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:23.800
 program essay is like that did have a massive impact because it is really that stupid. And it's

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.520
 it's easy to forget that it's that simple because in the moment where you're like, I don't know if

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:34.200
 it's going to go anywhere, like may should give up and start over, you're forgetting that where you

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:40.520
 currently are as a result of one year of work, whatever it is. And if you give up and start over,

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.840
 you're just starting down that same path again from the beginning. And you can easily just end up

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:51.480
 back in the same spot. But now you've wasted another year. So with all this stuff,

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:58.200
 as long as you just picked a big enough market, just if you just spend enough time in it and just

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:05.960
 continue to like tweak and learn and try stuff, if you can just do that for like longer than other

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:11.320
 people, eventually you would just have to hit on something that works. Because this stuff takes

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:17.560
 time, right? It's the work is figuring out what to build. And everything before probably market fit

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.120
 just feels like just completely unknown, like you're out there trying to figure it out. But that's

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:26.600
 the actual work. Everything after that is like pretty basic. But the actual work in the miracles,

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:31.480
 like being able to spend that time with ambiguity and figuring out what figuring out just something

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:37.480
 that that can work. So ejecting out of that just ejecting back into the same exact environment just

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:42.840
 from the beginning. So again, very, very simple. But that program essay did because it like,

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.320
 all right, again, maybe just because like the get rich part really, really spoke to me. But

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:55.640
 yeah, it did like snap me out of that. And I haven't felt that way even remotely close feeling that

00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:02.760
 way since then across everything I'm doing. So yeah, it was an important moment. So the first time

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.360
 being a founder where you're literally the one responsible, I think you had some expectations of

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.600
 what it was going to be like, I think it's very different than what you expected. So yeah, do you

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:15.400
 want to talk about some of that? Yeah, the biggest difference is I've always been in like small

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:20.040
 environments, like small number of people, three people, five people, 10 people, things like that.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:26.280
 Always been good with ambiguity, giving myself work, figuring out what needs to be done and doing it.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:32.600
 But I didn't appreciate how even then, even when I thought that there was ambiguity,

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:39.000
 there wasn't. There was already something, right? There was already like research studies that had

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.080
 protocols. There was already like a business, like by the time I joined right health, we had

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:50.280
 customers, we had a business, like it was clear, like things were clear. And I just did not,

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:59.320
 I was not prepared for what it feels like to be staring at a blank page and to just have to figure

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:07.640
 it out all completely on your own. And I wasn't prepared for like how lonely that is, like I've

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.920
 always been in these environments that are really chaotic. And I would see founders and leaders

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:19.720
 struggle to deal with the chaos. And I'm very, very, very good at managing chaos. Like dream job

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.120
 is I coordinate an emergency room or something like that, standing in the middle of it and like,

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.160
 like a kitchen at a high end restaurant. Exactly. Yeah. So if there's like a bunch of stuff going

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:35.000
 on and it's super chaotic, I think of myself as somebody who would do really well there.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:40.600
 It'd be stressful that I'd figure it out. And you know, I like that. There was just nothing,

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:50.680
 like no chaos, nothing, like no emails in my inbox, no Slack messages, no co-workers,

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:57.320
 in the beginning, no customers, just nothing, just like a whole day where my calendar is blank,

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.920
 which I'm sure to people who are like, they have a lot of meetings right now. That sounds amazing.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:08.600
 Yeah. But also it's like, what do you do with what the hell do you do with yourself? It's like

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.920
 too much freedom. It kind of feels like the bottom is like ripped out from under you and

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.640
 you're just like falling into an abyss. It's like a very it was honestly like a scary feeling for me.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:22.680
 And I'm sure there's people who they actually wouldn't have a hard time with that. But for my

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:28.280
 particular temperament, very difficult, very, very difficult. And so you know, the further we go,

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:35.960
 the more things that exist, the easier it gets from me. So we get customers that's easier. I have

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:41.720
 people to talk to. I have like a way of looking at this and reducing degrees of freedom and things

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:49.560
 like that. It gets easier and easier, but I just wasn't expecting like the quiet to hit me so hard.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:55.000
 And it's just hard. Like, you don't know where you're going or what you're doing. You're getting

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.720
 no feedback. You're getting no inputs. There's no coworker to be like, you're being annoying or

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:04.680
 you're being great or I love what you did or what you did sucks. Like there's just there's nothing,

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.520
 there's like nothing, nothing, nothing. And so you just keep plugging away. And this thing is

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:13.400
 like going into the abyss. And you're like, and yeah, I mean, it's gotten better, but I still struggle

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:19.560
 with it. Adam talked about this a little bit in the startup episode, but it wasn't like the thing.

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:24.200
 And for me, for where I am right now, this is like the thing, like this is like the struggle.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:30.200
 Yeah, yeah, it's easy to underestimate how much input most of us are getting all day.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:36.120
 Even if you're an early stage company, like there's just stuff usually happening and coming in your

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:39.560
 way. And it might be annoying things like maybe things you don't want to deal with, but at least

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:44.120
 it's something gives you structure. You're like, I have an email, I have to reply. You have to do

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.640
 this. Like something is telling you what to do. There's like some signal telling you what to do. And

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:53.960
 it is like, it's really easy to underestimate how shocking it is when you literally like nothing

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:58.520
 exists besides you doing stuff, you're giving yourself your own input and trying to make stuff

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:04.520
 happen. Yeah, building your own momentum. Like startups only get easier over time because you just

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.080
 have more knowledge, more stuff happening. Like, like you said, degrees of freedom in the beginning,

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:13.960
 like you can do literally anything, like you have 10 potential things you could do. They all seem

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:19.880
 equally important. You have no idea which one makes sense. And as as it goes on, it's annoying

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:25.720
 because you want to do 10 things, but you are forced to do like one or two. And that's annoying.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.640
 That's the environment that most of us are used to. But it actually is kind of a blessing because

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:35.160
 it's you're kind of being told, okay, this is what you need to do. And it's clear. So very different

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:40.280
 early on. And that's what I was saying earlier, like, yeah, it's a miracle to get to a place

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:45.000
 where you have like product market fit and you have customers and everything because those

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.080
 initials phases are where people get filtered out because they're just so like weirdly hard and

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:55.320
 it's all like internal mental challenges. Nothing really like external. It's not really about like

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:59.960
 building a product or making a product look and feel good. It's it's all these like internal

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:05.960
 struggles you need to need to conquer. Yeah, yeah, in this time, it's funny. I got really

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:12.120
 into reading these books that were like aimed at writers and that all that stuff weirdly ended

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:17.320
 up being like very helpful because I think it kind of is like that, right? You're like staring

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:23.160
 at a blank page. It's just you alone all day trying to figure out how to structure your day,

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:28.120
 how to like bring this thing that's inside of you to life. I found it weirdly like comforting

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:34.280
 and helpful to kind of read through some of that stuff to kind of get me through this phase. And

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:41.000
 I'm still in it, but I feel like we're at the tail end. Like I think also like how long it has

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.120
 taken is not what I was expecting. And we kind of get into this all the time because you're like,

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:50.680
 I don't know what the hell you were expecting. Like things take forever. But I really have this

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:57.800
 narrative in my head that if it's going to work, it works fast and that things are supposed to be

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:02.120
 going really fast. And if they're not going really fast, then you're doing something wrong.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:07.080
 You're never going to be successful. Give up now, you total loser. Like that's the

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:15.720
 that's the narrative that I have in my head. And I've found it hard to just like stop worrying

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:20.520
 about that piece of it. And I've found it hard to like tell myself like the type of product that

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:25.480
 we're building and the way that we chose to capitalize the company means that things are going to be

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:32.280
 slower. It doesn't mean that it's wrong or that it's not going to work out or that, you know, we're

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:38.920
 doing something massively wrong. Yeah, and it's funny because we we have this discussion a lot because

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:47.080
 it took some convincing for you to believe that it like this going this slow or like things feeling

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:52.520
 this slow is the norm. But if you like sit down and like go if I think we sat down and I thought

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:57.560
 through like, okay, all the people that I know, whether they're like in it right now or whether

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.640
 they've already been successful, like how long did it actually take them? It takes a very long time

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:08.200
 and people, it's like very easy to forget that. So with SST. So I joined, I think it's going to be

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.920
 two years two years ago, Frank and Jay already been working on it for like four years before then

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:18.520
 three or four years, something like that. So from my point of view, I'm like, I basically started

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:23.080
 at the beginning and like even then it's taking forever. They had already been working on it for

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.280
 like years and years and years before that and they had they've been working to other companies

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:32.200
 before that as well. And it does take a very long time and they're both very, very good at what they

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:38.440
 do because of all this time it's gone, gone by and and what they've learned in that. And that's

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.920
 the norm. Like everyone I know is like even people that are massive successful, it's like it's taken

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:49.080
 10 years or so for them to really get to a place where things are humming. I think we get distracted

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:53.880
 by the weird times of the last five years where certain companies like rocketed to

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:59.000
 but not evaluation in like under two years. I think we're hearing that left and right.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.680
 A lot of those were fake, like not real. Some of those are probably real, but the reality is is like

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:09.800
 it's just not the norm. The norm is it just takes a very long time.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.720
 Yeah, I know. I mean, I don't know, maybe.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.720
 So not fully convinced.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:21.320
 I was so not fully convinced. Yeah, exactly. It's just it's hard because you don't have a

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:26.440
 guarantee, right? Like you go to med school, you go to grad school. It's going to take a long

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:31.960
 time. That's years, years of your life, like five, six, seven years. But you know, if you follow this

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:38.360
 path and you like do these things, you get this outcome. The startup isn't like that. We could be

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:44.680
 doing all of this and it could turn into nothing and you feel this like opportunity cost of what

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.920
 if I had done something else. Of course, there's like a totally different way of looking at it,

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:53.400
 which I think you are very good at looking at it in a different, more helpful way. But

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:58.360
 that's kind of the fear. It's like you just have no guarantee that you pour all of this stuff into

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:04.920
 it. But what if I'm pouring the wrong stuff and over time, it just I spent 10 years on it and nothing.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:11.000
 Anyways, you have a much healthier perspective on that.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.080
 Well, I just think about what's the worst case scenario? Yeah, the opportunity cost thing is there,

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:22.200
 but the worst case scenario is you spend a bunch of years doing something a lot harder than what

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.280
 most people do. So if you spend five years on it versus someone spending five years at a company,

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:32.760
 you exert yourself a lot more over those five years. And the reward for that is you've learned

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:37.240
 a lot more. You understand a lot more about how the world works. You just are just become a more

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:43.560
 capable person at that time. So the worst case outcome is you kind of spend a bunch of time

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:48.920
 training really hard, and that maybe sets you up for something really incredible as your next thing.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:53.800
 I've always looked at my career as I just constant set up for the next thing. I think I'm getting

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:59.640
 to a phase where I think I'm like doing this stuff that I was training for. But yeah, I've

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:06.760
 everything I've worked my official career maybe is 11 years now. I've only worked at very small

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:10.360
 companies. I've only founded companies have been at very small companies. Every single one of them

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:16.200
 has failed. None of them has actually worked. Maybe save for one, but that's one where I joined

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.840
 much later and wasn't like, I don't even count that one. So I've only had a career of failures.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:28.680
 But I've gotten to a place in my like understanding and ability that's well, well beyond what most

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.960
 people have, just because of those experiences. And I don't like I'm not sitting here looking back

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:38.040
 at that and feeling like I think people imagine like, there's going to be a moment where my stuff

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:42.440
 fails and I'm going to feel terrible and look back on it and all feels wasted. Just being in a

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:46.440
 situation where I think that is literally a situation I'm in, I don't look back on that. It just doesn't

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:50.680
 feel that way at all. Because you just continue to get excited about the next thing and you bring

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:56.040
 all the skills with you. And then it just gets easier every single time. Like I remember

00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:02.280
 I used to work a lot harder, I think, like I would like exert myself a lot more to just get

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:07.240
 worse results. And I can like sit back and think about where my energy would go to before and like

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:12.360
 how little of an outcome I would get and think about now where I spend my time and like how much

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:17.800
 bigger of an outcome. So it's the same thing. Like if I just keep going, eventually the outcome

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:23.560
 becomes a thing that is big enough to be the thing that I want. So again, it's just time,

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:29.560
 just like knowing that nothing great happens without a lot, a lot of time behind it.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:34.120
 That's the thing I've like struggled to internalize because I ate up all these other stories about

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:41.000
 how it's so fast. But the other thing is it's just like, it's just like embarrassing. Like it's

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.440
 embarrassing to be like, I'm going to phone this company, you guys. And they're like, hey Liz,

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:53.800
 like how's it going? And you're like, yeah, like no updates since the last time. That's embarrassing.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:49:00.440
 It's embarrassing to think that, you know, at the end it won't work out and everybody will be like,

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:05.720
 yeah. So I don't know, I feel like you're very good at dealing with embarrassment or like not

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:12.360
 having it be a factor. Yeah, have you seen our YouTube channel? Yeah, can you tell and like talk

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:18.280
 a little bit about how you just like, this is not like a factor for you at all embarrassment?

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:23.000
 It definitely, I wouldn't say it's not a factor. And I definitely know exactly what you're talking

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.920
 about because I like, you know, definitely earlier in my career, it was like more of an impact.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:35.640
 I think I was always so motivated by proving people wrong. I was like make up fake enemies

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.160
 in my head. I would pretend like someone cared about what I was doing way more and I wanted to

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.080
 prove them wrong. They probably didn't really care that much. So that kind of like pushed me forward.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:49.160
 At some point, I mean, this everyone's heard this quote Nikita Beers quote where I forgot what it

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:54.200
 is. It's about like literally the thing that's stopping from getting to the next level is like

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:59.960
 being worried about looking bad or like being embarrassed. And again, these are just filters I

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:05.880
 would talk about things that filter people out. And some part of that clicked for me where I was like,

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:11.240
 oh yeah, if I just randomly do stuff that's more embarrassing, I'm like now in the 1% of people

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:16.120
 because 99% of people would have just not done it. So now I get excited to do things that are

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:20.680
 embarrassing. I'm like, this is an edge, it feels like an edge for me. I definitely remember it like

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:25.400
 YouTube's a great example because when I first was hearing about the YouTube stuff,

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:29.160
 and I would see all like the stupid ass thumbnails and I would be like, that's so embarrassing.

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.360
 Like my friends who know me are going to see that and they're going to be like, what are you

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:36.760
 doing? Like that's not who you are. And I was like rationalizing all this stuff in my head about

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:42.920
 why I would never do that. And then over time, I like started to learn a little bit more and I

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.920
 like rationalize it in like a stupidly intellectual way where I was like, I'm above that I'm going to

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:52.120
 do that. But really, it was just me being scared. Eventually it just sort of makes, I sort of understand

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:55.960
 it and it sort of makes sense. And it really flipped to a place where I'm like, now we just

00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:00.440
 genuinely enjoy it. It doesn't even feel embarrassing. It just feels really funny. It feels really

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:07.720
 creative. So yeah, a lot of times it doesn't work, you know, but the thing we talk about all the time

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:15.000
 is everything we try to do, we try to, it just has to have the potential of being a massive hit.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:23.000
 Doing the conservative bet is not worth it because the reality is you need to try a hundred things

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.520
 and one of those things will work. If the one thing that works is a conservative bet, like you

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:31.640
 didn't really get anything out of it. So yeah, I'm just like really now excited about trying all

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:37.080
 these crazy things. And like I said, my whole career has been a failure in a way. So at this point,

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:42.680
 I'm not like worried about it. I'm still in a great, great place. So it kind of doesn't,

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.440
 yeah, I just internalize it. It just doesn't really matter. I think everyone kind of feels that way

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:51.400
 when they get old, they're also like, we all know like the older people in our family that just like

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:55.640
 don't give a shit about what anyone thinks. So I think it just kind of is like a natural thing

00:51:55.640 --> 00:52:01.000
 that happens. Yeah, that part about dragging your competitors that are embarrassment really clicked

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:06.760
 for me. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So once we do boomy marketing, it's going to be really embarrassing.

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:11.080
 Yeah, I'm excited for that. I think the other night, I told you like, hey, by the way, you're

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:16.680
 definitely in charge of doing marketing. And that's something that even a year ago, like I would

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:22.040
 have never said because I wanted to like really be in control of it and be in control of like

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:28.200
 being perceived in a certain way. And now that I've worked my ass off, the only thing that I care

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:33.400
 about is that people know that it exists. Yeah, that it works. But no, it exists. I literally

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:37.880
 just want people. No, I know it works. No, no, not the product. I mean, that the marketing works.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:43.480
 It doesn't matter what it is. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. All I care about is that people

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:49.240
 know that it exists. Like, I can't just have worked that hard on this thing that I know is

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:54.920
 awesome for it to just fail because people just don't know it exists. So I'm definitely willing to

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.400
 do like literally anything, like anything. Yeah. And that's just what I'm talking about.

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.400
 Like it just it's just a natural transition where like you'd like had all these thoughts

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:07.640
 and like opinions about it. But you get to a place where you're like, I will do anything that

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:12.360
 that works. If it works, I'll do it. I don't care what it is. That's the other thing about

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:20.680
 being a founder is you get so like, like religious, I will really like, I will pray to God. Like,

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:27.480
 I will give this offering to God is at this temple. Like, this help me. I'm trying so hard.

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:36.040
 When we were visiting my parents, my mom got away as this. What is it? The idol?

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:43.720
 Actually. Yes. The goddess of wealth. Prosperity. Prosperity. And and and what she gave me options.

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.960
 She was like, you could get like this one or that one. And I was like, yeah, the prosperity one,

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:53.240
 for sure. Like, give it here. And now it's on her shelf and then let's pray to it.

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:59.560
 Yeah. Whatever we'll do whatever it takes. Whatever it takes. Yeah, it's funny. This reminds me of

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.960
 Frank a lot because Frank is like, most of the time people know Frank is like, he's just working.

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.640
 He's like very like focused on his work. And it's like seems kind of serious.

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:13.560
 So when we started doing all those weird YouTube stuff, in my head, I couldn't really picture him

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:18.760
 outside of like, it's always funny, but I couldn't really picture it. But he's like the definition of

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:23.480
 he will literally do whatever it is. And historically, it's been, it's looked like just working super

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:29.880
 hard and cranking out like a bunch of work. But as soon as it became, like, we needed to like,

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:33.960
 be funny on video, he just went super hard. I didn't even think about it. I didn't even like

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:37.880
 question it. Didn't ask questions about like, he didn't like clarify what this makes it. He just

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:42.840
 went way harder than I expected. Because again, he's been doing this for so long. He was again,

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:47.000
 at that point where, yeah, we'll all just do literally anything. If it seems like it can work,

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.680
 like, whoa, we'll take a shot. Yeah. And it's cool to get to express that part of himself.

00:54:52.680 --> 00:55:00.200
 And I feel like you guys have a lot of fun. And it is kind of like, it's corny and basic. But like,

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:08.280
 yeah, at the end of the day, like the journey, you have to enjoy it. Like you do. But otherwise,

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.200
 when you lose motivation, you're going to give up and it's all going to be for nothing. And that's

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:17.160
 a tragedy. Yeah, I will say it's all very, very fun. I think we talked about how intense all this

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:23.320
 and some of the painful parts of it. But there's, to me, there's really nothing more fun in my life

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:28.840
 than been working on all this. It's just like, we do have a lot, a lot of fun every single day.

00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:35.000
 The frustrations we feel are things that feel worth it. Like I'm frustrated because

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.400
 our prod isn't good enough or like we haven't found the right way to talk to our customers or

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:43.400
 like we haven't thought about the right features. Those are great frustrations. Like they don't

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:48.440
 like kill you over time. The frustrations a lot of people run into is like, my boss is an idiot or

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:52.680
 like we're using a stupid we're using Jira and it sucks every and I want to kill myself every

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:56.840
 time in one minute. Like all those like micro frustrations you find, like that is what really

00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:00.680
 kills your motivation over time. The frustrations I think we have are good ones to have. They feel

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:05.880
 healthy. Yeah, I totally agree as somebody who has spent their entire career frustrated. I totally

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:12.360
 agree. Career entire life frustrated. My entire life frustrated. Yeah. Okay, well, that's really good.

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:15.400
 That was great. Do you think it was better than me and Adam's episode?

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:22.040
 For like the stuff I wanted to hear reflected in the world. Oh yeah, I qualify it. She thinks it's

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:26.040
 better. She thinks it's better. Adam says yes. Adam says it is. It is better. I don't know.

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:33.000
 We'll see. We'll see like what the people say. We'll see what shorts we attract out of this.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.600
 All right, cool. Thank you for joining and have a good day. I'll see you in the other room in a second.

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:50.040
 All right. Bye. Bye.
