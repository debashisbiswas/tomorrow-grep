WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
 Uh oh. I don't hear you.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.760
 Oh, it's probably me.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.880
 Oh, my volume is down.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.880
 Wait, what? You can hear me?

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.000
 Yeah.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.480
 Okay.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.760
 [Music]

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.520
 But why are you such a jerk, huh?

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.560
 I'm in a lot of trouble.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.520
 I've gotten a lot of trouble this week.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.720
 Are you actually in trouble?

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.160
 Can you actually get in trouble?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.480
 Is it possible for Dax to be in trouble?

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.120
 And with whom?

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.160
 Uh, is it possible for me to be in, I guess not?

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.320
 Like real trouble, you know what I mean?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.640
 Not like internet trouble.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.000
 Oh no, you've been canceled.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.720
 You don't care.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.320
 But like, oh, I'm just saying people,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.080
 someone could always just hire a hitman.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.000
 You know, there's there's always that possibility.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.680
 Like real trouble, like you're in imminent danger.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.960
 That's something you actually have to think about.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.720
 I don't think I have to worry about that,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.720
 but that's that's something you could consider.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.320
 There's a lot of money on the line, Dax.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.440
 It's true, there is a lot of money on the line.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.800
 Something like 300 million.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.960
 Sorry.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.240
 Yeah.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.360
 Well, I guess two things.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.480
 So I got in trouble after our episode last week.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.040
 Oh, right.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.840
 Where I besmirch the name of a company.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.680
 And yeah, I will say, like during that rant last week,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.640
 I do feel like, like, I don't know,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.160
 I wouldn't put that out there publicly.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.440
 Like, just the things you're saying,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.800
 I'm kind of surprised.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.240
 Like, okay.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.800
 So here's, here's, I thought about this a lot.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.120
 So anyway, to summarize very quick,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.040
 I was very rude and very mean.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.760
 And I, and I hit in some, for some very sensitive spots.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.040
 Are you apologizing?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.920
 No, I'm not apologizing.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.200
 Of course I'm not, come on.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.760
 It's true.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.720
 I did all of that.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.240
 And then the, the clip went to CEO,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 the CEO emailed Frank and Jay being like, you know, whatever.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.880
 The typical, I'm going to talk to your boss situation.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.120
 You got fired and fired.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.000
 I were looking for a job.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.560
 First I might be hiring.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.200
 Yeah.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.800
 And then I quickly messed up one up too.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.600
 That's what happened.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.680
 But here's, here's how we perceive it, right?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.880
 Let's say Apple does it's like a keynote.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.560
 They're, they're, they're not doing it.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.520
 They want you to do a keynote.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.320
 We're all on Twitter online being like, oh, look at that guy.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.280
 He's so stupid.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.920
 Like that guy is at door.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.280
 Like this feature is so dumb.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.600
 You know, it's, it's, it's really, it's literally just that.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.440
 And that's all I was doing.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.960
 I was just doing that same thing.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.120
 But there's this perception that I have some kind of like business

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.320
 tie to it, which is why like, oh, this person's not going to,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.920
 the CEO is going to be talking to emails from right in person being whatever.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.440
 But because there's like, you know, I have, I have a company

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.520
 and I kind of tested it in the same space.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.960
 It feels like inappropriate.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.360
 And we, so we got that email and we were like, oh, you know,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.840
 what would we do if we were on the other side of this?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.840
 Like if someone is us, like what would be our reaction?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.240
 And we kind of thought about like, what is like the actual conflict here?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.240
 And here's the problem.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.080
 So as SST, the company, the product,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.000
 we actually, especially with V3, you have no opinions.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Like whatever you the user want to deploy, wherever, our role is to help you out.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.800
 We're not going to be there being like, hey, you should actually use this or

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.080
 like that thing sucks because you use that.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.640
 It's a very neutral position.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.360
 And that's like how the company is positioned.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.080
 But me as an individual, real human person, I have my preferences.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.040
 I have my opinions.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.000
 I think some things are great.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.520
 I think some things are stupid.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.120
 And I think people have a hard time understanding that these can be

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.320
 two things that are side by side.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.480
 And like they seem conflicting, but it's fine.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.240
 I make fun of next JS and think it's the worst thing in the world all the time.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.040
 Simultaneously, if you come to us and deploy next JS,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.680
 we're going to bend over backwards to help you, right?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.760
 So like, yeah, it's in conflict, but it's fine.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.360
 So I think that's that creates like confusion around interpreting this.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.960
 But I personally see it as the same way that we'd make fun of any company.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.280
 Way outside of our space.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.200
 Yeah, I guess you do say a lot of like similar things,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.360
 things in the same vein about lots of people, companies, whatever's.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.800
 And it doesn't really bother me.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.200
 I think this one was hard for me because I have a connection to this person.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.240
 And I hate conflict.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.240
 Like I hate I'm a Midwesterner.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.240
 I want everyone to be happy and glossy and everything is fine.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.200
 And the connection is literally I use Dracula and have for years.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.520
 Like if he didn't invent Dracula as a theme, I wouldn't have cared.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.200
 But look, the reality is you're going to have to switch color themes now.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.080
 I guess so.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.680
 You're going to have to clean the Tokyo night.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.760
 That's just Tokyo nights.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.040
 Like the default, isn't it?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.400
 On like Neil or something?

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.840
 I didn't know it was a default.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.040
 Like I know, I say it's whatever using it 10 years ago before it was a default.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.440
 I know, I saw where did I see it?

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.240
 Was it that guy a Fatty?

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.960
 Oh, I'm probably butchering his name.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.560
 Yeah, I think I don't hear it entirely.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.040
 Yeah.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.080
 He like just built it all like all the go to a link tons of stuff.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.360
 I think he had it like super long ago.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.920
 I'm teasing about it being a default, but Dracula is also like super basic.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.120
 Super common.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.480
 Everybody uses Dracula.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.680
 I've seen Dracula for years, for years and years and years.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.880
 And at some point, I was like, I think I like read it wrong.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.560
 And I was like, oh, it's Dracula.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.040
 It's a pun.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.240
 Well, so there is a Dracula variant, I think.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.800
 I see.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.120
 I want to say that is actually a thing too.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.480
 I see, I see.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.800
 I don't know.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.080
 I use Dracula pro now.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.640
 Like I'm levels above the normal Dracula users.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.160
 Oh, there's a all in.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.440
 There's a paid version.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.600
 Yeah, it's slightly different colors,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.240
 which I'm sure you could just find on the internet and not have to pay for it.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.800
 This is crazy.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.520
 No wonder recent things so they can make money selling anything.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.600
 That's the last one.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.600
 Okay, it makes you feel better.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.400
 I did message him.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.560
 And I was like, the last thing I said to him was,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.360
 yeah, how were things like?

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.400
 Was it approved me wrong?

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.920
 I mean, the thing is, I didn't.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.480
 I don't think I messaged him in a way that he feels good about necessarily,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.640
 but I did say, you know, okay, prove me wrong.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.800
 Like, that's really all we can do.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.640
 Yeah, you have like the opposite personality of me.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.240
 Maybe that's why I like talking with you,

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.480
 because I just dream of being able to do the things you do.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.480
 Like I saw the message you send him and I'm like, wow.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.600
 What's it feel like to just be like, now what?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.120
 What do you want?

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.600
 I just can't.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.880
 I can't imagine being like that.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.400
 You know what's crazy, Adam?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.840
 That's your perception of it.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.800
 My perception of it is, man, I need to get to a place where I can like hold back even less.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.840
 Yeah, because you've ever since the DHH episode,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.760
 you're like, how can I be more myself?

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:06.320
 In reality, if this was like, like the ideal version of this is Jay got that email

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.200
 and he would reply, WTF, why are you wasting my time with this?

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.160
 I mean, reply back.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.880
 Because, do you know why I thought about this?

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.040
 I was like, Frank sent us a screenshot of Steve Jobs email.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.920
 Am I seeing this?

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.360
 That Steve Jobs Adobe email.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.720
 And it was like way like more clever than what I just said,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.480
 but it's just clearly like, it's so to the point and there's zero fakeness.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.400
 It's just his exact emotion.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:32.720
 Yeah.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:38.960
 Whereas, you know, the rest of us, we qualify and say things in a certain way

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.680
 to make the other person afield too upset, even though it's not, it's kind of fake to something.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:52.400
 Yeah, I read the Jobs biography and I'm probably every other tech bro that was like,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.200
 yeah, like I just, I really appreciate that.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.480
 I think it's more for me.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.800
 It's less like, he was a tech tycoon.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.840
 I just want to emulate him.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.120
 It's more just, I'm from the Midwest.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.160
 And it's like you, Steve Jobs, people who are just direct and just say what they think and feel.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.840
 I just wish I could be that so badly.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.720
 And I feel like I can't scrub the Midwest off of me.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.880
 Like just 30 something years living here.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.080
 I just, I can't help but be kind of fake, especially with people I don't know very well.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.400
 I really wish I could not be.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.960
 And I think that's the thing I admired like about Steve Jobs about what I'm seeing

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.000
 in this interaction for you.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.720
 It just like, it feels very refreshing. It's so antithetical to how we interact with people

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.760
 in the Midwest.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.440
 And maybe that's a blank statement.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.240
 It's pretty true.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:42.720
 Like I think it's pretty like East Coast, the whole thing you said about what is really kind.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.880
 You know, like being direct and actually saying what you think and feel.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.120
 That's kinder than pretending to be kind.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:49.520
 Yeah.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.680
 And what's crazy is I still feel all of what you're describing.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.080
 Like it's still very difficult for me to be in situations and feel like,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.360
 okay, I was like treated myself.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.160
 So maybe I could push through.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:02.960
 Maybe there's hope.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.200
 Yeah.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.360
 So even for me, it's really hard.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.200
 And I didn't grow up in like an environment that even had any like the Midwestern thing

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.000
 you're talking about.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.800
 So yeah, it's just, it's just hard.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.280
 And it's a lot done.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.960
 And like we are social animals like we're just so, you know.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.880
 And like there's like some value to it, of course.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.960
 I don't think Steve Jobs.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.800
 Like I wouldn't like literally want to be Steve Jobs in every interaction.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.000
 The other thing that I'm understanding now is I feel like there's also different flavors of this.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.800
 So the Midwest one, I feel like it's a avoidance.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.520
 Like, yeah, it's more of a topic change or like not saying anything.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:41.920
 Yes.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.800
 I think there's a California version of this, which to me is the Midwest one.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.160
 I can just like, yeah, my best one is just like, to me, it's like quirky and funny.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.840
 You know, it's a funny funny thing.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.960
 The California one, I find really weird because to me, it's extremely passive aggressive.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.480
 But they think it's not transparent.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.320
 Like it'll always be like, I mean, even in this email that we got,

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:16.400
 there's like all these lines in it that are like so clearly like a jab or like making a point.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.880
 But it's like wrapped in this language that's supposed to like neutralize it or whatever.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.280
 And to me, it's like extremely passive aggressive and very obvious what they're actually trying to say.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.520
 And so it seems like very shady to me.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.880
 But I think people that are from California are like, this is us being polite.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.280
 Yeah, so I really don't like that one.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.480
 That one is tough for me.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.000
 Yeah, no, I'm with you.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.040
 The receiving end.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.520
 I just, I wish, I wish I were born on the east coast and just had that like,

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:52.400
 a few attitudes that like coming over later on the next thing.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.520
 So what'd you do to herself?

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.120
 Yeah, I'm catching up now.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.240
 There's there's some there's some tweets out there.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.120
 Yeah, so yesterday we posted about.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.640
 So cloud flares, it's been cloud flares birthday week.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.320
 They've been doing a bunch of releases.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.840
 One of them was they are now very actively supporting nex.js on workers,

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.280
 because the workers know JS compatibility story has gotten much, much better.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.720
 So they have got, they've are like, okay, we can like say we're at Elizabeth or nex.js

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.640
 a message just a few weeks ago being like, hey, we have this adapter.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.520
 It's working.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:35.600
 We think it can make a lot of sense to like put it under the open next like bucket umbrella.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.600
 Which I thought was a good idea.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.880
 The whole point of open next was, instead of these fragmented efforts,

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.000
 let's put it all in one place so that there's some cross pollination.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.360
 But you know, in the short term, there is actually no cross pollination.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.960
 It's just they have their adapter.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:54.320
 I did some reworking of our docs so they can put like the cloud flares with the docs in there.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.600
 And then they publish their adapter.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.280
 They get a repo.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:03.200
 Just to clarify for everyone who's not familiar with this world.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.880
 Open next does things with a next build output.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.480
 But then still next is so complicated to deploy.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:20.160
 You still need an adapter on top of that, on top of the open next piece to work on a given platform?

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.400
 Yeah.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:26.000
 So I think the way it's actually structured is the thing that we built was actually the AWS

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.560
 adapter.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.920
 So it's now being readable.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.320
 Okay.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.800
 Rehows as open actually a slash AWS.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.600
 And now they have open actually a slash cloud flare.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.040
 So there's actually no overlap.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.080
 There's no overlap.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:43.440
 There's one process to turn a next JS build directory into the thing that works on a given platform.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:43.920
 I got it.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.520
 So it's more of like a branding and then like stewardship.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.760
 You're taking over stewardship of this cloud for everything.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.200
 I'm sure with their support, but putting it under the open next manner.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.280
 So it's like we manage the AWS one.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.040
 They manage the cloud for one.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.640
 We have another company that's also going to be joining in a few weeks.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.120
 Ooh, can I guess or is that like no good?

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.280
 It's kind of obvious.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.840
 But I was going to say there's one thing I can think of.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.600
 Then I just want to say it out loud, but I'm not going to.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.520
 I'm just going to say that.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.360
 So we have another one coming.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.120
 So we announced it yesterday.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.240
 The response was crazy.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.560
 Like my post says like 2000 likes.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.520
 Wow.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.440
 That's like Lambo video like counts.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.000
 It's wow.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.440
 Like people were really excited because there is a lot of pent up demand to like

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.280
 try out Cloudflare and a lot of these actually, everyone's really, really excited.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.440
 Unfortunately, someone tagged Guillermo in the replies being like,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.720
 what's your position on this?

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.600
 I, of course, reply with a joke being like, I'm assuming their position is we wish them

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.440
 the best of luck, but unintelligible jargon, like I just put that in there.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.840
 Oh, I didn't see that one.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.160
 And then we got an essay from top G.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:54.640
 Okay.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.960
 Just saying a bunch of stuff.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.080
 And an unintelligible dragon.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.560
 Yeah, it was just like really defensive.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:11.280
 That's not that's not common for a defensive top G reply to one of your tweets, right?

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.600
 Normally ignoring it.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.840
 Usually smart enough to ignore.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:23.520
 In it, he implied some things that I was like, I didn't really take too seriously.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.400
 I don't know if it was just like in the heat of the moment, he implied like, he says that he's

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.880
 the phrase was something like, Cloudflare wants to be, it fit in this large argument,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.080
 but basically saying Cloudflare wants to be your host effectively.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.560
 And they're spending millions of dollars in marketing to do this,

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.520
 including sponsoring DAX or like partnering with DAX.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.040
 And I was like, okay, he probably just means that like

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.240
 they're spending money on marketing and separately, they're just partnering with us.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.760
 And as much a back and forth in there, I like paid my usual jabs.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.200
 And I made a, I made up another post layer that was definitely

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.200
 exceptionally annoying.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.400
 Then today I, the thing that I, the only thing that bothers me about his replies was when he

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.400
 describes this as like a made up problem.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.800
 He said that we open next is like a made up thing for engagement.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.080
 Like we, we work on this thing to get like, we say that next day,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.560
 it's hard to deploy for engagement and likes.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.440
 I don't like that because I know the people that work on the project and they like,

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.520
 they work very hard and they really like next to us.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.080
 So that makes me feel bad.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.240
 And that's the one thing I have an issue with.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.520
 So this morning I posted a screenshot from our open next talk saying,

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.040
 just showing like, oh, this is the thing that they documented.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.600
 You know, it's about this pretty complicated thing that can break when you try to self-host

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.000
 next to this and how they like work through it and figure it out.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.280
 And it's, you know, it's interesting to see that this is the tedious work that they do.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.880
 I was like, it's not made up.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.800
 It's like, this is like a real thing.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.000
 Like these are real problems.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.240
 We're not doing this for likes.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.560
 These are the two people that work on it.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.920
 We actually don't know who they are.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:03.680
 They are GitHub, no profile picture, work super hard on this thing.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.320
 Amazing.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.280
 That whole situation.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.440
 Anyway, then that point.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.120
 And again, someone tagged him.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.440
 The ammo being like, is this true?

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.400
 Which is a weird question.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.480
 It's just like, what do you mean is this true?

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.080
 Like, you think we like made up this post and we just wrote this?

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.960
 And he replies being like, it's not true.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.600
 This is probably just a problem of cloud.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.480
 I had to think of the cloud player.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.640
 He was like, it's a problem of cloud player.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.920
 Like comma, DAX is new sponsors.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.840
 I saw this.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.320
 Yeah.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:34.720
 Yeah.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.320
 And I'm just like, okay.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.520
 So you are definitely suggesting that cloud players paying me to now say bad things about

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.800
 you guys.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.720
 I mean, I was probably being like, no, they're not sponsoring open next.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.560
 This is like, not a thing that's happening.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:50.800
 Yeah.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.400
 So there's nothing to do with Lambda.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.640
 This issue is like over a year old.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:00.240
 Also, the person that wrote these docs didn't even know about this partnership happening until

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:00.960
 like a week ago.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:07.440
 And I was like, are you really the person to be like throwing out sponsorship accusations right now?

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.080
 Like, I know you just kicked the oats to the curb.

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.600
 So now you can say you don't have sponsors.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.040
 But like, we all remember and guess what?

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.640
 There's a really great video on YouTube about how frustrating it is when someone says,

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.360
 oh, but you're sponsored as a criticism made by the person that you were formerly sponsoring.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.440
 I don't know.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.320
 I honestly think about messaging being like, can we just do a truce?

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:36.320
 Like I at the end of the day, the only conflict here is that I don't really think this stuff is

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.120
 a big deal.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.880
 And you think next day, us and front end is like the biggest thing ever.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.640
 I honestly just want to like, I have this one more announcement.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.080
 I need to do because new company is going to, you know, join up next as well.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.320
 I just like never talk about you guys again.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.040
 Like I'm happy to do that because it's just like going to a stupid place.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.320
 That sounds nice actually.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.760
 I think about it on the podcast, like just how much I know, I mean, it's mostly making fun of.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:06.080
 I think we're just kind of both like, we don't like a lot of things that that particular company

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:11.520
 stands for, it's just like all the money raised, the front end being this big deal.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.080
 There's just a lot about that space that's really annoying to me.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.240
 So I just, it's very easy to make fun of.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.080
 But yeah, I would love if we talked about it less.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.840
 It's just, it is hard.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.760
 Like the nature of what you guys work on, it just comes up.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.480
 Yeah.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.440
 An alternate reaction by Versailles.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.960
 This would have been my reaction, right?

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.720
 If I'm Versailles, I am the best place to deploy an SMS.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.480
 There's really no threat of that.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.480
 That's how we felt.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.960
 I would have saw this and have been like, this is awesome.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.640
 The idiots are building adapters for us for free.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.760
 We can now say, next day has no vendor lock in.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.000
 Look, there's like, yeah, all this support for it.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.120
 And we don't have to do any work.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.800
 And we can like complete Dodger criticism.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.200
 Awesome.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.960
 That's a good point.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.840
 My reaction.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.320
 Yeah.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.680
 Like people are still going to buy enlarged shoes for sale.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.240
 Like the people they're converting or trying to convert.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:00.880
 Yeah.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.400
 And including me, I keep telling people just use, if you're going to use it,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.280
 you're going to use just next year.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.160
 Maybe next year.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:06.640
 Or so.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.640
 I get one of my personal opinions is that.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.960
 Well, now I've been perusing your Twitter.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.880
 And I just have so many questions.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.080
 Because I've not seen these live.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.800
 One, first, not a question, an observation.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.280
 Liz waking up and being mad at you.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.400
 Casey gets mad at me about Dream Adam all the time.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.520
 I do stuff in her dreams.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.520
 And I'm like, it wasn't me.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.840
 You realize I didn't do that, right?

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.400
 Yeah, but what if you did?

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.440
 Like, I didn't.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.360
 I literally didn't do that.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.240
 To be fair, I am no better.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:38.800
 What do you mean?

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.760
 You have dreams.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.000
 Sometimes I have a dream about dreamlays.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.920
 And I wake up with the emotions.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.920
 And I know they're stupid and though it makes sense.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.640
 But I'm like, the reality is, I feel mad at you right now.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.520
 And that's like, just because I feel like this thing happened to me.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.640
 It's going to take me a couple of minutes for it to dissipate.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:54.880
 Yeah.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.680
 It's funny.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.040
 She like, it was funny.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.680
 I was on my phone, again, dealing with this stupid thing.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.040
 And I like to look over and I see her open her eyes.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.880
 And she gives me like the nastiest look.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.200
 And she goes, I'm mad at you.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.040
 And then she rolls over and she goes.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.680
 And so I was like, because of her dream, she's like, yeah,

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.040
 but I'm not ready to talk about it.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.400
 And then she goes back to sleep.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.360
 And then she wakes up again.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.840
 And she's like, okay, I forgive you.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.280
 And she wakes up again.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.320
 She's like, you did it again.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.480
 Stop waking up and go to sleep.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.320
 And I was like, I still know what I did.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.440
 I've never had a negative dream about Casey.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.080
 I'm like a puppy, I guess.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.720
 I've never had a dream where Casey did something bad.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.200
 I don't know.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.000
 I'm just naive.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.560
 Everything's good.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.600
 Never had a negative dream period or you've never had a negative dream.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.680
 Like, I've never had a dream where I was mad at Casey

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.800
 because it's something she did in my dream.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.400
 Like, she's never done anything in my dreams

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.720
 that was like something I'd be mad about, I guess.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.680
 That's funny.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.800
 I don't have a lot of dreams.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.760
 Do you ever think people are either like puppies or kittens?

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.640
 Like, people are either cats or dogs.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.320
 Like, I'm more of a dog.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.520
 I'm kind of like, like, I'm just happy about everything.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.880
 Like, play with me.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.960
 In case he's more of like a cat, she's a deep thinker.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.200
 Like, she can hold grudges.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.960
 She can like, yeah, just, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.960
 I feel like you're all cats.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.440
 It's hard.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.000
 It's hard for me to, I get what you're saying,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.040
 but in my head, all dogs are boys and all cats are girls.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:21.680
 Oh, interesting.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.520
 So I have two cats that are literally girls

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.560
 and a dog that's a boy.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.840
 So it might have just like, every single cat in the world is a girl.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.200
 And every single dog in the world is a boy.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.320
 So it's hard for me to see past that.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:32.800
 Okay.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.440
 That's fair.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.000
 Okay, more tweets, because we're going to run out of time.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.840
 There's so many, so many questions.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.000
 This one's a quick one.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.480
 What was your sponsor tweet today again?

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.160
 P.P. Poopoo, what is this?

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.320
 Well, after that accusation,

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.080
 that Cloudflow was sponsoring me soon.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.040
 You know, message me.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.480
 It's like, I'll give you a dollar if you tweet what I say.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.760
 I think that's P.P. Poopoo.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.360
 And I was like, all right, sold.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.280
 I don't give you a dollar.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.000
 That's too funny.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.560
 This is the first sponsorship deal that I ever get.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.680
 So look at that.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.960
 And then this tweet calling yourself out.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.400
 I love it.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.840
 Okay, that was fun.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.480
 I'm glad I asked.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.080
 Let's see.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.000
 What's going to disrupt the whole industry?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.200
 You quote tweeted, Sunil.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:15.600
 Oh, yes.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.200
 I'm so excited that we can find talk about this.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.240
 You're so touchy containers lately.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.760
 What is what happened to you?

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.840
 This container guy, sorry, continue.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.200
 Just opened up the whole new world.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.080
 Do you just like have Docker running on your Mac all the time now?

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.760
 I don't eat some kind of animal.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.480
 You do too.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.680
 But I use my Mac to connect to my Linux machine,

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.600
 which does have Docker running all the time.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.480
 All the time, huh?

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.680
 I hear it's better on Linux.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:37.920
 Sorry.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.480
 I don't do your own.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.200
 There's no VM.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.040
 It running all the time means nothing.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.000
 It's like not doing anything.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.600
 Yeah, on Mac, it means something.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.800
 Yeah, I've heard.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.000
 I'm not smart enough to know what,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.920
 but it means my machine is crippled.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.040
 And so I don't run Docker.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.720
 Container boy.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:56.160
 So, Cloudflare is, they haven't launched it yet,

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.640
 but they have had an internal containers platform for a while.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.240
 It's getting to a point where it can soon be a publicly available containers platform.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.960
 And it's really exciting because the reality is,

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.920
 the majority of the industry still uses stateful deployments.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.920
 I love serverless.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.360
 Love all the cool things we can do with it.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.360
 But it's an uphill battle.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.440
 Like when you, when that's the thing you are showing people,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.960
 only one in X number are going to be like, cool.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.880
 I want to learn more about that.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.760
 Whereas containers, you're just

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.480
 selling into like an existing habit.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.960
 So they have a launching containers platform.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.800
 Why this is really exciting for me is,

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:38.560
 it's going to be one of those really modern container offerings,

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.320
 where it's just like, boots up really quickly.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.160
 Potentially, it like scales to zero.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.360
 Literally, I can split up another one in 300 milliseconds,

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.560
 like kind of like fly distributed all around the world.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.120
 Every single one of their, I think it's like 130 efforts.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.800
 So I'm like, over 100 data centers.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.360
 So fly, but with CloudFlares network.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.480
 Yeah, CloudFlares network.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.480
 And CloudFlares, like they are at massive scale,

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.480
 which means pricing will be decent, reliability will be decent.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.600
 I think right now, if you want that kind of offering,

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.480
 you are looking at like newer companies,

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.960
 or like middleman companies that are wrapping other clouds.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.880
 So I think you're just going to be really disruptive.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.600
 And combining clouds plus workers plus durable objects.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.440
 So I'm going to say combining containers plus durable objects plus workers.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.440
 It's going to be really crazy combo.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.240
 It makes it feel like a much more complete platform,

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.240
 where you can be like, I can run literally anything on here.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:40.080
 Yeah, like I imagine like an elixir distributed cluster,

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.280
 that's like distributed all around the world forming a single cluster,

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.480
 which you probably don't want to do.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.240
 Because there's other reasons you don't want to do that.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.320
 But like again, it's just a tool that we have.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.960
 To open up all kinds of new possibilities.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.480
 So you've been an investor in CloudFlare for a long time.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.240
 Am I too late to invest in CloudFlare?

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.320
 Did I miss the like, are they still in the early, early?

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.160
 Like in terms of the stock, sorry.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.680
 It's just so hard to tell, right?

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.040
 Like as yeah, yeah.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.480
 So here's what the stock did.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:14.160
 It went way too high, like way, way, way, way too high during the pandemic.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.320
 Like probably one of the stocks was affected the most.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.920
 It is now like a third of where--

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.960
 Nice, okay.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.040
 But the problem is where it is now could be the correct value.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.120
 So I don't know if you necessarily have an edge in investing.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.080
 Right, right.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.240
 Yeah, but like there's still a lot of growth ahead of this company.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.720
 Like this is a company at the beginning stages of really disrupting.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.480
 But you call them a hyperscaler.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.800
 Like they're already considered, I don't know where they fit.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.840
 Like if you take, let's say Google, Azure, and AWS in one little bucket.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.680
 Yeah, I don't know if any other companies belong on that bucket or Oracle or something.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.480
 I don't know.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.200
 But if you take those like big, big ones and then you take the flies

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.280
 and the render and whatever all those other little companies,

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.560
 where does CloudFlare sit?

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.320
 If 10 is the AWS and then like one is the little companies,

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.560
 where how close is it closer to the big ones or closer to the little ones?

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.960
 Like it's definitely closer to the big ones.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.680
 The thing with AWS is they have so many customers,

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.840
 so they're running so many workloads beyond their own.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:20.640
 Yeah, CloudFlare's platform is newer, so most of their usage is their own,

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.400
 like their own usage of it.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.440
 Okay.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.800
 So like physically, like they have the infrastructure.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.600
 Could you explain that?

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.640
 CloudFlare's, most of CloudFlare usage is CloudFlare.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.080
 So they basically decided, okay, we're going to build a platform.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.880
 We're not just like a DDoS company, we're going to build a Cloud platform.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.880
 Building a platform plays a long time.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.880
 Like I think they're on like year eight or nine.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.760
 I think I would generally say it takes 10 years, right?

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.080
 Yeah.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.640
 So they're close to like saying, okay, we have a real platform.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.680
 And by building a platform, you mean like data centers?

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.680
 No, not that.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.440
 You mean software platform?

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.360
 Like a user facing offering that you can go and spin up products on.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:04.320
 But their core business already involved data center servers all around the world.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.160
 Like they have done a lot of things that AWS hasn't.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.960
 But then in terms of like public workloads, AWS has so many.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.640
 So no one can really compare to them.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.240
 But they're definitely in the category of, well, one, they're a public company.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.880
 Like they're just on a different level compared to these other things.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.200
 Sure.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.000
 In terms of resources.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.080
 And they are at like a crazy scale, which is why their offering can be so cheap.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.800
 Whereas I would say these other options, like fly is cool.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.560
 Because they built their own stuff from day one.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.840
 Rather, it just wraps a GCP, railway also had wrapped GCP.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.040
 They just announced their offering their first bare metal stuff.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.080
 It's in beta now and they announced that two weeks ago.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.040
 So again, just like a different category.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.120
 I would say cloudware is way more on the way.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.440
 Yeah, I should have realized like public company.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.280
 That's a tell.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:59.600
 Like obviously they're a large company in that case.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.400
 And they need to absorb DDoS traffic, you know.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:02.640
 Yeah.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.000
 And that's when you say they're core business.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.120
 That's where they started, right?

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.520
 Just the like the security at the edge kind of thing.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.200
 That was their main business.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.440
 And then they turned they turned that into this whole cloud platform.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:15.760
 Yeah.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.800
 So they for themselves had to build servers all around the world

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:24.160
 and make it super programmable so that their engineers can like configure where the traffic

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.920
 goes and like add custom logic.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.080
 And that's where like this whole like serverless cloud

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.840
 they're offering we see comes out of.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.560
 It's that's what I mean by their usage is their own.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:32.720
 Yeah.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.640
 And they're better at that stuff than AWS.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.520
 Like there's not great options on the AWS side.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:44.240
 I mean, there are options and I guess like the cost at large scale isn't that crazy.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.280
 But cloud player, if you're like a startup, like their options are just better.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:56.160
 It's wild how it's such an interesting business because they bet a long time ago

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.280
 that DDoS is going to continue to be a problem.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.560
 And fast forward, it's just like an infinitely growing problem

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:06.880
 because as time goes on, there's just more devices that are turned on in the world.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.760
 The older they get, the more vulnerabilities they have.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.720
 And so there's more and more devices available to like do a DDoS.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.040
 Yeah.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.880
 So it's just like this infinitely growing problem.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.720
 It's a cheaper and cheaper and cheaper to do a DDoS.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.680
 So they're just like, you like, it's getting to the point where like you have to put something

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.720
 like that in front of whatever you have exposed publicly.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.080
 That was why they see that.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.320
 And they see like 30% of that traffic or something crazy.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.760
 Yeah, like who are the people doing DDoS's and like, why?

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.400
 I don't get it.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.360
 Some of them seem so random, like if I have a public endpoint up,

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.080
 that's not affiliated with anything big.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.120
 And it starts getting DDoS.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.240
 It's like, why?

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.320
 Who and why?

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.360
 I was working on something the other day on my server.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.040
 And it involved exposing a port externally.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:58.160
 And very quickly, just bunch of requests, just testing for random PHP vulnerabilities,

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:58.400
 right?

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:05.280
 We have dev and staging environments that are not like publicly crawlable or like

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.800
 discoverable in any way.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.080
 And it's amazing if you just look at logs, just for any internet property,

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.880
 anything publicly facing, just the amount of noise on the internet,

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.960
 the amount of requests from like random, I guess there's like WordPress exploits

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:20.960
 and all these weird things that all these bots are just peppering the internet with.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.600
 It reminds me of like, it makes me think of like all the radiation just flying around in space.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:30.640
 It just feels like this crazy amount of noise that if you tap in,

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.960
 you just say like, I'm available on the internet.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.120
 Boom, you just start getting peppered with all that stuff.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:35.920
 It's crazy.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.840
 It's really why it like comes from China, like almost all of it is like it's coming from China.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.480
 And it's, I mean, I was talking, I don't want to, I don't think I can say who,

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:50.560
 but someone was telling me about how their company had a two terabyte per second DDoS

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:57.040
 back in like 2019 or 2020. Oh my word. That's insane.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:04.480
 It was from the Chinese government. And it's just normal. The Chinese government literally just

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:11.440
 blasts companies and products that you know and use with two terabytes a second of traffic.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:16.880
 That's crazy. And it's like, are they just having fun? Because like that one is just like,

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.200
 maybe they're testing capabilities for like disrupting stuff.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.880
 Oh, yeah, it's like doing a missile launch. Like, yeah, exactly.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.600
 There's like a test launch. Okay, we can do that. Now we know if we need to take down a government,

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.720
 like, yeah, two terabytes second. No problem. We got it.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:38.000
 In that case, Akamai, I think was the, the protect the DDoS protection person and they handled it.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.200
 Yeah. I mean, if I just start thinking about some of this stuff very long,

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.960
 it just kind of blows my mind. Like what we have accomplished as humans,

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.600
 you just start thinking about all the underwater cables, what the internet physically is,

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:55.040
 and then like all the software layers upon layers upon layers that have gotten at this point and

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.120
 all the possibilities. Like we start talking about these weird, obscure things people do

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:05.440
 that I would never do. It's just like, there's whole worlds that exist digitally and physically

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.960
 that I just don't know anything about. And I'm a technologist. Like, I feel like I'm more plugged

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:14.640
 in than the average person by a lot. And it's just kind of boggles the mind as humans. We're

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.520
 pretty clever. Yeah, I had this experience recently because I don't know if you probably didn't see,

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:26.480
 but I have been exploring video game streaming, not like streaming video games I play, but like

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:32.240
 Stadia, like the Google thing. Yeah. And video equivalent picks like pixel. What is that called

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:38.800
 pixel streaming? I think it's what it's called. Yeah. Yeah. So again, the idea is, so NVIDIA

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.560
 obviously has their own GPUs. This is actually super cool because like, obviously, they make

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.920
 cheap. Oh, yeah. Okay. Well, it's cool because they can build this service where like, it's

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.640
 writing the GPU in the cloud and like sending you the video, they can do it for so cheap because

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:58.080
 the GPUs are at cost for them. Yeah. But I was like, I tried out in the past and I was like, okay,

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.240
 but I saw a post being like, what the hell this stuff is really good now. And I went and tried it.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:08.880
 It is incredible. It literally feels like really, I have a good GPU locally. So I can compare it,

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:14.640
 plug in like, oh, turn on my TV, plug in like just the cheapest device, right? That like just

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:22.080
 names video, connect my controller for, yeah, it just looks amazing. The GPU is better than the

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:28.480
 one I have here. And it's like, basically no latency, very little just like, occasionally,

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.760
 you'll get some stutter. And I was like, this is wild that I remember using this before. And now

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:38.960
 we can literally stream like the craziest 4k detail thing here. It's probably related to like,

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:44.160
 I'm sure Netflix, just like that whole era of like making that all work. I'm sure like, yeah,

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.480
 that just working further technology. Yeah, and the video compression and all that.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.320
 So then I was like, okay, there's some games that you know, there aren't in that library that I

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:57.120
 want to play. Let me try the open source version of this. So I installed something on my computer.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:03.280
 And again, it works flawlessly. Like I can be in any room on my Mac book, just like pop it open.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.040
 And Liz is like, so next we're reading a book, I can just play a game and I'm streaming from my

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:12.480
 computer. And it's all over Wi-Fi. My hot is not wired. I mean, my desktop is wired. Yeah,

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:19.120
 my laptop is not wired. My my TV device is not wired. It's just all over this mesh,

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:25.200
 yeah, your real thing that I have. And it works perfectly. So when you say you're looking at,

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:30.480
 is it go beyond just like, you're just playing games over it? Like, you're looking into it from

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:34.320
 like an infrastructure sample? Or what were you saying at the beginning? Or you're just just

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:39.040
 just just personally? Yeah, because I'm like, I've always been someone, because I like gaming,

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:44.480
 I do less and less of it every year, but I still like it. But I've always had this custom built PC,

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:51.840
 and I run Linux. Yeah, and I'm like, this is such a hassle to like, keep this GPU upgrade.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:55.840
 It's expensive. It's annoying. Because like, yeah, GPUs upgrade within other parts of your

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.080
 computer to upgrade. So it's whole thing. And I'm just past the point of my life where I'm doing

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.640
 it enough where that's worth it. But I love quality. So I don't want to give the quality,

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.880
 but now you don't have to. I'm realizing I'm confused about how this works. It's not in the

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:13.200
 browser. There's like an app you run. It can be in a browser generic shell. Oh, it can be in the

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.520
 browser. Yeah. But how do you how do you use it? You run some kind of client app, and then it's

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:22.880
 just so you can play through it. Oh, no. Yeah. So I don't know, electronic, that's bad. I'm saying

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.200
 it's just a browser. It's on the day it's all browser tech. Oh, okay. I think the reason I use

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:33.520
 the app is because I think they limit Chrome to 1080p. There's some like thing that's a little

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.760
 bit they can't actually control a bit rate or something. So there's like a platform that you're

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:43.600
 using for this, I guess. It's an NVIDIA thing. So the one I tried is NVIDIA GeForce. Now,

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.840
 I think it's JD GeForce now. It's 20 bucks a month for the highest tier. It gets you like the nicest

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:55.760
 GPU. 20 bucks a month is like, that's like, that's like nothing. I mean, that like, how many months

00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:02.800
 before you'd buy that GPU at $20 a month for years? And there'll be crazier GPUs, but in crazier

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.920
 games, I'm sure like if you're someone that like buys at the right time, sells it at the right time,

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.640
 upgrades at the right time, you're going to beat this, of course. Of course. And there's like,

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.000
 if you don't have good internet or your internet spotty, like you're not going to be able to play,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.200
 but all those trade offs, whatever, it's it's such a good deal. That's crazy. Yeah, that's the

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.600
 case where like, I'm not the subscription is good. You still have to buy those lots of things.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.480
 Oh, okay. So like a one time fee for the game or? Yeah, but the thing is, so there's

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:35.520
 so the GeForce now just a platform to do this, but then there's other game subscription services,

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:41.040
 like like Microsoft has like a monthly $10 a month or whatever, and you get like a whole catalog.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.600
 So I was like, what? And the other cool thing is no downloads. I was like, let me just sign

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.920
 with Microsoft thing. And I just tried out like 20 different games in like one game one day.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:55.840
 That's crazy. That's like something you can't do, right? Yeah. So this is the big like change.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:02.000
 I remember as a kid playing like Super Nintendo and my parents being like, this is crazy. How did

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.560
 they come up with this? Yeah. And like, it was just so beyond anything they could imagine.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.560
 This is the kind of form of gaming that's coming along that's going to blow us away. Like the

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:15.760
 things our kids could do that we couldn't do. We had to buy cartridges and we had to download games

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.640
 and we had to whatever by CD ROMs. And now they could just stream from the cloud.

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.120
 They don't have to download it. They don't have to download a machine,

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.920
 which already felt kind of crazy that you can you have to go to the story and just like

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:30.720
 download a game. That's crazy. I don't have to download it. It's it's wild.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:37.760
 Have you seen the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024? No. Okay. So this is a flight simulator 2020

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:42.080
 was already pretty incredible because it had the whole earth. You can literally get in a plane

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:47.040
 the whole earth to the whole earth. And it was a bunch of AI involved. Like they just took a lot

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:52.320
 of data, they automatically generated stuff, hand tweaked like, you know, more more popular places,

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:57.360
 but and it's all one to one. So if I like took a plane from my local airport and flew it to New

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:05.120
 York, it would take three hours in the game for me to do. Really? And then 2024 is like even

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:10.800
 crazier. Like the detail is up and they do such cool stuff. Like you're gonna love this. Okay. So

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:18.400
 they take in in just real time ship data on all the ships in the world. You mean planes? Are they

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:24.720
 called ships? No, no, not ships in the ocean. What? And then they just put them in the game at the

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.360
 exact position they're in. So if you're flying over the ocean, you look down, it's the exact same

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:36.160
 thing you see. And they're also adjusting in real time, like the real ships are being tracked

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.400
 anyway. And they have all that data and they put the real ships in the ocean at the real spot.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:44.320
 That's insane. And I think they're working on like kind of ship. Yep. I think they're kind of

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.400
 ships. And they're working on like carriers, so you can land on like aircraft carriers and stuff.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:57.120
 So my word. That's not it. Then they're also ingesting wildlife data of where animals are.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:02.000
 And you can literally land a plane anywhere by population.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.920
 Like this is getting too far. What are they building over there?

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:12.880
 It's over 3043 is right here. Yeah. But it's an Earth simulation, right? So but it's like generally

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.640
 where they are. So if you can like land in the Savannah and you can walk, you can get out of the

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:21.520
 plane and walk around and you'll see like giraffes and stuff and stuff. You can get out of the plane

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.160
 on flight simulator? Yeah. That's what's so this. They're like taking it really far where it's like

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.080
 yeah, it's a flight sim, but it's like becoming an Earth sim. This is wild. I feel like governments

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:34.400
 are going to use this like simulate diseases and I don't know something. I mean, and they have a

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:41.280
 project called Earth 2 and they're doing like a digital Earth. Huh. They should really collaborate

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:46.320
 like open next. Maybe this should be in the open next banner. I don't know. Well, it got posts on

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.800
 Hacker News and people were like, oh man, it would be cool if they just released this so we can all

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.200
 just build other cool stuff on it. And I've always been feeling like some games make really,

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:59.520
 really cool environments, but it's just used for a single game. I would love to like take this

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.960
 world and like use it for a different game. Anyway, it's an end to the head is a career mode where

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:13.600
 you can play as like a medical rescue helicopter or like a fire, like firefighting helicopter,

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:19.040
 all this stuff. Yeah. And I'm like, this is really cool. And it can be rendered in the cloud and

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:24.400
 stream to you. Oh, and played. Oh, okay. So that franchise has always been well regarded, right?

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:30.160
 It's like very crazy accurate. Like, who is behind that? Like, was it just some former pilots that

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.720
 got hired by Microsoft and have this passion for this? Like, it feels like so much it's the kind

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.560
 of thing where it feels like there's so much energy and something invested into something.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:43.200
 There has to be reasons that they care so much about making this so good. Or is it just that

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.120
 people like it and they buy it? It's so technical too, right? It's just a good technical to build

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.480
 like a simulator. It's a very technical engineering oriented thing. Yeah, like all the different

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:55.120
 aircraft cockpits and stuff. Like, I've seen the screenshots. It's like, they've really like,

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:59.200
 they've got all the planes and all the details about the plane. It's just crazy.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.120
 Yeah. And so you have to like know how to build that simulation and you have to understand like

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.840
 the physics of air and like, yeah, when's affected so you can implement it. Oh, sure.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:13.280
 It's like really, really talented, incredible people that work on it. Like, let's use this

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:18.480
 to like learn things. I mean, I feel like, do they, I guess, like, it feels like so much effort put

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:25.520
 into something for just like nerds to play on the weekend? No, I think it's using like

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:30.240
 light training stuff. Yeah. You know, my brother's a pilot. Have I talked about that?

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:36.320
 Yeah. That's so crazy. Like, to me, that's so, that's so outside the range of a normal life.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:42.480
 Yeah, just fly around every day. Yeah. Like, he's constantly in Atlanta. He's based out of Atlanta,

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:48.240
 but he lives here near me. Like, they just commute. They just hop on a plane in the morning and

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:53.360
 their whole job is a commute. There's no, like, yeah, that's right. They have like,

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:57.520
 they can just like get on a plane to go to the place where they're actually supposed to fly from.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:02.560
 It's like, yeah, it's an hour and a half flight to Atlanta from here. So he just says like an

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:08.720
 hour and a half commute, but not a normal commute. We're talking like eight hour drive commute.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:14.400
 I guess there's people that like commute to San Francisco from LA, like rich people that have

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:19.200
 jobs in Silicon Valley. It's like in our head, it's a one and a half hour commute. A lot of people

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:23.520
 have a one and a half hour commute. And it's technically the same thing. And he probably perceives

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.280
 it in the same way. But for us, we're like, you are literally going to like another place. Like,

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:33.600
 how is this happening? Yeah. And like twice a week, it's like, it's crazy. Pilots like truck

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:42.400
 drivers, but classier much classier. Sorry, brother, you're going to, you're going to get an email from

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:49.040
 the truck driving CEO of this one. I want to say something here that reminded me to our listeners.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.280
 It's because sometimes I forget we have listeners and we're not just hanging out. I get a lot of

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:58.000
 emails or messages after every episode. Like, it's funny. This last one, the number of people

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.280
 that reached out being like, Oh, yeah, yeah, React Native sucks for that. Here's the thing

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:04.800
 you should use. And I'm already forgetting. I think it was capacitor was the consensus.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.760
 It's just crazy. It's kind of fun to have a podcast where you can like just publicly complain

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:13.600
 about something. And then everyone's like, here's answers. Here you go. Solutions. Thank you to

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:18.400
 all of you listeners that offer up information. I don't always reply. Not like I'm snooty. It's

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:23.600
 just like, uh, you can ask that. I don't always reply to stuff I should reply to work related,

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:28.880
 terminal things. Uh, just sometimes I get busy and I just ignore DMS. That's the first thing to

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:34.880
 go for me. DMS. It's the first thing I just kind of like wholesale or just communications in general.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.720
 Like when I'm busy, I got like programming stuff in my brain. I just, I stopped communicating. Sorry.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.480
 You know what the is an example of this, like being able to get help and say,

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:49.600
 it's still weird, super power to have. Uh, I had, I don't know if you saw this, but I had like

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:55.520
 this few months ago, I had these like flies in my sink, like they kept, kept like killing them,

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.520
 but they just kept coming out of like our sink out of your sink, like out of the drain. Yeah,

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:03.200
 out of the drain. And it's a very like common thing, apparently, but I never had that before.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:07.760
 Really? And I was like, what? They're really tiny. They're super, super small. And I was like,

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:12.240
 what the hell? Like, what are we doing? We're looking up online, like pour water, hot water down,

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:17.600
 do this and that. We tried it all. It just, they just kept coming back. And then I posted about it

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.240
 and someone was like, Oh yeah, before I was in, before I was a software engineer, I was like,

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:30.640
 a food safety, like his job was to like design how kitchens like stayed clean. Basically,

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.880
 and he was like, here's a link to this thing. And it was like some weird phone

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:40.240
 that he'd like me to. And then I just took, I got it, I ordered it and I sprayed it down the

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:44.560
 down the sink. And I was like, I don't think I did this right because like some part of it was

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:49.360
 messed up. Next day, completely gone. And I don't think I would ever solve this problem. I think

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.160
 it would have moved out of my house. I think that's what would have happened. Otherwise,

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:56.800
 I'm just going to nearly fix it. And I don't think I would have found it otherwise.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.840
 That they were, I know you didn't like intend probably to delve into the details of this,

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:08.400
 but I'm going to because I just have, I'm curious about curiosities that they were coming up from

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:13.440
 like from the plumbing out of the drain called drain flies. Yeah, yeah. So they're like,

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:19.600
 next question is, isn't there like a bend in the pipes that like keeps water at all time? Like,

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:25.040
 how did the flies get through the little bend? The bend is what makes it possible, I think. Oh,

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:30.400
 because the bend allows for it's a good name of, there's a good name of that piece of the pipe,

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:34.320
 I've read what it is, but I think it leaves like a pocket of air or something. So when you run

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.440
 water through, there's like technically an area that uh, let's say is second. Yeah. So I think you'll

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:44.320
 like get, you'll get a bunch of them, but eventually they'll like, they'll be this area that just not

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:49.360
 being hit with water. Okay. Interesting. Yeah, but and this here's the craziest part. I was looking

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:56.080
 as up online and I was like, and people were saying that yeah, oftentimes if you like make it a problem

00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:01.200
 for them, they'll move to another drain in your house, like through the pipes. People were like,

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.000
 yeah, we got with them here, but then they popped up over there. Yeah. Huh. Like whack up. You're

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.400
 right that there is this bend and I don't really understand where I thought that kept like water

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:15.120
 in between. I mean, we have a garbage disposal. It's possible they're like somewhere they were

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:20.000
 somewhere in the garbage disposal. This is hard to hard to tell. But yeah, drain flies to think

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.960
 drain flies. Just learn something new today. Yeah. How are the mosquitoes doing since mosquito

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.520
 Joe did his thing there? If I want to come to Miami soon better, they're a lot better. It's just

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:36.080
 not a hundred percent effective. It's way better than it used to be. And if the good news is if I'm

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:40.640
 like in the morning, if I spend five minutes killing them with the we got a new electric racket and

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:46.000
 this one's way better. Oh, it's so good. Yeah. It's got multiple. The one that you use had a

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.480
 single layer of electricity that's like three layers of electricity. So you can go through that.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:55.040
 Can't miss. You can't miss. And since we realized pop, which, you know, you experienced, I love

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:58.880
 the morning, if I spend five minutes just getting there's like these usual locations where they are,

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.160
 like spend five minutes getting them. It's like pretty good for the day. They're gone. Yeah.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:06.880
 Oh, much better. I did not experience that. We did not ever have a day where it was like,

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.800
 we're good. You've got to work on the next time. Like we're so super for not thinking of that.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.480
 I was so stupid for not thinking that such all of us. I don't even think about that.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:20.160
 Yeah. Next time. When is next time? I guess they're talking about and react to Miami already.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.520
 Yeah. Like that's is they selling tickets already? Is it that soon? Or do they do it that early?

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.480
 Yes, there's some tickets and they're selling a lot way more than they did.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:33.760
 Pretty nice. Did you just get distracted? I feel like I got distracted and you got distracted a little

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:38.880
 bit. Yeah. Maybe it's the same thing. What did you get to check? No, I was looking at the clock.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.600
 Oh, just about the clock. That board, huh?

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:49.440
 No, I have to go in something for me. That might not even know. Oh, yeah. Well, we can get up here.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:55.120
 Next week, special guest. So exciting. We'll keep that as a teaser.

00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.000
 Yeah. We're gonna have someone on next week. This episode is always brought to you by

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.080
 Terminal Coffee. You can buy your coffee from the terminal. SSH, terminal.shop. Let's take a break.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:12.080
 Oh, it's not just sponsored by Terminal, according to Versailles. It's also sponsored by Cloudflare.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:15.680
 Oh, yeah. We might as well give them credit since people think that they're sponsoring.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:20.480
 Yeah. They're not. Believe it. There's no money flowing from Cloudflare to any of us.
