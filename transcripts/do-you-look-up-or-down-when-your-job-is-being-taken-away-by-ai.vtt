00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:27.440
 - What's up?

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.720
 - I'm good.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.780
 - It's really hot in Miami.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.080
 - No, I didn't ask you if you were good.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.020
 I said, what's up?

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.360
 I don't care about your wellbeing, Dax.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.200
 I'm just kidding.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.400
 - I literally don't know how to answer that otherwise.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.240
 - What's up?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.080
 - I don't know.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.920
 Give me news.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.200
 Tell me what's going on in the world.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.480
 I don't care about you personally.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.320
 No, I'm just kidding.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.160
 What's going on?

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.800
 So you're doing it hot, you said?

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.200
 - Yeah, it's hot.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.840
 Liz is two months away.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.400
 - Yeah, that's real hot for her.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.480
 - Oh, I guess 24th.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.680
 So I think we're three months.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.480
 - Oh, I guess it is, yeah, it's just the end of time.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.760
 - Two months away, we just finished.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.560
 We had a baby shower at her house last weekend.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.880
 - I saw a tweet, I believe.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.120
 - All we did was, we just got these four tables,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.920
 we rented these four tables and they were like,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.840
 old wooden, nice looking tables,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.000
 but it made the whole thing feel like crazy fancy.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.160
 I'm like, you know, it's not that hard to pull off,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.600
 but nice looking event.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.840
 There's that picture that I posted with my backyard.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.640
 - Wait, was that actually your backyard?

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.480
 - Yeah, that's my backyard.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.200
 It's just like, it's like a nice camera and a good angle.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.800
 It makes my backyard look giant.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.120
 - Was it the tweet about like,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.960
 make it a wedding venue, that one?

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.800
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.880
 - Yeah, I did see that.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.440
 I didn't even realize that was your house.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.600
 I thought you were saying like,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.000
 yours could pull that off.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.880
 That's crazy.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.800
 - No, that's literally my house.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.520
 - Why is Twitter search bad?

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.920
 I hear people say that and I never knew what they meant,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.000
 but like, I'm searching.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.200
 - You just got my profile and go to media,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.480
 it's like the first thing.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.320
 - Oh, media.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.160
 - No, the media time thing.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.080
 It's the ninth thing, you do it a lot.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.040
 (laughing)

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.000
 - I think I posted that much media.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.280
 - Oh yeah, sure enough, is that,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.400
 is that like one of Liz's relatives in the photo?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.240
 Who is that?

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.080
 - Yeah, it's her mom.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.920
 - That is your house.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.760
 Wow.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.560
 Look at that.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.320
 - Just the camera and the, yeah, the tables.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.280
 - Did you hire a bartender?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.000
 - That guy was there.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.360
 Oh no, I guess you missed the party the last year,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.200
 but yeah, if we've been hiring a bartender every time,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.320
 we do a thing at our house,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.000
 'cause it's not that expensive

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.560
 and they do all, it's not just him,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.280
 it's him and like two other people.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.120
 - Yeah.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.680
 - And they just make everything extra nice.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.600
 Like we had these mango drink,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.720
 'cause the mango themed baby shower,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.800
 we had these mango drinks to serve.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.160
 And instead of just like serving the drinks in a glass,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.120
 they like decorated it with all this stuff,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.120
 they don't even know where they pulled that out of.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.800
 And it just looked so nice.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.320
 And yeah, they're not that expensive

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.680
 and yeah, they'll just like help make your party feel nicer.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.960
 - Oh man, the tables, the chairs, the trees in your backyard.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.920
 I don't realize how majestic they are

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.760
 when I've been there.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.960
 - Yeah, when you look up.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.800
 - Yeah.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.640
 - I just don't look up.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.600
 Do you do the thing where you just like never look around you

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.520
 when you're in a place?

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.960
 - So I don't look down and Liz for some reason

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.160
 is always looking down when we would walk around.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.480
 And remember when we lived in New York,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.120
 this was an actual problem because

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.600
 you would just see the most messed up stuff on the ground.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.760
 And I would just never see it.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.200
 And she'd always pointed out to me.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.680
 Sometimes it's useful 'cause it's like,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.000
 I'm about to step on a dog poop.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.160
 But a lot of times it was like,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.400
 oh look, a pigeon that was flattened over and over.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.240
 - Oh geez, yeah.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.320
 You don't wanna see that stuff.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.840
 - You know, just disturbing stuff on the ground.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.560
 So I don't look down when I walk,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.480
 but Liz always looks down and she always just has these.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.560
 - Okay, I look down.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.400
 - Oh you do?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.920
 - Yeah, I only look down.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.160
 Like we have a lot of geese in our neighborhood

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.920
 and they just poop all over the sidewalk.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.000
 So I'm always like, I'm going on walks

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.960
 in these sidewalks every day

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.360
 and I'm looking to make sure I never step on goose poop.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.320
 Never have.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.160
 I'm pretty good at this.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.660
 - I literally step in dog poop like once a week.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.800
 Are you serious?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.880
 - Just in my own backyard.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.200
 - Oh.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.080
 - You don't wear shoes in the house.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.440
 You do wear shoes in the house.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.200
 Oh God, no, oh.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.600
 - But hang on, Adam, I don't wear shoes outside.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.000
 - Oh, so you stepping it barefoot.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.840
 - Yeah.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.760
 - It's even worse.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.960
 - 'Cause you gotta put shoes on to keep your house clean.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.000
 - But hang on, your reaction was that I step in dog poop

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.760
 and then walk in my house with the dog poop on that.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.240
 I know I stepped in it so I like blast it

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.080
 with the hose right away.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.160
 - Oh you know, so you fix it.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.000
 - Okay.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.920
 - I got you. - But also I'm barefoot.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.700
 So I get to, I get to like go between my toes

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.540
 and I really feel it.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.640
 - Oh my God.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.720
 That just gave me like play-doh memories,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.520
 like all the little play-doh tools,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.040
 the way they like squeeze the tree.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.040
 - Exactly, exactly like that.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.880
 And then you get an instant,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.160
 it like kicks up a bunch of smell too, so.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.640
 - Yeah, so I only look down.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.320
 I never look at like the horizon.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.440
 Like when we go through town,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.440
 like I could drive into my town of like 10,000 people

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.320
 and probably find new buildings all over the place.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.000
 So I just don't like, if we drive through it,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.600
 I don't look at anything.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.440
 Does that make sense?

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.200
 - I'm very absent-minded and I don't pay attention.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.240
 So I don't know for me, it's about physically looking

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.440
 but I'm similar where I just don't notice anything.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.200
 - I feel like you notice everything.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.040
 You're the person on Twitter that I follow

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.520
 that notices things.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.320
 Oh no, but it's not things like around you.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.400
 It's like things that are true in the world.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.280
 You just, you're too busy thinking about big thoughts

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.080
 to notice like what's around you.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.920
 Is that what you're saying?

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.440
 - Yeah, that's like what the absent mind is.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.000
 Like I'm like walking around, I'm looking,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.880
 but like my eyes aren't actually seeing anything.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.560
 It's just kind of passing right through.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.600
 It's kind of like when people drive,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.240
 like they don't remember driving, it's-

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.160
 - Right.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.200
 - Some of that but like love life.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.480
 - Now I'm just looking at all your tweets.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.320
 Why do I get on Twitter?

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.280
 I should stop, I should just not do it

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.880
 'cause I have so many questions now

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.280
 but they're not pertinent.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.520
 What were we talking about?

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.480
 Oh, you've been doing good.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.120
 You had a baby shower, it's hot there.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.560
 It's rained here for like three weeks in a row.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.640
 Like the sun is out today

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.480
 but it's felt like a vampire movie for real for weeks.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.320
 It's awful.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.140
 Like we got back.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.640
 - Is that why you look so depressed?

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.200
 - I mean, kind of, that's one of the reasons, yeah.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.320
 - You kind of look like a vampire, something about it.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.800
 I think it's 'cause you're wearing black

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.240
 but you also got the deep V going on, so like-

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.920
 - Oh yeah, it's just a jacket.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.760
 It's like a sexy vampire.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.600
 - It's a very low.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.160
 - Yeah, okay.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.840
 I am in a very dark room, like extremely dark.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.320
 So, I don't know, I wanna talk about stuff.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.520
 We're gonna be on a podcast, we should talk about stuff.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.920
 What are we talking about today?

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.320
 - I don't even know what's going on.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.240
 I guess we haven't talked about,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.520
 we just talk about AI every single podcast, but-

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.800
 - I know, I get so tired of it.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.040
 I just wanna rebrand this thing.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.280
 Like, I don't know, what are the AI podcast names?

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.760
 They have the dumbest names I swear to God.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.040
 - We would AI generate it, obviously.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.560
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.720
 Have a name dash in there and everything.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.080
 - But do we, I guess we didn't talk about Cloud 4?

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.920
 I think Cloud 4-

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.760
 - We haven't talked about Cloud 4.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.600
 - Or do we talk about Cloud 4?

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.440
 - There's always something to talk about with AI.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.160
 Did people doing crypto podcasts feel this way too?

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.600
 Were they always something to talk about with the chain?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.440
 - Did they say the chain?

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.440
 I don't know, I'm just guessing.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.480
 - The chains, there's a new chain, and there's a side chain.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.560
 - So I decided to, that's fine.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.760
 I've done this so many times,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.760
 so I'm sure you guys hear me say this a bunch of times.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.880
 I canceled all of my open AI subscriptions

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.160
 and I'm trying to move.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.580
 (laughing)

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.440
 I'm trying to centralize on Cloud now,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.080
 'cause I saw Cloud got the voice support in the mobile app,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.920
 which is the main thing I use open AI for.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.320
 And I'm just so annoyed

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.960
 with the infinite model selections in open AI.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.880
 And I really appreciate how Cloud 4 just came out

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.600
 and just replaced all the Cloud 3 stuff.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.760
 You never look at that again.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.680
 They're not keeping it around.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.400
 And it's the same price, everything.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.240
 So it's just simpler.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.000
 - I guess, do you still pay for Google?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.440
 You still have Gemini?

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.640
 Or I guess Gemini is kind of free.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.440
 I can't figure out Gemini's pricing model.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.280
 I don't actually know.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.960
 - I think I pay for Google One,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.840
 which is like, 'cause I use this storage

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.840
 and a bunch of other stuff.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.120
 And I think I pay for the two that have Gemini,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.400
 but I never open Gemini though.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.840
 - Oh, you don't open Gemini.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.480
 So for a while, I was doing like the open Grock Gemini

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.160
 and opening AI all at the same time.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.800
 I'd have like 03 and then Gemini 2.5 and then Grock 3.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.720
 And I just asked them all the same question.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.760
 And then I probably don't even look at all three answers.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.720
 I just kind of end up on one of them.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.760
 But I was doing that and it is really, really stressful.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.400
 Like I don't like this feeling of,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.120
 I don't even know what's best for what anymore.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.360
 So I would like to consolidate.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.400
 - The other issue I kept having with open AI is like,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.480
 I would just, I would use it for something simple,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.800
 but then I would have actually I've selected some like

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.040
 intense model and it would just take forever to respond.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:31.880
 So I don't know.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.560
 My product experience with Chad JBT has just

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.160
 it like peaked a long time ago.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.440
 And it just feels bad to use now.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.720
 - Kind of has not been so much.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.240
 - Yeah, so that guy is.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.800
 So I should probably just never open AI again.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.760
 Like there's nothing about like using open AI

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.720
 that I feel like is unique that I can't get elsewhere.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.520
 So I don't know why I ever use it.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.360
 'Cause I really do.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.200
 I hate that.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.160
 - I just have this stupid habit of typing CHA in my URL

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.880
 for him to go to chat.openai.com and I keep doing it.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.440
 So it's like crazy how sticky some of that stuff is.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.880
 - Yeah, I was just gonna ask you.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.160
 So you consolidate it on cloud,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.800
 but I don't know, is cloud four that much better?

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.560
 My overwhelming feelings with cloud four are

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.160
 I'm a little bummed that it is very clear

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.040
 the gains are marginal these days.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.720
 Like I don't, I didn't feel like it's that much better

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.560
 than three seven.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.640
 Maybe I just haven't used it enough,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.040
 but it just feels like four I'd really hyped up for.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.000
 That could be the problem too.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.320
 In my mind, I'd really hyped up what four was gonna represent

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.960
 at like one Dario comment where he was like,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.160
 saving big numbers like four for the major improvements.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.000
 - Right.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.840
 - And for some reason in my mind,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.560
 I thought like we can't even imagine what this is gonna be like.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.400
 And they just came out,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.880
 I didn't expect to come out this soon either.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.680
 So I don't know, I was overall a little disappointed,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.960
 but it's definitely better.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.160
 And it's better in the use case that we have particularly,

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.240
 but I think I built it up too much.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.080
 - Yeah, I mean, this is, we talked about doing building

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.000
 like a proper benchmark because I just have

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.200
 all these qualitative, not I'm not gonna say qualitative,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.220
 qualitative feel is useful

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.880
 if it's done in a consistent environment.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.880
 My issue is every time I try as new models,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.160
 it's like I'm working on a different project

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.960
 than I was a week ago and like, I don't know,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.920
 it's just hard to understand what my feelings are.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.960
 But my feelings are, it feels faster to me.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.360
 I don't know if that's like totally made up

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.440
 'cause I don't know why it would be,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.400
 but I feel like both in open code and in open control,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.640
 like doing some of the support stuff,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.460
 I'm like, I feel like it's not as slow as before.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.000
 And then I feel like it just feels like tighter.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.920
 I think that's the word I would use.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.160
 It feels less like it's gonna go

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.680
 and do some random crazy thing.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.640
 It feels like narrower and what it tries to do.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.880
 So it feels better to me, but yeah,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.440
 it's not like fundamentally changing what we can or can't do.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.520
 - Are you using opus at all or just on it?

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.960
 - I haven't tried opus.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.280
 - No. - Yeah.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.800
 - Like, again, I don't know when to switch

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.120
 to these things.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.400
 - That's a big pain point.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.960
 Knowing sonnet versus opus is like a thing I don't.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.520
 I think I just, like with Claude Mack,

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.240
 I'm just starting with opus.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.240
 And then when I run out of it, I guess I'll use sonnet,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.160
 but maybe that's why I didn't necessarily

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.400
 think it was a seat faster.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.440
 Maybe opus is not faster.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.560
 - Oh, yeah.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.920
 I basically assumed opus was gonna be really slow

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.880
 and the pricing just, I just wasn't interested in trying

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.680
 'cause it was something I would use every day.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.720
 So switching topics a little bit.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.680
 I read something interesting today.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.160
 It's still in the category of AI,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.920
 but a little bit different.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.000
 People keep talking about, I think Dario again,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.680
 was saying something about like,

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.520
 there's gonna be a huge hit to white collar jobs,

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.280
 whatever, the whole like job displacement question.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.040
 I saw an interesting comment today.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.600
 I have a Hyundai and I know that Hyundai

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.800
 was building a factory in Alabama.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.320
 So if you can take advantage of some of the tax credit stuff,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.160
 me and my infinite poor timing,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.400
 had to buy a car during chip shortage,

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.920
 during like no cars being available,

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.680
 and right after Biden rolled back

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.160
 the tax credit for electric vehicles,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.680
 like they had to be made in America.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.760
 So my Hyundai was the last one that was not made in America.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.400
 And ever since then, they've been made here.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.520
 And they're so cheap now, compared to what I paid for it.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.680
 Anyway, so not over it, pretty upset about the whole situation.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.400
 But they make them in Alabama now.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.880
 And there was an interesting stat where the facility

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.200
 is crazy automated, where each vehicle

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.680
 takes 24 hours of human labor, that's at the cost.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.880
 And if you value that at like 30 bucks an hour,

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.440
 40 bucks an hour, whatever,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.320
 it's like around a thousand dollars per vehicle

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.320
 of human labor.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.840
 - 24 hours is only a thousand dollars.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.640
 Oh man, our tech employee is showing.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.840
 - But yeah, 24 times 50 is 1200.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.520
 So let's say around a thousand, brother.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.520
 - Holy cow, no wonder people have employees.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.680
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.560
 So this is a reminder.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.160
 And I've heard this thing talked about for so long.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.960
 Like years and years, this keeps coming back where

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.240
 we just assume that infinitely automating everything

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.760
 makes economic sense, but human labor is pretty cheap already.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.080
 And we've automated a ton of stuff already.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.680
 So if you look at that, their factory, okay,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.480
 maybe you can do something to cut the human labor in half.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.800
 And that's worth something, you know,

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.520
 $5 a vehicle is pretty good.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.000
 But your gains are probably more on like,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.960
 just trying to make the machines go twice as fast

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.280
 and trying to like improve the automation you already have.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.120
 - Yeah.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.320
 - Even if it still takes, you know, 24 hours per car,

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.480
 like maybe you're, maybe the automated size producing them

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.480
 twice as fast or something.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.760
 - So many people working on them.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.920
 - Interesting.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.120
 - So like, I think when people talk about automation,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.160
 they have such like a naive sense of it.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.280
 They just imagine like, oh, like the humans are the parts

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.680
 that needs to be worked on.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.640
 By the way, AI can help with automation of the factory parts,

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.200
 but you can see out in this situation,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.520
 it's not removing any jobs,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.480
 or the incentive isn't to like remove the jobs.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.680
 If you double the automation side and the demands there,

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.320
 you're actually gonna double the demand for the human labor

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.360
 not as well.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.200
 So yeah, these situations are just so much more complicated

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.760
 than they're portrayed.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.920
 - I got so wrapped up in the like car factory example

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.760
 you gave and like the human wages thing

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.920
 that I just forgot we were talking about losing jobs.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.280
 And like, oh yeah, this is okay.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.800
 I see how it all ties back to replacing humans.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.360
 Man, that's all over the timeline right now.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.760
 I don't know if you've noticed Twitter,

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.920
 it's just like it's constant bombardment with people

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.800
 predicting the end of software engineering.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.040
 And I know software engineering is definitely the like

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.600
 the place where AI is currently most effective,

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.200
 but man, people are coming out of the woodworks.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.160
 It's really annoying.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.240
 It's just really annoying because one,

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.440
 it's like can't predict any of this stuff.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.360
 But two, it's like all the predictions are coming

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.920
 from these very loud people who like make platforms

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.800
 that are no code things.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.360
 - The replica, I swear, if I see him on one more podcast,

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.280
 I'm gonna lose my mind.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.000
 That guy, why is he bothering me so much?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.280
 - No, he's extremely unlikable.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.560
 He's always been this way.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.400
 - Okay.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.240
 - Yeah.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.480
 - And then I don't feel so bad for not liking him.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.400
 I really don't like him.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.840
 - No, he's very annoying.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.160
 So I tried V zero again yesterday

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.920
 and I have such a funny feeling with it

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.440
 where it is such a well done product.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.160
 Like if you're gonna build a product in that shape,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.280
 it's really well done.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.040
 All these nice little details, really cool UX.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:55.640
 They've pushed as far as some of these underlying LMs can do.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.440
 But my feeling around it was it's missing

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.440
 the most old traditional concept,

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.000
 which is when a user goes and uses your product,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 do they feel like, wow, that felt good to do right away?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.840
 'Cause I want to try it and the experience was,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.080
 despite all the polish, the great design,

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.160
 the great UX and all that stuff,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.440
 my feeling was, okay, I go try something.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.200
 Wow, this is taking forever.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.800
 I'm gonna go do something else and come back when it's done.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.880
 I come back, wow, that's a disappointing result.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.880
 So no product is successful

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.280
 unless people get to the aha moment

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.880
 and feel great about it pretty quickly.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:48.720
 So so many of these products, AI related products,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.760
 they're like missing this old foundational,

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.600
 traditional thing.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.160
 You just cannot have a successful product

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.880
 without pulling users to that point.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.720
 And I get that everyone is just waiting for the LMs

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.640
 to become actually magical in these tasks

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.800
 and then it'll feel that way.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.760
 But they really don't right now

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.840
 and it's kind of like, it's weird that most people

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.960
 have a disappointing experience.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.040
 Like it's tough to work on a product where that's a case.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.160
 Even if it is successful for some people,

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.360
 it kind of limits how it grows.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.560
 And if you look at something like Chachi BT,

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.160
 that actually fulfills that.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.320
 Like when you go to use Chachi BT and you ask a question,

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.280
 almost always you're like, wow, what a great answer.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.000
 Like, wow, it's exactly what I was looking for.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.360
 But specifically for these app builder things,

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.280
 or these like things that are trying to layer on top,

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.720
 it's almost never like, wow, that was a magical experience.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.680
 What's funny is what feels magical is a deploy button

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.360
 hitting deploy and having an instantly live,

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.760
 which is their old traditional product,

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.120
 not having to do with AI.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.000
 That's where the magic actually is.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.600
 Yeah, so it's kind of weird.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.120
 - Yeah, like what is the way that they could make it?

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.480
 I mean, aside from the models, just getting way better.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.840
 - Yeah, it's on their control.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.800
 - It's just, that's it, isn't it?

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.720
 It's just, if the first prompt is a miss,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.880
 like if it doesn't deliver.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.160
 Yeah, and it does, it feels like you just know,

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.440
 they're all just sitting back there.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.800
 'Cause I've even said it about stuff.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.040
 Well, the models will get better.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.440
 Like, it's like they build this whole city

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.840
 and it's like, well, there'll be people someday.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.720
 It's like all the buildings are there.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.720
 We're ready for it.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.040
 But like, yeah, what if it doesn't get better

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.680
 at that particular thing?

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.000
 That's the thing that's encouraging to me

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.080
 on the like enhancing programmers tooling

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.240
 the open codes of the world.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.080
 - The bar's a lot lower.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.880
 - Yeah, like I feel like the models are good enough right now

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.800
 to make our job way better.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.360
 And it's just now, on that side,

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.320
 I feel like it's a huge lack of the tooling,

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.840
 a huge lack of, I guess the cursor exists,

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.520
 but it doesn't feel like the cities have been built up

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.840
 nearly as much as the no code, like app builder stuff.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.480
 There's like so many of those

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.600
 and less focus on augmenting engineers,

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.120
 where I feel like the models are actually really effective.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.560
 - Yeah, and I think it's frustrating to work.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.400
 'Cause I remember when we used to work

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.800
 on SSD, the older versions were built on top of CDK

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.120
 and it was very frustrating to have a user,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.920
 new user come in, try it, have a bad experience

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.760
 and likely turn forever

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.720
 because of something that was out of our control.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.800
 Like it is the worst feeling ever.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.320
 So when you're building these products

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.320
 and you don't work on the LOM,

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.960
 it must also be really frustrating.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.720
 - Yeah, you must just wanna like get on podcasts

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.880
 and talk about the end of software development

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.520
 and get angry on Twitter at anybody

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.760
 who tweets anything bad about Replitt, sorry.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.160
 Someone's specific in mind. (laughing)

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.040
 - Yeah, so like it is not a,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.840
 I just know for sure that can be

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.760
 and with open code, it doesn't feel that way.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.480
 It feels like, oh, there's so much for us to do

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.640
 before we even hit like, okay, we're--

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.640
 - To vanishing returns.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.720
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.880
 Yeah, I don't know where all those tools go,

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.800
 'cause there's so many of them,

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.680
 they're all in heavy competition with each other.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.600
 - I just saw a tweet today

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.920
 that was some guy, which I made a list, by the way,

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.280
 on Twitter, Twitter meta discussion.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.320
 I made a list where it's just like a private list,

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.160
 I didn't know you could do that.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.080
 So I just have people, I wanna see their tweets,

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.640
 like only these people.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.360
 - That's supposed to be your following list,

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.120
 but you have this whole thing.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.280
 - Yeah, but I have the whole social chain on follow.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.200
 - I can't follow people, that's mean.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.760
 But it doesn't default to that type,

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.800
 so I always end up scrolling through the for you first

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.720
 and it pisses me out so much.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.120
 But anyway, I saw this random tweet

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.840
 from some random person who's like,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.840
 "I tried all 87 AI agentic coding tools."

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.600
 And they always use like totally different names,

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.760
 like no one knows what this category is eating at all,

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.320
 but they lump them all together.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.840
 It's like, the first one is like,

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.640
 goes from lovable to like cursor to windsurf to like both.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.300
 And it's like, these are not the same kind of tool,

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.000
 replica and like, it's just like,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.480
 my wife tried to use cursor

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.680
 and it's not a tool for non-programmers.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.320
 And whereas lovable, but these things are very much geared

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.960
 towards non-programmers, right?

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.440
 Like it's just totally different products,

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.920
 but they get lumped into the same category.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.920
 It's all very confusing.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.480
 - Yeah, it's like where in the spectrum,

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.280
 it's like a spectrum of like who it's for,

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.320
 but then if you're on certain points of spectrum,

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.160
 your product is fundamentally like different.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.800
 - I think there could be a place for all these app builders

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.760
 or for that category, like it does make sense to me

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.440
 that I hate all the local shops like my barber

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.640
 or like the county clerk website,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.840
 all these websites are terrible.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.360
 And I would love for them to just build them

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.000
 with these tools that are making much better websites.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.880
 That makes sense to me, restaurants, whoever,

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.680
 you have a small business, you wanna have a website

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.760
 or you wanna have some little apps, it does a thing.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.880
 Sounds great.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.200
 But like CEOs of those companies making, okay,

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.560
 the replet guy, you do not need to go out

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.880
 and talk about the end of software engineering

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.240
 because that's not what you're making.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.640
 Like your product has nothing to do

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.160
 with the future of software development.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.000
 You know what I mean?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.480
 Like it's just a totally different thing.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.120
 And he just thinks like programmers won't even be needed.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.720
 And I don't get how they can't, like he's a CEO,

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.400
 he's been doing this for how long?

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.120
 How long has that company been around eight years

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:03.960
 or something?

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.000
 Like has he not thought critically enough about the fact

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.440
 that his product doesn't eliminate software engineers

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.760
 in the future now ever?

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.600
 It won't.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.280
 Like that's not even the category.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.560
 Am I just crazy?

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.040
 - It's, no, I mean, it's just funny.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.440
 Like this is just what these periods of time are like.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.480
 Like you remember what crypto was like?

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.960
 Did you see my tweet the other day where I was like,

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.080
 during peak crypto, there was one conversation

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.600
 that kept coming up over and over and over

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.280
 and there was debate on both sides

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.480
 and then CEOs, you know, were saying one thing

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.560
 and people were saying the other thing.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.000
 It felt exactly the same way it feels now.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.200
 The question was, oh, well, crypto replaced dollars.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.880
 Well, it will replace money, right?

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.040
 And that was the entire conversation.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.280
 You were, you would like filter to one side or the other

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.160
 and you argued about that.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.600
 And in the end, it's like looking back on it.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.000
 It was just so irrelevant.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.400
 Like you could have been right that crypto

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.200
 doesn't replace dollars.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.720
 But if you use that logic to bet against crypto.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.640
 - You got wiped out.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.920
 - Yeah, like it's doing great regardless, right?

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.000
 - Like it's a huge, how many is it a trillion dollar market now?

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.200
 Like how big is the cryptocurrency?

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.120
 It's big. - Whatever it is, Bitcoin is high up.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.360
 - Yeah, 107K or something.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.480
 - That's such a good point.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.800
 - But then if you're on the other side,

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.120
 if you're on the side of, it's definitely gonna replace money

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.120
 and you went hard on like projects and stuff

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.840
 where it was meant to be like this thing

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.120
 that took over all consumers and everyone was using Bitcoin,

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.240
 you also lost.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.640
 - Yeah, so you really should sum this up in a tweet

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.720
 'cause that tweet that I saw,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.400
 the one where you're like, it's the wrong question.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.240
 I did not tie it all together.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.080
 A lot of your tweets.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.560
 I'm not smart enough to actually understand what you mean.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.320
 I'm like, that sounds very wise, Dax,

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.920
 but I don't know what you mean.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.000
 - So what happens is sometimes I don't,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.800
 I think I have like roughly a good point,

00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.800
 but I know how to express it.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.360
 So I literally opened it and I hope people project

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.240
 like whatever meaning they make it smart into it.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.080
 - And then when they project a really dumb one,

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.840
 you just quote tweet one of your old tweets.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.160
 It's like you're an idiot.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.560
 (laughing)

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.560
 Just reply. - Exactly.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.520
 - You're dumb. - Yeah.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.120
 - You missed the point.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.800
 Okay, well that point you just made,

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.680
 I feel like it's the most, that's tied me back

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.160
 to that crypto era.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.080
 And I can see now how AI could play out similarly

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.840
 where there is like this enormous value being unlocked,

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.920
 but we just don't even know where that is yet

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.680
 or it's still yet to be.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.520
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.240
 It's like if you're betting that,

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.920
 all software engineering is gonna go away,

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.160
 that's the equivalent of being like the dollars going away.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.520
 And if you're betting that this is all totally a scam

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.240
 is not gonna work at all,

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.480
 you're probably gonna lose also.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.560
 So the question is like, what is the right question to ask?

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.880
 And it's just so, so, so difficult in the moment.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.520
 I've been having so much.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.800
 - Is it possible in the moment?

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.120
 You think it's actually possible to know the right question?

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.000
 - Yeah, someone lands on the right.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.800
 Someone has clarity and someone gets the right place.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.720
 - But did they actually have clarity or did they get lucky?

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.320
 Like did they just choose the right thing?

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.160
 - No, you make a bet.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.200
 Like I mean, everyone's making a bet.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.920
 I think some people's bets are right.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.640
 And then do they know for sure?

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.240
 No, part of it is luck, whatever.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.720
 But I have so much more,

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.080
 I understand something I've always was confused about

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:22.920
 for a long time.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.760
 I don't know if I've talked about it before,

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.560
 but because my dad was in tech,

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.920
 at some point I was looking around and I'm like,

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.280
 man, how did he like not build Uber?

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.520
 How did he not build Airbnb?

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.440
 Like why didn't he like do this?

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.280
 Why didn't he do that?

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.760
 Like he technically was in near it

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.760
 and he like had the skills to like all these things

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.320
 in hindsight seem so obvious.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.480
 And he realized like in the moment,

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.160
 there's just so much noise

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.160
 and there's so much opportunity to work on things

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.720
 that just don't make any sense.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.760
 Like that's what 99% of them are.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.280
 And it's such a small sliver of them

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.000
 that actually makes sense and seem really obvious in hindsight.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Now going through these errors,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.840
 I'm like, I'm going to look back.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.200
 If I like, you know, miss a lot of these things

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.680
 or like don't super nail it,

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.200
 I'm sure my kids are going to look back and be like,

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.200
 how like you were right there?

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.080
 Like how come you didn't, you know,

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.560
 how come you didn't found Coinbase?

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.600
 How come you didn't like, you know, do these things,

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.160
 but it's so hard.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.360
 - Yeah, my kids are like, why didn't you make Minecraft?

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.760
 This is the best thing in the world.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.720
 And how could you not have done this?

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.040
 You program, what are you even doing with your life?

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.960
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.320
 - I had this idea in my head

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.280
 that something you said just reminded me,

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.320
 it happened in my sleep last night.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.840
 I mean, like when I can't sleep

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.600
 and I have lots of thoughts.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:43.600
 This like analogy of like these big venture capital

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.320
 moments, like when, when venture capital focuses on a thing,

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.520
 like in this case, AI, where it's like everything

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.400
 that gets invested in is AI.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.760
 And there's just so much money

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.360
 and so many companies creating it.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:00.440
 Remind me of like, like universe creation.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.360
 Like we think of like all the energy,

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.400
 like all that crazy amount of mass.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.520
 And it's just like explodes.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.880
 And that's like all the money.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.920
 And then it like congeals into like stars, you know what I mean?

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.480
 And like, or like clusters of things.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.960
 It's like they're all getting acquired

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.960
 and like focusing into the right things.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.800
 You know what I mean?

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.640
 They just kind of like visually it works for me.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.880
 That just visually makes sense.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.200
 - Yeah, it clicks for me too.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.720
 Is there something satisfying about that, that imagery?

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.600
 I think what's funny about this stuff

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.600
 and Jay posted to me about this other day is unlike your example

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.520
 where there's like an initial burst of energy

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:39.520
 and everything is just a chain reaction, VCs kind of operate.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.560
 Like that's true where they're like,

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.760
 I forgot what Jay's tweet was.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.320
 It was something like, the world is going to change

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.880
 and I'm just going to wait patiently

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.800
 while that happens on its own.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.240
 You know, it's like, it's not that like there's a force

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.880
 of nature changing the world.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.080
 It's like people dragging like individuals one by one

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.440
 and dragging users one by one.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.000
 And like it's such this intense like intentional human process

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.840
 but investors are just like, there's a trend

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.040
 and I'm going to like my sales

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.680
 and it's going to like carry me, you know?

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.760
 - Take three, four.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.440
 - Yeah, you'd literally do nothing.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.600
 - And they had this perspective that like,

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.920
 oh, there's these shifts that just happened

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.560
 but now like people are like pulling the world

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.400
 through those shifts.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.960
 - Yeah, VC, the whole VC thing is a, I hate to say,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.800
 I don't know if I should say negative things

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.800
 about VCs on my chest.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.640
 I should, okay.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.720
 Well, yeah, why would I sometimes?

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.160
 - I mean, I posted that picture of my cone head.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.160
 Like I don't think.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.120
 (both laughing)

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.000
 - Well, they just, they remind me so much

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.520
 they're like upper class real estate agents to me.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.800
 Like that whole profession of real estate agents

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.400
 is just like, what are you again?

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.200
 What, it's like, it's like a middle man kind of

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.720
 but it's like, do I even need you?

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.560
 I don't know.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.040
 We do need venture capitalists

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.880
 because I don't know a lot of old rich.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.000
 Well, I know some.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.560
 - That's really, the requirement for the job

00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.560
 is you need to know.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.400
 - Yeah.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.240
 - Like you need to know rich people.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.080
 - That's literally it.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:02.920
 - Yeah.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.760
 - And you can raise the fund.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.600
 - Mm hmm.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.440
 - It's interesting.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.760
 - It's like, I actually know enough to raise a fund.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.840
 I just think it's the most boring job in the world.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.800
 - I think the funniest, think of the funniest outcome

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.880
 would be DAX becomes like the mean,

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.760
 the funniest like stereotypical VC.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.760
 - No, I don't have it in me.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.840
 Like it's not.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.680
 - It'd be pretty funny.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.520
 - I just don't.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.360
 I don't have it in me.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.180
 It would be funny.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.020
 - Actually, it wouldn't be that funny

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:27.840
 if you made a lot of money.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.680
 - I think it would be confusing.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.520
 If I made a lot of money.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.360
 - It'd be confusing.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.200
 Yeah.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.040
 It'd be awesome if you made a lot of money.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.880
 - Like I do as a joke

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.720
 but then I have like three years of time.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.640
 - And then yeah, I actually succeed.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.480
 Yeah.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.320
 - Yeah.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.160
 - That's funny.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.600
 You're bio like early in XYZ

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.240
 and all the different companies you were early in.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.920
 It's so funny how like every profession has like

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.520
 the Twitter bio like cookie cutter template.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.360
 You know what I mean?

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.360
 Like you can look at somebody's Twitter bio

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.360
 and know what they do without even like knowing

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.640
 where they work or what they do.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.160
 - There's a VC that I really dislike.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.360
 I found his Twitter bio really funny

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.920
 because I can't remember his name or anything about him

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.560
 but it's like you go to his Twitter bio

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.720
 and it's like there's like 50 companies tagged.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.240
 It's like the most amount of things.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.480
 It's like I'm involved in all of these.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.600
 It's like how does he not realize

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.880
 that the more companies you put the more of a joke

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.160
 it looks like that you're claiming any association with them.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.040
 It's like you can't actually be involved

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:24.960
 in all these companies.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.400
 So clearly you're just pulling up any possible thread.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.240
 Yeah.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.080
 - Yeah.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.800
 - Oh man.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.520
 I feel like I don't want to talk about Twitter anymore.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.680
 I feel like we talk so much about it.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.760
 I feel like our podcast is becoming me

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.800
 and you catching up on like what we tweeted.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.920
 (laughing)

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.920
 And like I should just do that on Slack.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.720
 I should just ask you when I have questions about your Twitter

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.400
 that we could talk about other things.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.720
 (laughing)

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.560
 - That's true.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.080
 (laughing)

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.040
 I'm just imagining getting DM's from you being like,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:55.880
 "Hey, nice post.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.880
 "Like what does this mean exactly?"

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.680
 - Yeah, what does this mean?

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.120
 - I just learned what depot means today.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:01.960
 I still don't know what that is.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.880
 - Apparently this part of Twitter or no, I actually don't know.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.560
 - I know the acronym.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.680
 I just, it's like a, I don't really understand it.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.520
 - What could you confirm?

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.600
 Is it this part of Twitter?

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.360
 'Cause I think I saw five different answers.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.240
 - I think it's like that part of Twitter or something.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.640
 - That part of Twitter, okay.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.480
 - Yeah.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.880
 Anyway, just kind of moving away from this zone.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.720
 - Yes.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.440
 - Did you see that remakes finally announced the thing?

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.440
 - Yes.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.880
 Well, I got halfway through the article probably.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.800
 - My attention is not that good anymore.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.200
 But I got to the part where they explained,

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.640
 did Ryan write that article?

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.640
 - I think it was a team effort.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.840
 - Or both kind of Michael.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.680
 - Yeah.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.160
 - I got to the part where whoever explained

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:49.240
 that they're like starting fresh, remix three is like not,

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.800
 is it not built on top of React Router?

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.480
 Is it like starting to crash?

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.400
 - No, it's like they're trying to build a new thing

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.400
 with a certain set of constraints and they're exploring that.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.480
 - Does React Router like acquired?

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.080
 Like, what did Shopify acquire?

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.200
 The team?

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.040
 - Shopify acquired, yeah, the team.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.880
 But React Router now has like an open governance thing

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.720
 that they set up.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.480
 - Okay, so are they still at Shopify?

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.160
 Are they leaving Shopify and building remix?

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.000
 - Yes, they're still at Shopify.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.120
 - Okay, so remakes is still a Shopify thing or no?

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.080
 Or does it matter?

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:17.920
 Maybe it doesn't matter.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.120
 - They have support from the Shopify CEO to go this route.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:21.960
 - Gotcha.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.800
 - Which is what?

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.640
 I think matters.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.480
 - Yeah.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.320
 - So it's going to be a new web framework.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.600
 Can you catch me up? You probably read the whole article

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.880
 or talk about it or something.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.640
 - I've like kind of known about this for a bit.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.680
 So the main detail is this new thing they're building,

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.880
 it's not going to be built on top of React.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.360
 It's going to be built on top of Preact,

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.840
 which is like, in a lot of ways it's all the best parts

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.840
 of React just like slimmed down.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.000
 Kind of like the React that we remember

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.440
 before it got really crazy.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.720
 - The React, I remember.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.120
 - They're setting constraints themselves,

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.840
 which is they're not going to try to solve any problems

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.080
 using like compiler tricks.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.200
 - Right.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.280
 - Which I think people interpret in a wide range of ways.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.960
 They're like, oh, they're saying that everyone using

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.440
 this new thing needs to like go down this no-built path

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.520
 where it's just like JavaScript files and whatever.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.720
 I interpret it a little differently.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.840
 I think about it more like it's more about setting constraints

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.720
 themselves to push them in like an unexplored design space

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.440
 where they will build a framework around these constraints.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.320
 They believe that will lead to something good

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.240
 or have these good side effects.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.520
 You can still have like a heavy build process on top

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.680
 that if you need it, a lot of production apps do.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.920
 So I thought there was exploring this.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.080
 I think pretty much unexplored area of,

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:45.800
 hey, if we need to do SSR and SSR framework,

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.760
 almost everyone uses file-based routing

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.080
 because that helps you easily split

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.080
 the different routes and things like that.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:52.920
 But they can't do that.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.480
 So what would an SSR framework look like

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.280
 when you can't rely on getting a file system

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.520
 during building stuff?

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.480
 - For dummies, real quick.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.000
 Why can't they do that?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.120
 So if they don't have a compile step,

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.400
 they can't do file-based routing or is that what you're saying?

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.880
 - Yeah, so file-based routing is an example

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.200
 of something that needs a compile step, right?

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.960
 'Cause something needs to scan your file system

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.880
 and like pull out the files and know that, okay,

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.560
 this file is for client, this file is for server,

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.400
 like no stuff like that.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.760
 - I see, yeah. - Or the RIC thing

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.440
 where there's like, they use client thing at the top,

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.200
 you need some kind of compiler to go and analyze that

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.680
 and do it.

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:31.680
 So I think about it more like for like developer-facing features,

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.520
 there's no feature in their framework

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.840
 that's gonna require something like that.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.600
 But I think a lot of the conversation

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.040
 is now devolving into the build versus no build game,

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.880
 which-- - Yeah, I saw like Evan--

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.760
 - Yeah, I mean, Evan's questions were good.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.760
 I think he had like, his question's basically hinted

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.920
 at this thing, which is, well, there's certain things

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.320
 that are just impractical.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.600
 But yeah, I don't see that as like,

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.600
 you can still do those things.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.760
 It's more about not giving it to the temptation of,

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.880
 hey, there's this problem.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.600
 If we do some fancy compiler trick,

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.560
 we can actually solve it and see what a framework looks like

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.520
 when you adhere to those.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.720
 - So it's the two-y thing.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:16.400
 It's like constraints just make for different design decisions.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.760
 And that's fun.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.600
 I like that.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.760
 - At least that's how I was interpreting it.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.080
 But then today, it might go--

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.780
 - Did they correct you?

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.160
 - Well, today I might go post it something like,

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.880
 who's telling you you need a bundler?

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.920
 Is it your users?

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.520
 Is it the browser?

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.600
 Or is it the guy that makes a bundler?

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.680
 (both laughing)

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.080
 - So maybe there really isn't going to be a bundler.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.400
 And I'd be very curious how that works out.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.480
 - Like, are they, yeah, so I don't know.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.040
 I don't know if they're just doing that for fun,

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.320
 but it's hard to tell.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.800
 'Cause remember how remix was when they first came out?

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.320
 And they were like always starting these like--

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.520
 - Oh yeah, there was a lot of, yeah.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.080
 Since I've been acquired from Shopify,

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.040
 I've almost forgotten about those days.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.600
 - Those were good days on Twitter.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.040
 - It was a good fun day.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:58.880
 - Yeah.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.320
 So already it's like, you know,

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.160
 it's already starting up again.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.520
 But yeah, they should go really hard.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.520
 That would be so much rage bait.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.040
 Like if they just went really hard on like,

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.600
 there will be no bundler.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.320
 I swear to you, like no bundler.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.200
 We're going no build, just go hard on it.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.040
 - Well, it's confusing.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.560
 'Cause that's what Michael said that.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.360
 But then someone else that's working on remix

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.720
 had like a more detailed message yesterday,

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.880
 which is more in line with what I'm saying,

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.120
 which is it's more about how we decided--

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.640
 - Yeah, well, they could do the reasonable thing

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.480
 in practice.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.640
 They can actually implement it with a bundle.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.040
 But just stay on Twitter.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.080
 There will not be a bundler over my dead body.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.040
 - Yeah, but you know what's funny?

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.760
 I found it really funny because he posted that.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.840
 And I immediately thought, oh yeah,

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.240
 this was like when they would do this

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.080
 and they would fight Liverpool and that whole era.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.720
 And I look at, I scroll down to replies.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.400
 Germo already took the bait.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.040
 Geropomer already took the bait.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.360
 Like they both have these, like, okay,

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.960
 I guess we're back to what it was like, you know,

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.280
 three years ago.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.720
 - Feels good.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.560
 Feels good.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.440
 I'm excited.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.120
 - Yeah, so I'm interested to see where it goes.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.720
 I don't know, I don't feel, I think it's going to be interesting.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.400
 I think there's going to be some value out of it.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.240
 It's just not in line with, like, my tastes.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:16.160
 Like I don't mind build steps and build processes and, like, tricks like that.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.920
 I know it gets, like, next day I just take an example of what that looks like

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.120
 taking to an extreme.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.880
 But yeah, I'm okay somewhere in the middle.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.680
 Oh, yeah, I'm not, like, that excited about this.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.120
 - I've seen recent, like, group sync, not group sync.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.880
 Just recent, like, murmurs.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.560
 And I haven't thought about next day's performance in, like, a year.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.160
 I just kind of felt like all the early, when they came out with the, whatever version

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.840
 it was, 15, 14, whatever, the app router, when they came out that, and it was, like,

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.680
 so slow and dev, and everybody was just shitting on it incessantly.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.640
 I remember thinking, like, well, they're a big engineering team, they'll figure it out.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.320
 But I've seen, like, recent murmurs about how it's still really slow.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.640
 Did that just, like, did that never get better?

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.560
 Is next year's just, like, a slow thing now?

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.400
 Do you know?

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.240
 - It's so inconsistent.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.440
 There's people that still say their dev set up socks, and they, like,

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.720
 it's, like, a really miserable experience.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.760
 Other people say that it's fine, they upgrade to conversion, like, wow, it's so fast now.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.600
 And there's, like, run time, like, production.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.440
 Some people say that it's, like, slow.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.960
 Other people say it's not.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.320
 Someone put React Router inside Next.js.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.480
 And I'm just like, what are you doing?

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.520
 Like, what the hell is the point of this?

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:30.160
 'Cause I think I might be wrong, 'cause I kind of, I have such a time keeping track

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:36.120
 of all this stuff, but I'm pretty sure an app router, any navigation requires a

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.960
 server round trip.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.960
 - Hmm.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.600
 - That feels like the kind of statement that you say, and then you get, like, three tweets

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.960
 from versatile employees.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:48.040
 Like, actually, if you ISR, and then you're, you're, you're, you're, you're.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.840
 - There's probably something that's not correct about that, but I know a lot of people's default

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.960
 experience is, I'm not, it's not, like, a full page refresh or anything.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:59.280
 It's just, I think it's just, like, an asynchronous call to render, to have the server render,

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.400
 like, the next fragment, and they need to replace whatever's on the screen.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.440
 And that's innately slower than client-side rendering.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.440
 - Sure.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.000
 - I think that's what people get tripped up with.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 - That is the routing.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 It's the, the client-side.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.080
 It's not a, like, a spa feel.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.320
 So people get tripped up.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.520
 So I, I think that's what it is, but.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:21.560
 - I just wonder, the reason I asked, I wondered if, like, is it possible as a big organization

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:26.400
 like Vercel, they just got so into V zero that that became the important thing, and they

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.720
 just said, like, to hell with Next.js and its performance issues.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.720
 I don't know.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.720
 It seems unlikely.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.720
 - I don't think so.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.400
 I think, in terms of, like, user allocation, it's, like, the same, if not more than ever.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.400
 But.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.400
 - Yeah.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.400
 Makes sense.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.400
 - I don't know.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.720
 I think they're just in, like, a tough zone of trying to do everything, and they're, like,

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.180
 sometimes, like, certain designs just don't, don't work nicely.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:53.920
 I think the feel I have from it is, and it's so hard to, like, really ingest this.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:59.160
 Like, do you remember the feel of, like, legacy frameworks, like, it's stuff that you didn't

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.160
 grow up with, but, like--

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.400
 - What, what, what are we even talking about legacy anymore?

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.400
 Like, what is legacy?

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.800
 Like, I'm trying to think of stuff from our past, like, do you remember, like, working

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.800
 on--

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.800
 - Create React app?

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.800
 - Are we going further back?

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.800
 - No.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.800
 Something that's, like, really dominant.

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:15.880
 I'm trying to, I'm trying to think of a good example, like, do you remember what it felt

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:22.280
 like working on, like, an ASP type thing, where it's, like, it's huge, everyone used

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:29.760
 it, like, whatever, but, like, you know, it wasn't, like, cool, or, like, light, or, like,

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.360
 any of these things?

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.120
 But it was massively successful, and continued to be massively successful, to this day.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.960
 I think that's kind of where Next.js is now.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.960
 - Interesting.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.960
 Yeah.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.400
 It's the ASP.NET of the 2020s.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.880
 - It's like, the default choice, lots of companies will use it.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:52.600
 It's definitely way better, like, in terms of the stuff that they do, and, like, they do

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.600
 try quite hard.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.400
 - But its position in the mindshare and in the ecosystem is, like, very--

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.160
 - It's hard to see it that way, because we, like, saw it come up.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:04.840
 Like, we were around to see it come up, so it doesn't feel like it could be that.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.000
 But something has to be in that slot, right?

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 - Yeah.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 That's a great point.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.480
 - And it feels like, I think that's probably what it is now.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.320
 - I mean, if it's not still just ASP.NET, then I wonder, like, are we just in this little

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:18.000
 Twitter niche that knows what Next.js is, and, like, the rest of the world, doesn't it?

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 - It's huge.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 Like, it's--

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 - Okay, so people all over the place.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.920
 - Including, like, yeah, like, giant, like, if there's some giant enterprise company with,

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:30.240
 you know, the team of engineers that, like, are not plugged into anything that's going

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.240
 on at all.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.240
 - They're still using Next.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.240
 - Next.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.240
 - Next.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.240
 - Okay.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.240
 - Yeah, like, when, like, that's-- when you become that choice, you're, like, massively

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.240
 successful.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.240
 It's, like, incredible to get there.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.240
 But--

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.240
 - Yeah.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.240
 - Yeah, they're just gonna feel that.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.240
 This is a reality that comes with that, 'cause--

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.240
 - Mm-hmm.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:51.880
 - And we see this all the time, where, with-- working on SST, we're, like, so focused on

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.560
 DX things and trying to make everything better, incrementally, better, incrementally, better.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:59.960
 And then every once in a while, we'll have a call with, like, a big enterprise company.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.560
 And they're like, "Oh, yeah, we love SST.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.560
 It's great.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.560
 We're using it more.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.560
 We have these questions."

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.560
 And then you dig into it with them.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.160
 Turns out, like, 90 percent of our features, like, aren't even working.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:16.080
 And, like, they're experiencing, like, the most degraded DX possible.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.720
 But to them, they're like, "This is great.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.440
 This is, like, better than everything else that we have."

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:25.880
 So it's, like, their tolerance for pain is so much crazier.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:31.480
 So again, when people are saying, "Oh, the next day is depth server slow," or whatever,

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:36.000
 it might still be, like, amazing for, like, comparison for a lot of these teams.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 That's how it is.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 - Yeah.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.760
 - That's so funny that, uh, just you recounting the enterprise, we-- I just got on a call

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.840
 with-- so a few of us on the Stampede's team got on a call with the Stampede's user, who's

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:50.760
 having issues that were so bizarre that, like, three of us got on a phone call with

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:51.760
 them.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:57.400
 They're like, "If this is, like, even a hundred users, yeah, like, we got on the phone with

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.600
 an end user who had reached out to support."

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.280
 So my co-founder and I, and one of our engineers, are on this call.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.640
 And the whole site, like, basically wouldn't render.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:09.400
 I mean, like, he was missing, like, huge chunks of the site.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:13.600
 And he, like, had to do this crazy set of steps to find a sign-in button, because there

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.600
 was no sign-in button.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:19.120
 So we had to go to, like, pages that had, like, a kind of an upsell button on the table,

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:23.240
 to, like, sign-in, and he was just doing it happily, because he didn't know about it.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.240
 And he's like, "Yeah, that's great."

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.520
 I'm like, "I'm not even half of the site loaded.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.520
 It's crazy."

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:32.640
 So we figured out the issue, but it just reminded-- when you said the Enterprise thing, like,

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.640
 people will put up with stuff.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.880
 Yeah, and there's good, probably, market fit.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.840
 It's just funny what people put up with.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:43.280
 Yeah, it's like, the stuff that I feel bad about, they're, like, miles-- they're, like,

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.560
 miles behind that, it's just funny to get that perspective.

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.440
 Are enterprises using V3, or are they still-- do you have a lot of customers still using

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.440
 V2?

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.440
 A lot of V3.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:57.880
 I think our total V3 usage is, like, 5X, what V2 ever was?

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.880
 Really?

00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.880
 Yeah.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.000
 So, like, we still haven't moved on to V3 yet.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.120
 I'm working on it right now, but, uh, but that means it's still on V2, and I wondered

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.360
 if that's normal or if--

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.360
 No, it is.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:13.480
 There's a lot of people still using V2, but it's just like the growth for V3, like, outpaced

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:18.120
 any, like, historical usage of V2, which is always really crazy to see, because when

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:22.080
 you're doing the transition, you're, like, so nervous about it, but then in hindsight,

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:27.280
 you're, like, we're-- this was, like, so much more successful, like, we could have pissed

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.120
 off every single V2 user, and it would have still been--

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.480
 And started over and still had more success.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.480
 Yeah.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.480
 Yeah, it would have been tiny.

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.480
 Yeah.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.440
 Yeah, which is, like, again, like, the remix thing.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:43.160
 I think it's kind of like that where everyone wants them just to, like, stick to the zone

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:49.980
 and increment from wherever they are, but if V3 is successful, it's really means V3,

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:50.980
 right?

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:51.980
 Okay, they're also doing a V2 to V3.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:52.980
 Yeah.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:53.980
 Big jump.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:54.980
 Mm-hmm.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.420
 It is successful in the way that it needs to be, for them to continue working on it.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:01.960
 It's going to, like, make all the old remix usage seem, like, basically zero.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:02.960
 Yeah.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:07.520
 Man, you've got me missing that era, just when it remixed was a thing on Twitter.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.520
 I just do.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.520
 And just all the--

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.520
 And just all the stuff happens now.

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.520
 There's a lot--

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.260
 Is it the algorithm or something?

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.800
 I do feel like Twitter is-- okay, so it could be a few things.

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.600
 I was thinking about, like, that era when, like, everybody had an avocado in their bio,

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:25.280
 like, there was, like, a million developer advocates and developer relations.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.280
 Yeah.

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.280
 That's not on Twitter anymore.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:31.440
 And I feel like either they all went to mastodon or whatever.

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.880
 And that's why things change, because, like, just the group that stayed on Twitter is just

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.800
 very different than what it used to be.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.080
 Or it's something like the algorithm not feeding us the same kind of stuff.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.080
 Nothing's different.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.880
 It does feel like there's not really much happening at any given time on Twitter.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.840
 And they're used to feel like there's a lot.

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:47.840
 Yeah.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.840
 It's not even just on Twitter.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.720
 I just mean, like, I feel like there was a period-- for most of my career, I felt like

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.400
 I would keep up with Hacker News.

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.800
 And every week, there'd be, like, something very interesting new that somebody was trying

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.480
 or a new project or whatever.

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:10.000
 And it feels like that peaked in an era where a bunch of dev tool companies were founded

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.380
 and funded.

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:15.200
 And then, like, that's when, like, all that stuff we're talking about was going on.

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.940
 And then there was a consolidation period where most of those companies failed or they

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:24.760
 realized, like, this giant dev advocate presence was, like, doesn't make sense.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.280
 But also, I think that the companies just went away.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.280
 Yeah.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:31.320
 And there's been, like, crazy consolidation where it feels like there's not really any

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.400
 room for anything new.

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:37.640
 Like, do you remember when, like, there was an era where you'd always hear about spilt

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.680
 and, like, spilt was doing something new and that was, like, a cool, interesting thing.

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.240
 And then, oh, and then Solage just came out and that's, like, a cool and interesting thing.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:51.280
 And then it feels like now all those projects kind of work in silence and they're kind of

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.520
 established themselves.

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.520
 Yes.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.520
 I don't know.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.120
 It just feels like we're very standardized and consolidated.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.640
 And I think the AI thing-- I don't know if this is actually what's happening, but in

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:05.160
 theory, the AI thing pushes consolidation, right, because it, like, kind of, like, pushes

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.760
 people into an error set of tools.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.760
 Yeah.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.760
 Like, people are more apt to use the defaults because the AI is more apt.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:13.760
 Yeah.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.560
 Like, Tailwind, like, ended up winning and, like, there was a period where it was like--

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.560
 Yeah.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:21.640
 And when he talks about that, there's just, like, so little of the, like, framework wars

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:25.760
 or any signs of, like, just drama for the sake of drama.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.560
 Like, all that just kind of went away, but it's not, like, in a good way.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.320
 It's not, like, in a-- oh, it's so great.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.320
 It feels stagnant.

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.320
 All the productive conversation.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.320
 It just feels like, yeah, stagnant.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:37.160
 It feels like we, like, explored the space of ways of doing things and turns out there's

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.120
 just, like, a narrow set that most people are going to settle on.

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.720
 And now there's nothing else to explore here, which might be true.

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.840
 And I wonder if, like, scientific research works this way, too, where, like, you go down

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.200
 some path and there's, like, all this discovery and new stuff to figure out.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.200
 Yeah.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.280
 And eventually, you've, kind of, roughly, like, covered that zone of exploration.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.280
 Mm-hmm.

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.320
 And the next one is going to be somewhere completely different.

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:04.360
 Like, I think that's maybe what it is, but it's not just front-end, though.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.880
 Like, it's also back-end.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:11.240
 It's also, like, different architectures in, like, on your back-end.

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.240
 It's also databases.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.240
 Yeah.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:17.320
 Feels like a lot less, like, programmer, just discourse.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:18.320
 Yeah.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:23.720
 It's just-- I think it's, like, there's no more wrong ideas, but wrong ideas are exciting,

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:24.720
 you know?

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:28.440
 It's-- I remember, like, I remember-- I remember, like, a database was just a big question mark

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.440
 for so much of my career.

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.640
 It's, like, every new project I was going to try a new database.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:32.640
 Like--

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.640
 Yeah.

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.640
 Oh, graph databases.

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.640
 Like, those were really cool and you can do all these cool things with graph databases

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.640
 and that was, like, a thing.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:42.240
 But now, it's just, like, yeah, just use a relational database and it's probably fine.

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.240
 Yeah.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.240
 Oh, that perfectly sums up the database conversation.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:51.480
 That just perfectly sums up this, like, era of trying new, crazy things and constantly

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:57.120
 feeling like, I need to do the other thing, because maybe time series databases are whatever.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:00.520
 There's, like, seven startups for every type of database.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.520
 Yeah.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:06.320
 And then, like, this era just feels like everybody just uses Postgres and MySQL and nobody cares.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.120
 There's seven startups for Postgres.

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.120
 Yeah, it literally is.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.120
 Yeah.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.120
 Yeah.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.120
 But, like, yeah, the conversation is no longer-- that's such a good point.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.120
 So it's just that we figured out all the right answers, is that basically it?

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.120
 And now, there's not that much to talk about.

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.120
 It's, like, which--

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.120
 The thing is, like, it's not that--

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:28.120
 Because I ultimately believe that you can usually make anything work, right?

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.120
 Yeah.

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.120
 The fact that you chose a graph database, like, some things are going to be harder.

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.120
 Other things are going to be easier.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:39.120
 But, like, you would probably be fine for, like, a lot of projects would probably be fine.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.120
 But nobody does that anymore.

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.120
 It feels like--

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.120
 Mm-hmm.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.120
 I feel like there's, like, no--

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.120
 I don't know what it is.

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.120
 It is.

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.120
 It is.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.120
 Like, taking the hard path.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.120
 Yeah, there's no--

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.120
 I don't know.

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:54.120
 Like, being-- doing something that's, like, technically not right.

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.120
 Yeah.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.120
 Do you ever just, like, wonder what does everyone work on?

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.120
 Like, there's so many people on Twitter that are developers.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.120
 I'm like, what are these-- what do you do work on?

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.120
 I'm sure they think about me, too.

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:06.120
 But I just, like, I sometimes step back and I'm like, I don't even--

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.120
 there's not that many things on the internet.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.120
 Like, what are these people building?

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.120
 I know.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:15.120
 Well, sometimes I go through our SSC, like, customer list, like, the console list.

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:19.120
 Because whenever, like, a new-- whenever people sign up, sometimes I'll, like, once a week,

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.120
 like, look, who's paying and, like, what are they building?

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.120
 Mm-hmm.

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:23.120
 I go to their website.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.120
 And there is a lot of stuff.

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.120
 There's, like, so much stuff, like--

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.120
 I just don't get out much.

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:34.120
 We're not that big in, like, there's-- you know, in a week, there's probably, like, three

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:40.120
 to 4,000 production-ish projects with SSC, right?

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.120
 Mm-hmm.

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.120
 That are being worked on.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.120
 Yeah.

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.120
 That's pretty crazy.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.120
 Heck, there's so many.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.120
 Yeah.

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.120
 Yeah, I just don't get out much.

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.120
 That's the point.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.120
 I think I just don't explore the internet.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.120
 I have, like, five sites.

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.120
 But I kind of agree with you.

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:59.120
 Like, despite me literally seeing that, I, like, know that it's all happening, but it's almost,

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.120
 like, what are these things?

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.120
 Like, this makes sense to exist.

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:08.120
 Like, there's a whole team that's making money doing this and growing and fundraising and doing

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.120
 all that, but it's just--

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.120
 The world is big.

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.120
 The world is so much bigger than it seems.

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.120
 Yeah.

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.120
 All right.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.120
 We're not even going to make it an hour because I've got to pee and there's just, like,

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.120
 so much to do.

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:21.120
 I feel like this is one of those podcast episodes where we're both busy and it's just kind of,

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.120
 like, I want to talk.

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.120
 I do.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.120
 But also--

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.120
 I want to work more.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.120
 Yeah.

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.120
 It's just unfortunate realities sometimes.

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.120
 Okay.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.120
 All right.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.120
 Let's see.

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.120
 I'll call it.

 All right.
