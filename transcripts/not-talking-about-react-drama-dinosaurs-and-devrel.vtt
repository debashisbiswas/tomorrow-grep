WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320
 Hey, we are two engineers we do science in one of the oldest professions the one the oldest professions what engineers

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.140
 In Sandy, maybe use paying lol, you know the company you invested in that does exactly this. Yeah, I know I gotta set it up. I just have

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:56.920
 All the best features are hidden because they're all like secret query parameters. Yeah, I just like don't I just haven't Oh, you don't even know what I don't know, you know, I'd set up in my OBS, but I

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.640
 Uh, my for whatever reason my OBS settings and all my twitch stuff every time I come back to it nothing works

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.380
 And it's like I have to start over. It's like my new event my new event is so busted right now

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.680
 Like for the I don't know 12th time. I'm trying to get prettier and Astro to work in my new of them

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.660
 It's insane how many times this breaks wait, but what are you changing? Are you changing? I'm not I'm not changing anything

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.160
 I just want to say well, okay, I updated all the packages. I want to update it to Neil them 0.9

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.320
 Yeah, why does everything break? I did have a little bit of issue is 0.9, but it wasn't that bad

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.960
 Yeah, I just I did the thing this morning

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.520
 I was like, okay an hour

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.280
 I'm spending an hour just making things better because I had just been like plugging through it and like every time

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.440
 I save a file I get two alerts and like whatever just dealing with it finally I I cleaned all that up

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.440
 But I still don't have prettier working with Astro just the whole like prettier

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.420
 TypeScript all the things getting them to work together node whatever all of it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.520
 Why is it so hard? Why do I spend so much of my brain cycles thinking about the stupidest stuff in the world like formatting?

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.680
 Yeah, I know I think I I I have everything working, but I know my setup isn't correct. It was a good better setup

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.720
 So I copied yours. So that's my problem. Mine works. And that's the reason I'm in touch. No mine doesn't

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.920
 Can you please after this podcast or maybe right now? Could you please save an astro file dot astro file and see if prettier runs?

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.880
 Oh, you know what? Yes, there was an issue with this. Yeah, there was an issue

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.440
 And I did fix it and I can't remember how did you not push the change to your environment repo?

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.360
 I gotta look I gotta look okay. Maybe you just have a local change that will we'll fix things for me

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.600
 I hope so prettier is one of those things where I'm like people love rewriting everything and rust

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.880
 So there's rewrite stuff and rust for no reason. Please rewrite prettier and rust. That's like actually useful

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.320
 It's so slow. Is it someone doing that like the versatile team with turbo pack or something? I saw

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.720
 Okay, well, there's there's like a few people always like me to stuff, but it's never

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.600
 There was that Rome tools company that was that built that spent like five million dollars to build a

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.680
 Formatter and Russ and then promptly died

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.320
 That's kind of good. Yeah, I think I've seen like a few a handful of things

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.320
 I don't know if Vercel is working on a

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.760
 faster formatter I

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.320
 Don't I didn't see it anywhere. I use prettier d I do it. I don't know that like I just wish it would all work

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.160
 I just wish I never had to think about it again and every time I saved a file on my machine

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.480
 It would format it with prettier like it always should that's another thing. I like I love astro, but I

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.800
 Hate the fact that there's like a whole set of new tooling required and that just means

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.960
 I've had a lot of issues with the LSP and with everything else. Yeah. Yeah, it's like one

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.800
 It's like you introduce one new change, but then it interacts with all the other tools like one-to-one

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.960
 So you have like just way more points that can break

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.600
 I appreciate some of the astro file stuff

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.640
 But to be honest, I would be I would have been okay with just like writing a normal JavaScript file and like declaring

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.400
 All the stuff at the top and exporting you're saying declaring all the markup

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.760
 Like in a just like JSX well, I don't know

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.680
 I feel like you can get a similar experience without having to have created a new file format that astro

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.760
 Yeah, yeah, it wouldn't be as like slick, but then don't you have the issue then of like

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.960
 So if it's a JS file with HTML in it, then you still have the issue of a custom LSP, right?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.880
 Or now it wouldn't be any different than like a react file or like so it would be just JSX

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.680
 Yeah, just JSX and I could just use exports

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.160
 To control what's what yeah, I mean astro does feel a lot like JSX

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.560
 Like they took a lot of same syntax stuff like for templating and all that stuff embedding stuff in there

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.240
 I think it literally is just JSX right. Oh, is it? I thought no, it's HTML. It's not like class name. It's class. It's like

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.600
 actual HTML attributes the class that what you're describing there is a

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.940
 It's like a react specific thing cuz it's solid. Oh, that's not a JSX thing. No like JSX. I don't know exactly how is it fine, but

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.240
 like solids JSX flavor looks different and then reacts and

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.560
 JSX and the JSX part is of like let like allowing you like make JavaScript and

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:32.240
 Like those XML type tags. I think it's like just that and you can have whatever tags you want whatever attributes on those tags you want

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.880
 I actually just used

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.380
 JSX on the back end without react. I needed to render

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:48.800
 render a PDF so I was like let me just render let me just return some HTML and I can turn that into a PDF and

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.080
 I

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.080
 didn't want to learn any of these

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.120
 HTML templating languages like you know all those ones that are from like what no like like I don't even know like

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.280
 Pugs or like mustache or like you know all those random. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:11.200
 Because I just need to generate some HTML in the bag and my HTML is more complex than I get can just use like a string

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.100
 It's like more complex than I have loops and all that stuff. It's like I like JSX. It makes sense

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.200
 So I found a library. I think it's called VHML

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.300
 You know how when JSX gets compiled just gets compiled a bunch of function calls that like create the elements

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.600
 And you can swap out that function call so by default they'll go to react

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.560
 But you can swap it out with a very simple implementation that just takes a tag and turns into a string

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.880
 So if I was gonna call VHML, and I was like returning

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.520
 JSX from a lambda function and that just got

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.040
 That one of my parts of client as a as HTML

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.640
 It was great actually cuz I don't need state or any of the complex stuff

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:56.860
 I just needed to like render static HTML dynamically. So is that I mean, doesn't that RSC's we should talk about all that stuff, right?

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.360
 I mean, just the current react

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.440
 Do we have to maybe we don't have to maybe we could just this could be it

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.800
 We just we said we should talk about then we talk about something else and then we put it in the title like react to drama

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.000
 Let's talk about why we're not talking about it. Oh, well why I don't want to talk about it

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.840
 All right. Oh, okay, can you also remind me can you remind me later that we need to talk about HTML?

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.840
 I just want to know your thoughts on HTML X if you ever used it, and why they're so good it means. Okay, go ahead

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:29.360
 They're just more drama slash whatever with next JS and the migration to

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.680
 App router and all this stuff. I don't care to talk about it because it's just so boring. It's just like I

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.960
 Was ranting about this yesterday

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.320
 I was like this is such a boring topic and it is the only topic that ever comes up

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.720
 We're just always talking about next JS. We're always pretending to care about it

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.560
 We're always like micro analyzing every little thing everything goes right

00:07:53.560 --> 00:08:00.480
 Does it bother you because you you think like a marketer and you think like they're not doing the the cool new ways of marketing

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.400
 They keep getting all the buzz people keep talking about their thing

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:10.640
 When they're not even progressive and like doing all the cool marketing stuff. I haven't even had like a metaphor like that

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.720
 I just took a basic reaction of like this is just boring like this is just

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:20.600
 It's just like your front end like you just it's just like the tiniest most irrelevant part of your staggy like you're gonna serve a run

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:30.500
 I just don't count how much can we talk about how much can we dissect and like analyze this and think about it's just

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.920
 it's way too much and I

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:39.840
 Just don't care. I just do not do not care. I'm tired of pretending to care. I've never used next JS

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.600
 I'm not going to use next JS. I never will use next year. Do you are you pretending to care?

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.680
 I have not seen you pretend to care. You mostly don't care and you're very vocal about that, right?

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:56.560
 I need to understand what's happening so I can have the right context for coming. We support next JS

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.840
 We need to understand what's going on. Yeah, for my strategy around it

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.840
 But it's just like who it's just why

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:10.600
 Why is it talking about it's for most people. It's like a very small portion of their stack

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.200
 Yeah, for a small amount of people. What's their whole stack? It's their whole stack. Yeah, sure

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:22.080
 There's and the biggest users of next JS, which are like these e-commerce sites agencies that like build e-commerce sites

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:28.880
 There's not even on Twitter. So I'm just like why why why are we just talking about over and over? Yeah, I don't know

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.440
 What this one the specific

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.120
 topic like the more granular

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:40.840
 Is that it's not stable because it react it's a canary release etc etc. That's a worse part

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:48.000
 It's like they're so little to talk about this topic the only thing that we can devolve into is like a conversation about semantics

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.200
 Like what does stable mean? Does it mean this? Yeah, it technically means this but I feel like it means this and it's just like

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.240
 That's the conversation and to me it's summarized very simply

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.840
 I don't give a shit about a technicality words

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.120
 People are having a tough time moving to app router

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:09.560
 There's a wide range of reasons for that you can talk and think your way out of that or like why they're technically wrong

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.240
 It just doesn't matter because there are some percentage of people that are having a tough time

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.520
 That's really all there is to this

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.320
 And I don't really think there's any more I have too many things

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.280
 I want to say in response to that and it hurts

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:26.600
 I hate this situation on a podcast where there's like four things I want to talk to you about and I gotta like order them

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.680
 Or can I just list them on you pick? I'm gonna list them on you pick

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:37.040
 Okay, well, I already said a shimex that's not in response to that but do you here's one of the topics

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.040
 Do you think we'll ever run out of this is just a question do you think we'll ever run out of things to talk about like

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.040
 Will there ever be a moment where like?

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.880
 There's nothing to talk about not on this podcast like on tech Twitter or just like in the tech community

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.800
 So that's one thing the other thing was I don't know react

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.280
 So do you think there's ways they could have like leaned more into being good for spas

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.520
 Which is what most people use react for or everybody uses react for?

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:06.240
 Like was there any more like low-hanging fruit or like progress to be made there or is that why they're going to the server?

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.240
 Because they ran out of stuff to do. That's another question

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.120
 Third thing I want to talk about dinosaurs and I know that sounds super random

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:18.040
 But I yesterday was blown away by this thought that how do we know what dinosaurs look like?

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:24.920
 We don't because look at an animal skeleton. It looks nothing like the animal like nothing like all the dinosaurs are all thin and

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:30.800
 Ripped and like the just muscle and skin but like look at an elephant you would never guess an elephant look that way

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.520
 So sorry, I just I went into the whole top. I have a lot of thoughts on that one. I'm excited for that one

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.920
 Okay, yeah, yeah, so that was so pick you any of those really that was three no HCMX was another one

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.220
 Okay, so I'll start with the first one which what I already forgot

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:53.520
 There's like a couple react things that are super boring and who cares do we want to even talk about reacting more?

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.440
 Let's get to the let's get to those real quick. Well, okay, I don't I don't remember

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.440
 the first one was

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.480
 Oh, do you think we're running things to talk about are there ever slow newsdays on tech Twitter?

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.880
 Go ahead definitely death. I was thinking about that. I was showering this morning

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.880
 I was like I was again just thinking

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:14.880
 Actually, I'm like to be honest I myself haven't said anything that interesting in a while

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.640
 I haven't really seen anyone else saying anything that interesting in a while

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:23.000
 I feel like we're in a slump right now, and it's I was stuck on like the stupid tail when thing is coming up yet again

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.160
 I think the week before that was something about his program

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.800
 I actually miss a whole this whole thing is programming fun thing. It's just like the same stupid top

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:38.440
 It's falling up. Yeah, so I think we are actually in a slump. There's nothing new or interesting so I was like what so milk

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.240
 So that's I mean, there's a little bulk apparently. It's a no-coversation. Yeah, yeah

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.440
 So I do work so bored. Yes, we I think we are very bored right now

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.760
 And can I just say that I feel like like the older I get the more bored I get with like

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:59.480
 All of it, and I wonder how much of like the tech discourse on Twitter is people who've been doing this a long time

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:05.120
 I don't maybe not but are we all just collectively getting more bored over time is that like the galaxy's moving further away?

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:11.680
 Eventually, we'll all just be so bored. We're not even on Twitter. I've maybe like there's like maybe there's just a certain

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:17.200
 Because these topics keep coming up and eventually when you first enter this space

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.480
 It's like 80% of the stuff you see is new and I feel like over time

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:27.160
 It's just like you know less and less of that is new and like 10% when you see is new and I definitely feel that right now

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.440
 I'm just like this conversation again. I can almost like guess all the replies and guess all the things at this point

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.240
 The first thing the second thing

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:40.600
 Are they bored of react or they just don't react speeds? That's actually I never thought about that

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.800
 Maybe maybe like yeah react SPA has been fine for a while now

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.500
 In terms of the their current model. I don't know what else is needed

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:56.720
 So yeah, maybe they just got bored and they're like, okay, we're gonna move to the server now. Yeah, I mean, it's like

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.340
 I don't know. It feels like they didn't have to do this. Why did they make the decision to like

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:07.520
 Completely shift gears and really cater to like whole different use cases

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.760
 With this move to the server stuff

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:16.480
 I don't know like why why go through all that pain if they're not really just like either really convicted or really bored

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:22.000
 That's my that's my prediction. Maybe we can just blame Alex Russell. You know what I'm talking about. Yeah, I know

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Microsoft yeah, yeah, because he

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.660
 Forever had just been angrily shouting about how

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:33.920
 Every all these people use SPH inappropriately, which is yeah your thing

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:41.520
 And he's like he'll always roast the react team over and over about it. It's just like hammer them like insults

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:48.220
 Yeah, and maybe it worked. Maybe the react team was like, you know what they finally yeah, and now they're like okay, that's with SSR. I'm just like

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:54.000
 All right, you guys do your thing. I don't know. It just it feels the detach from anything I care about

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.840
 Which is what makes it even worse like I don't like it's not even that I

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:04.720
 Don't like is boring, but I have to use it like I don't have to use it and I find it boring

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:12.240
 Double whammy. Yeah, can you tell me about HTML X because when you talk about like a simple templating whatever whatever it sounds like

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.960
 Is that kind of an HTML X or they make it more simple to do minimal JavaScript?

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.600
 What is HTML X teach told me I forgot I think they make it simpler to do minimal JavaScript

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.920
 I haven't used it in anything so I can't really talk about too much, but it does remind me of how I used to build

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.640
 I can't remember what it was, but I

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:35.120
 Definitely remember back in the day. I would build stuff in a way where

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.920
 Like an asynchronous request would go from the front end the back end return like a partial

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.440
 Like a partial HTML and then the front end swap out a node

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.240
 Yeah, some note on the screen with it. I remember doing that pattern

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:57.960
 Same and I think and maybe I made from a ASP days or what yeah, Ajax. Yeah, so I think HMX is just like a

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:05.600
 Modern better take on that and my formalizing some of those patterns and it looks it looks pretty cool again

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.600
 I just never built anything that

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.360
 That makes sense for yeah, sure. They're really good at Twitter. They're so good. He's so fun

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.640
 Yeah, it's because the guy is the Grug the Grug guy Grug guy. I don't know you say it

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.320
 I've only read it okay. Have you ever seen that website? That's like

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:26.520
 It's like a comedy website, but he makes like interesting points about software engineering where like he acts out one person

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:33.080
 That's a caveman. Yeah, that's that guy. I think cuz a Twitter handle is this is his grub something

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.600
 I don't really so I think it's I think that's that guy and that guy's like so funny

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.800
 I mean those those things are oh, yeah, that's great communicate. I'd usually well

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:45.640
 So I think that that's why okay, so the Mount Rushmore of developer marketing

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.880
 We've got HMX definitely we've got drizzle drizzle we've got SST who's that fourth? Who's the fourth?

00:16:53.880 --> 00:17:00.240
 Now rush more I think fly might and make might make it up there cuz there. Oh, that was a good blog post

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.200
 I saw that yeah, cuz I posted it the other day and

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:11.200
 It was a fundraising announcement every company does the same boring announcement of like we raised 20 million dollars from

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:16.960
 Andreessen Horowitz and we're excited to use this in a very unique way to hire people and build features

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.520
 It's just like the most boring generic thing ever and I'm sure the SST

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.520
 Announcement for our seat was probably very similar

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:29.000
 The fly one was so funny. It was like so like funny and self-aware of how like boring these usual are and they were like

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.440
 They actually communicated interesting stuff well, but like everywhere line was like a joke and it was funny. It was great. So

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.160
 Yeah, they did a fantastic job with that post well link the blog post will link it in our show notes

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.160
 I can say things like that now and Chris will just do it. It's awesome. Nice. Yeah

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:53.400
 So I think I think they go up that means very it's not like they're not like as weird as drizzle or ancient mixes

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:59.240
 But I will say I have never read a fun one. I don't read like I hate reading articles. I just skim

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:04.600
 So what kind of articles that often to hell? No, I'm not reading a fundraising article

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.920
 But somehow I read like every single line of this

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:13.680
 This fundraising article and it was it was great. It was really interesting and it's also like I had I think just

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.440
 Lumped fly as like it's containers. So I don't think about it or care or know anything about it

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:23.920
 It was interesting to read through some of that and think about the different like angles of they talk about edge

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:31.240
 They talk about this stuff that they're very self-aware themselves in the industry. There's definitely some cool stuff that you can build under that model

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.960
 Like we were thinking about doing so because ssc as a product seed which is a ci tool and a thing

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.840
 I hate about every single ci tool is we've made them totally stateless. So there's always like

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.800
 Set stuff you want to cash and there's a good restore cash set up and that's supposed to make it faster

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:54.440
 But then that's like download the cash blah blah. I miss the good old days of having just a stateful ci machine that would just

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:59.400
 Like sync the code and like it once it built and it was done

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.680
 It was a resume from there the next time you got you did it push everything would just be fast

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:08.120
 Building a ci tool on fly would be great. You just give every project a container

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.800
 It spins up or zooms from where it was spins down if there's some issue with like state corrupting things

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.360
 You can blow it away whatever so yeah, there are some cool things you can build I kind of see them as like

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.840
 They're like the cloud further approaching

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:26.360
 Like the cloud flare but for like the container model, which yeah, we'll be practicing

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:32.360
 I didn't know they were on their own hardware. That's you have to be yeah, yeah, that's the thing that I

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.120
 one of the things that I think is a lot of these

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.320
 companies in their category

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.160
 basically

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.960
 Simplified cloud. I mean they're fed to the simplified cloud. Yeah, a lot of them

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:49.880
 Most of them don't own their own hardware. Most of them are selling. Yeah. Yeah, sure well versatile is at least serverless

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.160
 So it's a little bit different but the ones that are more container based

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.480
 Like railway or like render they're built on top of AWS or gcp whatever it is

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:02.520
 I don't think those business are viable period because I just don't think the margins are there to

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:07.560
 Do that. Well, and they actually in the flies blog post they very clearly spelled that out where like yeah

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.960
 We have done our own our own hardware. Otherwise this whole thing like the margins doesn't make sense

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.280
 Yeah, so it was cool to see that that validated and I think they're the only ones that are really going to succeed

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.760
 With that move for that reason

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.240
 Okay, so can you uh, that's everything but the dinosaurs. Can we tell you what the dinosaurs real quick? Yes, okay

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.920
 So I love this topic because have you seen uh, the artist's renditions of like rhinos? Yes

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.960
 Is that my wife showed it to me yesterday? Yeah, yes

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.360
 That's what this conversation came from. Yeah, just for so people have context

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.880
 Someone did an exercise where they showed artists

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:47.560
 Skeletons of like animals that are alive today like hippos and stuff and these animals have really crazy skeletons

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:52.120
 And they the artists guessed what the animal looked like and they drew all these crazy

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.000
 Sci-fi looking things that looked way cooler than the actual animal is

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.760
 Yeah

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.320
 And and yeah, it kind of goes to illustrate how difficult it is to infer too much just from the bones

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.840
 Yeah, like you take an elephant skull. You would have no idea has these giant ears and this giant trunk

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:14.680
 Yeah, like it just they have the tusks, but they end up when they draw these types of things. It looks like a dinosaur

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.560
 It's like all gaunt and like freaky looking

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:23.560
 Yeah, so the but the one thing I will say is uh, so have you seen have you guys watched?

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.160
 prehistoric planet yet

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:32.760
 Uh, oh the second yes, we saw the first one. We didn't know all the dinosaurs are chubby now

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:37.960
 Oh, they already started like incorporating this idea into

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:43.480
 Yeah, because if you think about the thing you were saying earlier like they're all like skeletal and like ripped

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.720
 Uh-huh and that's a dinosaur. I remember from being a kid like the models

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.360
 I had or like Jurassic Park. Yeah stuff. They don't look cool anymore. They all look kind of chubby

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.040
 Like a hippo. You look at a hippo skull. You would never guess

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.040
 Yeah, how giant a hippo is

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.600
 So I do think they're working with more than the bone because if I remember the way the fossils work

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.840
 Fossils aren't literally the bone. They're like the imprint of the brain

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.760
 So I think the imprint might also sometimes contain like

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.240
 the full shape of

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:18.920
 Their creature at least like the out or like to some degree potentially I thought I read that it's like the skin and all the tissue

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:23.560
 Would shrivel really fast to the bones. So any fossils. Well, it's kind of like a footprint, right?

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.280
 Like we have footprint fossils. Oh, that's true. The footprint wouldn't be just the bone. It would be

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:34.120
 The full shape. Okay, so we do we do actually in some cases know the outline of some of these dinosaurs

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:39.240
 Yeah, but I do agree that there's so it's so hard to infer some of these things like colors

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.760
 Yeah, even that prehistoric planet thing most of what they do is

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:49.080
 Look at the hints they have and try to map it to behaviors that exist in almost today

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.160
 And they're like, okay, it's probably some more behavior

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:57.320
 Thing with the t-rex arms yet. No, I don't like that. It was we haven't finished first episode. Okay. It was a

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.240
 It's like the most ridiculous part of it because the whole thing is

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.040
 We've always asked like why do t-rex have these tiny stupid stupid arms

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:14.280
 And it's like especially in uh in that show they really show how small and stupid they're because dangerous like kind of fat and chubby

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.840
 And it's got these like useless little things that are just hanging off of it

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.560
 So there

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.800
 They haven't seen where these two t-rexes go up to each other ones male one female

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.520
 And the male just like leans his head up and looks up all the way up

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.080
 And then opens his arms and starts flapping them like the stupidest way ever

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.160
 And the and the inside of the arms are uh are like highly colored

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.800
 Uh, so it's some kind of like mating thing and like it like there's some creature

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:47.560
 Some like creature that is alive today that mates in that in that way, but it looks so stupid

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:53.240
 Like this cannot this cannot be what the explanation is, but you know, it might be who knows who knows

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.840
 What's crazy is it like a hundred years ago or maybe it was a little longer

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.200
 But it wasn't that long ago people didn't even know dinosaurs existed like

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.960
 There've not been that many generations aware of the dinosaur bones. Have you seen that when was it the first

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.400
 Dinosaur bone discovered it was like a hundred years ago, wasn't it?

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.360
 I don't know exactly, but I know our depictions of dinosaurs before

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:20.360
 Made them look really stupid like they were like really slow moving or like they were like kind of too upright

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:20.760
 All right

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:26.760
 I remember like the way we shaped them, but I don't think the first dinosaur bones discovered that because i'm pretty sure that

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:34.360
 There's 1677 in europe actually further uh further ago than I realized if you're reading eurocentric history, maybe

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.480
 Where do you think dragons came from? Yeah, where did dragons come from? Oh, did they come from dinosaurs?

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.360
 Maybe I just made this entirely up, but isn't it that they just found

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.600
 skulls

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.280
 and

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:51.480
 They were like oh, so they found dinosaur skulls. They just didn't

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:56.920
 Published them in articles. That's my I don't know. That's my bad guy. There's made this entirely interesting

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:02.360
 I mean there is a lot of overlap between a dragon and a dinosaur. They don't exist today

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:08.280
 And what's the other overlap? I don't know. They're reptiles. I don't know. Okay, there's a lot of overlap

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.680
 I don't know what it is, but there's a bunch. Yeah

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:17.640
 This funny thing, which is always like I always forget dragons. Yeah, it's like to her like the back of her head

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.440
 They're just some like exact animal. She's like wait. No, they're like not real unicorns. I don't have that problem

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.000
 Unicorn is so stupid like I feel like

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.600
 They didn't do enough to make it a mythical horse. Yeah

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.120
 I mean the rainbow. That's not that exciting

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.960
 Colorful and sparkly nature of a unicorn

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.240
 Did I make that up? Is that like a specific unicorn?

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.960
 Are you just grabbing the background?

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.760
 Colorful, I guess what would be colorful? They're they're their tails a horn color

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.080
 They're like mains and their tails a rainbow colored aren't they? Maybe I don't know

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.800
 I'm just thinking about like a harry potter unicorn, which is just like a horse with the horn on it

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.960
 I think it also has blood that can keep you alive forever. So that's right

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:07.400
 When you said that, I didn't know what you're talking about in harry potter until until the blood thing what's keeping them. Yeah, I remember that

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.720
 My mom says this funny thing about dinosaur is where it's like too ridiculous to her

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:16.200
 Like it's such a good weird concept that they exist so that she just can't even believe they're real

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:23.080
 Like she knows they're real but like her mind just rejects the notion of it being real and I kind of get it like what?

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.560
 Like there's one. Yeah, it is bizarre

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.360
 And it does like we've done some studies or something right to like make sure that things don't just grow

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.640
 Over a long period of time like bones in the ground. They don't just like swell

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.440
 Like these things

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.760
 Yeah, yeah, well things used to be so big

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.040
 Everything that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.720
 One interpretation is that things used to always be so big but other interpretation is

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.600
 Things were little and they swell over time

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:56.920
 Like seems like a possible, I don't know avenue of scientific research. Yeah, it's I

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:02.840
 My like feeling around it is like nature we're just trying. They're like we're gonna try to make stuff really big and then nature was like

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.920
 Doesn't work together. Yeah, let's try

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.440
 Everything gets smaller better over time

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.920
 So we're gonna accomplish the same thing and more when this in a smaller smaller size

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.160
 I mean, I think I have looked this up in their theories at least with the bugs thing that there is more

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.720
 Oxygen like the oxygen in the air like more oxygen and causing some grow bigger

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.560
 But I do think but that doesn't really explain like stuff like dinosaurs being big

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.720
 I just think it was a go random thing. It was just like randomly stuff was just getting bigger for no

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:41.560
 Really random just because it could I mean as long as it can survive like it can just like why not stuff just gets bigger and

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:48.280
 Bigger you are the scarier you are. I guess I just assumed there are like dinosaurs on other planets too like

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:53.720
 I don't know. I've just I've taken a very earth centered view of the universe and I've decided

00:27:54.040 --> 00:28:00.040
 This is the path life starts a little tiny bacteria turns into dinosaurs and then really smart monkeys

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:05.080
 All planets all over that's what's happening. Oh, you're convinced that's a case. Yeah. Yeah

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.200
 No, I don't know

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:12.200
 Well, the thing that I think about is that uh

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:18.440
 As one of those Fermi paradox things that it's so natural. Wait. What was it? You just said it so fast Fermi

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.240
 Fermi paradox could you explain what that is for all of us who don't know paradoxes and principles

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.520
 It's like given the size and age of the universe. Why isn't it like overflowing with life like probability?

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.000
 Why is it should be yeah, but why isn't it? So there's like all these theories and one theory is that

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.480
 On earth, it's so natural for us to think of it as

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:43.640
 The smarter you are the more of an advantage you have and like the better your species does

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.200
 So over time there's a pressure on things getting smarter and smarter and smarter. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.040
 But it's possible that

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.480
 There's something about earth that makes that uniquely true in other

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:57.000
 Planets with life. It could be that the taller you are

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.960
 The more likely you're to survive or like the harder your skin is and more like

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.640
 Oh interesting. So yeah, even if this even if life has been around for billions of years

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:11.000
 The result wouldn't be a species that can travel space. It would just be a species. That's like really tall or something. Yeah

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.080
 So it could be that intelligent life is like a unique property if it's a unique advantage on earth and maybe not as much

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:23.800
 The advantage anywhere else interesting. That's really interesting. I'm just thinking about it. I don't have anything to say in response

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.760
 I was listening

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:33.800
 Wow, that's a very wow moment. We've talked about aliens again. Go ahead

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:41.240
 Yeah, I guess I think when we did all this stuff everything we just talked about was vastly more interesting than anything going on

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.080
 And on tech - way more interesting. This is why we're talking about it

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.200
 And this is why we've hardly talked about tech for three weeks. We're in a slump

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.400
 It's just a little tech slump. There's just like not much going on

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:58.120
 It's like I follow the NFL for them reasons like I don't know. I just I like Patrick Mahomes. Okay, he's cool

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:05.080
 Uh, so I follow like that whole season and I listened to podcasts and there's nothing to talk about in the NFL right now

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.920
 There's just literally nothing so they just make stuff where they talk about what they make stuff up

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:14.280
 They're like what if you could take one player from every team and make a super team

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.120
 Who would you pick? It's like dumb stuff like that. You can just talk about randomly

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.160
 We need to do stuff like that. We need to have little like yeah, you could do that

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.640
 I would just say we could do literally that. Oh wait literally what

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.560
 For the NFL players. No, no, no, no, not not that literally

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:35.640
 Take make a company you can draft people you can draft two people from any existing company like software engineers

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:41.240
 Create a new team. Anyone anyone. Oh, like a fake startup like a startup simulator. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:48.760
 Why is that not a thing? Oh, yeah. Like super like super uh, mockumentary style like making fun of

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.720
 You know, you have fantasy startup. Yes

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:56.920
 How would you score what would be the way to score points that I would be like uh product market fit?

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.760
 I don't know product market fit. That's how you I don't like score point

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:07.240
 Dollars raised who just don't really could follow week to week. Yeah. Yeah, money raised. I think is a good one

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.880
 Like getting like dunking on twitter. That's like another

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:19.320
 Three points a good meme a good a good tech meme now. Yeah. Yeah PR has merged PR's. Sure

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.800
 GitHub green boxes filled

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:27.240
 Oh, you somebody make it please that users. I would say users, but no one has any of those. Yeah

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:34.120
 We just created the worst the worst game ever, but it should exist

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.680
 Should definitely be a thing. Yeah, I was thinking about how like in tech

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.640
 people who start like becoming

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:47.880
 Creators or public like influential people in tech just talk about tech

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.640
 Why like is that every industry like do doctors just talk about

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:56.680
 Do they just talk to doctors about doctor things? No, I see doctors explaining like concepts to me

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.280
 Why is why are we not doing that in tech? Why are we not like talking to anybody outside of tech?

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.120
 It's just

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:07.880
 Our audience is tech after this conversation. I was like, I just kind of artificially limited what I talk about

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.880
 I think I

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:15.320
 In my head, I'm like, I go wider than most people because I talk about tech and also stuff on the business side

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.480
 Yeah, but that still is pretty narrow and the grand scheme of things like why aren't I talking about?

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.360
 Dinosaurs and aliens and stuff like that might as well. We should just we should do that

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:31.720
 It's just a job. We just happen to work in tech, but we're people. Yeah, we're just yeah two guys having a podcast

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:39.960
 I'm sorry my wife. She uh she made fun of me today something about how we were two bros on a podcast

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.880
 I was like, I'm offended. I wasn't really so she made fun of me also

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.280
 Well, it was like it well, okay. Here's what happened

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:51.720
 She wanted me to listen to this podcast which I am but the episode is like two hours and 38 minutes or something

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.280
 It's like a one podcast episode and it's like almost three hours like watching a Lord of the Rings movie

00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:01.080
 And I said something I was like two hours and 38 minutes like I listened fast

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.320
 But like that's a long podcast. She's like, well, it's like science. They have stuff to talk about

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.320
 It's not just two bros on a podcast

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:17.000
 That one to hurt cut me deep. Hey, we are two engineers. Oh, we're soft in one of the old

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.400
 Professions the one of the oldest professions what? I don't know engineers. I don't know

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:26.920
 It's funny just don't think of

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.920
 Yeah, software engineering and prostitution to the oldest profession

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.040
 History

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.600
 So this the point I'm trying to make is like

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.360
 I feel like

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.840
 Tech needs some ambassadors controlling the messaging to the outside world

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.560
 Like software developers

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.960
 A lot of misunderstandings a lot of people don't know what it is every time I meet someone

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:56.920
 What do you do? I'm a software developer. What is software? What is developer? What is like?

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.840
 People around here have no idea and I'm thinking it's because we're not telling people

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.880
 We're just talking to each other every tech influencer just makes stuff for people that know what they're talking about

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:11.880
 Why not let's explain computers to people. Maybe someone's already doing this. I'm sure someone is every time I think something like this

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.960
 I find out there's like 10 people doing it

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:20.600
 Well, you wouldn't be the audience for that. Yeah, I guess not. Yeah, I mean, it is funny because you're right

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:26.200
 Explaining what a software engineer does is like for people that don't work in the space or even adjacent to the space

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.360
 Very mysterious

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:34.120
 That's already hard then explaining how I spend my day or how you spend my day is like 10 times harder than that because they're like

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:40.200
 The people call my house. They're like why do you have like this fancy camera on this mic and there's lighting in your room

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.440
 And I'm like oh, I'm a software engineer like

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:52.120
 I just it's okay. Just it's too hard to explain. It's not worth explaining

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.080
 It's weird. It's not an interest rate phenomenon, right?

00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:01.400
 That's not like every all of us having mics and cameras is not just a tech had too much money for a little while kind of thing

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.920
 Maybe it is maybe it's exactly where you personally it is. Yeah

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:11.640
 Wow, I definitely bought all this stuff in that phase where I was making way too much money

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:20.120
 Yeah, same. Do you feel like the interest rate situation like I still feel like it hasn't happened yet like the real

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:27.000
 impact of what just transpired in terms of fiscal policy the drastic change

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 I still feel like the economy and everything else seems to be going too. Well

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.560
 For what I feel like just happened

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:38.760
 It's Silicon Valley bank crashing the only fallout from this whole thing like I feel like 10 years of print

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:44.680
 Not printing. I'm not that guy. It's like 10 years of quantity easing stimulus all the like injecting

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.760
 capital into

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:52.200
 A system and then shutting that off. I feel like it should be like a seismic effect and it has not been

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.920
 Yeah, well the goal of the fed was not to have a seismic effect. They were going for a really crazy

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.160
 I mean, okay. The issue is the economy is overheated, right? It's like yeah doing too well

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.400
 And they wanted to slow that down

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.800
 You can only really slow that down by

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.160
 Pushing in the negative direction, but I think they didn't want to push it too far in a direction

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:13.000
 So there is a version of all that and what we want know what exactly is going to happen for a while

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.160
 Yeah, uh, there's a version of all this where they actually were very successful in their goal

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.160
 They just slowed it down

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.720
 I forgot what they called it. They made so up some new word that they were aiming for

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.400
 They slowed it down without

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.000
 Going into like a deep recession or depression. That's their goal

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.400
 They didn't really want to go there, but they have to go close to it

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.920
 So it's possible. They like landed the plane exactly perfectly. Okay

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.520
 As weird as that is to believe that that is

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.480
 Let me let me ask you this maybe it's just the impact in tech

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.560
 But I don't feel like has been felt in the way. I thought I mean, I know there's been a lot of layoffs

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.680
 so

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.560
 Uh, I'm not trying to have kids. Oh, then the chat is good

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.680
 It's it's just starting to hit the react team right now

00:36:54.680 --> 00:37:00.280
 Okay, so let's just say

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.600
 There are a million devrels. I have no idea how many devrels there are if there's even like a title

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.000
 That you can like actually I don't know

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.200
 Uh, let's say there's a million. How many do you think they'll be in five years?

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.880
 I have no idea

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.680
 I feel like I felt it in tech heavily

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.080
 Oh, just like the layoffs or other things

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.040
 No, not the layout

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.240
 Well, because this

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:24.840
 The space that I operate in is the first to get influence which is a startup like startup funding all that stuff

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:31.800
 Yeah, the entire conversation around fundraising is like a thousand percent different than it was for the last five years

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.480
 Uh, and it actually feels great because it's like a return to normalcy

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.880
 Yeah, so I feel like that happened in like the course of a year

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:41.400
 And I don't want it to go any further because I think we're in like a good place right now

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.800
 Uh, someone messing with me the other day. They're taking much of BC meetings and they were like

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.720
 man

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:52.040
 BCs don't care about growth or traction like they just want to see revenue numbers. I'm like

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.440
 Oh, yeah, like that makes that actually makes a lot of sense. Like that's not weird. That's normal

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:01.640
 Uh, yeah, but so different from how you would raise money before and I'm happy with it because

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.120
 For the past five years, it's been a mystery

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.680
 Like if I wanted to go raise money. I didn't get it. I was like, I see a good business

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.880
 They're not able to raise money. I see a stupid business. They're raising a shit ton of money

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.200
 Yeah, I don't understand how to do this. Yeah, doesn't make it. There's like no logical plan

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:20.600
 Now it's like returning back to like, yeah, if you have a good business, you get to raise more money

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.040
 Yeah, if you have a shitty business and don't have a good model, you don't get to raise money

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.040
 So yeah, that should be I felt that there and that's where the most of the craze was happening

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:33.640
 So yeah, that space got impacted very hard a lot of ecs are gonna go bust and it's gonna be brutal

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.520
 um, I think every layer down is just less

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:41.480
 Jurassic of an impact, but you know millions of people did get laid off right so

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:46.440
 It's a good idea. Yeah. No, I don't know where are we in the layers? Are we lower or higher?

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:51.480
 You said every layer down is less less dramatic of an impact layer. Do we operate in?

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:55.960
 Yeah, how much impact are we getting who's we because I think like I said me being the sort of space

00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.600
 I think I was closer to to the oh, we're not in the same layer. We're in different layers

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:04.760
 I don't know what layer you're in. I don't know what you do every day. I don't layer you in

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:10.600
 Is this like the OSI model kind of like seven layers? Are we talking like a how many layers like a three layer cake?

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.840
 What are we talking?

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:18.520
 How is this going to affect me dax me? It's about me. I don't understand any of your

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:23.800
 Finances income. I don't understand any of it. So I have no idea how to affect you

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.920
 Okay, I believe I am closer to the sun than you are

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.600
 The sun being like the sun is bad. Do you want to be close? The sun being the VCs and the

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:37.800
 Pause of money there. I think I am closer to that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that makes sense

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:42.040
 I don't know the dev real thing. I tried to like make you talk about everyone you just didn't take the bait

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.440
 So now I'm trying again milky already posted

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.080
 That clip of me for this week. So I'm at my limit on talking about dev real

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.240
 Cliff. Yeah. No, I know

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.120
 You're trying to walk the line and it's fun

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.400
 It's fun to just watch you try and dodge all the questions

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:04.040
 Well, I said this before there's no group of people are more terrified than dev rel because there are I could think of one group

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.760
 At least one

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.560
 I know things you've cut out. Sorry

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.120
 Yeah, that's true. Yes, that's true

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:18.680
 So, but I guess like here's my real question and you don't have to talk about if you don't want to talk about it

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.400
 Just don't talk about it

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:24.920
 But the stripe have a dev rel theme that they just like make good docs and then become like a trillion dollar company

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.480
 Isn't that the model? Why are we all? I don't understand

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.320
 They probably have people doing the role because I know one can define

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.760
 Dev rel role

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:38.120
 They probably have people doing that and focusing all their time on docs and SDKs and all that all that great stuff

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.720
 That makes her probably great. Yeah, I just think they don't uh navel gaze about it

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:48.280
 Where they don't have I think right. I think a very common split right now is like

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:55.320
 Uh, someone's in developer relations role. They spent 20% of their time doing the job and then Ava's another time talking about the job

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.080
 I think that's like a very

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.080
 That thing that we see a lot. Yeah

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.400
 Uh, I just maybe the stripe team just doesn't do that so we never hear hear from them, but they are

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:10.280
 Incredibly good at the point of doing all this which is making developers happy to use your product and understand how to use it

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.240
 Well

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.320
 Uh, but yeah, I guess we never I don't know anyone with that's like, I'm a striped that row. Yeah, same

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:22.280
 I just think of them as baby. I also got corrected yesterday. Someone was like you can't say uh dev rel because dev rel is developer

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.240
 Relations, so you're saying uh developer relations how much shut

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.600
 Shut up shut up

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.560
 Shut up. Uh, it's funny

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:36.120
 I have friends. I mean, I have good friends under the dev rel umbrella

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.960
 So it's very hard to keep like throwing stuff on dev rel. Why are you laughing so hard?

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:45.320
 Well, this is the exact thing where someone says something racist and they're like

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.880
 Well, you know

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.320
 No, I'm I'm not saying like

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.640
 Oh, I have friends that are dev rel don't be offended

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.280
 I'm saying like it's hard for me. I have so many things. I want to say about that idea

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:02.600
 And it's it feels bad because I feel like i'm saying it directly to friends that

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.440
 Good for them like great job. I have no

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:14.280
 Uh qualms with you doing your job. It's more just the idea. Okay, so here's why I think that so that's exactly accurate

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.440
 I feel it too like I like I know a lot of people in this role and

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:23.000
 Uh, I hesitate to make fun of it for that reason but I thought about this the other day

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 I'm like I have no issue making fun of literally almost everything else like not my between two nerds thing

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.240
 I do I make fun of all these people in the most direct possible way

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.920
 And I'm like this is actually the most offensive thing about this

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.160
 I'm okay making fun of them because to me it's clear that

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:47.160
 They have so much value and security they can sit on on some level. I'm being condescending thinking

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.640
 I can't make fun of this group because

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:54.760
 Interesting implying that I think there may be more insecure about yeah about the role

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.160
 The ultimate burn is not burning

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:06.520
 I try to say I try to like uh, you know frame you that way when people are like that's so mean

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.400
 I'm like no, it means he really likes you. I've I've gone to bat for you

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.440
 I did see you post that tweet. I remember milky replying

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.520
 What the hell? That's only been nice to me

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:18.200
 And out of sheer coincidence, I just started making fun of them a lot more after that

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.480
 That's awesome

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.880
 Okay, I think we're done. I think we are. Yeah, that was good

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.560
 Yeah, thanks sax. All right. Yeah, we'll see you later

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.480
 You
