WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
 If you want to write a line on JavaScript, you got to ask me first.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.000
 You go through DAX, yeah.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:28.440
 What'd you say about Tailwind?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.440
 There's some technologies that we're all supposed to,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.720
 we all know we're supposed to say it's good, but we don't actually use.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.080
 And I included Tailwind on that list.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.080
 So literally what I said was, Tailwind is good, but I don't use it.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.680
 Tons of replies being like, you know, actually Tailwind is good.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.880
 It's just like, I thought the anti- Tailwind people were annoying,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.840
 but it turns out you're all just not every single person talking

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.640
 about Tailwind is annoying.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.080
 And then except for you.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.440
 Yeah, except for me, of course.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.480
 You got the right take.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.760
 Yeah. And then today I tweeted, I posted that.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.400
 I was like, hey, everyone, I said Tailwind is good.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.160
 Like, you don't have to tell me that it's good.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.600
 And I know and I, like, three minutes average with that, I'm like,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.560
 ah, damn it, I'm not going to get the reverse.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.360
 I'm going to get all these people replying to me being like, no,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.920
 it's actually bad.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.240
 I don't understand why this one topic is just like such a it just attracts

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.200
 the most annoying parts of everyone.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.880
 Yeah, it really does.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.400
 I love it.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.480
 I know you don't use it, but I also don't have strong opinions about why I love it.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.920
 I just once I started using it, I kept using it.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.120
 Yeah, I mean, I guess I've used that pattern for a very long time.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.840
 So I definitely appreciate it.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.240
 I just don't use it anymore.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.120
 And that's it.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.120
 It's not more interesting than that.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.040
 It's really not.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.040
 Yeah.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.560
 So I just finished this interview with a linear guy.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.440
 I don't know how much you caught a bit, but I'm mostly happy that it looked like

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.800
 his setup was very good.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.280
 So I think his recording is going to be very good.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.480
 Oh, nice.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.360
 Because usually we get like not like, you know, most people aren't like us.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.080
 I just spent way too much money on our setups that we get.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.600
 Yeah.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.760
 I guess joins using not who was that Liz you had on her setup was off.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.360
 I'm just kidding.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.320
 Well, you know, that that that that that choice is frustrating because she will

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.200
 come to me and she'll be like, Oh, you know what?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.240
 I think it does make a difference to have like a good mic and a good camera,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.680
 especially when she's just talking.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.080
 Anyway, it's investors to customers.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.680
 Like it's a nice first impression.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.960
 I'm like, Oh, great.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.680
 She like, she's into it like nice.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.120
 We can do this.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.600
 We can set it up really well and I want to.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.040
 And then she'll be like, but everything's so ugly.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.120
 Like I want my office to have this, right?

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.240
 And it's impossible.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.080
 It is impossible.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:44.360
 She has like this nice, like warm, interesting lamp, like candle, like zen office vibe.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.240
 You're just not going to get that when you have like a mic arm.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.680
 That's like coming off the side.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.560
 It really sucks.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.440
 The struggle is real.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.720
 Like I wish I could have a really nice looking office like I did before I started

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.160
 doing any of this and also produce video stuff, but there's just no way to make

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.600
 it look good.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.240
 I've tried.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.040
 You can hide the cable.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.600
 That doesn't matter.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.520
 The stuff is huge.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.680
 There's just so much stuff.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.160
 Yeah.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.320
 You have to commit to a different vibe.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.560
 Straight off you're willing to make though.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.360
 You can make it look good for a camera or you can make it look good for people

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.640
 in the office, but not both.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.520
 Yeah, I haven't hidden my cables at all.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.520
 It's a disaster.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.440
 I don't know how you did it.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.560
 There's so many cables.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.040
 I've only hidden the cables around my, like on my desk, like my computer stuff,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.880
 not really my media stuff, like all my cameras and stuff.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.160
 I think I did the first time, tried to like get everything so tucked away.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.520
 And then the first time I went to move it, I was like, never again, never doing

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.000
 that again, because it's really annoying.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.640
 Then when you're like, I'm going to move the camera over here and you got to undo

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.200
 a bunch of cable bundles and it's no good.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.960
 Yeah, my cables are just draped on the ground.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.520
 It's because I mean, I think you have the Sony camera, which is a little bit

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.560
 better because you can plug it straight into your computer, right?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.400
 No, it's a cam link.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.880
 It's powered by just a USB-C cable.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.920
 Oh, USB-C cable.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.400
 OK, so yeah, my camera needs one of those fake batteries with people like a fake

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.080
 battery and the camera and the battery has a wire and that's like a whole battery.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.480
 Yeah.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.640
 That's like a whole another thing.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.680
 And then the cam link wire and then.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.080
 Yeah, it's a it's a lot.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.280
 And what my light is giant.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.960
 Yeah, do you have a giant key light?

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.880
 Yeah, you see what I did, though.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.600
 I just went with, I'm just going to, I didn't choose to go with this dark aesthetic,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.880
 but it's just because I don't want this giant thing.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.800
 My room is small, so I feel like it's going to get super hot.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.080
 I've never, I've never seen pictures of your office.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.920
 I don't actually know what it looks like.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.280
 Take.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.240
 Well, the reason I don't share pictures is because my cable management is terrible.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.480
 So I think any picture facing this way, like towards my computer, it just looks terrible.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.000
 Yeah.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.040
 Is it good aside from the camera and lights and stuff?

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.920
 Like do you have your computer cable management sorted out?

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.040
 Like my desk is fine.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.160
 Yes.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.240
 My desk is fine.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.520
 Yeah.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.680
 But like behind my desk on the floor is terrible.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.640
 Why you can see it when you take a picture.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.200
 So well, send me a picture.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.600
 You don't have to put it on the internet, but I want to.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.000
 I'm definitely not sending you a picture.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.600
 You're like the most OCD person.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.200
 I just want to understand.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.920
 I feel like if I see someone's working space, I understand them better.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.040
 You know, that's true.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.200
 I don't know if I want you to understand me like this, though.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.920
 That's funny.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.640
 So the linear thing, linear is real good.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.960
 And I heard people saying something like, Oh, I use notion instead.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.440
 Talk about a contrast.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.200
 Notions, like the slowest thing I've ever used in my life.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.640
 It is so bad.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.760
 How do people use notion?

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.600
 I don't understand it.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.760
 So Liz is like a notion power user.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.600
 Like she should.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.440
 She just like start a discord or something where she just like, yeah, teaches people notion.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.920
 But even she says now, she said that it used to be really fast.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.160
 And now they've added every single feature possible.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.360
 Like they've added linear features to it.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.960
 They've added air table features to it.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.840
 And it's just kind of becoming this super cheap.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.760
 And it's gotten a lot slower.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.600
 I was hoping it had gotten faster because I haven't used it in a couple of years.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.360
 I was thinking maybe it was just growing pains and it's gotten better.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.760
 You're saying it's gotten slower.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.960
 Yeah.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.720
 Cause even she even she says now it's like she doesn't know if she loves it anymore.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.160
 She does like really crazy stuff in there, but just avoiding that blow.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.040
 If you just avoid blow oftentimes, like that's all you need to do.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.880
 And you're probably just stays very good for a long time.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.040
 I have the personality that like I've downloaded notion.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.200
 I think I did this in a GitHub project too.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.520
 I spend like a week where I just dump like so much information into some big

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.200
 project management thing and like try and like get every little detail that I

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.480
 could possibly track in there.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.920
 And then I never look at it again, like ever.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.240
 Yeah.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.360
 And I never learned I'll do it again in a year or so.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.960
 And then I'm back to this conversation again.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.760
 But yeah, it's just how you know when you're, it's like what role you should

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.960
 have at a company organization.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.400
 And I'm the same way where I let things like if I, let's all try to use

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.200
 some of these tools and I'll get really excited and I'll use them well for a

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.840
 couple of days and then I'll kind of, I'll kind of fall off the habit.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.200
 Yeah.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.920
 And so it falls to the cracks and I'm not really keeping track of things.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.360
 And then there's people like Liz who are just like, she's so, she's so good

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.360
 at keeping everything like not letting anything fall through.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.480
 And there's like making sure everything happens.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.200
 Yeah, like clearly one person is supposed to be a CEO.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.080
 The other person is supposed to be the person listening to the CEO.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.040
 So yes, it's just a personality.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.040
 I feel like you can't like really get better at it.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.600
 Cool.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.440
 I'm not going to try.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.800
 I'm going to try to remember that, but I don't need to try.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.040
 Are you like that in your family as well?

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.960
 Like, does your wife take care of making sure everything happens?

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.200
 So what needs to happen?

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.920
 I guess like when we go on vacation, I'm the one who kind of organizes.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.760
 Like I do all the logistics, like, you know, flight, hotels.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.080
 Actually same, I generally do the logistics for the vacation as well.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.760
 But that's like the only thing.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.360
 Yeah, but once we get there, in terms of like planning out the fun activities,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.280
 that's more Casey.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.440
 But I have, like, when you said family, I did, I remember setting up a notion.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.440
 Like I was like just asking Casey all kinds of questions every day.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.720
 Like because I'm trying to create OKRs for our family.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.120
 Like, what are things we want to try and drive?

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.840
 It was like what I learned about OKRs and then everything I saw was through the

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.240
 lens of OKRs.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.040
 Don't set up OKRs for your family.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.040
 That's the dumbest thing ever.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.880
 It was so stupid or for your company.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.600
 Just don't just don't do OKRs or for your company.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.040
 There you go.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.280
 Yeah, it probably it came out of Google, right?

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.320
 If it came out of Google, probably just don't do it.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.560
 Yeah, Google's dead though.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.360
 This is one of those linear thing.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.280
 Um, so I just talked to the linear guy for the past hour.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.000
 It was really good.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.280
 I think my goals with that, which is a highlight, two points, which I think we're

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.080
 able to get to one and we talk about this a lot where their differentiator was

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.080
 just quality, existing market ideas, very clear.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.920
 Um, so it's very counter to a lot of, uh, you should be embarrassed by what you

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.960
 ship philosophies.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.360
 Uh, yeah.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.080
 So I think we, we kind of talked about that a good amount.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.720
 The other side was like this local first approach.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.640
 That's a more technical thing.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.080
 But more of that first thing, I saw a thread the other day where someone was

00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:01.440
 arguing that a lot of that advice around like ship really, uh, I don't, I don't want

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.080
 to butcher this because I think there's nuance here, but again, this idea of like,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.720
 if you're not embarrassed by what you shipped, you shift too late.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.560
 Uh, the person was arguing that this is a little, this kind of outdated,

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.880
 device, outdated advice and it made more sense in an era where there was not a

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.080
 crazy amount of software and a crazy amount of competition.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.480
 Yeah.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.920
 Uh, and she was saying with her, her own company, that's what they did.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.320
 And it just didn't go anywhere because it sucked.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.920
 It just was not a good product.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.800
 And they really spent time making a very, very good product up front and then

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.800
 hitting the market with it.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.280
 And that went way better.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.400
 Just cause there's so much competition.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.920
 Like you really need to differentiate on quality these days.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.120
 So he was arguing that the bar is much higher with that debate was different.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.280
 And that's what they did, right?

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.400
 Like did they, from the start, they were like, we're going to make the best

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.600
 possible app.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.080
 Yeah.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.320
 And I didn't hear that part.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.400
 They were, yeah, they were very clear.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.320
 I asked on that what their initial pitch was.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.200
 And they were like, yeah, it's just on the execution.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.360
 Like it's the only reason we exist is to do this like a hundred times better

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.480
 than anyone's done it before.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.280
 Hey, did you ask him or do you know if they've like seen anybody, even

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.520
 incumbents start moving that way, trying to compete on quality?

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.320
 Or are they just so far ahead that nobody's even trying?

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.680
 Yeah, I didn't ask.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.920
 But my, my sense of it is it's not the thing you like can just decide to do.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.680
 It's like, we have to decide to be good now.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.040
 I think everyone's trying to do that forever.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.640
 But it's like a rare company that can actually execute that well.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.960
 So when you talk, you say stuff on Twitter, like performance is about

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.000
 architecture and choosing an architecture that allows you to create a

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.480
 really great experience, a really great performance app.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.320
 That just sounds so like high level and abstract to me.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.680
 Why don't you just start saying like the local first thing?

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.640
 Like why I don't hear that enough.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.320
 And it's something that I think there is a correct answer.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.400
 Like if you want to build something, perform it in fast, it's this way.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.320
 Or I guess there's some apps that you can.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:57.760
 Yeah.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.320
 I think I've been working towards it.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.960
 I think more recently, I've been saying more specifically, like you

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.800
 need to evaluate this local first approach.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.480
 There's this company that has proved it out.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.480
 It's not theoretical.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.720
 I'm not like giving you some philosophy that I made up in my head.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.480
 Cause it sounds good.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.280
 It's I like found it out of a product that is incredible.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.520
 Um, yeah.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.880
 And yeah, I'm sure people are going to start to find me annoying.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.000
 And they're going to like treat it like every other thing that gets kind of hyped.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.040
 I don't think so, Dax, what are you talking about?

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.360
 But yeah, but, uh, I think my intention with this is a little bit different than

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.120
 other technologies.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.160
 I think with other technologies, people get excited by it.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.720
 Cause they're like a user of it and they like, are just interested in it.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.880
 That's definitely an aspect of this.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.800
 But for me, I just want the apps everyone make.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.360
 Like when I'm a user of an app, I just want it to be better.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.240
 And this is like the thing that's blocking that from happening.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.080
 Like people not trying this approach.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.200
 Uh, every single app where I feel like it's slow, it's funny.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.880
 Cause, uh, I think I've been ruined in a lot of ways.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.640
 Cause I spent so much time looking and researching and studying this that whenever

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.600
 I use an app that is not using these techniques, it's like painful for me to use.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.120
 Cause I notice every little like delay, I know it's every little thing that they didn't

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.680
 do and it's painful.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.400
 Like even using something like the Vercel dashboard where like, you know, they're

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.600
 like the good web app company, everything just feels slow and laggy.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.080
 And they're spent, there's loaders everywhere.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.880
 And that's blank.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.280
 There's like loading stays and empty states everywhere.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.680
 And it's like, I don't understand like this, the, the working set of data here is

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.560
 probably like a hundred kilobyte.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.320
 It's like this could have just been all instant.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.800
 Um, so everything is just painful now.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.160
 And I don't think I can't really enjoy.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:39.880
 I'm like, ruin, can you, can you take me back to like your first experience

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.560
 with linear, assuming that was the first app where you, you saw this pattern.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.840
 When you felt that speed, did you, I mean, did you immediately just know what

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.400
 they were doing?

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.440
 Did you start like inspecting WebSocket connection messages and like figure out,

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.720
 oh, they're like syncing all the, how did that revelation come to you?

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:01.200
 So early on, I might be complaining with super human because I, linear was

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.680
 up in the first app that I used that had this pattern and made me realize, like,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.360
 wow, stuff can be so good on web.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.320
 Uh, but I had heard of super human before that and their big pitch.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.720
 Well, I was either them early and I forgot who it was, but they were like

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.680
 every interaction under 50 milliseconds or something.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.560
 Like they had some rule where like no interaction can take longer than that.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:27.320
 Um, so I knew that that was impossible to do over like network round trips.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:27.880
 Yeah.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.880
 Uh, so I think I did start inspecting it.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.480
 But the edge decks, did you consider the edge?

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.400
 Yes, I did.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.280
 And it does not help.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.640
 So of course, I'm going to skip right over that.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.520
 Uh, okay.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:38.800
 Sorry.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.000
 Yeah.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.080
 But the guy I talked to to us, he, uh, he actually did give a talk a long time ago.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:50.120
 It's, it's so funny because it's like one of the most influential, impactful

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.400
 things I've ever listened to.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.000
 And it's like, it's not like some grand talk at some big conference.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.080
 It looks like a little meet up, like a little me.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.760
 And as a kind of camera, I got a weird angle and he's like giving this talk,

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.400
 explaining the sync engine of linear.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.560
 And I think I, I think I basically watched that and I was like, oh, okay.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.760
 I see how all this works.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.040
 Like all the operations are local.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.760
 Yeah.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.120
 From then on, I've just been obsessed with this concept.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.680
 And I think in this interview, I talked a lot about that.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.240
 But there's a lot more than that.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.880
 There's like a lot of like UX patterns.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.400
 Uh, I was talking about it earlier.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:23.400
 I was arguing with Jay yesterday because, uh, so Jay does all the design for our

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:23.640
 stuff.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.040
 Our stuff looks really, really good.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.920
 Cause he's very good design, even though he's not a designer.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:33.680
 Uh, but I had a point disagreement with him because, and this is going to sound so

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.280
 stupid, right?

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.600
 Everyone that hears this is going to be like, that's the type of stuff that

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.880
 people waste time on.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.760
 So that should bring their product.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.600
 But I'll tell you exactly what we're arguing about for clickable elements.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.920
 Like let's, it was like this tab, the thing that you click on.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.400
 Uh, uh, he made it.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.480
 So when you mouse over it, there's a fade in transition to like light up the

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.640
 elements and there's a fade out transition.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.760
 And I was arguing that we should take out all fade in transitions because they

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.320
 make the app feel slightly slower.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.400
 It doesn't feel as snappy.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.440
 Um, and this is something I discovered in linear.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.080
 Cause I was like, why do their animations feel so good?

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.760
 Oh, it's because when you mouse over, the response is immediate.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.920
 So it feels like you're not waiting for something to finish.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.680
 Uh, but then when you mouse out, you saw that nice, like fade out.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.440
 So it feels like a nicely animated app.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.640
 Uh, so they do all these like little tiny, tiny, tiny things.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.360
 Uh, another great example is if you're hovering over something, you get it

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.280
 and you get a tool tip and you move to something else.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.800
 Cause you're like, okay, I want to see a tool tip for this one.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.720
 You don't get this thing where the first tool tip disappears and there's a

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.920
 delay for the second tool tip to show up.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.680
 They know you're going from an open tool tip to probably another open tool

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:36.920
 tip.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.280
 So they just show the second tool tip right away, but if you mouse out and

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.640
 then come back and there's a little bit of a delay just to confirm that.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.560
 That's really what you want to do.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:49.040
 So it's like in detail that's like, yeah, all the general advice would be,

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.840
 like, do not put that to go waste of time, right?

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.800
 Um, and it's just infinite stuff like that in there.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.240
 Uh, why are we all so bad?

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.880
 We're all just so bad at Billy.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.240
 Like why, why isn't everybody doing this?

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.520
 Why isn't everybody, is it just too hard?

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.080
 It's hard.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.120
 Is it too hard for the average developer to care about all these little things?

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.080
 It's hard.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.680
 And I feel like there just has to be so much else not sapping your energy.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.680
 Like, you know, 0% of my time, or energy is sapped because, you know,

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.360
 I'm using Jira and I hate using Jira or like, I don't like the, I don't

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.000
 like the way my manager and just me or like, yeah, my company's doing something

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.520
 stupid.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.160
 I feel like all those micro thing just make it so you just don't

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:28.960
 have energy to try.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.880
 Cause I feel like you, the things you work on, you've tried pretty hard.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.040
 But you go, you go crazy on the details.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:34.320
 Yeah.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.880
 Cause I don't have those things sapping my energy.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.720
 That makes sense.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.960
 Yeah, I mean, just work by yourself or in a tiny company.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.360
 And a lot of those things go away, right?

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.000
 Yeah.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.080
 And that's why I think like companies can't just decide to like do this one day.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.880
 It's like you have to like commit to that from the beginning.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.640
 Yeah.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.120
 Yeah.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:52.720
 Like GitHub.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.560
 I wish GitHub were all this stuff local first, super snappy.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.800
 Uh, and why couldn't there be?

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.160
 Why couldn't there be a GitHub competitor?

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.680
 Why have we all just penciled in GitHub?

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.960
 It's down like more than any app I use all the time.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.880
 Like, why, like, why couldn't somebody commit?

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.040
 I, like I look at the bit bucket and get lab.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.680
 They're just worse.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.240
 I mean, they're just worse apps.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:16.480
 Yeah.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.840
 So somebody go in and just say, I'm going to make the best possible

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.200
 get repository app with pull requests and whatever, make the linear of GitHub.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.240
 That needs to happen.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.320
 Somebody's going to do that, right?

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.160
 Yeah.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.160
 I think that the interesting thing with GitHub though, and I've been

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.120
 reflecting on this because of, because of threads.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.560
 Have you seen the thing with threads where they're like, they're

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.280
 definitely like the hype is the initial hype is done now.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.880
 Yeah, I haven't used it in forever.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.000
 Yeah.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.640
 And it got like 50% daily either views or something.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.160
 Yeah.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.280
 I don't know how that's going to play out, but let's assume that

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.400
 threads like guys, you know, they couldn't really find their footing.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.000
 Yeah.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.600
 It's like a crazy demonstration of how powerful we all know network

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.920
 effects are powerful, but like this is like an insane demonstration where

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.040
 Twitter's established network is so powerful that Facebook can like air

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.800
 drop an app to a billion people.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.000
 And it still can't defeat it.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.120
 So I kind of wonder if GitHub is in a similar situation, because they are a

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.360
 little bit social, the social side of GitHub.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.200
 Has it ever really stuck though?

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.800
 Do people like go to GitHub and like look at the homepage or I don't know.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.920
 I'm always just going directly into a repo, directly to pull requests.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.240
 Like the interactions I have on GitHub.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.120
 I never think about the fact that I have a profile on GitHub.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.080
 Maybe other people do.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.800
 Maybe I'm just kind of, I'm not a huge open source guy.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.080
 So I probably spend less time in there than the average person, but I feel like

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.800
 you just, if you started with a few big names, got people to put their repos

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.800
 on your thing and use your kind of beta test, your much better app.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.960
 Like they're not going to use GitHub.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:52.280
 They're using your thing now and like, I don't know, it seems less like

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.880
 entrenched than something like Twitter to me.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.200
 Yeah.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.200
 No, it's definitely true.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.760
 I guess I was thinking more about that, about the open source side where like

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.400
 you probably want to put it on GitHub because you want collaborators and like

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.200
 people open issues that I didn't know about.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.960
 So there's like a thing there, the social stuff, the actual social stuff.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.600
 Yeah, that's like pointless, but I guess you do make a good point.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.080
 Like technically GitLab exists.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.040
 And you could instead of shooting a dethron GitHub, you could shoot to dethron

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.680
 GitLab, and that's already like a massive market.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:25.280
 And yeah, you just need to capture people that don't need their stuff to be on GitHub.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.520
 That's, yeah, that's, yes, I guess you're right.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.280
 Someone could could do this.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.000
 This could be like, it could be a fantastic product.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.640
 Do it and remember us when you're famous.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.720
 And, and when we give us percentage.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.160
 Yeah, yeah, we'll take a cut and we'll want to have you on the episode on the podcast

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.400
 sometime to talk about it.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.200
 Just like we talked to the linear guy, like, how did you make such a great app?

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.920
 Oh, because you've heard it on this podcast.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.440
 Tell us more about this podcast.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:53.560
 Yeah, the thing that sucks about those, all the Git stuff, I feel like you need

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.320
 to spend like a year becoming an expert on Git to become a Git host.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.840
 What would you, how much does GitHub really, like, I feel like there's so much in

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.640
 Git that is not really manifested in GitHub.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.880
 You don't do any, I mean, they don't have deep integration with like doing

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.040
 weird, bisect stuff or like true, right?

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.160
 It's just like pull requests issues.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.400
 What else?

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.880
 I'm oversimplifying like crazy.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.080
 This is probably some developer trope, but like I could build GitHub and like a weekend.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:23.360
 Come on.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.560
 Well, I just think about how like it needs to be stored as a Git repository,

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.480
 but then it needs to be queryable as a typical web app.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.000
 So it's like you kind of store, yeah, in a database and like you store like

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.520
 each like commit and like the diffs and all that.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.960
 So yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.480
 Some amount, some amount of effort.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.640
 I don't know what it is, but yeah, I guess like thinking of the local first

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.640
 thing, like, but like the working set of memory on a huge repo.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.000
 If you're searching local first through that repo, how much data are we talking?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.640
 Not a lot.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.880
 You'd be surprised at how small data is.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.120
 Text is small because like I think you would, you know, you wouldn't need to store.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:03.160
 You wouldn't need the contents necessarily of every single diff.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.840
 Well, you might just need the metadata.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.120
 But it's like there's like ways you can be creative in it and do it.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.840
 For me, it's more about just like the issue tracking and like the pull request and

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.400
 just kind of like I don't search into the history.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.720
 Maybe not that important, but just like finding a file in the repo, right?

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.920
 The current file, just things like that.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.720
 Yeah, I feel like somebody's going to do this.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.920
 Maybe somebody's already started.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.560
 They've already raised their little seat round and they're already working on

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.840
 the linear quality, GitHub replacement.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.720
 I want this for, uh, and I tweeted about this, hoping someone do it.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:42.080
 I think someone did is kind of doing it, but I want this for a SQL client as well.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.720
 I want a SQL client that lives in my browser tab.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.120
 Yes.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.520
 I don't want to install something.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.080
 1000% yes.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.520
 It needs to be super fast.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.160
 And because I'm using plant scale, I should just be able to OAuth connect to

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.200
 plant scale and they have an thing in beta now and just build me the fastest,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.360
 most responsive client in my browser and I will pay every time I've had to

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:10.520
 download some form of a, like a query tool thing for connecting databases.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.760
 Like, I don't know, a dozen times in my career.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.320
 And every time it's the same, like, what do people use for this?

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.560
 Like there's got to be something good and there never is.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.200
 It's always like PG ads or whatever, and I just hate every second of it.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:21.560
 Yeah.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:21.920
 Yeah.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.000
 Why not somebody do that too?

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.480
 We're just going to, let's just, let's start out all the ideas here.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.160
 Request for startups.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.720
 Yeah.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.120
 Any others, anything else you wish existed?

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.920
 Here's the thing that I've been trying to get my friend to build.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.480
 Um, I want, how do I explain this?

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:44.520
 So I want a tool that lets me connect all my bank accounts and my credit

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.000
 cards and all of that stuff.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:51.840
 Uh, but it's not a financial planning app at all.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.960
 All I need to do is connect all those and let me set up places to pipe it to kind

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.320
 of like a Zapier type of situation.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:05.840
 So I can say like any transaction over $100, send it to my Slack or any transaction

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.320
 for this card, that may email or like put it in the spreadsheet.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.720
 I just want to like pipe stuff and I want to fix stuff in one place.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.800
 So I want to say like, okay, this thing has got categorized wrong.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.280
 So I'm going to fix it in this app.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:17.680
 Yeah.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.360
 So everything downstream has it, has it correct.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.200
 And this is something that I wanted to say.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.640
 Yeah, you just reminded me quick books.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.520
 I want a new quick books, a better.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.600
 That's another one quality quick books, simpler.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.200
 You know what?

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.000
 This is just like linear because how many quick books alternatives are there?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.840
 Like a hundred.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.720
 There's so many.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.080
 Yeah.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:37.400
 Yeah.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.240
 And they're all terrible.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.200
 They're not good.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:39.520
 Yeah.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.040
 They're not.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.240
 They don't just like immediately, you know, just get hooked on the product experience.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:49.680
 Yeah. And one of the things that Tomás said was they, the way they thought

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.440
 about initially was no project management tool focuses on the IC, like

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.680
 giving a good experience for the person actually doing the tasks.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:03.160
 I think in the quick books world, it's like for me and you were like, we're not

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.160
 like a real small business.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.040
 We're like, right.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:08.200
 Yeah.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.400
 This weird thing where we're kind of just independent.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.960
 And no one has really executed on that really well.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.640
 Cause quick books, 99% of the UI, I don't need to touch.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.280
 Do you guys also always changing?

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.920
 I can never find the invoices.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.720
 Like I can never find it.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.400
 Recurring invoices hidden somewhere.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.120
 It's just like no one is focused on that.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.040
 No one has built a good.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.480
 I want it.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:30.880
 Yeah.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.200
 You got me wanting to build like a spa.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.320
 I just want to like play with all this stuff now, like replicash and build a local

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.000
 first thing.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.560
 It's a lot of work, like I said, I will say like it took us.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.840
 Took me a very long time to get good at building this way.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.880
 And now we started a new project with me having that knowledge.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:53.000
 Uh, yeah, it took me a month before like things were even like set up correctly.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.200
 I mean, now people can just clone that.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:59.760
 Just in terms of like, cause so replicash, it's like a front end library.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.920
 It's only a front end library.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.320
 Yeah.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:01.640
 Yeah.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.520
 And then you have to implement the whole back end for it.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.120
 I can protocol.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.160
 Are there guides is there?

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.240
 Can you like package that up into an SST contract or something that people can

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.840
 just use for like a vanilla synchronization back end?

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.640
 Well, there's, there's definitely guides that document the protocol.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.840
 That's how I, how I did it.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.960
 Plus poking around some of their example implementations.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.560
 It can't be a construct cause it requires like just stuff everywhere.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.640
 Like you, your front ends of the instruction in a certain way.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.080
 Your back ends of the instruction in a certain way.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.040
 Like your domain logic needs to be short in a certain way.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.680
 There's just like transaction requirements on your database.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.040
 You can't use Dynamo.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.840
 You have to use a SQL database.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.960
 So I think our project, like the SST console, people should just copy that.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.080
 And like just like a template.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.960
 We need to extract that onto a template without, without all the, uh, the

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.000
 console specific stuff.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.920
 But yeah, there's just a lot of patterns I had, I've had to invent.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.480
 Like I want to type safety end to end just like TRPC and that's something I had

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.200
 to figure out myself.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.040
 So it took a while, but now that we have up and running, like, we've been

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:05.080
 shipping features like so, so quickly, uh, that's another weird benefit.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.640
 Not only is it good for the user, but adding new features.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.440
 Like I need to store this new thing and synchronize it.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.600
 It just like very, very easy.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:13.960
 Yeah.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.520
 Oh, it makes sense that it would be.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.240
 Yeah.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.520
 Why aren't I feel like the whole web dev focus right now is so far from this.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.360
 Yeah, I know.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:26.120
 And I don't know why it are more site is the site's first app thing, actually a

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.120
 thing, what are your, what is your opinion on that?

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.480
 I asked that before, put that pull out the other day.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.840
 I asked, uh, the thing you work on for work, not your made up side project.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.600
 That doesn't exist.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:41.280
 Uh, what is it described best as a site or as an app?

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.760
 I think 70% of people said it was an app.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.200
 So really, yeah, even on Twitter.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.080
 So do you, do you believe that distinction is a real distinction?

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.560
 Is that some weird artifact of the way things used to be and it will go away?

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.240
 Or are there actual fundamental distinctions?

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.680
 Should some apps be more site-like?

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.360
 Yeah, go ahead.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.920
 So I think I'm in the conservative camp of, yes, there is a very clear difference

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.800
 and everything that I do, I like delineate between these two things.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.200
 And it makes a lot of sense for me.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.600
 And I go to one extreme or the other.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.560
 Um, I think a lot of these modern frameworks are trying to push for the idea of like, no,

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.920
 there isn't a, there, you can have a framework that kind of does it all?

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.000
 And does it all like progressively, all that stuff?

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.760
 I have never seen an app.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.640
 I've never seen an incredible app like veneer shipped with a product like that.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.120
 So I don't, I refuse to believe it.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.040
 And I, I could rationally, I, I can point out to why I don't think it's possible.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.040
 Um, but I'm not going to argue that because I'm like, just show me a product until you do.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.320
 I don't have to like really consider it.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.040
 Yeah.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:40.400
 Yeah.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.680
 I mean, it makes sense that they're just fundamentally different.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.800
 Like if you're approaching a site where people are just there for a moment

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.240
 and then they're gone and it's like very different than if they're going to be there

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.120
 for like, they're using it every day for hours.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.040
 It's just a very different thing that I would think fundamentally that are too

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:00.480
 separate.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.400
 Yeah.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.080
 Concerns.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:02.560
 Yeah.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:02.960
 Yeah.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.520
 Yeah.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.280
 Yeah.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.480
 I'm, I'm sticking with that.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:09.440
 There are, there's a difference, but I think people do want to try to blur that a little bit.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.760
 But yeah, people would self describe it as 70% people.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:18.440
 I work on 70% of people build apps and, and what are we focused on?

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.240
 Server side rendering RSCs.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.560
 Yeah, it's interesting.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.680
 I hate using this argument because it's like kind of the idiot's argument.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:32.640
 But if you look at these stats and you look at where the conversation is, like, you need

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.160
 something to explain that discrepancy.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:41.320
 And it just has to, the only explanation is like the, the financing of the

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.720
 sun, like the money poured into some of these areas.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.360
 If everyone is saying that, or nine, one, seven percent, people are saying that

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.160
 this stuff isn't relevant for me.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.480
 Why is that just the topic that keeps coming up?

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:56.480
 It just has to be something like something influenced what would otherwise be

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.560
 the natural market inefficiency.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.880
 Yeah, or, yeah, I guess.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.480
 So it's like a waste of money in a lot of ways.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.320
 Yeah.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.520
 A VC bet that takes years to play out and then maybe doesn't potentially.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.360
 Yeah, maybe doesn't.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.360
 Huh.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.360
 Do you think I've seen some people kind of grumbling on Twitter about like the

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.360
 complexity of the web.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.640
 I mean, this is always a recurring theme that like things are getting so complex.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.880
 And it's that things are getting so complex for some perceived developer

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.760
 experience benefit.

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.080
 Do you think if things are getting more complex, that they're actually

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.800
 benefiting the developer experience or is that sort of counter?

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.000
 To the goal of improving your developer experience.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.440
 Yeah.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.040
 I was actually going to post something about that because I was seeing that as

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.640
 well, uh, things are getting more complex for a good reason.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.560
 It's like the linear reason.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.120
 It got more complex because you're chipping something really crazy.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.000
 That was crazier than anything else.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.160
 It's been before it.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.960
 Uh, and that's what we're trying to do is manage your tasks.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.480
 I don't know if people understand this, but like if you have tasks, you can

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.480
 really, you can manage them so fast.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.240
 Sorry.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:58.840
 Continue.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.120
 It's, it's crazy blazingly fast, as I say.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.360
 But if you look at our package, Jason, it's under 40 lines.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.920
 Wait, uh, your package, Jason is under 40 lines.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.800
 Is that a flex?

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.880
 I actually think it is.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.640
 I'm going to post it.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.680
 And I think people are going to look at it and they're going to be like, that's

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.760
 a lot smaller than my package.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:19.920
 No, I think just it sounds over like a voice medium that just doesn't sound impressive.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.000
 Like my package, Jason is less than 40 lines, people.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.160
 I don't know what to tell you.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.720
 The implication there is we have very few dependencies and like, you know, there's

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.840
 not really a lot going on to achieve this thing.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.960
 Uh, I mean, I'm talking about the front side.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.920
 So on some hand, I think a lot of this complexity is opt in.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:41.080
 I think people like smashed together, like way more libraries than they need.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.640
 And they put together way more tools than they really need.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:48.800
 So if we're able to achieve a pretty high bar with a dependency set, that's

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.480
 like probably half the size of what we guess most, most projects are.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:52.760
 Yeah.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.280
 There, it's almost some amount of that is self-inflicted.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:55.640
 Right.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.000
 Yeah.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.280
 And I will say, like my SST projects, I love my TS config, my package, Jason.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.320
 I love the, like boy, the plate files, how small and concise they are.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.240
 I think there's just like, there's no definitive guides out there.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.480
 They're like, Hey, don't just like craft your TS config or don't just craft

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.400
 whatever, like derive from these things.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.320
 There's some like known ones that are good.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.400
 And I wouldn't have found that on my own.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.520
 I don't know how you find all this stuff, but it's so nice to see that kind of

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.040
 concise jokes aside, like this, the concise package, Jason.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.480
 And, and just, it does feel like SST, you guys have thought through like a

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.480
 TypeScript monorepo project was a nightmare.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.360
 And now I feel like in SST land, there's some Sandy.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.600
 I can kind of like see all the lines and understand them.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.680
 Yeah, exactly.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.560
 And I think that's like we like, because we ship templates and starters and all

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.040
 that, because we need to for help people use it.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:53.560
 And it hurts us whenever we have to ship like an extra config file or like,

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.640
 because we know like the first impression of it is now like X percent worse.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.600
 Um, and I do think obsessing over that is rational because of what you said,

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.000
 like then you can kind of understand it easier and it just feels lighter weights.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.920
 It does come to judgment at the end of the day.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:10.280
 I think for me, I've swung more in this way because I've had some interactions

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.160
 with people that are like on the extreme of like anti tool.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.040
 Like they don't even use TypeScript because that involves a compile step.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.280
 And like, there's like the extreme on that side.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.640
 I don't go that far because I can't ship the stuff I need to ship using that model.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.400
 But I had been influenced by them to like double check.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.840
 Can this be simpler?

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.040
 Like, do I actually need this as a benefit of this going to last?

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.200
 But there's a judgment thing.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.000
 So we don't put ESLint in our templates.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.560
 Yeah.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.360
 And I think most people would probably disagree with that.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.640
 So, you know, it's reasonable to add ESLint, um, but for us, like we don't, we don't use

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:41.920
 lending.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.800
 So there's some amount of like judgment, zone of judgment.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.160
 You have to decide on for yourself.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.800
 I do like the limting thing.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.960
 When you, I remember you telling me that you didn't use ESLint when I was complaining

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.960
 about configuring ESLint and it's like, I realized so much redundancy.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.560
 Like, why do I want linting?

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:04.120
 I mean, a lot of it's built into the language server for the language I'm using.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.800
 Why, why do I need this extra thing that is so notoriously hard to configure?

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.760
 Or like, just, I don't want to have so many options.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.760
 I don't like like, oh, I got to think about which linting areas I care about.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.680
 And I got to configure my ESLint accordingly.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:23.200
 I wish like, I want to use all these tools and just not have to think about them.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.760
 And, and that's, and if prettier would just default to no.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:32.120
 That's, that's a one piece of configuration that I need to do.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:32.600
 Yeah.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.000
 But yeah, that's actually exactly it.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.200
 Cause I, I don't, it's not piece of equipment.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.320
 People here, I don't use limting.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.080
 They think I'm opposed to the concept of limting.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.400
 I'm not, I want limting.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.360
 I like really want that as part of my workflow.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:44.760
 Yeah.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.720
 But right now the cost of that is, like you said, I would love to just be able to

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.480
 grab ESLint and use it.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.720
 But as soon as I try to do that, there's some dumbass rule.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.520
 It's enabled by default and to go like somehow find the name, the rule.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.760
 Remember how they can take words and turn it off is not built into my editor.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.640
 I have to like, uh-huh, that overhead as much as I want limting is just not worth it

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.000
 for me.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.560
 And every code base I jump into is like slightly different.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.880
 Cause they have different rules turned on.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.000
 I go, I want it.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.720
 It's just, is that really worth it?

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.200
 And I don't think it is long term.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:15.960
 There's a lot of pain.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.920
 Yeah, a lot of pain.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.680
 Yeah.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:22.080
 I've, I've long hated the dance of like, I'm trying to get node.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.720
 With typescript with prettier and ESLint configured.

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.000
 And it's a day of my life that I won't get back.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.440
 I hate that so much.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.360
 Yeah.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.760
 So I do love that SST create SST app.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.040
 Like just it's handled.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040
 It's a mono repo.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.200
 I know how to structure stuff.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.880
 I think that's where frameworks really, really can shine.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.760
 Yeah.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.760
 It's a, again, I think it's a, it's a hard thing.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.560
 And the JavaScript world is like convincing people to use fewer tools.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:55.360
 Like I almost ever go into, I'm like, uh, like there's just so much here.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:55.600
 Yeah.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.480
 What is it just?

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.840
 What is it about JavaScript developers or this JavaScript community?

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.440
 That just struggles with consensus.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:07.080
 I feel like other places just kind of like everybody decides this is what we're going to do.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.800
 I mean, that's not fair.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.400
 I guess like I'm going back to Python in my mind and like, you've got different.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.200
 Mostly everyone uses black for formatting, but you've got different.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.160
 You know, the PEP, whatever standard.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.600
 There's like, yeah, well, that too.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:20.800
 Yeah.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.680
 The bifurcation of two verse three, but like, I think that's probably less of an issue.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.880
 Now I'm talking about the like PEP and flakes and all the different

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.280
 linting styles people use, like, why can't we all just decide?

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.160
 Like this one's best.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.040
 We're just using it.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.840
 Nobody should have to think about this again.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.840
 I just, I don't care enough about those things that it bothers me when people

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.080
 care so much that they'll like maintain a competing thing.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.040
 When there already was a thing and it was fine.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:42.520
 Yeah.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.360
 I think it's like, uh, these other languages have strong leaders that are

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.640
 effectively dictators that can kind of define that and have like a heavy.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.160
 Right.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:50.840
 The benevolent.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.320
 Yeah.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.480
 The benevolent dictator.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.120
 We need some kind of coup and like, not really a coup because no one's in charge,

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.960
 but maybe there needs to be like, maybe we need to think about it.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.680
 Like, I am trying to become a dictator of JavaScript.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.240
 Like, what do I need to do to take over?

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.120
 Dax, I will, I will submit to your dictatorship.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.520
 Please take over and just put us all out of our misery.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.400
 It's so bad.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.640
 Yeah.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.920
 I mean, that goes with line with your like package manager, like, or package

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.920
 standards thing.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.480
 Exactly.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.880
 So that maybe that's my wedge.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.640
 I start to do that.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.520
 I sort of gain way too much power and I start to like really use it for evil.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.600
 Don't take it dark.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.520
 No, no, no, stop.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.240
 Just stop at the part where you're a benevolent dictator and the JavaScript

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.480
 ecosystem is better for it.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.280
 When I think about this, I think there's a real path because if people

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.960
 tried to like start challenging your power, it's like, can they explain ESM

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.680
 better than you and they can't.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.920
 So you, you win on all those arguments.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.880
 If they could explain, like, ESM versus what's that one called?

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.360
 Yeah.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:51.360
 CJ has better than you than they get to be the leader, but they won't.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.200
 But here's the thing.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.920
 I don't believe that rational arguments, like that actually actually hold.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.920
 Oh, yeah, it's true.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.800
 So the only way to actually win is if anyone argues with me, I just make

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.720
 fun of them till they just there you go.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.440
 Just like some, like this isn't worth it.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:04.760
 Yeah.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.080
 Yeah.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.240
 This isn't worth the personal pain I feel.

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.840
 So I think that's actually the path and the beard.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.600
 I mean, you've got that thick, wise beard.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.360
 You really got a lot going for a year.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.600
 I think we could make this happen.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.000
 Yeah.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.080
 Who's going to oppose you?

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.280
 We could get people powerful friends on our side.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.800
 You're pushing you to the top.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.600
 That's true.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.800
 This needs to happen that we need it, Dax.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.080
 You want to write a line on JavaScript?

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.080
 You got to ask me first.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.280
 You go through Dax.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:27.640
 Yeah.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.080
 I tweeted out jokingly when I moved to Miami.

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:35.960
 I was like, if you want to write TypeScript in this town, you better see me first.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.960
 I love it.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.240
 I'm making this happen.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.480
 I'm going to do everything in my power, which is not very much, but I'm going to

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:50.320
 do everything I can to try and promote Dax as the dictator we all need and deserve.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:50.840
 Yeah.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.000
 And it's kind of like I, it's one of those situations where I'm like a little bit

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.320
 foreign because I'm not like I came into the JavaScript world as like after doing a

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.120
 lot of other stuff.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.400
 That's like a foreign invader situation.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.320
 I like that better or worse.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.080
 I like it.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:07.880
 Yeah, I like it.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.320
 Good.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.320
 It's good.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:14.920
 It's kind of like when you see people that are like committing genocide, it turns out

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.600
 like their background is like one of those people also.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.760
 They like kind of hate themselves.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.240
 So it's good to think it's kind of like that where that's what it needs.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.160
 You kind of hate yourself.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:24.920
 Is that your thing?

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.120
 Yeah, I hate the part of me that's a JavaScript developer.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:27.680
 Like I hate it.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.120
 Like you need.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:28.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.200
 You can't have some of the likes.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.440
 The fact that jobs are developer, I feel like I have to be one.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.840
 I didn't choose to be one.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.280
 I have to be one getting all these other things.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.240
 Very much like the backstory for a dictator.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:39.640
 Yeah.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:39.840
 Yep.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.640
 Love it.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.160
 Okay.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:41.880
 We're going to make that happen.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.280
 Did I tell you I'm a martial artist now?

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:46.720
 Someone was talking about you and martial arts in the chat a second ago.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.840
 I'm a martial artist.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.280
 I don't know.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:48.800
 Tell me more.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.920
 I'm an artist of sorts.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.880
 I did jiu-jitsu today my first time.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.400
 Wow.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.880
 OK, I didn't really do it.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:01.680
 I was there for an hour and they taught us some things, but it's like this

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.640
 class and there's no like, oh, you're a beginner.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.760
 You go to the beginner class.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:11.600
 It's just the class and this purple belt guy who was very kind and built like a

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.880
 bowling ball taught me lots of things.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.440
 It's very physical.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.480
 It's a very physical sport.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.800
 I don't know if you know this about jiu-jitsu.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:23.200
 It's a it's this guy's hands were very strong.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.120
 And when he grabbed my my ghee and threw me around.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.320
 You got you buy the outfit already?

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.160
 I did.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.600
 Yes, they had him there.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.000
 They had the ghee there.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.080
 It's a it's going to be good.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.440
 I think I'm going to get obsessed and it's like I'm just doing it for fitness.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.440
 Like I don't I'm not looking to like beat people up in the streets.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:48.560
 But but it's nice to like, I don't know, roll around.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.200
 My legs are already sore.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.680
 It was an hour and I'm going to do some like private lessons to try and get

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.960
 caught up a little bit because I felt like an idiot just like flowing around.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.880
 All the words.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.680
 Yeah, I don't know if you know how many words are in jiu-jitsu.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.240
 There are so many words.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.240
 Uh, I feel like I do need to just be thrown into it a little bit.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.560
 They just need to actually wrestle me, like just hurt me.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.560
 Physically thrown into it.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.640
 Yeah, just just toss me around, like make me figure out what it really feels like.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.840
 Cause I didn't get to do that today.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.800
 I'm hoping maybe tomorrow will stay interesting.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.600
 Yeah.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.080
 And you're like a good size for it too.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.240
 My friend has gotten really into jiu-jitsu.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.200
 Uh, I think he's above six feet tall, but he's extremely skinny.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.440
 Like he's, he's telling like ways the same as I do.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.960
 I'm like, ooh, yeah, uh, he loves it.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:35.240
 He's super into it, but just given his like physical makeup, like you can

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:38.240
 only do so much as much as skills improve.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:38.600
 Yeah.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.360
 Even me, I worry I'm too wiry.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:44.400
 Like after seeing some of the people in this class and even the instructor,

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.040
 the instructors built kind of like this guy that helped me today.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.280
 They're just very thick into the square, like square people.

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:50.760
 Sturdy.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.080
 Yeah, square.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:52.560
 Yeah.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.400
 Yeah, that's the word.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:00.080
 I got played football, but like I'm not, I'm not that kind of stout and I could

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.720
 see how there's a lot of leverage advantage.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.880
 If you're kind of like lowered the ground, uh, I don't know.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.320
 We'll see.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:05.800
 Yeah.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.480
 That's fine.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:06.720
 They didn't.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.200
 So they have, they have that in the Ozarks.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:09.720
 They haven't.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.760
 So honestly, I've thought about doing something like this, like getting into

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:17.080
 some kind of fitness like martial arts thing for a long time.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.440
 Uh, I used to do Tai Chi at home, just like YouTube stuff.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:24.120
 And I just assumed there wasn't really good options close.

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.600
 There's five minutes from my house.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.680
 There's just what do I call club, Jim?

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.320
 Yeah, there's a Jiu Jitsu place.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.880
 It's Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.280
 I don't know if you're up to speed.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.600
 Uh, this is specifically the Brazilian variant.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.200
 I don't know.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.800
 Actually, I have an idea if that's just like the default, uh, but it's five minutes

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:45.040
 from my house, five star Google reviews, like 300 reviews, the people in there

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.480
 were so incredibly nice and welcoming for like a guy that knew nothing.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.680
 Literally it was like, have you ever trained before?

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.200
 No, I've literally, I know nothing, not a single word of it.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.080
 I know Jiu Jitsu.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:55.760
 That's what I know.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.720
 Uh, but they were so good and like didn't make me feel like I was slowing

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.960
 them down or it was great.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.320
 Yeah, it's, uh, it's big.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.800
 I mean, so when I worked at, uh, Boulevard, uh, in those are back then

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.680
 in the Elixir community, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is, is pretty big.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.680
 And it kind of seems random, but then the founder of Elixir is from Brazil.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.920
 So I wonder if there's like some kind of tie in there, a lot of people, uh, on

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.560
 that team did that.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.000
 And I was like, this is really random.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.320
 And now it's like software engineers in general, there's a lot, there's like a ton

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:27.680
 of them.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.120
 Yeah.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.360
 So I, he asked me the instructor at the end asked me what I do.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.080
 And I said, I'm a software developer.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:37.040
 We got a few people in here that are software developers introduced me to, uh,

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.600
 someone on the EC2 team, an engineer at AWS on the EC2 team.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.120
 Wow.

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.640
 How wild here at Nixa, but he's actually moving back to Seattle in like two weeks.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.720
 Cause they're making everybody come back to Seattle to be with your team.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.840
 Why is he from there?

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:51.880
 I think that's where he's from.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.200
 Yeah.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.160
 Did you tell him that you never use EC2?

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.880
 You're like, cool.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.880
 I try to avoid using EC2 at all costs.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.600
 Yeah.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.200
 It's like, I know what EC2 is.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.240
 That's awesome.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.520
 I mean, EC2 is like the original service.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.000
 I wonder if he's been there from the beginning.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.400
 Well, yeah.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.000
 And it powered, I mean, can only imagine being on that team, like it powers everything

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.800
 above it, like everything else depends on EC2.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.480
 So we don't directly use it much.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.080
 But yeah, it was a, it was an experience.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.680
 I enjoyed it thoroughly.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.680
 I'm already obsessed.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.800
 Um, are you looking up like stuff on the internet?

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.760
 I'm going to go every day.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.640
 We'll see.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.560
 That's exciting.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.240
 I'll report back.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.320
 I mean, just cause it's so convenient.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:31.840
 You have to do it.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.600
 It's like why I go to that CrossFit gym because it's at the end of my street.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.080
 So.

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:35.720
 Yeah.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.840
 It's five minutes away.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.240
 There's nothing in the Ozarks is five minutes from you.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.360
 Like everything is usually like 15 minutes.

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.160
 So the fact that I can just drive five minutes and it's right there.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.080
 It's awesome.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.280
 You can, can you kids do it?

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:47.840
 They can.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.000
 I actually took Acea yesterday just to scope it out before I came today.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.160
 Cause it was like early in the morning, like six a.m.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.080
 So I took Acea yesterday.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.560
 So he also just did his first swim lesson.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.680
 We knew we wanted to get him in something like a thing on the schedule that he

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.920
 has to go to, you know, ideally like a physical activity.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.640
 So we were kind of considering like maybe he'd want to do Jiu Jitsu.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.600
 He saw the people in there kind of wrestling around.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.720
 He's a pretty like gentle guy.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.640
 Like he's a pretty caring and like doesn't want to hurt anybody.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.560
 Doesn't want any.

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.160
 I don't know.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.200
 I think he felt like it was a little too.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.120
 It's definitely intimidating.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:21.600
 Yeah.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.440
 It was a little too rough for him just at first glance.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.240
 But I think I could warm him up to it maybe.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.040
 I'd love to throw him around around the house.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.280
 There were no other kids there this morning.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.960
 So I don't think he could go to that session.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:34.600
 I think they have a kid.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.680
 So I have a funny story with martial arts.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.400
 So when I was growing up, I did a few things.

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:43.040
 And when I was when I was really young, I was it.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.000
 Probably was Taekwondo.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.920
 I arrived to a class and I can't remember what it was.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.760
 I think I missed the beginning.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:54.080
 I missed some part of it and we were we're doing grappling.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.600
 OK, and I was paired with the only other kid in the class was all adults,

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.680
 only other kid in the class.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.920
 And he was a couple years older than me.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.800
 So a lot bigger than me.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.360
 Oh, yeah, so we would do it.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.120
 And he would immediately get me in a he would like choke me like between his knees.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.120
 I didn't know what tapping out was.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.480
 I did not know what tapping out was.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:17.280
 So I would just like get choked and like almost pass out and might be like,

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.040
 this is fucking terrible.

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.160
 And he didn't understand eventually he would call time.

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.320
 And I would like somehow I never passed out.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.760
 But I would just get like choked super hard.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.440
 And then like a couple of classes later, I realized what tapping out was.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:33.880
 I was like, Oh, this is so this makes me think this is so much better.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.920
 And I started to enjoy it.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.040
 So wow, I remember my face like turning red.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.120
 Yeah, you're just depending on that kid having mercy, not being like, well,

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.360
 I guess I'm killing this kid because he's not down at this point of view.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.320
 He was like, I just kept going harder and harder and harder.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.000
 He was trying to get me to tap.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.440
 And I didn't know that was tapping out as a thing.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.680
 I bet people get really hurt that way.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.560
 And someone was asking a chat.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.160
 Did you not know how to say please stop?

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:58.720
 Yeah, try to talk while you're being choked with your neck.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:01.120
 Yeah, head was like, I didn't even think to it.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.280
 To be honest, I didn't even think to like try to say stop.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.760
 So I wasn't trying to get in a stop.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.200
 I was just like, this is the exercise.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.000
 I get choked and I'm learning how to like be choked.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.800
 Wow.

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.000
 Daikwondo.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 The tip for you, tap out.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.960
 What I've heard is like the arm stuff, like you could really

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:20.600
 the arm bar.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.520
 Yeah, have your arm hurt or yeah, they're just trying that.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.640
 The whole lesson that was like, we're learning all these kind of ways

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.520
 to to position yourself in certain contexts.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.880
 And it's like he's explaining to me, like, oh, no, if you don't

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.360
 straighten your arm right there, I'm going to get you in a choke.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.360
 And I'm like, that sounds awful.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.760
 I don't I don't want to be in a choke.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.280
 So they have all these other words for things they'll get you into.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.840
 But I think I just need to be thrown.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.320
 I think I just need to be like wrestling somebody trying to survive

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.320
 and just see how it feels and what all they do.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.120
 I'm going to ask them, I'm going to say, can I actually

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.120
 wrestle someone, please or jiu-jitsu somebody?

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:51.920
 What do you say?

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:52.920
 I don't know.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.680
 I roll around with somebody and see what it's really like.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.680
 That's exciting.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.720
 Everyone's getting into it.

00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.480
 Yeah, now I'm like, do I need to get into it?

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.080
 Because I can't just have everyone around me, like be able to beat me up.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:06.760
 So kind of like, I mean, I'm never going to do this with anybody

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:09.920
 that's not in a geek in a studio or whatever.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:10.960
 You never know.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.600
 You might need to, you might need to do something.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.160
 I mean, I guess it is a skill.

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:15.880
 You never know.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:16.680
 I guess it's true.

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:21.560
 Someone you might get into a fight with your kids and you might need to, you

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.680
 know, put them in a chokehold.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:26.560
 Sounds awful.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.760
 I mean, I know you don't leave your house.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.840
 So those are the only other people you could possibly interact with.

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:30.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.480
 I guess the only people I interact with.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:31.760
 Yeah.

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.320
 It's like the people at mama jeans.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:41.760
 I think I actually, this came up because I started listening to the Lex Friedman

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.920
 podcast and it turns out Lex Friedman, I don't know if you know this, his only

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:49.440
 qualification for guests that he have on the show or that they do jiu-jitsu.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.480
 I believe that's a requirement for all of his guests because I've listened to

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.480
 like three episodes, they all did jiu-jitsu, so does Lex Friedman.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:59.720
 Apparently it's a, either it's a tech thing and I'm only listening to the tech

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.480
 episodes or all of them are, I don't know.

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.400
 There's definitely like a persona, like all the Joe Rogan and Lex Friedman,

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.720
 people are all like super into DJJ.

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.400
 Do I need to listen to Joe Rogan?

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.160
 Everyone always says that name to it forever.

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:14.040
 People would be like, do you listen to that Lex Friedman podcast?

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.640
 I'm like, no, never heard of him.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.320
 I don't know.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.080
 But I also hear the same about Joe Rogan.

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:23.960
 Here's a problem, both of these names are like now controversial names.

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.880
 So if you say I'm listening to Joe Rogan, you have a bunch of people like upset at you.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.520
 Interesting.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.680
 Why, what could you tell me?

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.560
 Give me the quick lowdown on why they're controversial.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:36.840
 The historical reason is it's just like, he was just like a normal interview or

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.560
 whatever, people weren't paying attention to him that much.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.800
 Uh, and then he had a few people on that were controversial and people had the

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.520
 argument of like, you should even have people like this on because you're giving

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.960
 him a platform and he like refused to.

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.560
 So that like created like a negative energy around him.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:57.240
 And now when there is like that type of thing, everything he says, he's not, he's

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.240
 not like the smartest guy.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.560
 So everything he says is like scrutinized and made fun of, et cetera.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.440
 He had a bunch of like vaccine related stuff as well.

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.960
 So I don't care about those things.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:10.080
 I think the major, I like listen to this stuff because there's people I like

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.480
 that go on his show, like Michael Palm was on it.

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.320
 Um, and like he does such long interviews is great to hear something like that

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.960
 talk for three hours versus like a 20 minute thing.

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:23.080
 So that's what I noticed about Lex Friedman.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.520
 When I listened to a few of those, they're so long.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:25.880
 Yeah.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:30.920
 The, the car Mac was like five hours, which I think that was the longest, but still

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.520
 like I just blew my mind when I like most of them are two, three hours.

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:39.320
 Uh, yeah, I think mostly I'm enjoying the people he's having on the show, but

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.280
 what is Lex Friedman also controversial?

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:44.720
 Uh, I think just cause they're, there's kind of all associated with some, like

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.000
 there's like the circle that's associated with it.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.360
 So people like the people who listen to Lex Friedman are considered a circle

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.160
 type of person.

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:55.720
 Lex Friedman, Joe Rogan, like do stuff together and like, oh, they're like friendly.

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:56.000
 Yeah.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.600
 And it's like the guests are similar.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.200
 The recurring guests are kind of similar.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.160
 I know I've never listened to the podcast.

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.120
 So I don't know.

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:02.520
 Yeah.

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.120
 Okay.

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.920
 So I actually know more something about something in pop culture than you do.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:06.560
 Interesting.

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.080
 That's true.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:07.480
 Yeah.

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.520
 So it's kind of like how you're really controversial.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.160
 And I kind of getting broiled in that.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:15.360
 Because I associate with you and I just have to take on all of your

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.000
 controversy.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.160
 Well, you know, it's funny because I think technically the reverses

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:20.520
 happen.

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.320
 Wait, what?

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.000
 Am I controversial?

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:23.280
 Yeah.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.960
 Like your whole controversial YouTube career.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.560
 Oh, interesting.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.200
 I am controversial.

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:32.440
 I had to remove videos, multiple of them.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:35.720
 Those are the ones you want to see, the ones that they have to take down.

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:39.440
 It's like books in the library that you can't read, like the ones that are banned.

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:41.560
 My banned YouTube account.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.680
 Gonna have to check it out at him dot dev.

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:44.120
 OK, that's.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.040
 Huh, there you go.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.240
 Lex Friedman also had this thing where he wrote.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.640
 He was like, I'm going to read a book a week and he like made a list of books

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.120
 and everyone just like roasted him for it.

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:57.040
 So I was just like, once people kind of get into this in the level of scrutiny,

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.680
 like everything they do just gets made fun of like crazy.

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.200
 I mean, that seems like a noble goal to read a book every week.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.400
 So I could learn a lot.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:07.560
 It was like very mechanical where like it doesn't matter how like long the book

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.880
 was or how important the book was.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.080
 Like you just allocate a week to or something like that.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:11.480
 I don't know.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:11.800
 Yeah.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:16.040
 Uh, so I get why it was a little weird, but yeah, these people are just all

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.080
 with everything they do just blows up in this way.

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.840
 So be careful, be careful out there.

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:20.840
 I'll be careful.

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.600
 Uh, I was the deluxe Friedman when he had, uh, Andreessen on.

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:25.920
 So good.

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:28.000
 I could listen to that stuff.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.920
 Just felt like, I don't know, somebody who was there at the beginning, you know,

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:36.200
 the browser stuff at the very, very beginning, like he chose the colors for

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.840
 hyperlinks like blue and then purple when you visited it.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:40.120
 Like that's just cool.

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:43.440
 I want to hear people like that talk more because I just have not had those

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.200
 kind of inputs.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.120
 I've never listened to Mark Andreessen talk.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:47.880
 I hadn't either.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.680
 That was the first I'd ever heard him speak at all.

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.120
 Yeah.

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.280
 Uh, he actually talked about something not technical that was the most fascinating

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:54.440
 thing.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:58.280
 The thing that I took away from it and had to tell my wife is about this book.

00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.920
 I can't remember the title of the book now.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.200
 You'll just have to go listen to that three hour episode.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.920
 Uh, but he talked about this book.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:09.160
 It was like a, an ancient like Greco Roman historian or something that had

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:15.760
 like basically an outlined human civilization and those early, like early

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:21.320
 societies, how extreme and cult, like the, the, basically all of society

00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:25.800
 was made up of these cults that were just like 100,000 times more extreme

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.520
 than what we would think of as a cult today.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:27.960
 Oh, wow.

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:31.840
 And that everyday life was so centered around survival that like it was just

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:32.600
 extreme.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:36.720
 I mean, like in ways we wouldn't recognize or we could never kind of fathom,

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.680
 but like everybody in that setting knew their place and they all had this

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:43.720
 like, you woke up every day knowing exactly what you had to do or people

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.720
 around, you could die.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.240
 Yeah.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:49.080
 Whereas today we're so far away from survival that like we're just this very

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.520
 deluded down society.

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:56.200
 That's just like literally hundreds of thousands of times less intense.

00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:00.840
 So we have all this like the clickbait and the fake drama and the like hot

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:04.600
 takes, it's all just so we kind of feel something because it's such a deluded

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:08.120
 down world that we live in compared to back then, it's really interesting

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.520
 when you start digging into that stuff.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:13.280
 And it touches on like religion and like all of these things, you know,

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:18.040
 patriotism, like ways that we try to create some semblance of, of something

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:21.040
 that's like that, because there's this part of us that's sort of evolved with

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:24.640
 that really fascinating stuff that blew my mind.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.120
 I don't know how they got to talking about it, but I want to read the book.

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:27.600
 Nice.

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.520
 That sounds interesting.

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.760
 Yeah, I've never really heard Mark Anderson talk or I don't really even

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:32.680
 read stuff by him.

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.360
 I've read both of Ben Horowitz's books.

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:36.320
 I don't know if he has more than two.

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.160
 I read both of them.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.920
 And he, I have like always really, really liked him.

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:43.760
 Which one is he the subtle art and?

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.600
 No, he, what, what did Ben Horowitz did?

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:53.040
 The latest one was who you are is what you do, which is all about company culture.

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.400
 And the first one is the hard thing about hard things.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.960
 Well, hard thing about hard things.

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.720
 That's one I was thinking of.

00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.160
 Yes, I have.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:53:59.440
 Yeah.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.640
 So the first half of the one time, yeah.

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:05.160
 So the first half of the book, everyone will read the first part of the book in one

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.720
 sitting because it's just his story of like founding his company and like the

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:15.360
 insane ups and downs that they had, like they were in like one crazy scenario to

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:19.040
 the next to the next and next for like such a long period of time.

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.840
 It was like barely scraping by and like eventually making it.

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:26.840
 It's like thrilling to see how like they just came close and dying so many times.

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.720
 That's just like a fantastic story on its own.

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:32.440
 And all those lessons from that are are very, very good.

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.640
 Again, it's one of the, like in one of my 10 books, I think.

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.520
 Yeah.

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.400
 And the second one about company culture is very good as well.

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.360
 I actually don't think I finished it.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:42.520
 I think I read like a half.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:46.920
 I check out when it's company stuff because it's like, yeah, I think what was

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:50.240
 interesting about the second one is he talks about establishing culture and of

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:54.280
 course he uses some company examples, but then he uses like stuff that you wouldn't

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.920
 think of as a company, but a company just an organization, organizations exist

00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:58.600
 everywhere.

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.680
 So he talks about like how like it's like a mafia sets culture.

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.280
 Oh, interesting.

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:03.880
 Things like that.

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.400
 Yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.400
 Yeah, I remember hard things about hard things.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:10.360
 I can remember exactly like what season of life I listened to that book.

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.480
 I remember the gym I was working out in.

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.760
 I don't remember much about the book, but it's funny.

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.080
 Was that when you found your company?

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.480
 No, it would have been, well, let's see.

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.800
 We were living where we were when we were building this house.

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.360
 It's only been like four or five years ago.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:26.240
 OK, yeah, or three or four years ago.

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.840
 Yeah, not that not that long ago.

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.520
 Nice.

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.600
 We've gone for an hour.

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:30.360
 Did you realize that?

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.640
 We've been going for an hour lately.

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.160
 We have.

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:35.160
 I guess this podcast is an hour long now that I listen to Lex Friedman.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.480
 It's like this is short.

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.360
 Two and a half hours.

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.040
 No big deal.

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.800
 Yeah, this is just some quick, easy listening.

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:40.840
 Yeah.

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:42.120
 Do you have anything else?

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:42.840
 No, it's all for me.

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.400
 So you don't want to ramp it back up real quick.

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:47.600
 All right.

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.120
 See you next.

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:48.480
 All right.

00:55:52.800 --> 00:56:02.800
