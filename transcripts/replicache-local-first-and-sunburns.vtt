00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.680
 There are plenty of applications that should be built as a spot, and you could say for the last 10 years, people defaulted to building spas when they shouldn't have, and now there's backlash for that, like, things that should have been websites were built as spas.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.000
 I'm headed somewhere with this, I think. Hang on.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 [upbeat music]

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.360
 You look tan.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.240
 I am tan.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.920
 Do you like it?

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.720
 I do. Yeah, I mean, this is my summer look.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.400
 I mean, this is every year.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.640
 It's not just because I want to vacation.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.200
 It's like, we go to the pool and we have a community pool.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.240
 We've been there every day since it opened, since we got back.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.320
 Are your kids tan?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.320
 Yeah, they... Oh, you've seen my boys.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.520
 They've got very, like, white hair.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.840
 So they look really tan, but I mean, they do pretty well in the sun.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.680
 My wife, actually, she's, like, looks like she's from Ireland.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.040
 She's, like, red-headed, very fair skin, but she actually handles the sun better than I do.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.360
 Like, I'm the worst burner of the family.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.560
 Yeah, well, I witnessed that.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.200
 Yeah, no, I got really burnt, yeah, when we were in Florida.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:27.000
 I always do, and then I think after one good sunburn every year, I kind of, like, settle into a tan, which is probably terrible for your skin.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.040
 I don't know, I don't wear sunscreen, I'm awful, I'm probably going to die of skin cancer.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.240
 It's going to be really sad when I do.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.760
 How sad, sorry, how sad will it be when I actually die from skin cancer?

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.000
 And we, we play this back in my funeral or something.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.680
 Okay, sorry.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.800
 I wouldn't play this back in your funeral.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.320
 I don't know if I'm going to be in charge of your funeral.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.200
 I know why I said that.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.960
 Am I in charge of your... Sure, why not?

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.000
 I feel like you need to give me specific instructions for...

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.600
 Because you're going to want really good production quality for your funeral, so...

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.560
 Oh, for sure, yeah.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.160
 Do you need to produce it and I'll just make sure it happens?

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.440
 We can rehearse it ahead of time and then after I die.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.960
 Okay, cool, good plan.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.920
 Okay, what were you going to say?

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.800
 You're going into something much less unhinged.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.320
 No, I mean, I was going to say, I also got my first sunburn ever in my whole life.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.960
 Oh, yeah, you said, you said in Florida, you can't get sunburned.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.960
 And then you got sunburned.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.200
 We did, I guess we set out there a lot longer than I realized.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.560
 We were just kind of like, when you're in the water in the ocean, you just assume the sun can't get you.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.560
 I think it's okay. I'm not a scientist.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.960
 It can, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.920
 I mean, you're all, like, I got burned just a little bit on the top of, like, my shoulders.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.520
 Like a strip and a little bit, like, down by my waist.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.400
 And I literally was like, I was at home because I didn't feel it that day.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.920
 The next day, I was like, Liz, I have mosquito bites on my back.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.880
 Like, I'm so itchy.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.240
 Like, what is this?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.040
 Like, I didn't... And I'm like, when I scratch it, they're like, kind of burns.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.840
 Like, what is this?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.240
 Yeah, she was just laughing so hard being like, "Hi, you got sunburned."

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.600
 Oh, I love it.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.600
 I love that you've never been sunburned until that moment.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.960
 Not bad considering I wore zero sunscreen that whole day, and we were out for, like, many, many hours, so...

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.400
 Yeah, I think I even put sunscreen on, but I still, I don't, I hate sunscreen.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.400
 The whole thing just feels like a scam.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.960
 It never actually works for me, but it'll work in random, like, where I was wiping it off on my, like, belly,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.840
 because I just, I had some left on my fingers.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.920
 That spot, I'll have little finger marks where it worked, but none of the stuff on my shoulders,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.720
 like, I don't know if I was just out there too long, and maybe there's just no way to put enough sunscreen on,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.360
 but it's just so, it's so bad.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.240
 I hate the whole experience.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.800
 It never feels like you're getting it all over you.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.680
 It was kids that's sometimes worse, because you're constantly stressed about their skin too,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.160
 and I got three sets of skin you're worried about.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.440
 It's just a, it's a bad deal.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.480
 I'm actually going to a dermatologist, because I think I've got a couple spots on my nose that look scary,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.640
 according to WebMD.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.400
 Like, cancer stuff.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.800
 Serious.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.920
 Didn't have dermatologists out in the Ozarks.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.680
 Oh, my God, Dax, come on.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.960
 We wear shoes too, believe it or not.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.040
 Well, you have one dermatologist is that there?

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.040
 I think there's three in Springfield.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.240
 OK, spring field. OK.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.200
 How many dermatologists do you have?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.920
 Do you have it memorized in Miami?

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.640
 Do you just know?

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.840
 But within walking distance, probably more than one.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.080
 Are you within walking?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.280
 Well, how far can you walk?

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.760
 I mean, I think it's like a 15, 20 minute radius, I would say.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.880
 OK. Yeah, interesting. Come at me.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.160
 You're a number of dermatologists, an interesting flex.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.960
 I've not heard that one.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.640
 You're going to need a dermatologist with all the sun exposure.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.440
 Yeah, I know I know.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.320
 I think I have some things I need to check out to just not go outside.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.000
 Is that the problem?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.440
 Is that why you'd never gotten a sunburn?

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.840
 Like, why did you never got a sunburn?

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.880
 I'm outside all the time, outside all day.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.280
 I think so when I go to the beat, I think I said, see, when I go to the beach,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.000
 because because we go pretty often, we don't spend

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 like six hours of the beach.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.560
 Usually we'll spend like two hours and like go get lunch

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.360
 and kind of get more casual things.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.400
 So I don't think I'm like in direct beach sun for over two hours.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.240
 That might be my limit.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.440
 I think I'm there for like many, many hours.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.520
 No, it's a good, we shouldn't go out in the middle of the day.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.440
 Like, I don't think even with sunscreen, it's a good idea when the sun's the hottest.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.160
 Yeah, it's true.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.120
 Go out in the evening.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.040
 Anyway, let's talk about something other than sunburns.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.080
 Yes.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.600
 So I wanted to talk about something.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.320
 I had a topic and I tweeted it just now teasing it.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.200
 I retweeted that and I didn't even read it.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.600
 I still don't know what it is.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.280
 So it's about rep.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.000
 I want to talk about replicash a little bit.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.680
 Ooh, OK, because it continues to evolve.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.280
 It continues to get really useful.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.680
 And it's and with, you know, I'm working on the C console right now.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.960
 It's using replicash heavily for pretty much everything.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.280
 And it's incredible, the level of like UX impact it's having on the quality of our

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.280
 product and just how good it feels to use a product.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.560
 And I'm just like, why does nobody know about this?

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.720
 Why is nobody using it?

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.720
 Why are we obsessed with all these other things that have such marginal impact

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.840
 on on UX and in performance?

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.160
 So I just want to like show it a little bit.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.520
 Does that make sense?

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.720
 Yeah, OK, so I obviously know all about replicash being your friend.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.400
 I've heard about it all the time, but for the people on the show that listen,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.280
 that they don't know what replicash is.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.880
 Could you just give us like a 30,000 foot view and then let's dive into the specific stuff?

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.400
 Yeah.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.280
 So replicash is a primarily a library on the client that runs on the front end

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.080
 in the browser and it handles data syncing with your back end.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.280
 The thing that makes it unique is it's built around the model of sinking a lot

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.240
 of data to the client locally so that more operations can happen entirely locally.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.040
 And of course, from things like mutations, it handles optimistic updates and all of that.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.640
 And what's beautiful about it is it enables these crazy real time.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:57.040
 So one enables crazy real time applications to so much of your data is local.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.040
 That a lot of stuff that you normally have to go to the server for for a round trip.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.920
 You can just do locally.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.960
 So things like fuzzy search, like, you know, command K bar, like jumping to things like that.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.320
 And so it makes everything really, really fast.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.520
 But what's great about it is if you look at a bunch of other solutions that are similar,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.240
 and there's different solutions like this for a long time, they're all way more complicated.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.880
 And replicash is really, really simple and it has a very different architecture

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.440
 to everything else that exists that kind of allows it to be a lot simpler

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.480
 and it actually makes it possible to use this stuff in practice.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.800
 OK, so it's like the offline first kind of stuff.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.120
 Like, is that a different concept?

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.360
 Yeah, I think it is a little bit different.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.480
 Because so replicash can be used to support offline applications.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.680
 But it's not like they just haven't matured that part of it as much.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.640
 Actually, the laser lease, they've made it a lot better.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.520
 But the offline stuff is it kind of has a pathway to that, but it's not really the focus.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.360
 Because I think what they thought about was so far, we've treated this category

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.960
 of application as very specific, like, OK, you want application that runs fully offline

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.440
 or you want application where there's no state and there's just a bunch of people

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.080
 connected to each other that are like seeking state within each other.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.840
 And there are a bunch of solutions in that in that category, but that's like not most apps.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.440
 So I doubt most of you have built apps that need to be offline first

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.360
 or like are completely peer to peer, right?

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.080
 Yeah, right.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.640
 But I think those ideas get conflated when we think about real time or like local first.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.360
 So I think replicash is in the category of local first.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.960
 And I think this is becoming a category that's popping up a lot more.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.400
 I actually saw like there's a whole like local first meetup that even exists now.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.440
 Oh, wow.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.440
 Where you basically try to build applications that can run locally first

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.800
 for as many features as possible.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.800
 Of course, some things you might still need to go to the server for, but there's a lot

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.440
 that can be built in this way.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.280
 So replicash really focuses on this local first mentality.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.240
 And so many applications, I think, fall under the category of working really well.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.520
 The application that I always talk about linear as being like the best example

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.760
 of an incredible web app pushing the bar on what's possible on web today.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.880
 Linear is a local first app.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.840
 And that's why it's so fast and so amazing to use.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.880
 Plus, of course, all the details to you actually paid attention to.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.440
 And if you go to the replicash homepage, is this a funny experience for me?

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.160
 Because for a while, I was like, OK, how do I recreate linear?

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.680
 How do I have a stack that can let me build something as good as linear?

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.560
 I was like researching this for a while.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:33.600
 I landed on the replicash homepage and their demo app is a recreation of linear.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.880
 So replicash basically took a linear and was like, yeah, how do we make it

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.560
 so more people can build stuff like this?

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.000
 And they built a general tool for that.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.400
 So how does it fit in?

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.640
 Like, I feel like the whole landscape is shifting toward the server.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.240
 Yeah.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.840
 What UX wins do you get if you go the replicash route?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.760
 As opposed to like SSR and doing stuff on the server.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.280
 Yeah.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.880
 So SSR is built.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.680
 And I'm going to keep saying this to keep saying my whole life.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.040
 I think so.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.560
 And I'm never going to stop saying it because no one's just keeps

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.400
 continuing to think SSR is built for applications, not applications.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.080
 It's built for websites where people go and leave right away.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.400
 That's kind of how I think about it.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.520
 Like, yeah, yeah, you don't expect them to explore every single page of your app.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.760
 They might come in and look at a single page and then leave some short sessions.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.240
 Yeah.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.920
 So it's not worth sinking a bunch of stuff down to the client.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.920
 They're not going to really be around for that long.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.600
 So for anything in that category, e-commerce sites, websites, just kind

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.440
 of one off things, yes, don't listen to anything I'm saying because it's not relevant.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.040
 But for productivity applications, for things people have up all day to do their

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.920
 work, you do want to sink a lot of stuff down to the client because they're going

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.760
 to be around for the while.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.960
 It's worth that initial cost.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.280
 Yeah.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.760
 And plus, initial cost is literally the first time they load the app.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.800
 From there, it's like kind of incremental sync.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.280
 So whatever changes on the server, the next time you show up needs to be synced.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.000
 It's worth sinking all of that because then a bunch of operations can happen locally.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.240
 Right.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.520
 So in the SST console, we sync all of your resources and like all the

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.360
 metadata for the resources to the front end.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.240
 That way, when you open up the command K bar and you type in, let's say you're

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.280
 looking for a function that's mounted at a certain URL route.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.800
 So you can go look at the logs, you can type in just the URL of the function.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.080
 And that search happens locally.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:28.000
 And literally with every keystroke, instantly with like no perception of legacy,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.560
 the command bar is updating with the results of your search.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.080
 And the SST console, that's like a small set, because you're not going to have

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:35.760
 a ton of resources.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.040
 You're plugging up like even the biggest cases, like sub 500 resources, sub 1000

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.040
 resources, maybe, but for for Boomi, which is the other project that we're

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:49.640
 coming up with, Liz, we've done like searching on 50,000 records and still been

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.040
 instant.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:50.560
 Wow.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.120
 Yeah.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.800
 How much data?

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.560
 Like, what is that like down in that?

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.440
 I mean, like you said, it's worth it because people are shaking around.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.880
 But is it like megs of data?

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.000
 Yeah, it is.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.880
 So on the first time a user gets added, so in the Boomi case, if you invite a new

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.640
 user because they're a new employee, they join the first time they load the app,

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.160
 it's going to be several seconds of waiting because we need to query all that

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.120
 and queue it up and bundle it in the right way.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.760
 Uh, and I get streamed down, but after that, it's all incremental updates.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.960
 So it's only as much data syncing as your business is changing.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.320
 Um, and that's all happening in real time and reflecting right in front of you.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.960
 Um, so yeah, it's really not a lot.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.840
 It's a couple of seconds waiting up front for like instant.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.800
 Every page you navigate to knows we have, we have zero spinners in Boomi at all.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.520
 Is we haven't had to build a spinner cloud at all for anything.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.760
 Cause everything you load is instant.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.480
 Uh, well, you can kind of compare it to is in the RSC model or like in like the

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.600
 traditional model, you might have like a cash is progressively built up.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.440
 So like you might go to one page, it might load.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.080
 You might go to the next page and uploads.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.040
 And if you go back and forward again, it's instant and you cause you, cause like

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:02.960
 stuff has been built up.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.200
 Yeah.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.680
 It's like that, but without having to like explore, it's like that from the

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.200
 beginning.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.200
 So it's like everything is fully warmed all the time.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.080
 So, uh, it's an incredible technology and it's just not very used.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.680
 Like I don't see a lot of people bringing it up.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.520
 I will say it is a little bit challenging to learn.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:19.720
 Yeah.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.280
 So that was my next question is like the author time experience.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.960
 Like what does the, your code look like with all this stuff?

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.400
 Yeah.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.560
 So I actually think the initial setup is a hard thing to learn.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.640
 Um, so right now they have a service that solution called reflect as well.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.080
 So you don't have to do any of that.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.760
 You can kind of just plug it into effectively a back ends of service thing.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.760
 I don't use that because I want to have like a normal application and replica.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.160
 It's just like a thing that I'm adding on top of a very normal application.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.680
 That's built on top of SST and plan scale, et cetera.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.840
 Um, so there's an initial cost of understanding the sync protocol and there are

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.640
 certain things you didn't make sure you're doing correctly to like implement

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.480
 the sync correctly.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.360
 Uh, there's a lot of when you come to distribute systems, real-time sync,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.120
 there's a lot of like edge cases where, uh, you know, data doesn't make it to one

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.320
 place and not something else.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.200
 Things that made it and then you have a desync.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.800
 They lay out very clear steps on how to do this.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.680
 It might be a little challenging if you're not familiar with the

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.720
 previous system stuff.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.600
 Um, but it's really not super hard.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.720
 Like within a couple of days, you can probably have implemented.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.080
 But once you have it implemented, it's so easy.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.880
 Like from there, you just have these mutations.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.760
 You can send up, you apply them optimistically on the front end and you

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.760
 apply them for real on the back end.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.520
 Uh, and then any issues that come up, like there was an error,

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.320
 things have to be rolled back.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.080
 It's all automatically handled by Replicash.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.280
 So I think there's some initial setup learning curve, um, but you

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.600
 know, ST consoles open source.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.720
 So you can just take whatever we have there if you want to use it.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.920
 Um, and then from there, like the, the other time experience is fantastic.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.200
 I even added like an end-to-end type safety layer on there.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.880
 So it feels a lot like TRPC.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.680
 So yeah, it's been, it's been, it's been amazing.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.280
 And I think more people should look into it.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.840
 Yeah, it seems like if you're building an app, like you're building a spa

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.920
 or like some long lived thing, you should always be doing it.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.320
 It's like leaning into that to get the best out of that, right?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.720
 Is there any reason you're building an app?

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.760
 You shouldn't use this local first approach.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.000
 Are there downsides?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.320
 Yeah.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:15.440
 So I think it comes down to understanding the working set of data that a user needs.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.000
 Uh, if this working set is massive, like it's in, let's say it's over

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.160
 100 megabytes, it probably doesn't make sense to use replica cash because

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.760
 thinking all that to the client is maybe too much.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.720
 Uh, but I think very few applications fit into this, like even something

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.760
 like linear, you can imagine that, oh yeah, as a company, you know, makes

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.240
 issues and like over time, they might have like millions of issues.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.760
 But the way linear treats it is no, the working set of data is just any issue

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.840
 that's open or well, they keep closed issues around for like a week.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.280
 So your working set of issues is never going to be like infinitely

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:50.720
 growing.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.800
 Yeah.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.280
 Yeah.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:57.080
 So anything where you can fit the working set into a reasonable size,

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.960
 you should do this because there's no downside at all.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.000
 Um, for stuff that's more like analytical or like you're like looking

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.800
 across big data sets and even in Boomi, uh, we have like the day-to-day

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.440
 work flows, which are like a small working set of data.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.320
 Then you have like admin workflows.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.040
 We're looking at like reports analytics.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.400
 Uh, that is currently powered by Replicash, but it's starting to get

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.640
 to a size where it doesn't make sense.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.640
 So that part of our app might still be a traditional server side thing,

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.360
 but it's okay because people aren't touching that every single day.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.840
 That's something they look at every once in a while.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.480
 The part of your app where people are using every single day, every

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.960
 single hour, that tends to be a small working set.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.160
 So most things can, can fit into this model.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.640
 Yeah.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.080
 Okay.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.240
 So I have a related thought to all this.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.560
 And like as you're discussing all this stuff, it, I realized that like these

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.320
 topics have kind of fallen out of favor, or they're just not talked about as

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.640
 much because of all the RSC stuff and like Astro and like every, it's

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.720
 like the trend is moving server side.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:01.160
 And I feel like talking about how to make a spa better feels it for

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:06.080
 some reason, so off topic, which is dumb because there are plenty of

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.960
 applications that should be built as a spa.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.800
 And you could say for the last 10 years, people defaulted to building

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.280
 spas when they shouldn't have, and now there's backlash for that, like

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.120
 things that should have been websites were built as spas.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.520
 I'm headed somewhere with this, I think.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:19.920
 Hang on.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.320
 So that was the default.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.880
 We have all these new covers coming into the field building spas with react

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.080
 that should have been a website, like it just shouldn't be client-side rendered.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:34.360
 And now we're shifting to this default world where everything is like

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.520
 multiple pages, not a spa.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.680
 Okay.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.200
 And now you're going to have people building what should be a spa with those

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:48.160
 technologies, so people should be using react and replicash or whatever,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.600
 solidjs, whatever, to build their spa.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.600
 And instead they're going to use RSCs and we're going to have the exact opposite

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.920
 problem we've had the last decade.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.880
 Did I land that?

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.000
 You know, that's exactly right.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.560
 I think there is just, there is just no global default, but people always

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.000
 operate as there is, as there is.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.120
 And I think what's sad about this one, I don't think people are going to

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:16.680
 realize, like at least with the one you incorrectly use a spa, it was so obvious

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.920
 that it was a bad choice because like we've all used apps.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.480
 Like it's always be something like you're like trying to book a flight and

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.520
 there's like a million spinners and like it's just like, why is this like this?

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.280
 It's very obvious that it sucks.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.200
 But I think in the reverse case, it's kind of like it actually feels okay

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.720
 because you're used to it.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.480
 So I don't think anyone is going to think, oh, this is like a bad use of RSCs or SSR

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.440
 because it's still going to feel terrible.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.520
 It's going to be obviously terrible.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.160
 They're just going to be a class of application that continues to be like

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.960
 magical and mysterious because people are like, Oh, like, how do they do that stuff?

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.600
 And yeah, yeah.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.120
 And they're using the local stuff.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.560
 Yeah, they're so few.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.640
 Like I think of all applications I use, I think I always list them.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.880
 It's air table, linear and superhuman are the three that I use that are like

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.600
 so clearly a million times better than any other app I use, but nobody's

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.160
 copying them for some reason.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:07.560
 Yeah.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.920
 So why, why is this?

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.560
 Why has this been slow to adopt?

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.360
 What's replication's marketing problem?

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.400
 I have a funny theory that is going to be.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.760
 See if I can get this out.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.080
 You better do better than I did.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.360
 Sorry.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.280
 You guys said before, and you might have heard me say this before, but

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.400
 if you are someone that builds an e-commerce website

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.240
 and you're like a pro at building e-commerce website, you're like one of the best people

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.360
 in the world that does this.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.640
 How much can you possibly make doing that?

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.680
 Not a ton.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.200
 There's definitely a ceiling there of how much money you can make.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.720
 Just doing literally that job, right?

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.360
 Yeah, but you can make a ton of money by founding Vercel and making it.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.880
 So a bunch of other people can, you know, can kind of have your skills

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.920
 without having to put in as much work.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.440
 Yeah.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.840
 So like a Vercel for like the SSR world exists.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.600
 Like there's a company focused on educating people and making people

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.280
 aware of this stuff and having people build in this way.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.520
 The flip side, if you're someone that's an expert at billions of local

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.000
 first SPA's, you're just going to build linear and be a billionaire.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.680
 You're not going to go like go and spend your time like doing this other thing, right?

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.480
 So the fact that Replicash even exists is a miracle.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.720
 So Aaron Goodman is like is a founder of it.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.520
 And he made Grease Monkey.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.120
 I don't know if he used Grease Monkey back in the day.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.800
 What is it?

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.480
 It was like before Chrome extension really existed, you can like inject JavaScript

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.480
 and override stuff.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.120
 Oh, that does sound familiar.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:35.360
 Yeah.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.360
 I don't know if I really used it, but I know you're talking about now.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.560
 And he eventually ended up working for Chrome and like building the Chrome

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.360
 extension stuff.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.240
 And now he's working on this completely unrelated thing.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.000
 So it's like a miracle that someone is focused on his problem.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.320
 Yeah, because everyone else is an expert on this has already like built a massive

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.800
 business that they're just like, they're not even on Twitter.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.520
 Like they're not even like talking at all because they're just like, we're so

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.720
 successful and rich, we don't have to do we don't have to do anything.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.600
 And you think the key to that is that they built these really amazing web apps.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.000
 Like that was their business's success.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.440
 Yeah, like linear entered a market that is the most like fragmented

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.280
 saturated market in the world.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.800
 Like every engineer is like, I have an idea for our product management app.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.760
 Like that's like the default thing, right?

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.040
 Yeah.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:18.560
 Yeah.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.040
 They entered there and just killed it just through the quality of the thing they

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.840
 built, like compared like the status quo was Jira pretty much Jira's like the

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.960
 slowest thing in the world.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.960
 Yeah.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.560
 Same thing with superhuman like what you like aren't even an email provider.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.000
 You're just like a layer on top of Gmail.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.400
 But all you do is make stuff faster.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.800
 Like also also people are paying.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.800
 I'm paying like 20 bucks a month for it, which is like crazy.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.240
 So this is super powerful.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.360
 I mean, this is like this idea that you could just come in and disrupt an

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.600
 industry by just having a really good product.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.680
 Well, yeah, why don't more people do that?

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.040
 Why are there so many bad products?

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.400
 I don't understand the hold up.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.440
 Is it that hard to learn?

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.080
 You said there's some initial investment.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.680
 No, it's just, I just think it's not well.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.080
 And it says, what I want to talk about is I want to get people curious.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.760
 I think more people need to be curious about this.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.680
 Uh, we are so used to stuff that is slow that we don't even think twice.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.480
 And once you start using these like magical products, you start to wonder

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.640
 why isn't everything like this?

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.440
 Like I go to GitHub.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:11.800
 Yeah.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.800
 Because GitHub so much, I work on open source stuff.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.520
 I'm always in there looking at issues, looking at PRs.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:20.000
 Every time I click on something, there's a delay and a spinner and

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.880
 surprise to them in it all day.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.200
 Like I get hub, okay.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.640
 Maybe you don't sink every repo in the world to my machine locally, but

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.520
 sink the repos I'm working on actively locally.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.640
 Sink all the issues and call it pull requests.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.120
 Um, I should be able to switch between them really quickly.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.720
 And they're starting to do this a little bit, like their new, uh, like

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.800
 directory explorers, like a little bit more in this direction.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.280
 Like I'm seeing that be a lot faster.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:47.240
 But yeah, like anything that is a B2B tool, a productivity tool, anything

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.320
 with a working set is small.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.160
 Like this should really be the default.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.080
 Yeah, it should not be SSR, RSC, any of that stuff.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.560
 It should really be do a ton on the client.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.320
 And it's why people love native apps, right?

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.840
 A lot of native apps do a lot on the client.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.360
 Right.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.000
 So can we do like, can we speak about this?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.040
 And like, like how people would be like Uber, but for groceries, can we be like

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.240
 linear, but for GitHub?

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.000
 I've seen people do this already, actually.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.320
 Oh, like communicated it that way.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.560
 Like, I think this, this, there's something, I think actually is from someone

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.360
 that used to work with linear.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.520
 So it makes sense.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.560
 I forgot what I forgot what it was.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.480
 I think it's going to note taking tool something.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:24.640
 Yeah.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.480
 I mean, just like, could someone build GitHub, but build a better web app and

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.800
 actually make a dent.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.200
 Like a different interface to GitHub.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.960
 That actually, uh, okay.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.520
 So here's the thing.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.640
 Replication needs like very strong control of the server.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.000
 So you can't do it externally, unfortunately.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.920
 But wait, what?

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.520
 I didn't even understand this sentence.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.400
 Do what externally?

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.200
 Well, I meant, like, I couldn't build a better front end for GitHub without

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.480
 coordination from GitHub.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.800
 Oh, no, I didn't build a new GitHub.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.600
 Like, could somebody actually disrupt?

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.320
 I think they're like too big to disrupt.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:54.560
 Okay.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.000
 So there's limits.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.240
 There's other things in that way.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.560
 I'm learning the rules here, but it's like, there's just stuff that we use every day

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.360
 and we don't think about.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.200
 Um, like sometimes some, so I, so I have for some of these developer tools, like, uh,

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.680
 uh, somebody's SaaS products, there's the work instead of data is so small.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.280
 They have a concept of a project and it might have like some configuration.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.040
 Like why are there any loaders all?

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.560
 Um, even something like, take something like Cal.com, right?

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.320
 Depart where you're managing your own settings, your own configuration.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.720
 The working set is low, just your own configuration.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.720
 I bet that's like less.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.120
 That's probably a tiny amount of data that should always be synced, synced locally.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.160
 So yeah, it's a great thing to explore.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.720
 Like I almost think of it.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.720
 Like if I am building something that is not public facing, it's like, you need to sign up

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.040
 for is behind a login wall.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.440
 My default is going to be this until my working set out grows.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.440
 Then I'll like, you know, refactor that out to be server powered.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.960
 Um, so do you have any open source repos that you've built, like, or any of your apps

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.800
 that you've built with this open source where I can look at it and seal your.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.040
 Yeah.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.920
 So the new ST console, which is just at our GitHub slash console, uh, is built with

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.480
 replicash, yeah, like I said, it's, I built a little bit of a layer on top to get

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.920
 like some of the type safety stuff I like.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.480
 Uh, I'd love to like have some nicer patterns emerge out of this.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.040
 And once they do, uh, I might like package that up into its own library.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.160
 Okay.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.760
 I'm just going to look now.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.800
 I'm, I'm sold, like, I'm, I'm sold.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.400
 I'm going to build apps this way right after I get done building a layer of L.A.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.480
 I'll build one like this.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.800
 Well, you know, I mean, I wasn't joking.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.600
 You know, I know you're not joking.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:36.680
 The level I take you seriously, though, it's not that I'm joking.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.000
 It's that I just, uh, I'm flaky.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.680
 I believe you think you're serious.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.000
 Yes.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.520
 Oh, okay.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.240
 We should end this episode.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.480
 This has been good.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.000
 Cool.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:49.800
 So yeah.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.120
 All right.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:50.360
 See you.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:15.740
