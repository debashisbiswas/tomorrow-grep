00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 - My main point is that you should just shut up

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.240
 about Tailwind.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.280
 Read the word.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.080
 If you talk about Tailwind, I'm gonna come after you.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.440
 - I'm not sure how we got there, but okay, fair enough.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.020
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.720
 - Speaking of, have you eaten?

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.080
 - Yeah, today I was like, I'm gonna drink water.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.920
 - Ooh.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.120
 - I'm gonna eat, I'm gonna have my energy levels up.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.600
 I'm like finishing off this lard bar.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.800
 - Oh, nice lard bar, haven't had one in so long.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.880
 Did you know I haven't eaten lard bars in a while?

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.480
 - Did you like realize you got a problem

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.400
 and you wanted to go take time off?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.240
 - I wish it was that profound.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.840
 It was just, I didn't order them again.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.080
 And then I realized I really don't fit

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.640
 into my eating schedule.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.800
 I eaten a very limited one.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.440
 I'm doing the intermittent stuff.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.680
 And we just eat two meals, like a breakfast on it.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.080
 We're not going the full one meal a day thing.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.080
 But, yeah, I don't snack.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 So there's not really an opportunity to eat a lard bar.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.280
 Man, I love lard bars.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.720
 Man, I miss lard bars now.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.880
 Just talking about it.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 (laughing)

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.800
 - I've also been on a lard bar break

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.960
 because they were like my streaming thing.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.240
 So I would like eat them while I streamed.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.240
 And I stopped streaming as much.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.680
 And I also ran out.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.800
 Do you remember I ordered way too many?

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.520
 I had like a basket when I got hungry with them.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.160
 - That's awesome.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.040
 - And I finally finished them.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.320
 And I didn't buy them for a couple of weeks.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.760
 And then Liz saw them in the grocery store.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.320
 So she grabbed them and now I'm back on the train.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.160
 - They're so good.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.240
 - Back on the lard train.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.400
 - I'm eating, I haven't eaten, I'm eating now.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.080
 So throughout the podcast,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.760
 my energy levels should rise.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.920
 They're on the upswing.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.720
 - No, is that your beats pre-workout?

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.800
 - No, there's no beats in this.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 It's just breakfast.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.440
 It's a lot of stuff in it, but it's not beat.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.680
 I'm not working on it today.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.040
 I have a massage today.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.880
 I'm excited for that.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.040
 - Are they coming to your house?

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.320
 - No, that'd be cool.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.480
 Do they do that?

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.320
 Are they a masseuse?

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.160
 - I feel like you're the type where

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.560
 they would come to your house.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.400
 That's why I asked.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.640
 (laughing)

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.480
 But that's a thing.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.320
 I remember in, I mean, maybe in cities,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.920
 but I remember in New York,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.680
 some companies would offer that as a perk

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.720
 where they would come to your office

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.000
 and massage you.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.680
 I don't like massages.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.600
 I get really tense when someone is trying to massage me,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.440
 which is the opposite of what a massage is supposed to do.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.120
 And I found this the thought of laying naked

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.600
 on a table and not fully naked,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.640
 but let me make it where you worked in your office.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.840
 Something about that just fell off.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.640
 - Yeah, that seems kind of different.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.640
 Yeah, I don't know, like I've never had an actual massage.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.140
 I know some people say they can be really painful.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.080
 Like, yeah, the deep ones.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.800
 But Casey, my wife goes to this masseuse

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.160
 and says that she'll give you like varying degrees

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.800
 of pain depending on what you want.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.760
 Yeah. (laughing)

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.080
 It's like an opt-in.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.400
 My neck is doing that thing again.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.080
 I've got like a thing in my back

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.080
 where I can hardly like move to the left.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.600
 So I badly need this massage.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.080
 Couldn't even train this morning.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.560
 Couldn't even BJJ.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.520
 Sucks.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.960
 - A large percentage of our podcast

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.120
 has turned into us talking about our bodies wearing down.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.280
 - Yeah, we should really stop.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.600
 (laughing)

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.440
 - So he's talking about it.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.200
 - I think we'll be coming at those people.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.320
 We're like, ah, my back is acting up, you know?

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.400
 - This is episode 50.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.200
 So by episode 100, would just be dead?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.040
 What's up?

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.880
 - Would be dead.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.120
 (laughing)

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.800
 The last hundred years to live,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.320
 those like bin folks on. (laughing)

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.160
 - Yeah.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.680
 I, so I, I, back when I was having all those shoulder issues,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.560
 I was saying the same topic.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.400
 (laughing)

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.680
 I was talking about shoulder issues.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.120
 I went to a physical therapist

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.480
 and she would end every, like I was on crazy good insurance.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.920
 This was when I was selling her my parents insurance

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.080
 and my dad was working for some, some crazy hedge fund.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.840
 And I liked insane insurance.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.080
 And like the physical therapy I got from completely for free

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.320
 was like 40 minutes of physical therapy.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.440
 And then like a 30 minute, like legit massage.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.280
 - Wow.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.360
 - After each one.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.920
 But it was the most painful thing.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.960
 It did, it did make me feel better,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.320
 but it was very, very painful.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.840
 She was just like, go hard and it's a pressure points I had.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.360
 - Do you feel good afterwards?

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.560
 Like, is it worth it?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.040
 - Yeah, it, it, it did make me feel better

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.240
 but then the larger point.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.480
 So I was like, okay, this is cool.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.960
 It's free and it makes me feel better.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.200
 But the large, if you zoom out a little bit,

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.640
 I fixed my shoulder problem just by hanging.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.920
 And I think I've talked about it before I was hanging.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.240
 I eventually discovered the concept

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.600
 of just hanging from a bar.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.440
 - Yeah.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.280
 - And those like permanently fixed my shoulder issues.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.760
 - Same with wrist issues, right?

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.520
 - It was all kind of pointless in the end.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.480
 There's a help through wrist issues too, obviously.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.840
 - Yeah, I think primes talked about it helps with your wrists.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.680
 - Okay.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.280
 - I've had wrist issues like I've had carpal tunnel

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.960
 in the past and I've had issues where like,

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.160
 maybe it is the carpal tunnel where you wake up in the night

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
 and like three your fingers are numb on one hand.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.000
 - Oh really?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.120
 - Yeah, I'm using like a little wrist thing now,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.040
 like a wrist bar in front of my keyboard

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.040
 so that it's a little more.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.880
 - You like rest?

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.720
 - Yeah.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.400
 - I'm shocked that I don't have carpal tunnel

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.280
 'cause I've been, I've been like using my keyboard a lot

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.880
 like a lot more than the average person.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.880
 - For 10 years.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.880
 - Probably the same, yeah, for a long time

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.320
 and somehow my wrists, wrists are fine.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.840
 I don't even use an ergonomic keyboard.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.680
 - I just use a--

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.280
 - Yeah, I don't, I don't like mechanical.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.440
 - Yeah, I don't, well non-mechanical, that's wrong

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.160
 but I don't like the ergonomic ones.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.120
 - Anytime I say 10 years to you, by the way, I'm joking.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.960
 That's a joke.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.680
 - I know, I know, I know, I know.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.560
 (laughing)

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.160
 - Actually, that time I was like, is he making a joke

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.640
 or is he like being serious?

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640
 That could have gone another way.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.440
 - What are you gonna do next year when it's 11 years?

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.280
 What are you gonna do?

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.120
 - I'm gonna round down to 10.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.360
 - Oh, so you ran in on 10 'til it's 15?

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.920
 - I've been saying 10 for like three years now.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.120
 So I think I'm marching on 11, I don't really know.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.080
 - Wait, wait, when did you start,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.240
 like when did you start professionally as a developer?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.040
 'Cause I feel like we've talked about this I forgot.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.040
 - 2012, I think, is probably when I was really getting paid.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.680
 - So I've got three years on you, I started in 2009.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.680
 - Wow, right after the crisis.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.380
 - Yeah, that affected, no, I have no idea.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.240
 (laughing)

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.880
 So I've been doing this three years longer

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.360
 and I'm like 50 times worse.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.480
 I wasn't gonna say 100, but I don't know.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.640
 - Well, you haven't really been doing it,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.200
 you've been doing it three years longer professionally,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.200
 but.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.200
 - Oh, you grew up in it.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.200
 - You, yeah, I think I was, I'm like doing it long overall.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.040
 - Okay, okay.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.040
 - Also, your house is bigger than mine, so that's all right.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.040
 - There you go, that's all right.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.040
 Also, I live in a place that's much cheaper.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.880
 (laughing)

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.120
 - Did you get partner on Twitch?

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.000
 - I did a while ago and I didn't even notice

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.160
 and I laid it on stream since I got it.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.960
 Is that the curse you just get partnering,

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.800
 you're never streaming in?

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.360
 - No, I mean, oh, I get it.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.200
 (laughing)

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.400
 - I don't think of myself as never streaming again,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.800
 I'm going to stream again.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.160
 I'm just not streaming right now, that's all.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.560
 - Back when you were getting it or close to getting it,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.080
 you were telling me like, oh, you know,

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.840
 like what's gonna be the next goal?

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.080
 Like I'm like kind of directionless after this

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.240
 or is that something to that degree?

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.240
 And I was like, what is he talking about?

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.080
 Like who cares?

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.320
 Like it's just a random thing.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.840
 But then now I'm like, I know exactly what you're talking about.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.200
 I like got partnered, I'm like, oh, so much of my motivation

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.320
 to stream came from there being this goal.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.240
 Like I didn't even realize that that was what was driving me.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.360
 - Yeah, at the beginning, I didn't even know what it was.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.600
 I didn't know it existed.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.320
 I was motivated just to do it for the fun of it

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.160
 for the first few weeks.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.920
 And then once you learn what it is, it's like,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.160
 oh, there's a carrot, I want the carrot.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.520
 And then yeah, you get the carrot.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.560
 I think what I'm gonna do, because there's reasons

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.640
 I just can't stream like work stuff right now.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.360
 I think I'm gonna start streaming just like playing

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.480
 first band, have I said this?

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.920
 I think I've said this publicly.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.080
 I'm gonna play-- - You mentioned it, yeah.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.880
 - It's like an old Super Nintendo game.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.400
 I'm gonna play it on stream just to be able to hang out

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.720
 with all my friends that are here right now

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.860
 in your Twitch chat.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.600
 Yeah, I'm gonna play it.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.440
 - These aren't our friends.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.360
 I tweeted something like tailwind is annoying.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.480
 And that's why all these people are here in the stream.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.840
 - Oh, these are just people who agree

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.760
 that tailwind is annoying or disagree.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.320
 - Or are here to yell at me, yeah.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.000
 - Does anyone have a neutral opinion on tailwind?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.200
 You claim to, but you just made your title tailwind is annoying

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.560
 or I hate tailwind, so.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.480
 - Well, but do you want me to expand on why?

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.960
 I said that.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.600
 I have a neutral opinion on tailwind

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.640
 because I think it makes sense.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.440
 And like I said, I've used that pattern for a while,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.520
 but I feel like, so at first it was tailwind kind of came out

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.640
 and I think it was a kind of like the underdog

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.680
 in a lot of ways and it was definitely not the incumbent.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.360
 There's a lot of people just hating on it.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.640
 And those are people that were annoying,

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.200
 just people randomly hating on this new thing

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.600
 they haven't tried. - Yeah.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.000
 - But now it's just swung to being pretty consensus.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.760
 Like it's kind of the mainstream opinion.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.600
 And I now am finding pro-tailwind people super annoying,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.640
 like they're just constantly being like,

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.800
 this is so awesome.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.800
 Like, and I don't understand why this draws

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.840
 so much passion from people

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.440
 because I cannot think of a more boring part

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.480
 of my application, like if I'm gonna be passionate

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.920
 about something, it's not gonna be

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.000
 how I style my front ends, you know?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.920
 - Yeah, but you like the CSS and JS.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.560
 I feel like I don't like that.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.960
 I don't remember why I don't like that.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.400
 - Yeah, people don't like it.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.880
 But I think it's because, so I think there's two dimensions.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.000
 There's what the API for it looks like

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.840
 and there's what, how it's implemented.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.680
 - The runtime.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.320
 - Yeah, I think I used it when it was like style components

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.120
 and motion and all these things that were super slow.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.560
 - Yeah, so style components and emotion were,

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.280
 I think emotion were both string based.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.160
 So you were kind of like writing CSS strings

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.880
 in like these template string things.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.720
 - Yeah.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.840
 - I don't think that's a good API.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.000
 I think that there's a good reason why people

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.680
 just didn't like that.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.720
 Then Stitches came out, which was very typescript oriented.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.520
 So that was like, really thought about

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.520
 how do you build components, like prop mapping,

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.320
 all of the classic things that you do with components.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.000
 - That's the same people that make radix, right?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.380
 - Radix, yeah, and then a lot of radix, radix, radix,

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.200
 radix, et cetera.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.280
 - It's radix, actually.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.160
 I'm just kidding, I don't know.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.840
 I don't think you should say that out loud.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.680
 - Why?

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.960
 What was that a bad word?

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.800
 Wait.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.620
 Just move on.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.320
 - No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.280
 Is it a bad word?

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.920
 Is it a word that's like a bad word?

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.120
 - It's not a bad word, no, no, no, no.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.720
 It just sounds interesting when you say it.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.960
 - It sounds interesting.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.200
 You can't just leave me like that.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.640
 There's something about the way I said,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.920
 it sounded like another word, or that.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.720
 - Why don't you say it one more time?

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.600
 - I don't think I want to,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.400
 because you're being very critical of it.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.120
 - Well, chat's helping you out there.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.480
 - Oh, got it.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.160
 (both laughing)

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.800
 - Okay, I'll not say that again, my bad.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.000
 One time I said something on stream,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.880
 and it was apparently, it was like a racial slur.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.720
 I didn't even remember that.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.920
 - I'd never heard the word in my life.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.920
 I'd never heard it.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.360
 And I wasn't, I don't remember why I said it, but anyway,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.200
 go ahead.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.120
 - Yeah, okay.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.520
 Nobody believes you.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.680
 - Yeah, so they made, so yeah, they make,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.560
 I can't remember how to say it anymore.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.720
 Radix, radix.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.560
 - I've never known how to say it.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.400
 I don't know.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.240
 - I just say all the different ways.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.080
 - Yeah.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.600
 - There's one of those terms that I've never had to say

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.440
 out loud, I've thought it a million times,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.560
 I've never said out loud.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.880
 I'm just gonna go to radix.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.280
 - Radix is so good by the way.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.120
 - Sorry, stitches.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.960
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.320
 And a lot of their examples were like using

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.400
 stitches underneath.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.000
 So I think stitches nailed the API.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.400
 Like more or less, like 95% of there it was right API.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.800
 Variance, compound variance.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.400
 Like all the classic things you knew with components.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.920
 But the runtime implementation was not good.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.800
 And in fact, as of the latest React version,

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.040
 it like doesn't even work.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.680
 And it was effectively a rewrite to get it to work

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.520
 when they chose not to--

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.360
 - Isn't it abandoned?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.200
 - Continue to invest in it.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.240
 - Yeah, so I was using it around the time when I saw

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.560
 that that obstruction was going,

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.080
 which is why we worked on Macron,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.480
 which is like the API from stitches, which I like,

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.000
 but no runtime.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.820
 Everything happens at compile time.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.320
 It extracts out static CSS.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.720
 It's built on top of an old extract,

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.360
 which is made by, it's just like--

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.320
 - It's made by that guy that makes the memes.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.440
 - You used to make the memes.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.280
 Mark.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.120
 - Yeah, Mark.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.400
 - Yeah, and I think he like co-invented CSS modules.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.560
 So he's like, he's like very pro.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.840
 He's like, obviously very good CSS,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.240
 but he also invented this other thing

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.240
 of doing it in TypeScript.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.400
 So I think that like, there's some credibility there

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.360
 in that it's not just doing it for the hell.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.360
 - Yeah.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.480
 I don't know what CSS modules are, by the way.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.400
 I hear that all the time and I don't know what it is.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.960
 - It's just like importing CSS from a CSS file.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.280
 - I mean, like, why do I need,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.960
 why do I need modules of CSS

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.040
 when I could just have like components

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.760
 and then they have styles on them?

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.080
 - Where do the styles go?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.440
 - On the components.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.960
 - But that's using tailwind, right?

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.600
 - Sorry, I was trying not to say tailwind

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.920
 'cause I didn't want to trigger you.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.400
 (laughing)

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.560
 - No, I'm saying like outside of tailwind,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.600
 like, you know, if you're just using normal CSS,

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.400
 you can organize them into modules

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.680
 and import them as needed.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.520
 - I see.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.760
 - Anyway, tailwind is fine.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.600
 Use it.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.200
 Just shut up about it, you know?

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.960
 - I never thought, I don't talk about it.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.840
 I don't think, do it, ah, I probably don't.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.680
 - I'm not talking to you.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.520
 - Okay.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.600
 - I'm talking to the general world

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.320
 that just will not shut up about this thing.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.280
 - Was there a recent thing like,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.640
 why did you say I hate tailwind today?

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.680
 Was there a recent, is tailwind back in the news?

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.600
 It's about every other week, isn't it?

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.440
 What happened?

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.040
 - Exactly, and I think it went from like, okay,

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.000
 it's constantly, we're talking about it.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.120
 Then it became this meta thing where we're like,

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.040
 ha ha, we talk about tailwind so much, so stupid.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.640
 But then it's still continuing.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.240
 So I'm just like, okay, it's too far now.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.840
 Now, I think this started because Taylor,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.560
 well, tweeted something like,

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.080
 tailwind is the only way to do maintainable CSS.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.080
 - Did you, and I was like, did you argue against it?

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.920
 - Yeah.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.600
 - Did you, no, I just don't care.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.560
 I was like, this drew nothing, no, no urge

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.440
 for me to respond or anything.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.960
 - Except your Twitch title, that's all.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.920
 That's all, it just drew you to say, I hate tailwind.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.760
 - That's true, yeah.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.840
 But I don't wanna actually talk about the topic.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.840
 I just want to say the topic is friggin' boring.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.840
 - Okay, can I switch gears?

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.680
 - Yes.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.280
 - I know you really love talking about tailwind.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:45.280
 But there is a group now of nine people in a Twitter DM.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.800
 It's a Twitter group of devs who stream on Twitch,

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.280
 they're going to Twitch con in a couple of months.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.520
 And you know who's not in this?

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.880
 - Me.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.880
 - I'm not in it.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.680
 - You, you suck.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.000
 Why are you not going to Twitch con?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.520
 - Can you list everyone in it?

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.800
 Is that private?

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.560
 - I mean, I don't, I get, I mean, I don't think anyone,

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.440
 anyone who's going has probably said publicly, right?

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.000
 - That's gonna, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.240
 - I mean, they're all like, okay, I'm gonna say who's in it.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.140
 I hope this isn't bad.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.640
 - Okay, tell me.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:20.640
 - Prime, bad cop, bash bunny, begin, like begin bot,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.160
 trash, milky, tawny, acorn, trav, Theo, me,

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.380
 and Chris Griffin.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.760
 - Wow, what a, what a crew.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.800
 - It's a bunch of people.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.840
 It's a crew.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.640
 We're probably gonna like go to dinner or something.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.120
 I don't know, something.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.960
 - You're gonna be in Vegas.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:37.800
 - You're gonna be in Vegas.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.640
 - Yeah, someone, don't you?

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.680
 Oh, you're trying to anti, you're trying to reverse them on me

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.680
 by pointing out they're some Vegas.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.680
 (laughing)

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.520
 - Hey Vegas.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.680
 I definitely have FOMO as gonna increase

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.080
 when I see all of your pictures.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.080
 - Oh yeah, there's gonna be some,

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.120
 we're gonna post so many pictures.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.680
 I'm just gonna DM you pictures.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.000
 - You don't even stream on Twitch,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.760
 so you shouldn't even be allowed entry.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.320
 - I have streamed my share, sir.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.240
 (laughing)

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.880
 - It does feel weird going to TwitchCon

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.320
 when I haven't streamed in months.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.720
 That does feel weird.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.560
 Has it been months?

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.400
 I don't even know anymore.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.520
 Wait, when is it again?

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.360
 Is it in November?

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.160
 - October, October.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.000
 - October?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.320
 - It's like October 20 something.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.360
 Are you considering it?

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.480
 Are you, are you considering?

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.120
 - No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not considering.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.320
 - What's the, is it killing factor?

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.000
 Is it, 'cause Vegas?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.960
 - No, it's not, it's not, well, okay.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.640
 So there's like layers of friction, right?

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.560
 So base level Vegas, okay, I can like get over that,

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.080
 like whatever, if I just go for a couple of days,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:31.920
 I'm gonna have fun.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.640
 That might, most favorite place to go,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.680
 I wish it was somewhere else.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.520
 That would excite me.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.360
 - Yeah.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.200
 - Instead of being like a negative.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.040
 - I know, it sucks.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.800
 But it's, you just stay in the hotel and who cares?

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.760
 - Yeah, but it's like, if I'm gonna go on a trip,

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.400
 it would just be nice if it was somewhere

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.720
 I hadn't gone before or something.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.560
 - Yeah, that's fair.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.920
 - A little added bonus.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.960
 Second is, I'm just like in work mode

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.120
 and I'm like just traveling right now, it just seems.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.760
 - Yeah, no, it's a distraction.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.720
 - Just a big disruption. - Yeah.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.880
 - Also, of everyone that you listed on that list,

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.600
 I don't really like any of those people.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.640
 So, that's really the main thing.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.720
 - That's not true.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.800
 (laughing)

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.880
 I know at least a few of them that you like humans.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.320
 - You suck.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.480
 - Yeah, have fun at your 12 person dinner

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.920
 where you end up in the corner seat

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.160
 and then you're not gonna be able to talk anymore.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.040
 And you're just gonna be looking at everyone else

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.520
 and you'll be like, I wish I got here earlier

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.120
 so I could get the middle seat, but you did.

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.280
 You got the wait and now you're at the edge

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.560
 and you can't really hear anyone

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.240
 and you're trying to get a word in

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.080
 and it just makes you work.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:28.920
 - 'Cause this isn't working, Max.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.760
 - I'm very excited.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.680
 - And then you're gonna pay 70 bucks for your dinner

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.800
 and then you're gonna go home.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.720
 You send me a box for your dinner

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.160
 which you actually couldn't even eat

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.600
 because there was meat in it.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.120
 You're gonna go home, order those terrible vegan donuts again

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.640
 and then slowly eat them over the course of the days.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.920
 - You got those in Vegas didn't it?

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.800
 Those were some terrible vegan donuts with a capital T.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.800
 Oh my word.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.600
 I mean, like in the, they're good tasting

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.880
 but make you feel awful 'cause they were so sugary.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.960
 Did you have any of those?

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.800
 I don't remember.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.480
 You came to the room.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.000
 - No, no, no, I saw you posted pictures

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.760
 and I was like, that doesn't, that looks like a kid's toy.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.440
 - Yeah, the way they decorated them.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.000
 - Yeah, I'm definitely gonna get more of them

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.680
 and I'm gonna regret every second of it.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.040
 Why am I gonna do that to myself anyway?

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.000
 - Yeah, so I'm not gonna go.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.320
 I hope you guys have fun.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.160
 I know you guys have fun.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.240
 - Okay, that's fine.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.160
 - It's fine.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.160
 No, it's fine, really.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.320
 It's fine.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.800
 On behalf of everybody, it's fine.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.000
 - That's fine.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.520
 - I'm just trying to make, I just hope this, again, react.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.840
 I'm just focused on react Miami.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.680
 I don't have to travel for that.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.920
 - So that's the one time of year

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.120
 you'll be at a conference when it's in your backyard.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.440
 - Yeah, I'm gonna try to like do, yeah, exactly.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.560
 When I can literally walk to it.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.560
 I'm gonna try to do more, just try to like get more people

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.600
 that I wanna see to go this year.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.880
 'Cause last year, a lot of people went

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.240
 that I wanted to see, but it was kind of like

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.080
 she's like going to see.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:49.920
 - I'm gonna try to go.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.280
 Before you just start begging me.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.120
 - What?

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:54.960
 Stop it.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.800
 (laughing)

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.800
 - Tickets are already sold out.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.040
 - Oh, stop it.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.080
 I know the organizers.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.880
 I know them.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.280
 I met at Rinder, 'cause I went to Atlanta.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.600
 I'm just quite the traveler.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.440
 - Oh.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.280
 - I'm just all over the place.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.920
 - I met the network here.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.760
 - I go to things.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.840
 - Rubbin shoulders, as I say.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.040
 - I am excited for React Miami.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.560
 It does seem like there's a lot of momentum

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.320
 behind that conference.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.920
 And the fact that it's gonna be a party this year,

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.200
 there's gonna be like an element of partying,

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.120
 just on purpose, not just as a side effect.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.200
 - Yeah, and the organizer Michelle,

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.400
 like she like tries really hard

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.560
 and she like tries to think really hard

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.760
 about what we're doing as opposed to being like,

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.640
 this is a conference you do, as wise.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.480
 - Yeah.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.120
 - Kind of thinking from it from ground up.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.280
 'Cause like even the city you're in

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.280
 should just impact the whole format of it

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.280
 because it is a place.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.640
 - Yeah, if it doesn't incorporate that.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.480
 Yeah, right.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.320
 - Yeah.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.160
 Yeah.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.160
 I can be a widely different base off of where you are.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.440
 I'm hoping that that works out.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.600
 I'm trying to get more of the bigger React people to go

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.600
 this year, which will be fun.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.320
 - I would do big React people not go last year.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.560
 Who are the big React people?

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.280
 - No, we had a bunch of like Kent.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.440
 Kent C. Dodds was there.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.480
 - Yeah, he's one of the biggest React people, right?

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.320
 - Yeah.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.480
 - Yeah, I always forget how he pronounces viju, viju,

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.880
 viju, the gixialidraw guy.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880
 He was like, yeah.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.700
 - Mm-hmm.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.560
 - Viju, viju.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.960
 I don't know if he's French, but.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.280
 - Oh, I missed trying to pronounce words

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.520
 that I can't pronounce.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.360
 That was fun.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.200
 When I streamed.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.440
 (laughing)

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.400
 - I'm laughing 'cause I'm remembering that one time.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.760
 Someone made you say something really inappropriate.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.600
 I actually still remember what it was.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.600
 - Was it the racial slur that I just mentioned?

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.200
 - No, it wasn't the racial slur.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.040
 - Oh, okay.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:36.860
 Something else.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.320
 - Someone spelled something in a different way.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.000
 - Oh, yeah, I remember to stop it.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.640
 Yeah, and I said it out loud.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.560
 'Cause I read every single message.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.800
 That's a vulnerability.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.920
 If you wanna hack my stream, just type anything into the chat

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.080
 and I will read it.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.320
 Double it still has the clip.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.440
 - Another thing I miss is when I would just

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.640
 re-paste someone else's message over again,

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.000
 and it was like kind of confused you.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.840
 (laughing)

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.400
 - Yeah, that was annoying.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.240
 Oh yeah, I gotta stream again.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.240
 We had good times.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.920
 - But you wouldn't have time.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.640
 You're probably thankful that I don't stream

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.640
 because you spent all that time in my chat

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.920
 when you should've been working,

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.120
 and it was just not a good use of time.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.000
 - That is a good point.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.720
 Maybe I don't want it to stream.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.440
 My productivity levels are at a recent high.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.240
 In the past couple years, this past few weeks,

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.720
 recent high in productivity.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.680
 - Do you chalk all that up to any one thing in particular?

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.520
 - No, I don't think I changed anything in my life.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.040
 I think it was just stuff pulled in a direction.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.720
 There's just a lot of work to do for SST.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.000
 I mean, we launched a console and we have users now,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.840
 and there's like--

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.720
 - You have users.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.920
 You have zero users.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.320
 Now you have users.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.160
 How's that going?

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.840
 What's it like to have users next?

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.440
 - It's fun because we get to see all this visibility

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.840
 into how people are using SST.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.080
 Before it was kind of a black box.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.320
 We had a little bit of telemetry in there,

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.320
 but it was just like, what commands you ran?

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.160
 - Yeah.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.320
 - But we didn't know what types of resources

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.160
 are you using?

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.640
 Are you deploying APIs next year sites?

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.480
 What are you doing?

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.080
 So now we're able to poke through all that.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.760
 And it's super interesting.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.440
 There's almost a, probably almost 1,000 next-js sites deployed,

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.640
 just from the people that signed up.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.480
 - Wow!

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.600
 - Yeah, the numbers are pretty crazy.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.360
 And we were also hooking into the metrics

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.360
 in your AWS account so we can see

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.400
 how many function invocations you have.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.320
 So every morning, the first thing I do is I check,

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.000
 'cause we have a job that runs every night that computes it.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.880
 And I have a ranking of all the companies

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.440
 and who has the most invocations.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.920
 - Whoa, I guess that's all private information.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.720
 Can you say?

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.960
 - Yeah, well, I mean, I can't share it, but--

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.320
 - Can you share any numbers or orders of magnitude?

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.800
 Or I don't know, something like what's--

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.480
 - Okay, so there's interesting dynamic that's happening

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.520
 where, so right now, to set up the console,

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.560
 you need to connect to your AWS account to us.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.960
 So you basically give us permission to look in there.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.040
 And right now, we haven't tightened up the permission.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.720
 So it's, right now, just you give us full access.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.480
 That sets a ceiling on the type of companies that--

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.640
 - Yeah, we'll just kind of like set it up offhand.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.200
 'Cause so the numbers aren't crazy right now,

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.680
 like they're, the highest one is like three

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.680
 or four million invocations a day, something like that.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.520
 - Ooh, that sounds like a lot.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.360
 - Around three and three became the thing.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.720
 - Is it a huge drop off from the top ones?

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.200
 Like, is it like a few people do a lot more

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.480
 than everybody else kind of thing?

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.360
 - There's like the top, I would say,

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.720
 if you look at over a million invocations a day,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.400
 there's like 20, I think, maybe less than, sorry, not per day.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.840
 Yep, no, sorry, per day is probably like five

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.120
 that do over a million a day.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.280
 But the thing is we know of,

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.640
 we know like, no personally of customers

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.440
 that do like billions of invocations a month,

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.600
 but for them, like they can't just add on a tool.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.400
 Like they need to like go through some more formal process

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.000
 to get it approved and all of that.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.960
 - We're learning a lot just by looking at some of this data.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.480
 So like right now, we're only gonna hit

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.720
 like this mid-range tier of like range

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.560
 from like hobby projects to like smaller companies

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.880
 that don't have like a ton of overhead.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.360
 So that there's always gonna be a limit there.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.360
 And we were like looking through and we were looking

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.760
 at the data 'cause we're trying to figure out

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.400
 our pricing model 'cause we wanna do it usage-based.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.880
 Yeah, we concluded that it doesn't make sense

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.800
 to charge this tier of people like a ton

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.600
 to try to maximize revenue 'cause most of it's gonna come

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.440
 from the people that need like a more involved process

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.600
 to onboard with the tier.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.440
 - That makes sense.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.640
 - We built the whole, and this is a really great pattern

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.880
 that I think more companies should follow.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.560
 Our app is just an SST app, right?

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.100
 So mostly if you do SC deploy the console,

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.520
 that's how we deploy it.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.120
 You theoretically could just clone the repo

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.040
 and do the same thing.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.040
 There's a little bit of a configuration that we need to

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.320
 remove or like to make it so it doesn't depend

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.560
 on certain things 'cause it doesn't make sense

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.800
 for self-hosting.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.120
 But the idea is you can like easily spin up a version

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.360
 of the console in your own account.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.800
 And for these bigger companies,

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.200
 that's really what's gonna have to happen.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.080
 - Oh.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.240
 - They just don't trust.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.640
 - They're not gonna hand over their account.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.480
 - Yeah.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.320
 - It just makes the conversation harder.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.320
 Like they probably will with enough talking

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.080
 and documents and all this stuff.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:12.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.880
 - But a nice thing that we can literally say,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.200
 okay, just clone the repo and do SC deploy

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.120
 in your own dedicated.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:18.960
 It was account and then-

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.800
 - They have their own concept.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.640
 - Just pay us.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.480
 - Yeah.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.320
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.160
 - Okay.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.680
 - So we call this, there's been a lot of different,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.680
 so the history has been like a fully hosted version

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.560
 or like an on-premise version.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.120
 And usually the on-premise version was like,

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.200
 like there's a lot of work for you to sell

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.560
 because they have to learn how to like operate your software.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.640
 Like, oh, it's a container and needs a database.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.880
 And like you need to spin up Kubernetes, all this stuff.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.480
 But because our stuff is just built using native AWS tools.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.480
 Self-hosting is like very little work.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.880
 Like it just kind of runs on Lambda.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.840
 Yeah, you don't have to scale anything.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.280
 You don't have to like really worry about much.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.480
 We did use PlanetScale.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.520
 So that's the one thing where we have to like fall back

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.360
 to RDS.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.200
 - Yeah.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.120
 - But that's not a big deal.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.680
 So yeah, self-hosting becomes very easy.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.920
 And it's great for the customer

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.080
 because like no overhead in self-hosting is great for us

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.760
 because now we can get these bigger enterprise type deals.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.040
 But you know, it's not like the code base

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.640
 is enough to like drastically vary.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.480
 So it's a great model, I think.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.320
 - Yeah, that's awesome.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.120
 - Like there's a lot of software I would love to self-host,

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.680
 but I just don't 'cause I don't want to like

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.160
 manage a container for it, you know?

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.320
 - Interesting.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.960
 Yeah, it's just like their app.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.880
 They deploy, just like they deploy their own app.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.160
 It's a SST app, that's awesome.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.840
 - So we're trying to figure all that out

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.560
 and we're probably gonna launch.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.400
 I think we're gonna launch billing today.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.960
 - Ooh.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.800
 - Billing.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.640
 - Hopefully.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.640
 - So you can start making money.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.480
 - For making more than zero dollars.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.320
 - More than zero dollars.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.120
 You got more than zero users.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.640
 Hopefully making more than zero dollars.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.940
 Startups that's hard.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.840
 - I know.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.680
 - But it's worth it.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.840
 - A lot to figure out.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.680
 - So worth it.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.560
 - I think so.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.000
 I mean, I really enjoy this past week.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.080
 We just had so many discussions on just pricing

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.280
 and strategy and like really thinking through all this stuff

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.760
 and I find that really, really fun and rewarding.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.560
 I think another interesting stat is I think so far,

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.200
 we've launched, it's been like two weeks, I think,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:18.120
 and we've have like 700 AWS accounts connected so far.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:18.960
 - Wow.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.800
 - It was pretty good.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.600
 - That's awesome.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.960
 Do you have any like,

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.080
 you've been head down building,

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.360
 but do you have any new thoughts,

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:31.360
 like a little check in on the broader startup ecosystem,

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.560
 the post free money environment that we're in?

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.240
 Like if there've been any developments,

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.240
 how do you feel about the outlook for startups?

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.240
 - I think there's been,

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.960
 the interesting thought I had yesterday was,

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.120
 so there's like this fallacy

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.720
 that exists into extremes, right?

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.720
 There's the startup that never has any business model

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.240
 and they just try to grow, grow, grow, grow, grow,

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.560
 and they realize one day like,

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.200
 okay, we grew a bunch, but this doesn't make any sense.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.840
 Then there's the opposite extreme, which is also bad,

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.880
 where you just focus on like revenue way too early

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.840
 and you never really find a product that can be huge

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.640
 'cause you like just kind of limit yourself.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.160
 So I think, so obviously we were at one extreme,

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.320
 like the no-biz model extreme,

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.080
 but now I'm seeing people swing to the other extreme

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.120
 where they're like trying to,

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.440
 because everyone's like worried about money

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.240
 and want to become sustainable,

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.360
 they're like really focused on getting more dollars out

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.680
 from people before their product is like hyper-growing,

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.160
 before they really found a product market fit.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.600
 And I think that's kind of,

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.640
 the reason startups and VCs exist

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.680
 is so that you can buy time to turn the revenue

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.280
 on after a couple years of experimenting

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.560
 and find something that really hits.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.960
 So I feel like people aren't threading that well

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.280
 where now they're just way too focused on revenue.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.440
 - Yeah.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.280
 - And there's a lot of pressure,

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.400
 like what we ourselves feel it

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.000
 and like we are more focused on it than we were,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.320
 but like you, if you get into the mode

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.680
 where you're like trying to squeeze more money out of people

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.680
 when you're still like a pre-product fit company,

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.680
 it's like squeezing more money out of like 200 people.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.520
 - Yeah.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.600
 - You know, it's like, this really makes sense.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.800
 - And like from a VCs perspective,

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.480
 the whole goal is for these big wins.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.560
 Like they're hoping for the, you know,

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.200
 earn their whole fund back wins.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.920
 And if startups are generally doing this

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.080
 in their portfolio,

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.080
 I would think they'll, don't not like that.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.680
 They'll shift the strategic thinking towards the other end.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.640
 - Yeah, it's a weird time.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.480
 I don't know.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.680
 Like, yeah, I think VCs are also confused

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.600
 not that they were ever not confused.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.640
 (laughing)

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.920
 - Companies like Uber,

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.680
 when you're talking about the other end of the spectrum,

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.680
 like where companies just grow, grow, grow

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.040
 before they ever figure out the money side.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.360
 Like Uber, it sounds like they didn't know the business model,

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.760
 but did they ever become profitable?

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.200
 Like, I think of giant companies like that

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.280
 as Uber profitable.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.240
 - So I actually don't put Uber in this category.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.400
 I think they had a very straightforward business model

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.520
 and it actually all made sense.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.960
 They had their first profitable quarter this year or something.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.800
 - Oh, okay.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.200
 So they finally did, yeah, figure out the economics of it.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.040
 Yeah, it's a different thing

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:12.880
 than what you're talking about.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.160
 You're talking about companies that just like,

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.360
 there's no idea that we're gonna make money,

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.440
 but they grow and blow it out

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.840
 and then try and find a business model later.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.320
 - Yeah, like fundamentally, it doesn't make sense.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.800
 Like, so in Uber's case,

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.160
 they didn't have to spend as much money as they did

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.400
 to get to where they were.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.240
 I think someone like looked at that profitable quarter

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.200
 and they like mapped it out and they were like,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.680
 I think they said if they continue to be profitable

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.200
 at this rate, it's gonna take them like 30 or 40 years

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.000
 to break even on the amount of money they've spent.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.440
 - Was that mostly 'cause of competition,

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.520
 like with Lyft, they're just trying to win space.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.920
 So they had to be so aggressive or

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.000
 - Just like, they have so many engineers,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.920
 like crazy, crazy burn rates.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.920
 They had a whole like self-driving car division.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.600
 They had like flying car division.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.440
 I don't know if you remember that.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.240
 - No, they had a flying car division.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.360
 They were gonna make flying cars.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.840
 - Yeah.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.760
 - Yeah, they had like a division for that.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.240
 They were like in all these countries

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.200
 that they kind of got booted out of just 'cause like

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.560
 you can't really operate freely in certain countries.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.000
 There's like a lot of waste and obviously

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.200
 it's only clear in hindsight.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.960
 Some of it, you know, obviously like flying cars

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.760
 maybe obvious in the moment as well.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.280
 But yeah, like they didn't, like the model worked

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.680
 'cause like ultimately taxi companies work

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.460
 where like there's a taxi company that employs

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.400
 the hedge drivers and that whole model works.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.160
 At scale, it should have been even better

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.720
 but they just spent way more money than they needed to.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.480
 And I think now they've like paired everything back.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.680
 They've raised prices to a place that is more sustainable.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.160
 I still think they're way too big probably,

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.380
 but also Uber eats does really, really well.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.220
 - Oh really?

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.520
 - Yeah, so they're not, they're like,

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.120
 they're just like a weird example of like

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.680
 that could have been a much healthier company,

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.920
 but it just wasn't.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.080
 - Sorry, I'm stuck on this.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.560
 That little nugget you just pulled out,

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.800
 that little Uber eats does really well.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.280
 Like, do you like read the Wall Street Journal?

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.800
 Like where do you hear these kind of things?

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.320
 Like what, well that one is a weird one

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.040
 because we, back when I worked in at a company

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.600
 that did like the medical transportation,

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.080
 Uber was like a really close partner.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.260
 So I'd always be talking with people there

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.960
 and they would just tell me about information

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.560
 like Uber eats and how much money it's making and all of that.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.840
 So yeah, and I use it all the time too, so.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.080
 - I mean, yeah, whenever I travel, I'm big on the Uber eats.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.320
 - Everyone was always referencing it.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.720
 It's like become the default way to describe food delivery.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.840
 I think some people say DoorDash.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.280
 - The problem for me with like food delivery

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.360
 that nobody seems to talk about is that

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.720
 it's always a little cold.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.080
 It's not cold, but it's like.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:42.920
 - It sucks.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.440
 - It's not like eating the meal right after it was made.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.320
 Is there a solution to this?

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.200
 - I think somebody, I'm gonna make up numbers,

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.680
 but they're roughly, they're like, directionally correct.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.200
 I was told that, you know that delivery company is Slice?

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.360
 Have you ever heard of it? - Never heard of it.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.160
 - They're like Uber eats just for pizza.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.400
 All they do is pizza places

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.920
 since their entire focus is called Slice.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.920
 - It's the slice of the market, even, you might say.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.640
 - It's something like pizza is still like 60 plus percent

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.880
 of all food delivery. - Oh, I guess that makes sense.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.800
 - And they only drop like 10% after all these like Uber eats

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.520
 and DoorDash and all these things came out

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.800
 because it's like one of the only foods

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.760
 that like just travels well and is cheap and reliable.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.400
 There's so few places that I'm like happy to get delivery from.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:34.920
 You might have the same experience, but like over the past

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.600
 couple of years, Lizz has gotten like insanely, insanely

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.000
 good at cooking.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 And now most food, especially delivery just feels terrible.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.400
 Like just compared to, it just like tastes like garbage.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.680
 Even when we go out, a lot of times we're like,

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.600
 and this was like not worth it, you know?

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.680
 - Yeah.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.760
 - So my bar on what's acceptable.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.520
 Yeah, my bar on what's acceptable just has gone up a lot.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.840
 And yeah, very like not a lot of food travels well at all.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.680
 - Yeah.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.040
 I mean, those vegan donuts in Vegas,

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:04.880
 they traveled pretty well,

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.520
 but they were mostly plastic, I think.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.560
 They were literally were children's toys.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.760
 I think just coated in sugar.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.160
 I don't know.

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.000
 - Those could have been delivered

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.800
 like a hundred years late and been a completely fine.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.640
 - Oh yeah, those would never decay.

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.920
 Well, that wasn't like a documentary or something, right?

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.160
 Didn't, maybe it was in the, they supersized me.

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.920
 They like at the end of the documentary,

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.000
 they took like a McDonald's burger

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.240
 and put it in like this glass jar.

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.200
 And then they put like a, like a mom and pop cafe burger

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.000
 next to it and fries too, maybe, I don't know.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.240
 And they watched them decay like time lapse

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.720
 and like the McDonald's burger never decay.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.040
 Just sat there.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.960
 And the other one like turned into mold in a week.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:43.800
 It was crazy.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.680
 - So the McDonald's one is better is what you said.

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:46.520
 - I guess so, yeah.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.520
 And the life-giving properties of like anti-aging.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.560
 I mean, you will never decompose basically.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.400
 - Yeah.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.240
 There you go.

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.560
 - You heard it here first.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.200
 - Yeah, but anyway, what were we talking about?

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.360
 We're talking about how Uber,

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.520
 before Uber, we're talking about just companies up.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.960
 You're saying you don't put Uber in that category.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.760
 Like is there a company you will throw into the bus

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.280
 and put in that category publicly?

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.120
 - Do you remember?

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:10.960
 Do you remember Fast?

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.800
 I think they were called Fast.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.720
 - Wait.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.000
 - All those like instant checkout.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.800
 - No, it wasn't Fast, was it?

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.640
 I know what you're talking about.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:18.480
 The instant checkout.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.320
 - Bold.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.160
 - Bold.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.960
 - The founder was like, you just really,

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.520
 if you've ever disliked somebody publicly,

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.560
 it was that founder.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.400
 What a guy.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.240
 What a guy.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.640
 - He was the one that had that picture.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.640
 Do you remember his profile picture?

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.480
 - Was he like meditating?

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.080
 - He was like for like, no.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.240
 - No, no, no, this one, it was like his face.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.480
 He had like a crazy face.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.040
 I was like, it was like a weirdly professional photo,

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.440
 but he was like looking and the camera was pointing down

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.080
 at him and it just was very, very annoying photo.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.680
 And he was always posting all this like founder insights.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.840
 I'm such a business genius.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.560
 - He was just like such a meme of San Francisco,

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.400
 or not San Francisco, of like Silicon Valley founder culture.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.840
 - Yeah.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.960
 And that company like never made any money

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.120
 because it just did not make any sense at all.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:02.960
 - Yeah.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.960
 - So yeah, I think those types of companies,

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.840
 I don't know if we'll ever see those come back.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.640
 A lot of people made money starting those types of companies

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.240
 and exiting somehow, but.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.720
 - Good for them.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.560
 Good for them.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.320
 - It just sucks that we're stuck with them now.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.640
 Like the people that did that and failed,

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.480
 they're wiped out.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.320
 We'll never see them again.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.800
 Really, they're not gonna annoy us.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.200
 But there's probably like 50 people

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.560
 that did stuff like that and made money.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.080
 And now they're just gonna be pouring their insights out

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.680
 on us for like the next 30 years.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.000
 - They've successfully exited a company.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.040
 They've got stuff to share.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.320
 - Yeah.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.800
 - The world is so random.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.640
 Basically taking nothing at face value.

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.080
 Is that what you're saying?

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.280
 Or is that just my conclusion?

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.720
 - My main point is that you should just shut up

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.560
 about Tailwind.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.280
 (laughing)

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.120
 - Sorry.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.440
 - This is all gonna stop talking about Tailwind.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.640
 If you're listening, spread the word.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.040
 If you talk about Tailwind, I'm gonna come after you.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.560
 - I'm not sure how we got there, but okay.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.160
 Fair enough.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.160
 It's just so good.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.200
 It's so nice.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.840
 I don't know what your problem with it is.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.760
 - I don't have a problem with it.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.680
 It's just like, it's just fine.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.840
 (laughing)

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.920
 Do you really love it?

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.600
 - I'm trying to think of like.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.120
 - I really honestly do.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.400
 Do you want me to go into the reasons why?

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.000
 (laughing)

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.840
 - No, I don't.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.000
 - If you never heard why Tailwind is good,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:25.840
 do I need to tell you?

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.680
 - Oh my God.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:30.760
 You know, this is like buying a really nice,

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.800
 handmade Italian sports car.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:38.800
 And you're like, I just love the space and the trunk.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:43.520
 It's just like, if you focus on some random detail of like,

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.000
 oh yeah, the floor mats are like amazing.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.120
 Like everyone needs to get these floor mats.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.080
 - Oh, I love it.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.080
 - You're just saying, well, 'cause you view things,

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.880
 I think some people would say,

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.120
 I mean styling is a big part of the front end.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.960
 But you don't view things from a front end perspective.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.440
 You've got the whole project in one repo.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.600
 I mean, you're very full stack to the,

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.000
 like as much as anyone is full stack,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.480
 you're a full stack dev.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.560
 You work on the infrastructure, you know, whatever,

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.480
 all the way down to the CSS.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.920
 So it is a tiny part of what you do.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.640
 But for some people, I'm imagining, I don't know,

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.960
 front end developers.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.320
 It's like they write markup and they style it.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.320
 And so it's like half of their job.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:26.000
 - But the thing is, and the classic thing

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.960
 that people respond to me hearing me say this is like,

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.800
 oh, you just don't think fun is important.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.600
 Like you don't think it matters.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.440
 - You say yeah, I don't.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.760
 - But it doesn't matter, U.S. is the front end.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.220
 (laughing)

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.560
 But this past two months,

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.400
 I've mostly been writing front end.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.920
 Like I've been doing a ton of front end,

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.760
 a ton of styling.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.480
 We've been building a product from zero.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.400
 Like most of the work was design work

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.160
 and getting things styled right and looking right

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.360
 and feeling right.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.120
 I care a lot about it.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.600
 I am happy with the tools that I use.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:00.600
 I think most of my pain comes from making a good product

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.720
 that like looks good.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:07.280
 Like the, yeah, how I literally style and do it.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.520
 Like there's like five good options to do that now.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.200
 And Tailwind is one of them.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.640
 So I'm just like, okay, we will like, we're happy.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.880
 Aren't we happy?

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.040
 Didn't we be happy now?

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.200
 Like why are we still talking about this?

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.040
 - It is.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:22.880
 - Will you still be talking about this much

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.720
 if you were happy?

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.560
 - I don't know.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.400
 - And I don't know one person.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.320
 I'm not trying to call anybody out.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.320
 It is odd though that it does continue to be a topic

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.720
 that we will forever discuss.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.760
 Like is it just something about the polarization of it?

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.800
 Like the fact that it has some of these traits

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.760
 that people latch on to and freak out like in lines.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.240
 It looks like inline styles.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.880
 Like is that the reason that we still talk about it?

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.280
 - My theory with the reason that these stupid things

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:49.080
 draw so much passion, I posted this the other day.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.280
 The only explanation I can come up with for this is

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.800
 people work at companies where this is not consensus.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.840
 So they want to use Tailwind or they want to use whatever.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.200
 And maybe like 70% of the company agrees,

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.680
 but there's a kind of annoying 30% that's holding out.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.440
 And you can't like really yell at your coworkers in this way.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.680
 - So I think it just comes out online where whenever

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.760
 someone is like, I don't like Tailwind,

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.720
 all these people that are upset at their coworkers

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.560
 are not enemies.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:21.200
 They're like, I'm gonna get my anger out on this person.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.600
 That's my only explanation for it.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.400
 If that's not it, I gave everyone a reasonable reason

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.240
 for being this way.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.440
 There's a reason why you're that way.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.760
 There's something wrong with you.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.120
 (laughs)

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.400
 - That's your only out.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.080
 Bex just gave you your one escape.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:36.920
 - Yeah.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.160
 All right, I've got a cold and I need to pee.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.040
 So I've got a lot of things working against me here.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.400
 A lot of things that want to come out of my body.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.640
 - What order are you going to do them in?

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.680
 - I don't know actually.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.760
 I'll probably pee first.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.000
 It's a little more pressing.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:48.840
 This just got weird.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.680
 I don't know.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.280
 Maybe we don't include this in the podcast

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.120
 for our poor listeners.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:52.960
 - No, I include it.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.160
 Adam is going to pee them blow.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.000
 - Okay, fine.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:55.820
 You don't want to include it.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.000
 I'm going to pee them blow this.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 You don't shorten it to blow.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.840
 It just sounds like doing a drug, I think.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.840
 (laughs)

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.360
 I think it sounds familiar.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.200
 I don't know.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.040
 It's all on TV.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.400
 (laughs)

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.560
 - Episode 50 in the books.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.040
 50 of them.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.360
 Half a hundred.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.960
 That's not a way that you refer to 15.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.800
 Nope.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.640
 One of them I think enough.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.960
 - Yeah, I'm just realizing our very important milestone,

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.000
 50 of the episode is going to be about tailwind

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.920
 and I just did it to myself.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.760
 - You're part of the problem.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.760
 You're part of the problem.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.600
 - No, I can't stop either.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.120
 - All right, well, congratulations on Twitch partner.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.600
 I can't believe I just now learned it

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.200
 by looking at your name on Twitch

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.280
 and seeing the little purple check.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.360
 - Did you announce it?

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.480
 - I think you already knew this.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.320
 You just forgot.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.440
 - No, you didn't tell me.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.480
 - I did, I tweeted.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.360
 LOL, I got Twitch partner last week and I didn't notice.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.200
 - I didn't see that tweet, honestly.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.560
 - Oh, maybe it was when you were disappeared.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.880
 - I mean, yeah, I'm not on,

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.240
 I don't see all your tweets anymore

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.200
 'cause I don't get on Twitter every day.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.880
 I missed it.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.720
 There you go.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.800
 You didn't DM it to me though.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.640
 - Did you?

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.480
 - No, I didn't DM you.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.320
 I'm sorry.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.160
 - That's okay.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.280
 In the recording and then continue talking

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.080
 'cause that's when all the good content comes out

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.560
 after we record (laughing)

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.440
 everything interesting we say happens after we stop

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.280
 the podcast.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.120
 So let's say bye.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:17.960
 - Okay, see ya.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:18.800
 - See ya.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.380
 (upbeat music)

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:33.160
 - And then we look at chat.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.520
 - We talk to chat.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.680
 - Tran's coding.

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.120
 Just never stop recording.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.640
 We'll just never stop.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.640
 We'll just go forever.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.160
 They actually gotta leave your stream up.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.000
 You can't turn off the stream.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.380
 - Oh, Adam, you didn't see that tweet

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.360
 'cause I tweeted it only to my circle.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.360
 - Oh, oh, I'm not in your circle.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.520
 You just kidding.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.640
 - Oh, you're nice about that one, Paul.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.360
 I just sold Pete Bertrand's shirt.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.200
 - That's good.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.040
 AJ's here.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.520
 Well, I'm gonna talk to AJ tomorrow on.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.520
 - Very exciting.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.360
 - Yeah.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.640
 - We're gonna record with AJ.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.520
 I'm gonna talk about AJ as a crazy person

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.040
 and we shouldn't trust anything he tries to say.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.280
 He literally jumps off of bridges.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.120
 - What?

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.360
 - Literally jumps off of bridges.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.000
 - Like functioning bridges?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.480
 - You haven't seen AJ's videos of him base jumping.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.880
 - Have I seen this, AJ?

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.800
 You base jump?

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.800
 - He does backflips off of bridges.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.360
 - Well, I guess if you might've showed me at re-invent,

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.120
 did you have a video at re-invent AJ?

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.000
 It's sort of familiar.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.240
 How often, AJ?

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.120
 - Are you like--

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.200
 - One thing I love about the videos is you can tell

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.600
 he's like a pro and very confident in his own.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.480
 It's a bunch of times.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.120
 So he's like pretty like calm.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.240
 But despite that, you can still see the hell yeah.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.760
 I'm still alive, like kind of in his voice.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.600
 - Yeah.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.800
 I mean, that's gotta be every time you do something like that.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.720
 Even people who jump out of planes all the time, right?

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.200
 They've surely got to have like a moment of,

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.560
 I'm on the ground.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.400
 - Yeah.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.400
 - Yeah.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.400
 - Have you ever done anything like that?

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.720
 Have you?

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.080
 Any kind of thrill seeking?

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.120
 - Never done bass jumping, no.

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.440
 - Have you ever jumped out of a plane?

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.280
 - Yeah.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.800
 - You've gone skydiving?

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.880
 - But strap to someone else, yeah.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:13.920
 - Are you serious?

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.760
 - A long time ago.

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.680
 - Did we talk about this?

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:16.600
 - I don't think it's a big deal.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.920
 I think a lot of people do that.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:18.760
 It's like not that you need.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.880
 - I think it is a big deal.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.160
 I think jumping out of a plane is a big deal.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.400
 - You just strapped to somebody else

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.680
 and it's just this weird thing.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.240
 - So why did you have to be strapped to somebody else?

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.880
 - You couldn't, you didn't have--

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.240
 - I thought the rule was that--

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.960
 - You weren't tall enough, did you not cross time?

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:33.800
 - Align.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.600
 (laughing)

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.600
 - No, I was tall enough.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.280
 In fact, that was too tall, just kidding.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.800
 (laughing)

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.080
 - What was it like to know that that person,

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.880
 like that they had your life in their hands?

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.840
 If they didn't pull that cord, you were gone.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.080
 - People have my life in their hands all the time.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.040
 When I take an Uber, that person has their life in my hands.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.160
 - I guess, yeah.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.520
 Okay, Uber, a pilot in the plane.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.480
 - Yeah, although you don't ever fly anywhere,

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.400
 'cause you're a jerk and you won't come to--

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.920
 - Switching to New Jersey and I came back.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.400
 - You did, wait a minute.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.000
 I thought you were too busy to travel.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.120
 You, hmm.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.160
 - But that's why I have to allocate my travel

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.000
 to the things I can't say no to.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:14.840
 - Do things you care about?

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.680
 Oh.

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.520
 - You can't say no to a joke.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.200
 I understand that, obligations.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.040
 - I get it.

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.320
 - You can do an eight hour ground course

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.480
 and jump solo right away.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.960
 Yes, okay, so I think I did do an eight hour ground course,

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.800
 so that's why.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.400
 - Eight hour ground course, like you learn

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:31.560
 for eight hours on the ground, how to jump off a base.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.400
 Oh, wait.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.240
 - No, no, no, no.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.080
 How to jump off of an airplane.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.480
 Then you can do it, your first jump can be solo.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.520
 - Oh, out of a, I gotcha.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.760
 Wait a minute, why is it called base jumping?

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.600
 What is a base?

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.640
 - It's an acronym, it's a, what is an acronym?

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.200
 Building antenna spanners.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.600
 - I'm sorry, what?

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.800
 Oh, those are the different things,

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.480
 the four objects you can jump from.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:55.080
 And antenna, like on top of the Empire State Building?

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:55.920
 Is that an antenna?

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:56.760
 - Wait, hang on.

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.240
 Okay, so you know, when I used to live in New York,

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.040
 I live right by the New World Trade Center.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.320
 And before it opened, a bunch of people climbed,

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.000
 snuck in, climbed to the top and jumped off of it.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.120
 And they landed like on the street where I lived,

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.320
 at like in the middle of the night.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.160
 - What?

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.080
 - And you see them land in front of this taxi.

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.960
 I'm always like that taxi driver,

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.440
 which is like, what the hell just happened?

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.640
 (laughing)

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.560
 - I guess parachutes, that's how you base jump

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.760
 with the parachute, right?

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:25.880
 - That's high enough?

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.440
 - I feel like doing it to be a certain height

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.560
 above the earth to use a parachute reliably or no.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.520
 - There's definitely a minimum height,

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.360
 but it's not that high

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.840
 because you hit terminal velocity pretty quick

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.640
 with a parachute, it's a whole point, right?

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.480
 - I don't know, the whole point.

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.520
 - The ages as these jumped as low as 125 feet.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.040
 - Oh my word, are you serious?

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.520
 And a parachute works at 120 feet, huh?

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.440
 - Three iron workers.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.320
 Oh, they were, oh, interesting.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.640
 Were they working on the World Trade Center?

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.880
 'Cause I was wondering how they got up there,

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:51.960
 like how they needed to go up there.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.440
 - Ah.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.160
 - Yeah, I'll share the video later.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.480
 It is really insane just to do that.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.680
 I mean, they got arrested and they got in trouble

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.840
 and all of that, but definitely worth it.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.840
 - Man, you guys are crazy.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.400
 I don't have the thrill-seeking jeans.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.480
 - I like the ground.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.320
 - The AJ's crazy.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.160
 - I don't even like flying.

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.000
 - I like the ground, too.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.280
 - Yeah, flying sucks.

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.720
 Do you think every time you get on a plane,

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.200
 you like imagine it going down?

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.960
 - You used to be really afraid of terrorists.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.800
 - Oh, interesting.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.120
 - That was like the source of my fear.

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.240
 I never really worried about a plane crashing, really.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.240
 But I mean, of course, I feel relieved when it lands.

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.080
 - Yeah.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.240
 - It's, I love, I love flying to Miami or like leaving,

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.360
 whatever, like when I'm on a plane

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.040
 with a bunch of people from Miami,

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:37.280
 people get like, people are like pretty religious.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:41.200
 And like, when we were leaving to go to New Jersey

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.400
 and we landed, the woman was like doing like the Jesus thing.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.520
 I know what this is called, where you go like the cross thing.

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.440
 - Yeah.

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.520
 - Was that called something?

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.480
 - I think it is, but I don't remember.

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.880
 - Okay, she was like doing that as we landed.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.840
 - Oh yeah, I mean, that's the moment.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.220
 It's just like when I think about being that high

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:03.080
 up in the air and being in a metal tube going that fast.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.360
 I don't know, it's just hard not to think about it

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.760
 going wrong, like so many things that could go wrong.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.600
 I hate flying.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.160
 - Have you seen those?

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:15.760
 So the smallest private jet you can buy, I think,

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.880
 it's all a serious something, it has a parachute in it.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.180
 - No, for the plane?

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.960
 - For the plane, for the plane, yeah.

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.800
 - It's light enough that the parachute can stop it from, huh?

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.360
 - Yeah, and it's been, I think, so I know it's definitely

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.560
 been deployed once ever for some Walmart executive.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.640
 He was flying, he had to do it and it saved him.

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.480
 - Yeah.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.480
 - And I think recently it got deployed one more time.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.720
 I think it was the past couple of months.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.240
 - Wow, that's crazy.

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.080
 - Yeah, it's definitely a crazy feat of engineering,

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.480
 but if I ever have a plane one day, it's gonna be that one.

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:51.360
 - So my brother is like a commercial airline pilot

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.200
 for Delta.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.040
 - All right.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:56.640
 - He told me that there's a certain kind of plane,

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.360
 if you ever get a plane, like you wanna be a private pilot,

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.960
 you wanna single engine.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.560
 People that are like doctors and lawyers,

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.520
 they can afford a plane and they get like a dual prop plane.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.080
 They think like two engines safer than one.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.560
 They call those doctor killers or lawyer codes.

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:14.400
 - Yeah, I've heard that.

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.200
 - 'Cause one engine goes out and it's like a death spiral

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.120
 and they don't know how to recover.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.080
 They're not experienced enough pilots.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.560
 So you want one with just a single,

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.480
 like a single engine in the front,

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.640
 you're getting a small plane.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.680
 - Interesting.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.160
 - Just for those listening that might, you know,

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.320
 wanna buy a plane someday.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.720
 - It's always like the doctor and his family and their dog.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.280
 That's like always a story.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.120
 - Yeah.

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:35.960
 - Yeah, the dog.

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:36.800
 I know what you're talking about.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.640
 I've heard that story.

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.720
 - It's always like the dog.

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.040
 There's all the dogs always there.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.960
 - So listen, I realized the problem with this plan,

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:46.040
 where we say on after we don't hit the button is,

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.160
 I still have to pee.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.200
 And also, I feel like we still knew it was recording

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.400
 'cause this still wasn't any good.

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.580
 And now we've over-promised.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:55.240
 People thought, "Oh, this is gonna be the good stuff."

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.720
 I mean, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't like,

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.520
 I feel like we're a lot looser.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.560
 Little more, maybe we say things we shouldn't say.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.600
 I don't know. (laughs)

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:08.160
 I've got a jiu-jitsu takedown seminar tomorrow.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.760
 I'm gonna be learning some takedowns

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.920
 for like three hours in the morning.

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.760
 - Nice.

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.080
 - Sorry.

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.360
 I'll be throwing people at the ground.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.060
 Is that when you insult each other?

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.760
 Oh, let's do your throw each other, yeah.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.720
 - Like you suck, no, you suck.

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.520
 (both laughing)

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.960
 I think I have tennis elbow, by the way, in both elbows.

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:26.860
 - Oh, is that what that is?

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.040
 - Yeah, like not from getting armbarred.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.520
 I thought I'd just been talking

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.560
 about my left elbow pain on armbar,

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.520
 but then I realized, "Oh, my right one hurts just as bad."

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:37.600
 And it turns out, tennis elbow, very common with jiu-jitsu

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.040
 because you're using your arms in so many ways,

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.840
 like planking on them and like just gripping really hard.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.000
 All these different things you're doing

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.920
 that your elbow is not really getting that strain

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.200
 in everyday life, so it's pretty painful.

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.120
 - Are you gonna like become stronger

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.640
 in these ways doing this,

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.040
 or is it just gonna deteriorate you more?

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.520
 - Is this gonna be nagging injuries?

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:02.360
 Yeah, am I gonna slide into my 40s half decrepit,

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:03.720
 not able to move around the house?

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:04.640
 I don't know.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:08.520
 I hope that I'm gonna adapt and be stronger,

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:11.200
 but I don't know, I should look it up.

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.280
 At my age, "Hey, my birthday is Sunday."

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:15.200
 - I really do have to pee.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.320
 - Yeah.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.400
 - Oh, you knew that, huh?

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.880
 - You just knew that.

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.880
 - You told me last time.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:20.720
 - Oh, okay.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.560
 (laughs)

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.400
 - I put it in my calendar.

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.480
 - Oh, you put it in your calendar.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.320
 Wait, when's your birthday?

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.400
 Oh, do you wanna share your birthday?

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.600
 I don't know if you wanna share your birthday.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.600
 - No, I don't wanna share my birthday.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.440
 I'll tell you in private.

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.280
 - Tell me in private, yeah.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.280
 - I mean, everyone knows

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.240
 'cause I think people talk about it last year, whatever.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.080
 - It's a privacy thing.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.840
 I understand that now.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:35.840
 Too late, I already said,

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:38.400
 "Well, you don't know when this was recorded."

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.040
 Except everyone in Twitch share right now. You guys know my birthday now.

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.200
 - This was recorded August 17th.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.040
 - Stop it!

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.120
 (laughs)

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.320
 - Oh, love it.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.520
 All right.

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.520
 I'll see you next time.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:51.360
 - Okay.

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.200
 - All right, see ya.

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.040
 - Bye.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.620
 (upbeat music)

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:18.380
