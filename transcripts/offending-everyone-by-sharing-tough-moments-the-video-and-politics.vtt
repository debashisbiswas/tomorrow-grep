WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
 Can you hear me? Okay, I'm getting some like stuttery. I don't know if it's my internet

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.280
 I was trying to find it might be your inner voice my inner voice. That's causing you to sound stuttery

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.680
 Like I have low bandwidth. Yeah interesting

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.600
 You looked very deep in thought. I was you were eating your necklace. It was a whole thing

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.960
 I like vaguely like I don't know. I don't know what speaker coming out of like on your shoulder

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.360
 Yeah, it's the ghost of Adam haunting you. This is not an episode. I thought we would record in I mean like

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.940
 Not what we're gonna talk about. I don't know what we're gonna talk about. I just mean

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.380
 It's not an episode like today. I kind of thought I was gonna need another week and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.980
 Things fell into place at the last minute. So here we are. I love that you don't really know what's going on

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.280
 I don't know and nobody knows what's going on. It's funny cuz uh

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.280
 There were a few posts today about this podcast and someone was like oh really someone was like it's so annoying

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.400
 When they skip a week and I was like we're about to skip another week. Just skip a few weeks

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.200
 Who knows how many weeks actually, you know what this has been like the toughest week of my life

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.480
 That's pretty easy to say even not even like close and I'm actually really proud of me for not like melting down publicly

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.240
 I didn't have any like serious fault. Did I did I tweet anything that was just like

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.280
 Irreparable damage to my reputation or something. I don't think so. I think I managed

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.280
 Oh, did I am I forgetting? I would forget something like that. No, I don't think you but it's like the reason

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.440
 I'm saying I was like that was an expectation that I don't know I wouldn't even think of that possibility really

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.000
 Yeah, I guess I know people

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.480
 People that are close to me that have had

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.160
 issues in life

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.120
 mental health or otherwise that have done a lot of things publicly and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.920
 They I don't know you can you know when things are really bad and you're struggling. It's true

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.600
 It's easy enough to like find solace in the anonymous internet not the anonymous internet, but just like

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.080
 Say what's on your mind and then I don't know everyone views you a little differently because you're struggling

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.280
 There's a lot of stigma about mental health in America. Let's talk about that. I'm just kidding. That's

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.680
 That's not what I'm here to talk about

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.280
 Think it so okay

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.800
 Where do I want to begin? I I really do struggle here because I don't know like if it were just me and you talking and this wasn't gonna

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.840
 Be a podcast obviously the conversation would be different normally. I like to just have the conversation as naturally as possible

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.200
 Where I don't think about what I'm saying. I'm probably gonna think a little bit about what I say on this episode

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.880
 Yeah, okay, so I've had a tough couple of weeks week. I don't know also

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.480
 Yeah, I just I don't want to make this whole episode about this. This just feels weird. It's weird

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.760
 There's so many things that are weird. It's weird. You're just dying

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:30.240
 Okay, like don't worry about the meta stuff let's just start talking. I will to balance it. I also had

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.560
 something

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.560
 embarrassing and very

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.560
 Annoying happened to me in the beginning of this week. Okay, I will share that afterwards. Would you say it's been the toughest week of your life or?

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.600
 Maybe not

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.520
 It was definitely a very tough

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:54.980
 Hours that led to difficult sleep and then I woke up and then everything was resolved by then but uh, okay

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.700
 It's just embarrassed for me particularly. It's embarrassing. So I'm so excited. Okay. We'll we'll do my thing first and then we'll come

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.000
 That'll be the comedic relief

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.900
 Yeah, okay. I'm not gonna beat around it. Just like I'm gonna get into some stuff. It's

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.480
 This is our podcast like like we can talk about what we want and it'd be weird for me like as you'll hear one thing

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.680
 I'm really focused on moving forward is being

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.840
 okay with being myself and just being

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.440
 like having a life where I'm the same to everybody and I'm not

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.680
 Like pretending ever to be something so we basically would just have to cancel the podcast if I didn't talk about this stuff

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.600
 Because there's no way I'd be able to get on here and not just be fake and pretend

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.280
 I don't know all this stuff isn't going on. So this had to happen

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.660
 I'm sorry if you're a listener and you're just like I don't want to hear about next year's because I'm a big versatile fan boy

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.640
 I'm sorry because this is gonna be a little different

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.120
 Yeah, so Casey and I my wife Casey of 15 years

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.000
 have been on the precipice of

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.740
 Ending our relationship for a week. So we were separated. This is very it's gonna get very confusing

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.120
 It's like the friends Ross and Rachel stuff

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.960
 We were on a break and then we were separated and then we were maybe closer than ever and then yesterday

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.280
 Was very close to looking like it was over over over divorce over and then today

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.720
 Once again the best it's been

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.680
 I can feel you right now just like

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.040
 You're so in the dark because we didn't we haven't talked since yesterday and yesterday was the yeah

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.480
 We haven't we haven't talked since eight hours ago. I know and eight hours ago

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:47.080
 Oh, man, okay, maybe we don't spend that long on this

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.480
 Maybe I can just kind of give you the rundown and then like if there's something good that comes out of it

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.600
 And we can hit on it, but at least I've acknowledged it

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.840
 Yeah, basically, I just I hid from my wife

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.440
 I've just haven't been myself in some ways and like things that I was holding on to since like college

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.800
 Yeah, I mean, I've okay

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.580
 I played a video game in college that I failed out of college over and then hid that game from her subsequently a

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.600
 Few times in our marriage

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.000
 This last time it's just whenever I get really stressed basically when there's like a lot of stress in my life

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.640
 I fall back to this thing and it's not a thing. I felt I could share with her

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.520
 And it was just rough it was like harder a lot

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:33.680
 in the process we've learned a lot about each other I think in some ways we've grown closer through all of it and

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.040
 Yeah, I'm really optimistic now. So I was really optimistic a week ago

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.240
 And then we almost got divorced yesterday, but I'm really optimistic now. So I think things are better

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.360
 We want to work through it. We want to work. We want to do the work

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:56.080
 We've got therapists. We've got all the things the resources we need to figure out why we had these barriers between us

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.080
 And I think we're gonna make it

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.240
 We want to work through it and we want to be together while we work through it. So we're not even really separated now

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.920
 That's the progress

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.920
 We're back together and I think we're on the right track. Okay, that's all anyway. How you been?

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.160
 It's just like I I was prepared for this to be like a really long thing that we talked about

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.360
 I think you just I think halfway through you're like, you know what we can just make this this really quick

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.480
 Yeah, cuz I think I realized like the value is in like acknowledging it and not just like pretending for the rest of the podcast that

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.000
 Yeah, you know, so that's like what I don't need to go through the whole story

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 You guys don't need to hear about when I was 16 and like we don't have to go back to the beginning. It's fine like

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:50.480
 No, I mean, you don't have to talk about that, but I will say people love hearing that shit. So really like you mean like struggles things that

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.840
 Define you or what what shit is it that you speak of it?

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.780
 So it's also weird when I say a curse word because it just comes out in my mouth. So I'm naturally

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:12.620
 Well, I'm saying I think oftentimes you feel like I'm talking about me

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.400
 A lot and this is like so unrelatable. This is just something like so specific to me

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.380
 But like let's be honest. There's a reason that the most watched TV is in the reality TV category

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.760
 Good point. Yeah, people in their core love hearing about

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.840
 Stuff. Yeah, that is personal of people's lives

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.640
 So you don't have to talk about any of it like I think if I were you even how much you just talked about

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.600
 I think I would I would struggle to mm-hmm. I do think it's a right call

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.240
 I think what you said makes sense because like yeah, it would be weird to get on here and

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.640
 Pretend like everything's normal. Yeah. Yeah. This is kind of something we've been talking about for the past week

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.520
 But yeah

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.920
 My only thing is I mean I said to you over and over I

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.640
 Feel like

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.960
 And you've heard this from me in enough times when I'm just saying this for our audience

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.960
 You are someone that really looks to blame yourself a lot even in really small cases

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.520
 And I think in when there's complicated situations where

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:21.920
 It's something you did but it's very complicated because this was all reflexive thing where like it was because something else

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.920
 But that was because something else

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.000
 I think you your natural tendency tend to be to like

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.440
 solely reduce it to like the one action that you did when it's yeah a lot more complex

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.040
 So anyway, even there's a way you describe the situation. I remember people listening

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:44.920
 It sounds like the equivalent of everything was great and I cheated on my wife. You know, I like it's it's like not

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:51.000
 It's been a it's a very complicated situation like people can imagine

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.760
 Yeah, yeah, and I think some of the things you've said to me and then I had coffee with my brother this morning

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.760
 I think all of the inputs I've gotten helped triangulate some thoughts and

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.760
 It's some of what you're speaking to like the big problem between me and Casey

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.760
 It does feel weird to do this on a podcast. I guess like this is so I don't know

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:17.080
 This is like you're getting a real inside baseball. You're getting stuff that I mean Casey. You're probably Casey's gonna listen to this

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.400
 I'm sure I hope I didn't misrepresent anything that we're talking about here

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.960
 And she's open to me talking about this on the podcast by the way

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:30.000
 I guess like one of the things that I feel like broke today in our conversation that kind of like broke in the right way like

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.560
 toward the right

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:38.400
 Thing is related to some of the feedback you've given me that just realizing how much of my last decade with Casey since we've had kids

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.720
 And things got stressful

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:46.080
 Has been spent like I've been twisting myself internally into this pretzel trying to just make her happy

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.600
 But in like superficial ways like ways that I think are just like the low-hanging fruit ways to make her happy

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.880
 Like I've done so much to try and like

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.800
 Just be it's the hero. I mean, it's I have this hero complex the hero role or whatever hero child

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:10.000
 I don't know if anyone digs into psychology or has had someone tell them they have this. Well, we have it together

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.200
 We are the hero children

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:18.320
 Basically just like have to put all things together and make it look really good and feel really good for everybody on the surface level

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:24.320
 I've just I've had that and it drives so many of my decisions with Casey and it to the point of being unhappy and

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.360
 Not even really being self-aware enough to know how unhappy I was some of that stuff. Yeah, it's the blaming myself

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.280
 it's it's all of it it's all very related and

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:40.100
 Yeah, I mean it wouldn't work we both acknowledge this marriage doesn't make sense if we can't fix those things

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:45.680
 So it's still a long road of becoming these new people that we need to be to have a healthy relationship

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.160
 We kind of both agree that just what we've had is no good

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.980
 We don't want I mean there was good. No good is the wrong term because there literally was a lot of good

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.120
 We got two amazing little boys

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.880
 There's a lot plenty of good

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.080
 But we want to start over we want like

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.160
 To just forget everything all of the trauma and the pain and the things that we've created

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:16.000
 We got to start on a new foundation. So anyway, that's that's me and my life and the crumbling walls around me

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:24.120
 I just made that a song. It's not a song. I don't know. I was uncomfortable. Okay, so I start singing about this art

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.120
 You better start like an email band

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.920
 Yeah, that makes sense that you guys want to go for like a reset. Let's try creating something new. Yeah

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:38.760
 Are you guys gonna try doing something really drastic just to get like some superficially drastic just to get out of?

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:44.080
 You know certain habits and stuff and you consider that like getting a dog or something. What do you mean like?

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.520
 I mean kind of yeah, because it's like it's just like with any habit

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.400
 It's if you're in like the same type of environment, even though the habit is not related to environment

00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:03.600
 It's like easy to fall back into it. Yeah, how our brains were this is what we thought a week ago when this all went down

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.560
 We thought okay, we need to separate we need to start

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:14.560
 New habits and like that separation will help us break out of the current cycle. We did some things

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.560
 I mean, I've been sleeping in the basement

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:25.560
 Among other things. We changed up our schedule. We created like a more strict schedule that gives us both the time that we just didn't have

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.040
 Because we sort of like both I think we both just kind of like we're the martyr and like

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.920
 Trying to sacrifice ourselves to just make sure the other one was getting what they need

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.200
 But like we're both unhappy and we both feel like we never have time on the schedule. That's like our time

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:45.440
 So we kind of like created that we did some things anyway. We did some things and now I I feel like we've

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.680
 We've decided the separation

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.880
 Is it wasn't helping because it was already like we were falling back into the same patterns anyway, so we're kind of like

00:13:53.880 --> 00:14:01.440
 Effit let's just actually be together while we figure this out because I don't think what we did was helping now a therapist

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.720
 Might tell us you need to do xyz and we'd be very open to that

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:12.840
 I think we just both now after a week and how much up and down pain there's been we just want to figure out how we can do it

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.280
 But also be together

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.840
 Because we feel like we need we need something we need that from each other I guess

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:26.600
 I'm probably misrepresenting all this. I'm so sorry Casey. That was right terrible. I don't know. I didn't said the wrong thing

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:31.120
 One thing that's stuck in my head look you're doing the thing. You're doing the thing you just said

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.960
 What one thing let me just say one thing about that the thing you just did it's funny cuz uh

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.040
 It's this weird thing where

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.760
 So you were like concerned that you do the wrong thing and you accept the other person

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.760
 Yeah, and it seems like that is a situation that's bad for you and good for the other person because you're like

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.200
 Being really careful and the end other person gets a benefit

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:02.320
 But in reality no one actually wants to be in that position where someone yeah needs to like check in with them

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.280
 yeah, everything right, so I think I've noticed with like with uh

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.240
 situations where it feels like the power dynamic is off everyone imagines like

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:16.800
 The person getting the upside is actually really happy, but like they're actually like nobody's actually happy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think uh

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:23.440
 That's when I said like superficially making her happy. I know I'm not genuinely like creating real happiness

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.080
 It's or joy or anything. It's like just creating a

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:33.960
 Comfort for today like let's just feel comfortable in this moment. So yeah, I'm I recognize that's I got to get rid of that

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.960
 but the one thing I am do like

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.560
 The thing I'm hanging on to in my mind just today

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.880
 so

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.800
 Not creating a bunch of different life habits to try and shake up the brain

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.480
 But I'm just thinking like I'm very hung up. They're very like

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.920
 Concentrated on the idea of like one day at a time. That's so cliche, but I literally need to like

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.320
 Have a constant check-in

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:03.480
 With Casey right now to just make sure we don't slip into patterns

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:09.260
 so one thing that's changed dramatically just today is I do feel like I can tell her everything and I have

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.680
 Started telling her everything that I felt like I had to hide before

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.840
 something has flipped for me that like I

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.640
 am gonna be myself

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.740
 100% and if that means she doesn't want to be with me then that's better than

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.880
 This life we've built over 15 years where I'm I'm just gonna hide the things that I think she doesn't want and try and be the thing

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.600
 She she does want like that is gone. I will not do that anymore

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.560
 And I think that's the main place. It shows up is with Casey like I don't want to do that with anybody

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.520
 I don't want to feel like I'm pretending to be something

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:48.800
 With anybody, but yeah, it's like repulsive to me like the the feeling of like hiding

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.680
 Makes me kind of want to vomit so like at this point moving forward if

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:59.520
 I'm someone who plays video games or not if I played that specific video game or not

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:06.880
 She's gonna know and everyone's gonna know and it's gonna be healthy and I'm not gonna be in in the shadows

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.520
 Feeling like I can't just be myself with my own wife. Anyway, that that much has changed

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.320
 I know today something flipped. Yeah, I know that that makes a lot of sense

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:21.360
 And it might be this weird counterintuitive thing where if it turns out that half the time you're doing stuff that she disagrees with

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:27.280
 She might still like you a lot more overall. Oh, yeah, at least it's not this this weird thing, right?

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.040
 Yeah, it's gonna feel it's every interaction still feels hard

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:35.600
 To not think about what she how she perceives me because that's been ingrained over a long period of time

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.480
 But yeah, I've got a I've got to get past that I've got to be able to make decisions without

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.200
 Fear of how she views it if I think it's a good decision to make or it's a stupid decision

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.480
 And I make a mistake, but like I can live with that

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:55.100
 Knowing at least I was honest. Yeah, like you can do it and then and then she has a right to like find it annoying

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.040
 Yeah, exactly like that. That's what that's all okay. Yeah healthy

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:05.080
 Yeah, anyway, can you tell me your embarrassing thing? I need some I need some light. Okay, you ready for this?

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.600
 Yeah, oh, man. I'm trying not actually I really want to kind of like guess but I'll never guess so it's okay

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.600
 just go ahead on

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.680
 Tuesday I deleted our primary database

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.120
 Whoa

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:24.800
 Dax mr. Senior dev have you tweeted about this yet? No because I'm waiting to figure some stuff

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.200
 I'll explain why I am gonna post about it, but you're still trying to figure out how you're gonna

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:42.000
 Tuesday nights or it was Wednesday night. I forgot what wait what there was the election was Tuesday night

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.480
 It's always on Tuesday. We're doing just learn that I've voted like a hundred times. Sorry

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.920
 I

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.800
 Was watching the election and I'm like, okay at midnight

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.440
 I'm gonna do this big console deployment that we've been working on for a couple weeks

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:01.000
 And I did it all in dev and it went great

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.280
 And I went to do it in production and I was like halfway through it and then all of a sudden I was like

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.520
 Why is my SSC deployment error and saying 404 database not found?

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:17.400
 And then I go log into plant scale and it's an empty account and I'm like

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.560
 Wow, that is really bad

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:28.080
 What happened so in the moment I didn't realize I didn't understand what happened

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.440
 I was like I must have messed up our infrastructures code somehow

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:38.560
 And like removed the database and then done deploying. Yeah, and then so like deleted the database

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:44.480
 So I I was like I'm not gonna try to figure out what happened. I'm just I need to get this fix

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:49.080
 So I ended up texting Sam who's a he's been on our podcast to see a plant scale

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:56.160
 It was embarrassing cuz I'm like, you know, I do like freaking deleted like I deleted our database like all of it is

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.920
 And then I did he replies. Okay, like you asked me a few questions and he goes

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.680
 You're so lucky that our CTO is at my house right now

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.680
 They happen to be like hanging out together

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:14.320
 Wow, and the CTO found it look at this service the found the EBS volume that

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.760
 You know obviously when you delete something they don't like immediately like everything

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.580
 But I was worried that they probably have some

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.160
 Process that runs at some point where it is clean. Yeah

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.680
 Yeah, so he did he found the EBS volume and has marked it as

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.600
 Like to not delete or whatever is making sure that it wouldn't get deleted

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.400
 While the support team

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.480
 The support team could eventually restore it. Yeah, so I was waiting on the support team

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:46.400
 And it was like this at this point. It was like 1 a.m. My time. Oh and I stayed up to like 230 waiting

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:53.360
 And then I was I see a sleep cuz I'm not it's like no point in just me waiting and I woke up and the database was back

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.600
 And like it turned out like of course 10 minutes after I went to sleep

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.600
 They like they did the restore and then and I got everything back and at that point

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:08.160
 I could like investigate what the issue was and I still haven't fully gotten down to it

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.160
 But this is actually was a bug

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:15.120
 either in I haven't found figure out where the source of the bug is it's either in

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.960
 Pulumi or it's in the tower from provider for plant scale

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.920
 eek, you know how you can you can import resources. Yeah into

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:30.560
 Existing read so we this plan scale database. We had was before STV 3 so it was manually created

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.720
 Mm-hmm. So I wrote in my in my in my seeking fake to import it

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.800
 There's just a really weird quirk that seems to just happen with the plan scale database because I've tested this with other resources

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:47.320
 If it's flagged as being this is an imported resource and you do it deploy multiple times for removing

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.600
 The line that makes it import

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.720
 It was creating another entry

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.400
 For that import so it'll import in the database multiple times

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.440
 And then when the deploy would finish it would clean up the old one

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.640
 But it's like two entries for the same database. So it's like oh, I got the new one

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.520
 Let me delete the old one but old ones point to the same database as well. Oh

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:12.240
 So the mistakes I made on my end are

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:19.920
 Anything important you should flag as retained on delete. I was gonna say is so even if there's that

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.480
 To kind of safeguard that I guess that works with imports too. Not just new resources

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.760
 Yeah, yeah, so if I had set that flat if I remember to set that flag sounds like this is an important like I never want

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.400
 It being deleted and automated way like you need to flag this is retained on delete. I did not do that

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.760
 Yeah, the second thing is the API key I generate for plan scale

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:44.160
 I had initially generated a really granular one and some point during the process

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:49.040
 Like while I was working on it. I like lost the key so I had to regenerate it and I was being lazy a second time

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.040
 So I just made it a key that could do everything

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.920
 Uh, but there's no reason for this key to have the ability to delete it. It is. It's never needed. Yeah

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.720
 Uh, so I updated it data that now so

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:04.000
 With those two changes like it's like impossible. Yeah thing to be deleted anyway

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.280
 Uh, so we actually made an update to so we actually have a list internally in sst

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:16.080
 Of any resources that we think are popular that this can happen to so we automatically mark the metro chain on delete

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.600
 So we added a plan to scale database do that and those would be an ever-growing list of

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.720
 uh resources that we just

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:30.000
 It's probably good even if the person forgets to treat you guys are trying to delete. That's a better default. Yeah, and

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.480
 The better default. Yeah, exactly. So

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.960
 Uh, I have to still look up to see why this happened because I've tried with other resources

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.720
 And you can import the same resources multiple times and it just overwrites the existing one

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.760
 It doesn't like create a new one try to remove the previous one

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:49.360
 Um, but yeah, it was uh, it was bad. Yeah, something like this whenever something like this happens

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.360
 There's always multiple things like multiple failure points that had to go wrong

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.400
 You know what I mean? Like yeah, it's like so many little things

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:03.120
 I mean you just call that too that and then I don't know surely like the order you did things or whatever the deploys

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.360
 It's always like just the perfect storm and it happens even the dax

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.000
 Even dax to lease the prod db

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:17.440
 Yeah, was this this was for like the sse console. Yeah. Yeah, so it's not it's like it's data that like it's not recoverable anywhere else

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.240
 Yeah, here's another interesting dynamic that um

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:26.640
 I don't think this is going to change my opinion or make me actually do anything different, but it is something I considered where

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:32.640
 Managed services are really good because somebody else will deal with problems

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.360
 but

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:40.720
 If this had happened on AWS where I have more direct access to stuff. It's like in my control to

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:47.200
 Exit immediately because like I have you would have been the one flagging the ebs volume. Yeah, and uh, like, you know

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.120
 AWS would have had the

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.920
 It's snapshots on delete anyway, so it was just enough to meet a restore from from the snapshot. Yep

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.600
 Whereas now I have to wait on a support team that said we're not paying for any

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.120
 Higher tier, uh, if we were probably paying for a higher tier

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:07.120
 We probably would have gotten like more immediate support. We already got more support than we should have a plant skill

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:12.160
 Yeah, I was gonna say I think texting the ceo and the cto being in this house. That's pretty good support

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:18.080
 It's probably a typical. Yeah, exactly like we we we we shouldn't have even gotten that given

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.480
 What what we're paying. Yeah, but like I think we were looking to see what

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:27.440
 Because we were kind of surprised like how come they even had someone up at three a.m to do this. Yeah, no kidding

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.920
 But I guess it's because they're really enterprise the their actual customers and ones

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:39.120
 You know paid them real money. Yeah, um, I think they literally have like five minute response

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:44.880
 That's a laser or something like that. So I think I think they have so they've got a 24/7 staff. I guess yeah

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.160
 And I think uh

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.680
 We got a little special treatment because I'm I'm think one of the staff that was

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.320
 They're like meant to serve those use cases. Yeah ended up responding day to day

00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:00.560
 So super appreciative really stupid on our end. We'll try to pay it back by like really figuring out what the root cause was and

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.400
 And uh making sure that this isn't happening to other people

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.320
 Thanks, sam

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.400
 Uh, let's give a little a little free promo, you know, if you're looking for a database service

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.400
 And you're tired of dealing with backups and all these things

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.320
 Choose planet scale if you're not tired of that if you just use need the database at all

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.640
 Yeah, like just your first choice

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.200
 And if it doesn't work for you, then you can consider other stuff

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.320
 It's kind of my

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.840
 I go there first and if I can't use it for whatever reason don't use something else

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:33.360
 But uh, it's it's not good my opinion. Dax's Dax's default. You just need to get the stamp already

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.680
 We need a Dax's stamp that you can just plaster on everybody's github repost

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.880
 So be so easy. It's low hanging fruit Dax. It's like a low hanging idea

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.760
 You just literally need a visual like a stamp that people can like AI generated stamp

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.760
 It is. Oh, yeah, I generate even better. Yeah, but it just needs to be something they can put a little link in their read man

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.440
 It's like Dax approved Dax approves. I think it's got that's got legs. Just give it a shot

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.480
 People would get so pissed at that

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.400
 Yeah

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.120
 You put your stamp on this thing and I hate this thing

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.120
 I like that thing instead. Yeah

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:18.880
 It would be a lot of that. What else has been going on? I missed everything the last two weeks. We posted that video

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.520
 I saw the video today. Oh, you posted it because I saw it before it was posted. That's right people

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.360
 Yeah, I got the inside scoop

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.640
 All I had to do was lose everything in my life and hit rock bottom and Dax was like this will cheer you up

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:36.880
 So if you could do that if you could just lose everything Dax might give you a little little preview of the video

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.000
 Did you hear me you're looking at me funny or is there a huge delay?

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.120
 No, no, no, I'm just laughing because I'm like, I think I would have given you the preview. Yeah, you were gonna give it to me anyway

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:50.720
 Yeah, here's what happens. I always finish editing a video and I'm so excited. I just need to show people and I'm like

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:57.840
 I can't send you a time it very specifically when we release something. Yeah, so I'm always in misery for like 12 hours

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:05.440
 This morning like Adam could you stop having a crisis so I can send you this video? Please. This is not a good moment, but I need to send

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.440
 Yeah, literally this this morning. I was like jay. I want to post a video

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.880
 Like I know you want this blog post you're writing, but like let me know when it's done

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.840
 And I've got so impatient. I was like fuck it. I'm just posting it. Give me the blog post. I posted later

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.360
 Oh, it's yeah, but I so I made that video

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.880
 It took me exactly one day. I started yesterday

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.240
 probably around like

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.360
 planned it

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.160
 Uh, and then I showered and shaved my head so I could look okay

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.080
 And then I filmed from like noon to I finished editing around

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.040
 like 10 p.m

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.480
 It was a one day effort

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:48.240
 That was my first time filming entirely on an iphone. That was my only really into this idea

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.400
 You're really into the iphone cinematography thing. Yeah, because because it's like

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.120
 just the the floor

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.600
 of it is um

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.520
 Sorry i'm just saying i'm just texting me

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.800
 But it's not related. We're just talking about he goes

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:12.400
 I did not wake up this morning expecting to see your nips every day is an adventure

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.280
 Yeah, there's a little bit of shirtless facts in this video

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:24.240
 I mean you're wearing shirts. It's a thank you for uh for the great support you guys give us

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.600
 Oh, that's funny

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.960
 Um, but yeah, so I am really into this iphone thing

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.720
 Um, so I bought like it goes back before before this video

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.800
 I mean like you've been showing me like you're rig and all this like you've kind of got this set up

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.280
 And I get it. I'm excited about not having big hunky cameras. Yeah, we go ahead

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.640
 Yeah, and so this is the first thing that I actually try to do with it

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:52.800
 So I bought uh this rig that you've like slot your iphone into and it has like nice handles

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.040
 I mean we talked about it's already in the podcast last time. All right

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.040
 This is the first thing that I uh

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:03.200
 Filmed with it and it was such a great experience. Like it's just so versatile that it's like so much less cumbersome

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.000
 And

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.040
 When you need to like rework stuff because something doesn't go according to plan

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.560
 It's it's pretty easy

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:14.320
 And the video quality is is pretty good. It's great. Yeah, like I'm looking at still frames of it right now

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.960
 Yeah, like it's uh, it looks very good. I just dropped in the standard lot that apple

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.320
 um

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.360
 gives you

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.520
 Which uh, you know, they you

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.840
 I probably should have tweaked it. It's like a little oversaturated

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.240
 But you know, it's it's pretty good for what it's good even the lowlight like the outdoor scene

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.080
 Also, shout out liz. I can see you in the reflection of the the door

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.640
 Uh, good work on the camera work

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.480
 I mean, I should have known it wasn't zuko like of course it was

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:48.800
 Yeah, um, were you at all afraid you were going to drop the we ever afraid you were going to drop the laptop or did you drop the

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:53.280
 It's funny because there's there's so many people replying be like, oh, what a wealth flex like

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.840
 You know, he's so rich. They can just spin this and not give a shit. It's actually not a wealth flex

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.440
 It's actually a deep confidence in myself. Oh, yeah, that's what i'm flexing right there

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.400
 Okay, I had no doubt that I wasn't gonna drop it. It was on hard

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.640
 Tile floor and I spun it a bunch of times throughout the day and I didn't drop a one

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.000
 I wondered if you how much you practice high confidence. Yeah, really high confidence

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.840
 Okay, just just for my ultimate days, you know spending it for my mind on my finger

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:21.440
 I've got a still frame of it right now and it looks like the the laptop looks fake because it's like in motion

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:26.400
 And it I don't know. It's just the way it's balancing on your face. It looks like it's floating above your hand like levitating

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.480
 And it's glowing. It's just it's very funny. I'm gonna I'm gonna send you this frame. It's

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:35.440
 It's funny. That sounds really cool. Yeah, the other thing was I did not use any external mics

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.840
 I just use the on board iphone mics the iphone 16 has three microphones on it now

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.800
 uh, and it does

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.520
 A pretty good job. So that's like my mind like that the audio is just from the phone mic

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.400
 Like when you're sitting in that chair

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:56.480
 It's picking up well enough just over the phone mic. Yeah, and remember how noisy my backyard is the highways right there

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:03.360
 And it was pretty windy too. So that plus like a tiny bit of processing during editing. Yeah, it's uh

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.680
 Yeah, it's clearly none of it is as good as a pro setup, but

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:15.760
 It's so close that that cumbersome trade-off is just like you're just gonna produce better stuff because you it's more flexible. Yeah

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:21.760
 I'm pretty excited. We're gonna use this in in New York. Nice at our mystery. I mean, it's still a mystery, right?

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.560
 People don't know what we're doing yet. Yeah. Nice. Are you still going?

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.280
 Uh, it's a roller coaster. TBD. Yeah, still day by day

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:35.760
 Trying to figure out what life looks like the only thing is it can't really be day by day for this because like we need to figure out

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.400
 The solution if you can go. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that only occurred to me this morning

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.800
 I was like before I was like, yeah, it's fine. You can figure it out. But it's like, okay, that that's just the one thing that okay

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.680
 I will let you know is a little critical one of these day by day

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:51.600
 It's not a big deal either way. We just need to know what we need to buy on our end. Okay. Um

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.400
 Which we can do uh

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.000
 Yeah, okay. We'll we'll we'll talk we'll we'll talk through that

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.120
 Uh

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:04.880
 Yeah, I would love to hang out. I mean, I would love to be with you guys for a bit that that sounds very refreshing

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.880
 Given all the current events. Yeah, just some hangout time

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.200
 And obviously I'm excited about the event and what we're doing. It's very exciting

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.040
 Oh, did you say I found 16? Yeah, I think I have a 15. There's a new one

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:22.240
 When did that? Yeah, I don't have a 16 just because of the mic thing and I gave Liz my 15

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.360
 So three mics, huh? When did they come out? Is this like recent?

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:30.080
 I used it for a couple months now. I used to switch cars. Was that new? I think

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.440
 It was new when you got it like it just came out. Yeah, yeah

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.520
 I came out two months ago

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:42.000
 I used to like watch all the Apple events and WWDC and like all this stuff and know exactly when every new device was coming out

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.280
 And now I've gone years and I don't even know half the time. What number my phone is but I do remember recently

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.960
 Uh, I broke my phone and had to take it to the place and it was a 15

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:58.640
 Yeah, nice. Nice. Great story. Great story. Well, there's more to the story, but I'm not going to share it for the sake of others

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:04.800
 It actually could be a pretty good story, but sometimes you sacrifice the content for the people, you know

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.880
 I'm thinking about that goose meme

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.240
 Do you know the goose meme that with a goose is like chasing the guy asking him a question

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:17.280
 What? No, is it the afflac goose? That's like a commercial. That's a goose, right?

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.640
 Is it a duck? It's it's this one. It's just me and I found it

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:24.400
 I feel like you're just trying to have like commercials and calling it a meme. That's what I my guess

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.640
 No, there's everything about that sentence

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:33.680
 Does he say afflac because that's the afflac duck or goose or whatever. This is a this is a goose or is a duck

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.000
 What did you send me? Let's say I just sent you. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've seen this. It's in the jacket

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.080
 It's in the jacket

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.400
 Except he's asking how'd your phone break? How'd your phone break?

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.800
 That's what everyone wants to know right now

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:53.120
 Did I did I make it did I make it clear that that was the interesting part of the story how my phone broke?

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.880
 Did I make that clear? I don't know. It's clear now. How'd your phone break? Anyway, let's move on

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.720
 That's funny. I don't get I don't get what's in the jacket if i'm being honest

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.760
 Like I don't get this specific version of the man

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:10.320
 No, people replace that with something that's wrong. Yeah, I get that

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.480
 I get that this is like the meme template, but whoever made this one the what's in the jacket

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.400
 I don't get it because I think it's a goose down jacket. Is that why oh that confirms? It's a goose. Oh, I see

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.200
 Is that what it is? Maybe that makes sense. They can talk calm interesting

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:32.240
 Okay, what else is going on? Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Oh, we have a new president or an old president. Oh, that's true

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.400
 We have a I mean president elect the uh the politics happened

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.040
 Do we want to touch this with a 10 foot pole or do we want to just skate on by?

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.760
 I want to talk about a little bit about the uh about germos tweet. Let's do it. Oh, I saw this

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.680
 And i'm like the most disconnected i've ever been and I even saw this

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.480
 Yeah, I gotta say I don't get it

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.080
 I don't get why people freaked out about someone congratulating the new president

00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:00.720
 Like I feel like that's a thing people do every single time there's a new president and like people

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:06.160
 Who like everyone respects like if obama does it everybody's like cool. I love that guy

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.480
 But why did people freak out the germos did it? I don't understand it. I get it if you don't like next to s

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.080
 You the caching policy is driving crazy, but like really I don't understand it

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.360
 I don't get

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.200
 So I I have a I have a grand explanation for all of this

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.840
 I was just going to get real spicy and say it's just childish

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.240
 Like you just look like a child on the internet if you're like shame on you like what what are you talking about?

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:32.400
 You just like it's a just I don't get it. I'm not a trump supporter

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:39.280
 But I don't get like you said the name trump. What a loser like what is that attitude? I just don't understand it

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.120
 So to me, this is a very

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.400
 That situation. So here's my like psychological analysis of everything that happened. Yeah, so germot tweeted

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:52.000
 Congratulations Donald trump and then he posted it's crazy to see the impact of

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.800
 X and just give us a bunch of things that he was like it's crazy that this stuff had an impact on it

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.480
 The reason he did that is because he's trying to fit in with like the silicon valley

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:06.320
 like very serious CEO crowd because if you look at it all the

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:13.680
 Billion dollars, you know company public company CEOs are posting that so his message wasn't deeply insightful

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.680
 It would just kind of like this vague

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.000
 like, you know

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.680
 mimicry of

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:25.120
 Okay, yeah, so in a way, it's a little sad because it's like he was just trying to fit in with this group

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.280
 Yeah, and then the people reading it

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.320
 Reddit as

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:36.160
 An extremely strong endorsement of certain things that they don't agree with and they found that very disappointing

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:42.000
 Uh, and everyone's really pissed at him. But the reason I find it says because like he wasn't doing that guys

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.840
 He was just like trying to like fit in with his

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.120
 He wants to fit in with and then everyone's really pissed at it

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:52.000
 Yeah, I mean on one hand I get it like it's like the timing of it was insane

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:58.320
 Especially to an audience that is like leans sure pretty much in in one direction

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.840
 So you actually think like the response the people getting upset about it that like they they have valid criticism

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:07.200
 I don't know if I would call it valid. I think I understand it

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.440
 I obviously don't have that reaction at all anywhere remotely to that reaction

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.120
 I think you know

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.880
 Everyone has different levels of emotions at the end of the day and I get how

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:22.320
 literally, you know in the in the like within 12 hours of the event

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.720
 Probably people, you know

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.760
 thought in a much more extreme way than it was intended

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.840
 Um, and they disagree. They finally disagree and I think that it's

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:34.480
 They they don't feel aligned with

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.440
 This company in the tool and I get that and you're totally allowed to feel that way and to like, you know

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.320
 I don't agree with this thing where people are like you should not boycott people over politics

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:50.160
 Yeah, I wouldn't I personally wouldn't but I think people should be allowed to do that

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.720
 Yeah, and just like it's it's it's it's fine. It's just to me. It was just like a

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.040
 funny dynamic

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.320
 because of

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.800
 Wasn't intentional. It was like treated as a good heavy endorsement, but it wasn't that's I guess that's my thing

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.520
 It's like I guess it's just this formality in my mind

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.200
 that people

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.280
 Congratially the incoming president not like

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.920
 I didn't read it as Guillermo like endorsing or saying I think

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.040
 I am on board with everything this person stands for

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.000
 It was just like one of I think the fitting in thing makes perfect sense because it just felt like I kind of tweet

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.040
 You see from like Tim Cook like congratulations. It was Mr. President. Oh, was it really?

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.480
 Yeah, that's exactly how I viewed it and then for people to like

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:36.080
 It just feels a little virtue signaling when people are like shame on you and I don't know

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.000
 It's probably some of my friends. So I'm sorry if if there happens to be a venn diagram

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.840
 Of people that listen to this show that are my friend that also tweeted in response to top g

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.840
 I'm sorry. I don't dislike you or I'm not

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:54.000
 I don't know. I'm just walking back on my spicy. Just forget all the spicy. I said

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.920
 You're fine. It's fine. I just don't I don't really get the uh

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.960
 I don't know. I'm gonna flame somebody because they said congratulations president Trump

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.040
 It's it's funny because it's technically virtue ceiling on the other side too because

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.520
 Why is Tim Cook and

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.160
 Anthony Nadella like why are they doing this is because they are

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:19.440
 Enormous companies that face heavy regulation burden and then they need to cozy up to whoever the current administration is

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.640
 Yeah, and you know dermos like yeah us too. We're also like that. Yeah

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.920
 That's important

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.680
 Come on trump. So yeah, look out for versatile. They need your help

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:36.080
 Yeah, it's just it's just a funny situation

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.520
 Um

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.120
 Yeah, I think it upset a lot of people and I'm sure the employees within and I thought to a few people that are

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.040
 That work inside for sale that you know didn't didn't like that

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.960
 And I think if I want to make the case for people that are upset with it. It's that

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:54.720
 Generally, this is fine. No matter who wins an election. Like there's two candidates. You agree with one screw the other

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.160
 It's fine. It's a democracy. It's the outcome of election. Um

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:06.880
 And you you know everything you're saying makes sense. I think the way people feel is this candidate is so outside the bounds of what's acceptable

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.880
 that

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.600
 anyone treating it like a normal situation is

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.160
 implicitly saying that

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.760
 This is I'm like normalizing this candidate as a normal person

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.760
 But you know people believe that this is

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:25.520
 So outside the range of anything normal. We shouldn't do anything that my potentially normalize. Yeah, this type of behavior

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:31.280
 I get it. I get it. I see that argument. Yeah, sure. Definitely outside normal. Yeah, I also feel like

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.160
 It's not getting any better over the next 20 years. Like I just feel like

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:41.040
 Normal that ship sailed a long time ago like our our political sphere

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.000
 Is so far from normal at this point

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.560
 I mean, I think like that like the democrats are just gonna keep losing because they're trying to play like normal games and

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.040
 At some point they got them the lesson though. And it's not just a normal thing for me. So

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.160
 Jay posted a bunch about this

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.480
 They didn't just lose

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:06.400
 It was like a colossal flat in the face, right? Yeah, they did so bad across the board everywhere senate

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.880
 uh house representatives

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:16.160
 Compare every single county to how biden performed and biden was like such a nothing candidate to be in with

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.560
 It was like it's just like

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:23.920
 They've had so many moments where they should have like been like we need to pivot drastically

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.680
 Because we're like failing in places. We should not be failing at all

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.880
 Yeah, and you kind of wonder like at what point do they realize like

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.440
 We got stuff fucking around and like

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.760
 Just go for the win. Yeah

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:39.040
 And do what we need to go for the win and what they need to do for that

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.760
 Has been kind of obvious for a very long time. So yeah, I just don't know why it doesn't happen

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.600
 Well, now I now I feel like you need to say it because I mean, I was probably not obvious to me

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.600
 I'm pretty simple on this front

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.880
 I think a few things that they do wrong is

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:58.080
 Every every politician when they were campaign they're supposed to do some very basic things

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:04.160
 Make very concrete promises so that the average person can understand what they're getting when they like to

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:09.440
 You know, most of times these are like effectively lies or they don't happen. Sure. That's like the thing

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.280
 When I say

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.080
 Trump

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:17.520
 You know that you get border. You get tax cuts. You get like sure these like

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:22.320
 Any average person can probably tell you what they are. Yeah, if I say, you know, the other candidate

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.360
 What what what is their thing?

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.600
 Yeah, what are you getting with that? Sure. Nobody knows

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:33.280
 Do you just not not do not know how to pronounce camel because I don't either come letters call us. I don't know. That's the one

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.200
 Not only is she have indian she's actually from the exact same part of it

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:42.400
 I know I didn't know that you had this tie until like the day of the election. That's so cool

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:48.320
 Yeah, I mean it sucks to lose, but it's so cool that you have that title to a losing politician

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.800
 I don't I don't like her and I don't think she's a good candidate. So it's fine

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.920
 My problem with the loss

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.320
 My problem with the democrats is way more like

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:05.040
 Grugbane, you're probably on the like the hoodie guy and i'm on the far left of the grug meme or whatever the bell curve

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.440
 Uh mine is just like

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.440
 They're going against a party. That's like

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:14.640
 It's like a religion for them. I mean it in some cases it literally is a religion for them

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.680
 But like they're so passionate about their candidate

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:23.840
 It's like they would die for their candidate and then on the democrats side. They're just like well, uh guys

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.360
 uh

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:30.560
 like here's logic and reason and why we should do this this way and it's like there's no passion there's no like

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:37.280
 Just like being fired up about it. And that's kind of what i'm saying like there's well like that is true, but

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:41.680
 I don't think the reason they lost was because

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:46.720
 The democrats failed to win over really passionate people

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.120
 What happened was they just failed to win over

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.840
 They just failed to win over like

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:58.160
 People that don't care that much. Uh, they got the passion of people. They just don't have anybody else

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.640
 Yeah, and trump is always going to have like that side of the passionate equivalent on their side, right?

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.600
 Yeah

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:09.280
 It just felt like people were like, I don't care about the details like here's xyz reasons why i'm happy

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:15.600
 And there's one candidate says he's gonna fix xyz things where I feel like democrats entire thing they keep doing this is

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.080
 All they talk about is how they're not this other person has other person is

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:26.800
 Really bad xyz ways and even though those things are true. It's just not what the average person is looking for. Yeah

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.360
 Uh, so that that's one thing and the second thing is

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:35.120
 Just actually just steal what the republicans talk about and just make that your

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:40.800
 Your own talking points because like they're just basic things that everyone the average person cares about. Yeah

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.000
 I feel the democrats are like really focused on these like really complex

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.840
 like

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:50.480
 Crazy ideas that don't really impact most people like just kind of flush that side of the stuff out of your party

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:56.320
 And just be like kind of boring and be like, we're gonna make you richer. We're gonna make you safer

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.640
 Yeah, you do that. Yeah

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:05.040
 That's like two of those three things. What's the Maslow's like hierarchy or whatever. That's a couple of the big ones, right?

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.520
 Yeah, just do that be boring

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.440
 Be straight forward pick a candidate that like is like a southern

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:17.520
 Governor or something. That's a democrat. There's a few of those that I just can't see you not winning if you do that

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:23.440
 Who was the VP can't it was he he was a governor from somewhere. Was it a southern state or from mesh from Minnesota?

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.800
 Minnesota midwest like you know, he's pretty he's pretty close

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:35.040
 Like I don't know feeling that had one from Georgia or Pennsylvania or is that retro retro respect is that they were considering the one from Pennsylvania?

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:39.840
 Okay. Yeah, they're considering the governor of Pennsylvania. He was like, I guess there's no one state that decided this one

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.840
 They just kind of got swept

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:45.360
 Across across the board. Yeah, like four years ago. It was like Georgia

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.040
 Turns out really important. Was that four years ago? Yeah

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.040
 This time not so much. It was just sort of like yeah, uh, sweep

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.840
 It's like how did you do worse and Biden? That should be like a crazy tough. That's

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.960
 Like a call. That's a big slap in the face for sure

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:07.360
 I don't know how Biden became president. That's kind of wild actually. Maybe that's also revisionist history

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:11.840
 Like maybe he didn't seem so old and decrepit when he ran, but yeah, I'm pretty simple

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.400
 Are you old and decrepit? I'm out. Sorry

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.880
 the other thing is uh

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:22.080
 I think this just got more extreme over time. I think it's going to be very very hard for

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.800
 a candidate to

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:29.600
 Have consecutive terms. I don't know how frequent this has been historically, but I think it's just gonna get harder and harder

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.280
 because

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:36.320
 I just feel it's an overall attention span thing like we try someone new and if it doesn't go well

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:41.920
 We're just like we want the next thing. Yeah, so picking a candidate that's associated with the existing administration

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:45.680
 You're just like screws in the beginning. That was a rough situation all the way around because like

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:49.120
 I remember when the talk was like they could never remove Biden

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.880
 He's never gonna step out like this is just what they're stuck with and then when it did finally shift

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.920
 Yeah, it's like how do you prepare that late in the game? Like

00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.960
 It's kind of yeah, and like she's stuck being like I can't be like everything

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:04.960
 I disagree with everything Biden did everything different because that's the support but like

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:10.480
 Also, yeah, and like you were there. So you're just you're just kind of saying like I failed to be impactful. Yeah

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:16.640
 Oh, yeah, that's tough. Everyone wants something new everyone wants like a brand new thing. Yeah, so I hear you on the

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:21.520
 consecutive term saying in fact, I think I heard it on like a 538 podcast they talked about the trend

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:26.960
 It's like it's what you said the attention span, but it's also the like distrust and authority

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:31.280
 It's like basically every incumbent government everyone's like not you're not it

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.880
 Like we don't trust you and you had a chance and you failed. Yeah

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:40.400
 So I think given those things you just got to bring something fresh every single time and I hope the next time

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.200
 That they put someone up

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:47.440
 They're really trying to go for the win. Like if you're like, I need to win

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.200
 I need to figure out what to do to win. Yeah, you would do almost nothing that they did

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:56.640
 Which they would focus on on winning more for more of them. Yeah, it seems like a good strategy

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:02.480
 I mean really if you're to focus on winning I feel like if you're gonna focus on something you should probably be winning

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.560
 I don't know

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.640
 I just went like 15 seconds without saying anything. That was just for fun

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:15.040
 Yeah, I think like more of a boom busty kind of like I play fantasy football and you have players that like

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.840
 They're gonna get you nine points and it's not gonna be exciting

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.360
 And you're kind of gonna hate that they're on your team

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.520
 But like whatever they're gonna get you your nine points

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.200
 And then there's people that could get you 25 points or they're probably gonna get zero

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:30.480
 Are you saying like when you say go for the win is it like get somebody like that who's kind of polarizing and like a

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:35.120
 A big swing and a miss kind of potential, but could be a home run

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.800
 Yeah, I I guess what I was saying that like picking picking the candidate is one thing

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.400
 But just overall just the attitude does not seem to be like

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.320
 We're gonna do whatever it takes to win like we're gonna figure out the strategy

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.600
 We're gonna do we're gonna we're gonna focus on what people want to hear

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:54.160
 We're gonna like say those things if that changes we're gonna pivot and say the other things that people want to hear

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.480
 Yeah, like it's it's an election. It's not

00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:01.520
 You got to do what you need to do to win the election. Yeah, so then you can do the thing you need to do

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.680
 Yeah in power

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:08.560
 And that's just the way it is like it's maybe doesn't fit some ideal, but it's just the way it is

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.840
 The game doesn't ever be the same in that a song. I think I made that one. Did I make that one up?

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:18.720
 Yeah, no, right. You're right. That is a song. It's like an old old song. I think was it really musical today?

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:23.840
 I know you're singing. Uh, maybe that's my new identity. I'm gonna be a singer. Maybe you're in a good mood

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:29.760
 Maybe it's kind of crazy given. Yeah, the last 24 hours. You know what it feels like you know how it feels like

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.680
 When it comes to sports, let's say like sprinting

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.640
 You know, someone should just be able to like

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:42.480
 Be born a certain way and then like just train generally and then they could just be the best

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:50.080
 Renter ever. Mm-hmm. But the game has gotten advanced even for something as basic as run really fast. Yeah, it's like there's a whole

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:56.320
 Perfect nutrition approach the whole like exact type of training you need to do and each thing gives you like

00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.160
 a point one percentage of advantage and there's just so many of those things where

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:05.440
 If you're not playing the game, you like really just the game has just changed. Yeah, I feel that way about

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:13.120
 Politics too, like it's very advanced now. Yeah, that's a great analogy. Actually, uh, it's like in the 50s

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.360
 You could be a professional football player and you're like smoking cigars at halftime and you're like

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:21.680
 Drinking a can of beer and then you go back out into the first half now. It's like

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:28.080
 Elite elite nutrition everything is perfect to hone those little tiny advantages. That's that's dead on

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:32.480
 Well, even like you look at the olympics that come around every four years like the swimmers

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:37.840
 They all have the like perfect swimmer body like they're proportioned to be an olympic athlete

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.760
 You can't just be born with like long legs and suddenly you're going to be an olympic swimmer

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:47.120
 You have to have the like giant upper body tiny little like dolphin legs. They look like boats

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.120
 Yeah, they literally look like a hole

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.480
 So true

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.440
 Like everything now it's like it gets more and more refined and more competitive and yeah, you're right

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.360
 That's how politics should be like you got to get up

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:01.360
 To that level of challenge if you're the democratic party and you got to say

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.080
 This isn't the 50s anymore. How do we compete at this elite level? That's a great call. Yeah

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:10.880
 Yeah, just just less weakness more strength a lot of people talk about I feel like as a layman

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:15.920
 That doesn't really get into political science a lot of people talk about the democrats being like bad at elections

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:21.120
 But they win sometimes right like I mean biden. Who is it before that? I guess obama

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:27.440
 Obama right before that bill clinton. I don't know. Yeah, like there's been pushing between but yeah

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:32.240
 there's been some democrat democratic wins, but the clinton win was very similar to the

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.960
 The situation right now but in reverse the republicans were messing up

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:40.720
 In a way and then the democrats are like here is a

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.360
 Southern governor

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:47.840
 He kind of had the wider appeal he could appeal to people that were a little more in the middle

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:53.680
 Who's young also like he was pretty oh, yeah, definitely not near the ages that we're listening

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:58.560
 Yeah, what is that about I don't understand the politics thing. Yeah, nine-year-old

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:01.920
 The other thought I had is like we might just be in like a really weird time like

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.440
 There's a lot of people

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:10.560
 From a generation we cannot connect to at all still alive

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:14.400
 And then you like shift forward 10 or 20 years

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:20.000
 And that'll be different that kind of looks the same at that point. There's like not really

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:24.240
 These people that are like they live in a different world effectively

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:28.720
 Just say it boomers. They're boomers. Yeah, they're boomers that we don't have any

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:32.880
 Have I ever said the word boomer before? I don't know. I'm pretty sure we don't have any boomer listeners

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:36.880
 I'm pretty sure. I don't think they listen to podcasts if I'm being honest. What about your mom?

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:41.520
 I don't think she listens. I don't know mom. Do you listen to this? Let me know in the comments

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.320
 Like and subscribe, please

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:48.960
 Uh, I don't I don't actually think my parents listen. No, I don't think boomers know what podcasts are even

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:52.960
 I don't think it's like on their radar. They listen to like serious xm

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:57.520
 They have like satellite radio. They don't listen to podcasts

00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:04.880
 Yeah, like by the time like in 10 or 20 years the oldest people around will maybe be our parents

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.600
 And yeah

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.560
 Like if that right and it's uh at that point

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:15.280
 It's like everyone most people on earth are going to be from this like the internet world

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:22.240
 Uh, and we're never not we definitely don't all agree, but like there's at least there's not like these like there's that commonality

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.320
 Yeah, like I think generally

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:28.000
 People from those will like understand like the modern world where like yeah

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.680
 A lot what you read is not true when you're skeptical of like everything like it's it's uh, that's a great point actually

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.760
 I don't think about how old

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:41.280
 There are there are so many people in their 70s 80s that are voting that like

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:46.000
 We are basically a different species. I mean like we have nothing

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 In common with that generation at this point like they're

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:57.040
 Far removed from our modern society, right? Like is that is that ageist? I don't know if i'm being

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.800
 a horrible

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.240
 I mean, it's just it's just it's just a reality like, you know

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:07.440
 The world changed a lot in a certain time period and you're either on one side of the other side of it

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.880
 Yeah, I don't think about like the gap in ages you got 18 year olds voting and then you got 75 year olds voting

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:20.800
 Kind of weird actually like to think that group of people. Yeah, would all come to like a common

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:25.280
 Solution and for me it's less about the voting and more about the literally being an office thing

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:31.280
 Oh, that that is nuts to me either should be an age limit if we saw this problem of like 75 year old people running for president

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:37.680
 Again in 10 or 20 years that's not that weird compared to

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 it's more of our peers than

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.960
 Or at least like yeah less of a gap. That's an interesting thought experiment

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.800
 Yeah, do you get really dry this time of year? I guess Miami's really wet

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:56.720
 Like do you ever get dry? I got I got a comment on the video already. That was like, I love that Miami's humid because it makes your head look so shiny

00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:03.920
 Looking at the shiny right now. That's funny. I don't I don't good. I don't get dry. Okay. Well, I have to like slather

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:10.080
 Uh, like lip balm on my lips because they're cracking like the corners on my lips. Like I can't open my mouth very wide

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.680
 I remember that. I remember that the lip you got that in New York or something like

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:18.160
 Just my whole life. How can I say this? I don't want to be racist

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:23.360
 That's a terrible way to start a sentence because it's like sure that you're gonna say something racist

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.840
 At the moment you say that it makes me really excited

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:30.160
 Well, I don't want to like jump to conclusions

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:35.840
 But I know like different color skin has different properties and I just wondered like when you lived in New York

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:40.640
 You see you you do get dry skin. You don't really burn sunburn. Yeah, except for that one time

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:46.640
 So I just didn't know if like, I don't know your skin is just naturally moisture than mine and it just never gets dry

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:54.160
 No, actually people with darker skin tend to have dryer skin. Really? Okay my experience. Yeah. Yeah, so like interesting

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:57.760
 I think that's related to the climate like when I was in

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:03.760
 Cold or climate my super dry skin. I still have like like I still don't take care of my skin

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:07.760
 That way it's like way less dry than it used to be just from being in Miami

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:13.840
 Like where the where you're from in India. Is it like a warm tropical climate? Like what kind of climate?

00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:18.000
 It's like identical to Miami really that's nice got that little slice at home

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.920
 I'm in my I'm in my the correct environment. It never plays you tycoon

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:29.760
 Maybe oh, I think I'm flooding with good memories right now. Yes. Yeah, you like the cages. Yes

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.560
 Yeah, it's very similar to rollerfish. I can yeah

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:37.760
 And you have to like you have to like put like the right terrain and environment so the animals would be happy

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:43.760
 That's you you're in your correct feels that way I'm like, I'm like in the correct outfit

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:50.240
 You had that thought before did that one just click? No, I think as we were as I was imagining me being in Florida

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:53.760
 It's like yeah, I got dropped here, but like, you know, they recreated the right environment for me

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.920
 That's too funny

00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:01.440
 Can we we got to get the guy? I'm sure he's done a lot of podcasts the guy that made rollercoaster tycoon in assembly

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:06.000
 That's like a legendary story at this point. Isn't it? I want to hear from him. Yeah, that's true

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.200
 I want to hang out with that guy. Who is he? I wonder how old he is mr. tycoon himself. Yeah, mr. tycoon, right?

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:15.040
 Yeah, it was the last name. Who are like the legend like we got to have more people. I'm sorry

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.840
 I know you're just I just blew right past that joke. Sorry

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.400
 We got to have more people on the podcast and I don't know who people would want to hear from

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:27.920
 I mean, I can think of people I'd like to hang out with I don't know if you're a listener of the show and you want to like email us

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:31.440
 At something something at tomorrow.fm

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:36.640
 Shoot us an email. Let us know somebody you'd like to have on you have somebody can I tell you something I struggle with a little bit? Yes

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.120
 I think that I

00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:44.880
 This isn't like enough of a problem to say like we should or should not do anything

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:51.280
 Are you breaking up with me? I think I I think I struggle. No, okay. I struggle without those types of guests

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:56.720
 What type of guests? Oh like famous people like people that are accomplished and like further

00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:04.080
 Like they're they're like past the point where they have accomplished something and now they're just like, you know established like DHH

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:07.280
 Just call them out because

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:13.040
 I had to do with the person. It's a new thing. I

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:20.800
 Feel like I am way too on the same track or attempting to be on the same track as these people

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:25.840
 So my entire mindset around everything when I think about these people is like

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.680
 Being me be their peer one day because I like get to

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:34.560
 Maybe not the same level accomplishment but get to like any amount of accomplishment on the same track

00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:39.120
 And when I when I like when we had them as guests like I don't

00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:44.000
 I don't feel good in this like interviewer. Uh, yeah, I don't want to I don't want to interview

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:48.880
 I want to hang out. That's a good point. Yes, exactly like when we had pocock on and we're just hanging out

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.720
 Like it's like just peers that are at the same kind of stage of career. Yes talking

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:58.720
 That's that's like that's perfect. Um, but this thing where if you're just trying to be

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.560
 If you're if you're not on the same track of these people and you're just

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:06.960
 Trying to like do content and do that stuff like it makes makes total sense

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.760
 But for me afterward, I always had this like weird feeling of like

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.080
 I don't know. It's hard for me to articulate, but it's I get it. It's just in conflict with

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:19.440
 Like my drive and my motivation and everything. I suddenly feel like i'm being pushed into this other

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.960
 Yeah, it's kind of dumb disingenuous reasons that I would want to have

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:27.120
 Well accomplished people. It's just for numbies, you know, it's just like I want downloads

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.640
 I just want I just want somebody who's people gonna see the name be like, oh man. I gotta listen to that

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.520
 But like if it was just about the enjoying the show, you're right

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:41.040
 I mean I enjoyed listening to DHH talk straight 90 minutes like without getting a breath in that was fun

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:48.080
 But like if i'm being honest the pokok thing like people who I mean even like having taylor

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.720
 and ryan on like they're people that like

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:56.400
 Are in our just more accomplished but they're in our stage of career like they're not retired

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.920
 They're not like

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.920
 on mount rushmore or whatever

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:05.040
 I think the other thing that's challenging is when you're in this interviewer position

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.600
 To do that well

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:14.000
 You have to be really neutral and let's the person like really be able to get deeply into the way they think

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.640
 But because I want to be more of a peer

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:22.880
 I don't want to do that. I want to like be in conflict in certain areas and like have a different perspective on it

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.760
 And the reality is it's you can't really do that. Like that just doesn't really not with someone like that

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.960
 Yeah, it just doesn't really really exist. So let's let's just have you know, let's just have peers on

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:37.120
 We need to just have the whole terminal crew on we've never done that right just like have us all five

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.080
 I guess it'd be really hard to have five of us on now. We should do it. Yeah, we could do it

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:43.920
 It'd just be fun. I mean it'd just be like whatever. It's maybe it's a train wreck, but people don't listen

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:48.240
 Yeah, we should do it. I guess we should get off here. I have no idea how long it's been because my thing is broken

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:51.120
 I hope it recorded. How come you don't have to pee? Has that changed too?

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.400
 I'm a new man. I no longer have to pee

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:00.720
 Think of all the productivity. You're really nervous. You're bothering about your emotions and emotions are pushing out the urine

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.160
 I actually think there could be something to that. I'm not a scientist. I'm not a doctor

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.720
 I can't rule it out. It's possible. Maybe you were nervously drinking water. Maybe I mean

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:15.760
 You had some kind of repressed stuff. So you were just drinking the water as a way to self-regulate

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.600
 I think it's a simpler explanation that we're recording in a weird time today

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.520
 And this is not the time of day. I pee constantly

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.600
 I pee a lot in the morning right after coffee

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:28.160
 Like I drink coffee and then I have to pee every 20 minutes for like three hours

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.200
 And then I'm good like all afternoon. I haven't read anything so

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.840
 Uh, has it been an hour? How long have we been talking? I have no idea because I have to get my boys off screen time

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:42.080
 So before we get off, I want to tell you one theory that so Liz has all these funny theories that are like

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:48.400
 They're funny because they seem kind of ridiculous, but they're not totally implausible. Yeah, she has a whole set of them

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:54.640
 Uh, but there's one that maybe you will find helpful. I love it. Uh, I think I've heard I sorry. I think I've heard her say

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.800
 Theories like this where she's like I have theory I can hear her doing that

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.560
 I can hear

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.120
 She thinks that we all

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.080
 Underplay the role of smell

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:11.520
 In all parts of her life, especially relationships

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.080
 and she thinks that

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:22.000
 When you meet someone new all the excitement is because you have this new smell and then eventually you get very used to their smell

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.400
 and that uh

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.440
 Correlates with you know the relationship going stale

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.960
 I love this and I it could be true and they just need to be compatibility with smells

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:39.840
 And she's like that's how animals work and we're an animal. Like why do we think we're it's true. We're we're beyond this

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.760
 um

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.840
 And she hasn't got a bunch of other observations around this that I can't remember right now, but to like support it

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:52.960
 Is it just just romantic relationships or just like friendships? Everything probably everything but like I think she's mostly talking about romantic ones

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:57.680
 So yeah, maybe you guys should like

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:02.640
 Spend time in places with that don't have any smells. I get back together

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:09.840
 Just to be reminded reminded of the smell. Yeah, just to like you know, it's funny. We don't like uh

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:15.120
 Casey's pretty sensitive to like fragrances like chemical fragrances

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:20.880
 And we don't wear like cologne or perfume all of our cleaner. We just use like we knew okay

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.960
 Yeah, we just use like vinegar for cleaning solution like we try to like

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.560
 So when somebody comes over and they've got like a lot of perfume on or something

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.760
 It's like it's in the house for a couple days and it just like

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:39.520
 It's very dark when you're not used to it. That reminds me. Okay. There is some kind of perfume that I will

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.200
 smell off someone like maybe like

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.440
 Once every two weeks like just walk by someone or whatever and I'll smell it

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:54.960
 It is such a shocking smell to me because it smells so strongly of like cleaning alcohol or something

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.000
 And it just reminds me of like covid for some reason like mine was like

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.800
 Disinfecting something like all the disinfectant. I'm just like in the air everywhere

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:07.040
 And like it like I had such like a repulsive reaction to it

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:12.960
 And for the longest time I didn't even know it was perfume. I literally thought like oh someone just like came from the hospital

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:19.040
 Got hand sanitizer or whatever or like yeah, something like that and it's like this guttural reaction I have and then I realized it

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.440
 Their day like no that they're smelling like that on purpose. Like what they're trying to

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:28.960
 Trying to I like my brain like kind of understood how it could be a perfume flick

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:34.000
 It's like it and I was like oh my but for me it just smells like horrible or reminds me of

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.480
 covid. Yeah, this is the worst

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:42.800
 Design perfume ever. It's really interesting perfume and cologne. Did you wear cologne like growing up?

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:47.840
 Like in high school. I did for sure. I'm not trying to say I had the same like high school boy

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:52.320
 Thing yeah, I tried it for a bit, but I'm just not good with high school boys

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:56.560
 Is there is there a weirder subgroup than high school boys? I feel like that is the

01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:02.160
 Embarrassing strangest. It's the most embarrassing. I'm embarrassed. I'm embarrassed for high school boys right now

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.760
 Like whoever they are. Yeah, I don't even know them. Are they embarrassing anymore?

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:10.400
 Probably actually yes. They have the broccoli haircut. Have you seen the have you seen this?

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:15.280
 Every like I go to my gym and there'll be like eight people there and six of them are

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:21.840
 18-year-old boys with that haircut. It's insane. I don't know if it just hit the Ozarks late. Why did everyone get curly hair?

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:25.200
 I don't know. That's everyone's so curly. They have to be like perming it or something

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:28.640
 They're doing this on purpose. There's no way that many kids have curly hair

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.320
 I'm just I'm convinced they're all going in perms and then they shave the sides

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:38.880
 It looks ridiculous. I don't know how to like reach out to that generation and just shake them and say listen. It's not good

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:44.480
 It's not a good haircut. We but every generation needs something to look back on and be embarrassed by because it's like a bonding

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:48.560
 Cars are the frosted tips. I had like the the blonde frosted

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:52.320
 Pointy. You had the blonde. Yeah, I just had I just had there's there's the

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.880
 Oh, yeah, the rooster thing. Yeah

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.680
 That was our generation. Yeah

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:04.160
 It's funny. Yeah, and my hair was super curly. So it was really hard for me to get it like that

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:08.480
 You could have had the broccoli cut natural. Yeah, I could have had I could have had it naturally. Yeah, I know

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.680
 Born at the wrong time now. I don't even have any hair so I can't even do it

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.800
 Man, I I really I wish I didn't have just put a hat on all the time

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.440
 I'm gonna shave it eventually because I just never want to fix my hair

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.960
 So your hair is the dream like just shave it and never had to fix it

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.360
 I guess you have to shave it. Did I tell you my plants from my hair? No

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.000
 implants, okay, so

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.720
 No, okay, so I did

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:35.280
 So I found out that one of the best hair transplant places in the world is like 10 minutes away from my house

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.320
 Of course it is of course it's in Miami. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, of course

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.720
 I was like, okay, okay, I'll just go get a consultation see what yeah, what what's what

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:45.440
 And here's why I know it's a really good place

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.840
 I went in had my consultation

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:51.840
 They talked me through a bunch of they asked me a lot of the interesting questions that a lot of suggestions

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:57.040
 And they told me not to do one. Oh, why that's how you know they're good because they're not trying to just get the money out of you

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:02.240
 Like it's but yeah, so basically here's the thing I did not understand so my thought process was

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:07.120
 I might as well get it if I don't like it. I like the way I like my shaved head

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:10.800
 Like I can just go back to it. Yeah, but it turns out you can't go back to your shaved head

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:14.240
 If you get a hair transplant because what they take the hair from the back of your head

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:19.600
 And it leaves these like little dots there. So you have to commit to

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:26.560
 Like your new full-time the new look forever. Yeah, and if you don't like it you can't you can't shave so

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:31.520
 Yeah, I feel like it would be a waste to like ruin that for the rest of your life

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.400
 So he literally looked at me and he was like he just judged me aesthetically

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.520
 He was like good looking back ahead. That looks good shave. Yeah, uh, so I think he was like

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.680
 I think I would make you look worse if I did

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.840
 What we did and like he said I would have to have two treatments not just one

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:49.440
 And so it would take like a year and he just he was just like looking at everything

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:53.600
 And just like it I noticed he's like he had he had very low confidence that he would make him look better

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.760
 and that's what's funny about

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.280
 Doctors in this field whether it's plastic surgery or hair transplants

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:03.440
 They need a sense of aesthetics to be like I can make this person look better

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.560
 I can't make this person look better. And this is what looks good. This is what looks bad

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.200
 And they like study that and get it get a good taste for it

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.240
 So

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.800
 Now I know that a hair transplant is technically never going to be an option for me unless they figure out

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.320
 Hair cloning which is like they take a little bigger hair and they make it into more

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.000
 Um, which is like, you know, that's like the technology to try and figure out

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.640
 Um, so I'm like, okay, if I can't do that, I'm gonna go the other extreme

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.240
 I'm going to get laser hair removal on my head. So you never had to shave again. Yeah, so here's a fun

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:35.120
 Here's the next funny bit. So I'm looking into this. I'm like, is this a thing

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.160
 Whoa, is it really great someone on youtube?

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.640
 Just makes a bunch of content

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.720
 She's someone that removes that does this and she makes a bunch of content about it

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:49.200
 And I learned so much lift her up 20 minutes away from my nose. Where do you live?

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.920
 It's not real. This is

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:56.320
 The best hair removal place the best hair addition place

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.280
 Anything aesthetic you want to do to yourself, you know, my enemies got you covered. It's like what we do

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:09.120
 Um, so I think it's going to be a little painful and it's like make sure you don't stay in this hunt a little bit after you do it

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.120
 So it's a little tricky, but yeah

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:16.480
 Yeah, but like just never had like if I could always look like this. This is like I shaved yesterday. Yeah

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.760
 Um

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.080
 That'll be fantastic and I have to worry about my hair ever again just to my beard. Oh man. That does sound

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:27.120
 Yeah, I wish they could make it where your hair like I want my beard to just stay the length that it gets

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.960
 And then like not grow. Can they do that? It'd probably be really bad for you if they could

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.560
 They'd have to like radiation or something. I don't know

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.520
 Like kill the hair follicles, but like

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.680
 Then the hair would slowly start falling out and you just have all these missing patches that'd be awful

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.720
 I don't understand why wigs aren't more popular. Yeah, like they solve the problem perfectly like you look

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:51.120
 You can look like whatever you want. That's a good point. Why isn't that more popular?

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.920
 I could just wear one even like it could be the way I style my hair and then I don't have to style my hair

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.920
 I just have a wig on

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.560
 So right now you're wearing a hat because yeah, I didn't want to fix my hair

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:07.040
 Instead of wearing a hat. You just don't want to wig. Yeah, you know, that's so funny. Dude. I didn't do my hair today

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.680
 Just I don't know. It's like I gotta do my I gotta do my hair. Casey. I'll be right back

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.960
 I mean, that's I guess no, I guess that's weird. I

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.840
 I'm not I'm not someone that understands this world. Yeah

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.040
 I don't know. It's just like it sounds like what my grandma did to her hair

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:26.080
 She had like do upper hair. I feel like the bald is really good on you. The only thing I would say you could add

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:30.800
 If you considered being jewish or you considered like converting to a yarmulke?

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:35.280
 Yeah, because I think the little cap on your bald head would be amazing. I think they look good

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.080
 Just just give it a whirl. That is that is really great. I never thought of that

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.920
 Try one on you got the beard and everything just try one on if you like it. You can always just do the

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.200
 Jewish thing you can become can you become jewish or is it only if you're born in a certain place?

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:53.200
 I don't know. No, you can you can convert but I have too many Palestinian friends. So

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:59.360
 Yeah, also our copy supplier is a Palestinian. So interesting. I hope I didn't just offend people

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.480
 I feel like there's certain things if I just say certain words. I'm like not sure

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:07.840
 I'm so uncultured that I just don't even know so I'm sorry. I love all people all people are great. I was mostly kidding

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:13.280
 Um, I do wonder what I look like with a yarmulke. I see why you're saying that because it looks like it would just perfectly fit

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:17.360
 Like right there. I think I think it looks best on bald people because I think some people

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.960
 You don't have to be bald to wear a yarmulke, right? It's not just bald people

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:26.400
 Like I'm gonna stop offending people. Well, I was about to say something that was maybe the most offensive of everything

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.600
 Maybe it's not

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:35.040
 I'm gonna say it. I'm gonna say it. It's just a theory. It's not it's not real. It's just a yeah funny observation

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.200
 Um when people go bald, they have they get that like circle right here

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:46.080
 Exactly where the yarmulke goes. You think that's what they they invented the yarmulke for like that is quite convenient

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.160
 You know, that's interesting interesting theory. I have a theory

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.520
 Well, they call it the solar panel

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.520
 They call it something like that. That's what they like when you have a bald spot right there

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.840
 They call it the solar thing. They call it that's they call it something. Oh the horseshoe or something. I don't know

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.080
 But uh, I feel like we've offended so many groups of people on this episode bald people

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.160
 I mean, that's good as long as we offend everyone. Okay, everyone. Okay. If you seem targeted

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.520
 Yeah, so everyone like on the political spectrum

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:17.120
 Like if you're on the right of the left, you should all be offended feel bad

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.720
 But if you're trump your idiot, you vote for come a lot. You're an idiot. Yeah. You're an idiot

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.800
 Yeah, how could you not vote? You loser

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:28.160
 Uh, okay. I think my boys got extra screen time. You're welcome

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:32.320
 Podcast listeners. They should just listen to episodes of our podcast while

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.720
 We record this. Do you want to know what they watch?

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:40.080
 Well, actually i'm blanking. It's like every combination of two animals. It's like shark dog and like

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.000
 Tiger boy. I don't know. It's like so many

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.840
 How many shows you remember when we were kids and we watched like Saturday morning cartoons and it was like power rangers or

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.400
 This other thing this I was talking about this other day

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:57.440
 There's so many shows that I watched and I found like I didn't like the aesthetics like it made me uncomfortable

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:02.000
 But I watched because it was the only thing that was the only thing. Yeah, we had to learn a little perseverance now our kids

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.920
 Have hundreds of different shows they could watch. It's insane. Netflix just cranks out the cartoons

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.280
 I feel like they can make them even easier than like they're so nice action stuff. Yeah, there's so much stuff on there

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.400
 It overwhelms me. I mean, I feel that way about normal Netflix just like

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.760
 Spending 15 minutes at the beginning. It's like, what are we gonna watch and you just never feel good about it

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.960
 There's something there figure that out. I don't know. I feel like they could figure that out

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:31.280
 Sometimes instead of watching we'll just spend an hour browsing like intentionally like sometimes i'm like, they're feeling it. Yeah, browsing

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.560
 And we'll just we'll just like go through each thing and look at it and just make funny comments and we'll spend an hour

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.640
 Yeah, and then we'll go to sleep. Yeah, I mean, it is a form of entertainment

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:46.160
 They do the little preview even like they start playing stuff. You can kind of get a little taste of a lot of stuff. Yeah. All right

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:52.480
 Uh, okay, cool. I don't know, uh, I tuck. I forgot that we don't know how to end episodes. So

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.840
 I can hear my child screaming. I'm gonna go. Okay. Bye

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.800
 You
