WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
 Well, let's just record a little, a little goodbye here, Dax.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.600
 So Chris can use it for earlier.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.080
 Okay.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.120
 Chris will know how to do that.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.960
 All right.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.560
 See you Dax.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.240
 Yep.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.160
 So funny to me.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.960
 Well, have you seen these these last minute Miami to Vegas flights deals?

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.800
 It's nuts.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.400
 I keep getting advertising for them.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.000
 Oh man, it took me a second.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.560
 Everybody's going to be there, Dax.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.360
 It drives me nuts that you're not going to be there.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 Well, you know, I got to always be contrarian.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.680
 That is, that is so you.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.040
 Even like Kevin Naughton, who just does YouTube, he's not even a streamer.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.680
 He's going to be there.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.400
 I'm not a streamer.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.240
 You're not a streamer.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.200
 Well, we're streamers.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.440
 We're just taking a break.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.080
 Yeah, I just, I wish I wish you were going to be there because it's like, then

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.000
 I would have my default.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.640
 We're just like hanging out and then it's like, yeah, we'll see a bunch of people.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.360
 But now it's this pressure of like, don't just be in the hotel room when you could be out.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.640
 I tell you, you're going to be the awkward guy at the end of the restaurant table.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.400
 Like not being able to talk to anyone.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.360
 It's going to be depressing.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.400
 You know, wish you didn't go.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.280
 And everyone's going to be using all, all like, all like Twitch lingo that you're

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.440
 not going to understand, you're going to be talking about stuff that you don't get.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.800
 I've streamed in the last week.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.400
 How about you?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.080
 I haven't.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.840
 That's why I'm not going.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.840
 You're not claiming.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.080
 You lost track of your argument.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.840
 I did.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.520
 So you're definitely not going.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.000
 Do I just need to close the door?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.960
 Definitely not.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.000
 Definitely not going.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.720
 I've made that very clear and you need to not be.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.400
 You really have.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.440
 I've just, I've continued to ignore you and just hope that you've come around.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.840
 OK, the Aaron, the replicash, replicash, Aaron, the founder of that, yeah, he's just

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.640
 admitted to talk to react Miami, which I hope gets accepted because it's a very

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.520
 interesting topic.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.520
 He talks, he's going to talk about what we can learn from video games for like making

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.120
 these real-time stuff in web.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.360
 It's funny because in his point, his video games are always ahead of us in terms of

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.880
 architecture.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.640
 And it's so true.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.200
 Like, I've seen this a bunch of times.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.440
 In fact, I learned a bunch of distributed system stuff from reading a book on

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.840
 multiplayer gaming.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.520
 And it was actually a really cool book.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.240
 It like kind of goes through games I've played like Age of Empires and a few other

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.440
 things and it talks about like age of empires.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.400
 Yeah, it talks about their strategies for how they how they did multiplayer.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.960
 Interesting.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.320
 And there's a book and there's like a few different generations of them.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.560
 Yeah, it's called a multiplayer.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.640
 It's very boring title.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.480
 It's a multiplayer game programming, just like the most little thing ever.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.160
 The first section of it just goes over IP protocol, like just how the internet works.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.120
 Like here's like the package shape and here's what goes in it.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.840
 And then when it gets wrapped by this other thing, here's what goes in that.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.800
 And it's also simple and elegant and like, yeah, anyway, but he's he's giving a talk.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.080
 I'm excited to see if he gets accepted because then I'll get to meet him.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.480
 So I guess I'd react.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.160
 Miami is the only thing I'm going to go to, but it's not going to be 10 minutes away.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.680
 You're going to roll out of bed and you're going to like walk across town.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.960
 Yeah.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.200
 So I guess my thing is if you want to hang out with me, you have to come.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.840
 I'm coming.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.320
 I'm definitely going to react Miami.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.280
 That's going to take my like my slot next year.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.200
 When is that here?

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.200
 Cool.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.960
 It's like in May or something.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.120
 OK, yeah.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.960
 Well, it's not my anniversary, but that's going to take my like conference slot.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.320
 I went to render last year.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.080
 I'll go to react by me this year, this coming year.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.480
 Well, you might not be able to because tickets are limited to everyone listening.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.320
 Oh, no.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.720
 Wait, is it too late?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.760
 No, it's not.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.840
 It's not too late, but I want to pretend like it's too late.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.440
 Is it open?

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.360
 Can you book now?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.360
 Uh, yeah, I think so.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.640
 What have you not been?

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.240
 You don't even care if I go, do you?

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.400
 I tweeted a bunch about it.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.120
 You're just not on Twitter.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.880
 Well, tweeting is not telling me your friend to make sure and get a ticket

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.520
 so we can hang out at react Miami.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.200
 Well, it just hasn't gotten that serious yet.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.560
 Like the CPs just went on.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.200
 I'm disappointed.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.680
 Why don't you submit a talk and you can go up for free.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.280
 I'm not going to come at a comp.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.920
 What happened?

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.760
 Wow, the tickets are very affordable.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.280
 We think so relatively to other conferences.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.280
 Render was like, I want to say it was like $2,000.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.720
 Are you serious?

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.720
 That's insane.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.240
 That is crazy.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.360
 And they're doing great work.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.840
 Good job.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.800
 Everyone at Render Atail.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.520
 I'm not trying to like that's how much a reinvent cost, right?

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.600
 It's about 2000.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.280
 Yeah, reinvent was like $2,000.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.640
 That's so crazy, Amy.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.520
 And maybe I did like a premium pack.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.880
 I don't know.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.840
 I generally spend as much as I can on a thing.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.840
 It's just stupid.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.760
 OK, but three three.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.320
 No, they gave me like bottles for this at the talk.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.720
 No, they had some options.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.200
 I don't know.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.400
 React Miami is for a win the guest list.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.880
 OK, whoo, get on this.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.800
 You should consider bringing a whole family also.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.160
 Oh, yeah, no, I will.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.560
 But anytime we can go to South Florida, we're looking for excuses.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.840
 Yeah, I can say a couple of days.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.840
 And in fact, we're probably coming to Florida

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.480
 like in the next month or so.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.840
 Casey's going to go to a volleyball thing and say Pete again.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.280
 Oh, no.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.240
 And we were, you know, we just did that beach vacation.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.440
 You visited us.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.440
 Yeah.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.680
 We decided after that vacation, next vacation, we'll do like a

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.120
 mountainous, somewhere cold and snowy in a cabin with hot cocoa.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.720
 That was my idea.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.240
 But we're going to do a beach vacation again, because now it's cold here.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.600
 So we have to go somewhere warm.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.600
 So beach vacations for the rest of my life.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.800
 That's basically what's happening.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.960
 Your video just did something terrifying.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.560
 Oh, really?

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.680
 OK, well, right now, your video frame, I've got to take a screenshot.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.400
 Oh, it went away the moment I tried to first what happened.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.160
 And this no one and this is going to care.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.720
 But first, an ear started forming on your forehead.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.400
 Then once it was fully formed, everything, your face went black, like a demon.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.960
 And you're still moving around.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.000
 It was the most terrifying thing I've ever seen.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.200
 And that was what was happening here.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.760
 But oh, I see.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.280
 The weird part is the audio.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.200
 I can hear you.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:30.200
 I'm looking forward to a world where this never happens, whereas we're never like,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.560
 ah, they're frozen.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.120
 Are they like, I can't hear you?

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.720
 I don't think.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.760
 Yeah, I don't think it ever happened.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.600
 I think there's some kind of like law of physics or something at play, because we've

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.360
 had teleconferencing for 10 years now.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.080
 And it's just always been an issue.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.800
 There's always going to be, oh, hang on.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.160
 My headphones are connected.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.360
 The first like five minutes of every call will forever be, oh, just one sec.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.600
 Yeah, I'm just trying to get the thing working because I do this five times a day, but it

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.400
 just doesn't work ever.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.400
 Can you even hear me right now?

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.400
 You're just staring at me.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.000
 No, I can.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.120
 I'm just thinking about how like it when the military is like calling each other up, like

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.960
 are they like, like, uh, like, can you hear me?

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.240
 It's like, like, oh, yeah, like, no, there's a bomb.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240
 Yeah, you're on mute.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.040
 It's like, when it's like that serious, like, is it like when they're like, you know, how

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:24.160
 the president watches, deal team six or whatever, oh, yeah, so they're probably not using Google

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.160
 meets for that.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.160
 Probably not.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160
 Yeah.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160
 At least using zoom.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.160
 Yeah.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.160
 At least using zoom.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.680
 It's definitely not web based.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.680
 That's a great point though.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.040
 Like, what, what does like critical teleconferencing look like?

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.640
 There's somebody who's figured this out.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.640
 Yeah.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:47.560
 Maybe that the, the wires, like the little physical wire is like a hundred percent dedicated

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.560
 to this.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.560
 Because I'm assuming when stuff like jitters and stuff, it's because it's on like, it's

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.600
 all public internet stuff with unpredictable load and stuff.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.600
 So that's my guess.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:02.520
 Cause yeah, I mean, even so I once had a meeting in New York, I forgot who we were talking.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.360
 I think we were talking to a law firm because we were like, needed some like financial regulation

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.920
 for the company we're working at and it was a super fancy law firm.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.300
 And we went up to like this giant, it was just like the two of us.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:19.920
 And it was like a giant like a board board room type situation to meet one other person.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.360
 But the fourth person was calling in on a giant TV in front of us.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.360
 Yeah.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.440
 And I, it was one of those like dedicated like Cisco line things.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.000
 And I could not believe it felt like he was in the room with us.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Like something.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Wow.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.080
 You pass some threshold and it starts to just feel like they're actually there.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.080
 Yeah.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.840
 Super low latency, completely clear like, yeah, they're like, this feels good right now,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.600
 but there's still something that's off that we can't really perceive.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.600
 Yeah.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.600
 But yeah, I was like, Dan, that is like some crazy technology that they have there dedicated

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600
 network.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.600
 Yeah.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.600
 He was going to call us from Vegas.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.600
 I could see like some of the crazy mountains in the background.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.600
 Yeah.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:04.960
 When I worked in like New York finance stuff, they all like these bond trading banks, like

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.080
 they trade between each other, they all have these direct connections.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.080
 The microwave.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.080
 That we're talking about?

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.080
 Oh, what?

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.720
 No, this was just like this company I worked for.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.760
 They did all these direct connect installs.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.360
 It's kind of like what Amazon does, but like they run fiber to your bank and you're directly

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.960
 connected to their platform.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.840
 Like that was just like a thing that they did for all the big banks and just blew my mind

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:32.080
 to think of people like on the streets digging up concrete, like running fiber lines because

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.520
 some customer wants to software.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.520
 Yeah.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.040
 It's just like a few crazy things like that.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.240
 So one, like the stock market also has a data center.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.520
 You can co-locate stuff in.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.160
 So like if you're a high-frequency trader and they fight over like how far away like

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.560
 it's the length of cable, right?

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.560
 Yeah.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.560
 And there's a crazier one.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.200
 This is one I was thinking of.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:58.520
 There is a microwave tower with a line of sight from like Chicago to New York.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.600
 I don't know if it's that long of a distance, but there's something that some fun built because

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.240
 they needed to beam information as fast as possible and that they can't like run a cable

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.240
 for us.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.800
 Like I don't know if it's that crazy.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.120
 It might be like whatever, but it was something to do with like when certain reports came

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.120
 out.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.960
 I think it was Chicago because I'm pretty sure that University of Chicago does a bunch

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:28.160
 of those like big materials like C bot or you know how it's like the unemployment numbers

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.560
 are like whatever the big economy numbers are, I didn't think it was Chicago like did

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.800
 handle a bunch of those and they like beam those as fast as possible to New York so they

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.800
 can execute trades on them.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.800
 Wow.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.800
 And that's like worth it.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.800
 That's wild.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.920
 Whatever seconds that shaves or milliseconds that shaves.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:54.000
 Just the efficiency of those markets is just kind of mind-boggling like how reality just

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.680
 like becomes like if something happens in the world that affects some company's future,

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.680
 just how quickly.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.680
 Yeah.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.680
 That's factor in the markets.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.680
 It's just wild.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.680
 Yeah.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.680
 It is really crazy.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.680
 Yeah.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.480
 I mean like my dad spent most of his career working.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:15.120
 He never worked on high frequency stuff, but the stuff they do is just so, so complicated

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.440
 to like figure out like all of these like little tiny inefficiencies and like it can be like

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.560
 a 0.5% inefficiencies somewhere, but they can blow it up at like a billion dollar scale.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.560
 Yeah.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.560
 Right.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.040
 And as far as to add up to something, it's like yeah, insane.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.040
 Yeah.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.040
 It's pretty nuts.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.040
 Right.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.040
 And you're in, you're in the finance world.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.040
 Hey, hey.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.040
 Personal.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.040
 You're gonna build some software.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.040
 Yeah.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.040
 Quite different.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.040
 Yeah.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.040
 I just want to build for myself.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.040
 I just want to build something that I like.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.040
 Build for yourself.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.040
 Build something for you.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.040
 And then let me use it.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.040
 Yeah.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.040
 I'll be a beta tester.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.040
 Make my life easier too.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.040
 That'd be great.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.040
 Yeah.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.040
 Hopefully.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.800
 I know you something and then they tell me to fix it and I feel very motivated to fix

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.800
 it.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.800
 It's a good situation.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.440
 Like when I use SST and I send you messages every day.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.440
 Yeah.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.360
 Things that I want you to do for me.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.360
 Yeah.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.520
 It's just like things go from you like know about a problem and like you don't really

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.520
 feel motivated to fix it.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.040
 And as soon as someone you like even kind of know tells you that they're running into

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.760
 it, you like just really want to fix it.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.480
 So yeah, it's really nice having that like really tight feedback loop like that.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.880
 I feel like such a lazy jerk because I'm not even doing contributions.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:28.040
 I'm just like literally whenever this person submits a PR to SST, I just send it to you.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.040
 Please.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.040
 Please merge this.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.600
 I'm doing nothing in this equation.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.600
 I'm not merging it.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.600
 I'm not.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.600
 You're a lobbyist.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.600
 I'm a lobbyist.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600
 Yes.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.600
 You have access and you're lobbying.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.600
 There you go.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.600
 The actual community.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.600
 But you also represent.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.600
 That's right.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.600
 You know, a sizable.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.600
 I do.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.600
 It all makes sense.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.600
 Don't worry.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.440
 It all makes sense.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.440
 Wouldn't be happening.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.680
 I think other things are so many things I want to talk about.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.200
 Well, there was ever cell stuff.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.200
 Maybe we should talk about that.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.200
 Yeah.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.680
 No, I do want to talk about that because I don't understand what happened.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.040
 I just saw like two tweets and then could you just explain?

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.640
 Vercel is bad or something?

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.960
 Yeah, I think I don't think anything that happened was that serious.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.840
 I think I don't think there's anything deep to take away.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:19.520
 But the gist of it was first someone tweeted about how it's very complicated.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:25.320
 But what it looked like was it looked like Vercel released a template to build like a

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.040
 AI headshot generator app.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.300
 And you know, there's like five different indie hackers like have like an AI headshot

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.280
 generator app.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.960
 So they were like, hey, Vercel, what the hell?

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.760
 Like, why are you just cloning our business and making it so anyone can launch it?

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.960
 And they are upset by that.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.760
 The details of it, though, were like, Vercel didn't make that template.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.640
 It was some other company that made it and Vercel did promote it because, you know, it's

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.000
 a thing that deploys it for so I don't think that that's that egregious.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.640
 I also fundamentally don't think it's wrong to do that.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:05.320
 Like if you built a thing that can easily be cloned by a hundred people on Vercel.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.320
 Yeah.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.240
 And there's already like five other people like trying to build this exact same product.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.760
 It's just like, I just don't have and everyone knows this, I don't have a lot of like empathy

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.760
 for indie hackers.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.760
 Yeah.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.840
 I'm just like, you just jump on some hype train, then you build a ship of prize in a week.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.220
 Like, of course, it's not something super defensive role, like go move on to the next

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.220
 thing.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.360
 That's that's the entire strategy for what you're doing.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.280
 And they were like, first upset about that being like, well, why is Vercel doing this?

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.920
 Okay, to some degree, I get it is like a little weird.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.120
 And given their size, maybe they need to like think twice about some of that stuff.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.200
 But then that person followed up being like, Oh, I think every post that someone reached

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:46.200
 out to them saying like, Oh yeah, like a Vercel employee reached out to me and was like, you

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.880
 need to change your domain name because it's too similar to one of my projects.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.920
 And like we're going to get like lawyers involved if you don't.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:15:00.280
 So basically this employee of Vercel used a Vercel data to find who this person was to

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:06.360
 contact them, and then like kind of like threaten them using it the weight of Vercel, even though

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:14.240
 it was a good personal matter, which then of course, like the Vercel team like investigated

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.200
 and they fired that person.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.120
 So that that like blew up because they were like, again, like you're going to have a

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.120
 Rogan point.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.120
 That's a point.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.760
 This is going to happen.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:30.120
 The point I made though was this isn't to me, it's more the attitude around it where

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.320
 I might be reading too far into this, but I've seen this a few times.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:39.720
 I've heard a few stories from people interacting with the Vercel employees, not specifically

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.360
 not like, not really like the CEO or the CTO.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.880
 It's always like someone lowered down at the company where they kind of get like, it's

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.800
 like a weird like power trip that this person is having where they're like, they think they're

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.880
 at this like elite company that's like so invincible on the shit, they just like abuse

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.240
 their power in some way.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.000
 I've heard a bunch of stories like this, so this doesn't fit into another thing, like

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.280
 this person's like, I work at Vercel, who's this person think they are competing with

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.280
 me.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:11.280
 And I think that's a side effect of a certain culture where, yeah, like their whole vibe

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.680
 is like we're elite and we're better than you.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.440
 So you're eventually going to attract people that are average, but now in this environment

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.000
 where they're told they're elite and like an average person that environment is probably

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.280
 going to like start to like overstep what is reasonable.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:29.560
 But I don't like blame them for individual employee doing that, but I do think that's

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.640
 kind of one of the side effects you get from that culture.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:37.000
 And this very specific thing like harassing someone over a similar name that happened

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.880
 to us with open necks, like from from like the Vercel leadership, they were like, you

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:47.080
 have to change the name of open next, and a few other people have mentioned this type

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.320
 of thing where like, you know, like they didn't do it in a way where they were like, we're

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.520
 going to get lawyers involved, they dropped it when we were like kind of resistant to it.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.000
 They didn't like push too hard.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 Yeah.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.080
 But it is this like thing of being like, we, we have some amount of power to put this to

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.400
 like have this expectation that you would do just do what we say.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.440
 Like they asked someone that made like their V zero product, don't make like open V zero.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.960
 And they like got the guy to change the name interesting again, not by threatening or anything,

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.520
 just by saying, yeah, just kind of like oversell, please change your name.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.760
 So that type of thing, I think, does like trickle down and people's are acting rogue.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.240
 So hey, we're Vercel, we're the empire.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.080
 We have red lightsabers.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.080
 Sorry.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.080
 Yeah.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.080
 Exactly.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:39.000
 So that was that drama again, like do I, there's like something that deep to it, I think.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.840
 I think what I said is maybe like the deepest thing, but it just like kind of makes me cringe.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.160
 You always say the deepest things that I'm just saying it just wasn't the deepest thing

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.080
 I come up with wasn't that significant.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.080
 Yeah.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.080
 This wasn't that big.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.080
 Yeah.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.400
 But I always kind of cringe when I hear it, when I see people being like, Oh, like I'm

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:02.200
 never going to use Vercel again, like this is a whatever I'm moving on myself off of it.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.560
 Like, if you build something where it's like so trivial for you to move to something else

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.320
 over like one little thing like this, like, to be honest, like you just don't matter.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.520
 Like I just can't imagine you matter to, to herself.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.520
 You just don't matter.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.520
 I need to think twice.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.360
 So how many people were like, he had an indie hacker community to think twice before hosting

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.080
 on Vercel because like, what if they steal your ideas?

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:26.360
 I'm just like, no one wants your ideas, the only people that want your ideas are other

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.640
 indie hackers because they just do the same thing that you do.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.040
 So yeah, it was just funny.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.440
 Oh, and the other dynamic, which I also loved.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.480
 And it's like a great bit of marketing advice for anyone.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.320
 So of course, out of this, there was a bunch of people being like, why isn't there an open

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.320
 source?

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:49.920
 Like an open source way to deploy your next JS sites when AWS come blah, blah, blah.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.760
 So for us seeing something like that, what's the first instinct?

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.040
 The first instinct is to go reply being like, Hey, we're actually doing this, like come

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.040
 check out SST.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.040
 Yeah.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.040
 Yeah.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.040
 But we didn't do that.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.360
 We waited for random people to put, like, point that out.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.760
 So we had a bunch of people replying on our behalf in that thread.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.760
 So we never had to look like just like some other founder being like, please use our product.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.480
 You know, jumping on the opportunity.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.360
 There were so many companies in the replies being like, Hey, we do this.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.360
 Hey, we do this.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.360
 Come back.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.360
 None of them actually do.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.120
 Like if you like, the reality is it's so hard and we're actually going to put together

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.120
 a benchmark page so you can deploy a sample and actually as app to any provider that says

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.120
 they support it.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.920
 And you can see all the features that work and what, what don't.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.920
 That's a great idea.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.920
 Yeah.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.920
 It's quite hard.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.400
 And nobody really, nobody really covers the full feature set.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.680
 You can't, if you're not a source, again, a bunch of people were in there.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:50.880
 The only reply I did have is I replied with our free next to this video, which, but yeah,

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.040
 so marketing lesson, wait for someone else to make your point for you.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.720
 Like you don't, don't jump with the urge to like just make it, even though it's like,

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.040
 I saw that that thread and it was annoying me that so many people were like, this doesn't

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.040
 exist.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.040
 Why does this?

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.040
 That's why I'd be like, it does exist.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.040
 We've been working on it.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.040
 But just wait.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.240
 Someone will make the point for you and it's much stronger when it's not coming from the

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.240
 founder.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.280
 I want to go back and see all the replies.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.280
 I'm very curious.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.280
 Yeah.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.120
 I have ideas about what I might find.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120
 Yeah.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.320
 I can see me.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.320
 Yeah.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.320
 Yeah.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.320
 Okay.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.880
 Your knees are correct.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:32.840
 So can we talk, can we talk about the whole like corporate responsibility thing?

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:38.600
 And it just reminded me of the people who are like, have you seen what the, what's the

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.840
 Walton, is that the Walmart people with the kids have done?

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.840
 Yeah.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.200
 Like never shopping at Walmart again, like, is that, is there like, is there good that

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.200
 comes out of that?

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:56.040
 Like, can we actually make good decisions about where we spend our dollars based on the actions

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.640
 of corporations or people involved with corporations?

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.480
 Aren't they all just bad?

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.120
 This is, I've felt this way for a long time.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.120
 They're all just bad.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.160
 And like, if you're going to buy things, you're probably going to buy stuff from bad people.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.600
 Did you like deal with it?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:13.360
 Yeah, I think it's like, I'm fine with people individually being like, it makes me uneasy

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.760
 to support XYZ things.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.360
 You can recognize that like, you're never going to be internally consistent.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.640
 You're going to like, feel uneasy about something and opt out of it while you like support something

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.960
 maybe even like, objectively worse.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.960
 Yeah.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.400
 You might have your personal things.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.800
 I just hate when people demand it of other people.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.800
 I'm like, okay, I get that you feel that way and it's fine.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.800
 You can do whatever you want.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:40.720
 Like, don't tell me I'm a bad person because that then draws me into saying like, well,

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.320
 what about this other stuff that you're doing?

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.960
 So it's just like a stupid thing and then the other side of it is like, what is the

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.960
 company?

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960
 Is it the CEO?

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.160
 Is it the CEO feels something that you don't agree with?

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.400
 But then like, 50% of the company doesn't feel that way.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.400
 Yeah, it is.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.400
 Like what?

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.400
 Like, it's weird, right?

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.880
 Like, what if one person of the company feels the right way and everyone feels the wrong

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.880
 way?

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.140
 Like, it's not like a singular entity.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.920
 So it's kind of really complex and I'm like, I don't really understand the people's obsession

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.920
 over that.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:17.680
 I think that's the key for me is like the world is too complex to like feel like you

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:23.400
 can make good judgment calls about how you, I mean, that's too blanket statement, I guess.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:28.200
 Like, sure, there are ways you can make a difference by directing your energy and resources

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.120
 towards things that you care about.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.720
 But like, to think that you're going to walk some narrow path that like avoids stopping

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:41.240
 on any of your own values, it just seems impossible and like you couldn't untangle everything.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.240
 Yeah.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.240
 This comes up every once in a while.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.440
 There's some big thing that happens.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.840
 Some CEO says some dumb thing and everybody's like, if you ever buy from Target again, you

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.840
 hate babies.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.400
 He's like, no, I don't.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.400
 But I'm like, Target's right there and I need to get some whatever.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.400
 Yeah.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.020
 I'm sure a lot of employees like are different and like, what about, there's just something

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.120
 like second, third, fourth order effects that are so hard to understand like, yeah, if you

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:10.200
 genuinely don't support a company and then all the employees lose their job, is that

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.200
 good?

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.200
 Is that worth it?

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.200
 Right.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.200
 Yeah.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.360
 Then there's all this thing I think about that I absolutely hate is, look, I get being active

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:23.000
 in some things that are important, but there's so many examples of it just like doing the

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.080
 most insane amount of damage you can possibly imagine the thing I always think about was

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:34.120
 how anti nuclear, all the environmentalists were back in the 70s, created like an international

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:40.360
 fear of nuclear energy got so much shut down and like, look at the situation we're in.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.000
 It's like, we're back to coal.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 Good thing.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Yeah.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.640
 It's just like the people that thought they were doing the most important moral thing,

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.560
 like create one of the worst situations I could possibly imagine because like, again, there's

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.440
 like so it's very complicated.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440
 There's like so many.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:24:00.000
 I told you like my friend that works on all this carbon stuff, it's always like, oh, we

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.160
 change this thing here and that seems good.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.120
 But it actually makes this thing 16 steps over here so bad that like negates that first

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.120
 thing.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:15.240
 So yeah, I think these like getting this involved in like simple things like that, it's like

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.120
 it's really, I get it some things you feel bad for your soul, like don't do it if you

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:25.560
 feel bad for you, like it's fine, again, it's a very personal thing and you can, I think

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.760
 for things that I do that are in that category, I can say, I'm not going to do this because

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.320
 I feel like I feel bad doing it.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.320
 Yeah.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.760
 It might even be worse for the world that I'm not doing it.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.760
 I'm not saying it makes sense.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.760
 I'm not saying it's rational.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.440
 But for me, like it's taught me to live doing XYZ games, which I think is reasonable, but

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.040
 I think beyond that I'm just like, I don't get it.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.040
 Yeah.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.040
 I don't know.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.520
 I say a lot of things that sound like I think other people are wrong about everything.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.520
 I think I'm wrong too, just so everyone knows.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.200
 I don't think I'm right about anything either.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:58.160
 Well, I think a lot of stuff you say is actually weirdly, I think it's a majority position,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.680
 because I think a lot of stuff you bring up are like reasonable.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.680
 It's so basic.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.640
 No, I'm not saying they're not important.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.080
 I'm saying that the stuff you bring up is kind of reasonable, but reasonable points like

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.080
 never get brought up, but they feel like the minority.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:15.080
 But if you never bring them up, then they kind of do become effectively the minority.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.040
 So this is why you like talking with me because I can make the majority comment and then you

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.680
 can be different and you can be like, actual, I almost always agree with you.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.680
 What do you mean?

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.680
 That's true.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.680
 Yeah.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.680
 It's true.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.680
 I generally feel like I'm in the true majority.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.440
 I don't know if everyone feels this way, but I feel like for most practical day-to-day

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.840
 life things, I feel like I'm in like the true majority.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:40.280
 I feel like I imagine most people are kind of like not too extreme in any direction and

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:45.280
 I feel that way for most things, but you just never hear from that.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.600
 That group never represents itself as like a community, you know.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.600
 Yeah.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.600
 What is the dynamic there?

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:56.080
 Because I know I've had this conversation with Casey before, just like most people are

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.280
 probably more like us than we realize.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:04.240
 And it's just not like the sensational things are much more easy to sell, like in the media

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.080
 landscape.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.520
 Is it the, I just hate talking about the media because you just sound like, I don't know,

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.520
 it's the media.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.520
 Yeah.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.520
 I know.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.520
 It's the explanation for everything.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.520
 The explanation for everything.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.520
 Yeah.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.520
 But that's the thing.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.520
 Yeah.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.520
 That is true.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.520
 It is true.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.520
 And again, you feel we're bringing it up because I do.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.520
 Yeah.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.520
 They got me.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.120
 They figured me out and know how to make me feel self-conscious about talking about

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.120
 them.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.120
 Yeah.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.680
 I feel like that whole thing is eroded so much like compared to 10 years ago.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.780
 And now I feel like most people are like, at least based, whether they, it's hard to

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:41.400
 like really shake it, like whatever is being presented.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.200
 But I think at people's core, they understand like they shouldn't trust these things even

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.200
 if they can't help it.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.840
 I think it's very different from, from like 10 years ago where like, and I think now whenever

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:57.280
 we see a headline, most people are like looking for the trick of like, what, what's the trick

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.280
 here?

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.280
 Like why?

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.280
 Yeah.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.280
 Why could they say that?

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.440
 Everything is like literal.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.880
 I think we've kind of figured out the scheme of, I don't know, I feel that way.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:12.680
 I feel like most people aren't like just assuming every, all that is, face value.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.680
 Yeah.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.680
 This is kind of tangentially related.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:20.160
 I saw Ken Wheeler tweet, which I know, I love that Ken, like most of his tweets are just

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.920
 like, I would never want to read them out loud or say them to anyone in person.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.200
 Or they're just like pictures of food, but then he'll have like a random tweet that's

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:33.960
 like kind of deep or kind of like, huh, and he had this tweet about politicians and how

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.440
 they're antiquated because we used to need representation.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.440
 Yes.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.440
 I was thinking about that so much.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.440
 Yeah.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.440
 Casey and I talk about this a lot of time.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.240
 Why can't we just vote on our phone?

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.560
 Like everyone has a phone.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.880
 Can't they just like use the fingerprint or something?

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:52.920
 And everyone just votes and we don't have to have the whole like, republic or whatever.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.760
 Can we just all like vote on things?

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.720
 Is that too, is that too much overhead?

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.880
 Can we, I mean, I was imagining that so, so there's this, there's obviously some spectrum,

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:06.240
 there's some spectrum between like direct democracy, vote and everything and like having

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.200
 a king and we landed somewhere in between.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.280
 And his point interesting, he's like, where we landed, at least some portion of why we

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.080
 landed there was practicality, which is like, you couldn't have information go around the

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.080
 world in real time.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.080
 Yep.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.640
 But based off of that, now that that's changed, I guess you would land a little bit more towards

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.280
 the side of being a little more direct.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:32.160
 I don't think you'd go to the extreme because a one reason to have like a republic is it's

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.800
 just not things are complicated, like you, we're not going to be voting on like budget

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.240
 decisions on like, it's like, I don't think we have the context of that, but if we could

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:46.280
 at least just vote for our representatives digitally from home with that's like a corruption

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.280
 problem, right?

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.280
 Like it is, right?

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.840
 Yeah, because we know the politicians don't want to make it easier to vote because easier

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.840
 is to vote, but more than to control it.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.840
 How dumb is that?

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.960
 We got a bunch of people elected and now none of them want to change anything because they

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.200
 get to be, they get to do their thing up there.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.600
 And now it's like, oh, we don't want to make it easy to vote, they'll vote us out.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.120
 Yeah, exactly.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.000
 It's like just to wait for literal death of these people.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 And it's like kind of insane.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.680
 Yeah, but then they're just keep, they keep getting replaced.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:23.000
 There's young idiots, there's one from Missouri that I'm well aware of, like that, it's just

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.160
 a new generation coming up behind them that's going to have the same rules and they play

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.160
 by the same, whatever.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.160
 It just sucks.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.160
 Yeah.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.160
 I don't know how this stuff gets disrupted.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.160
 I have no idea.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.660
 Who told me?

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:38.480
 Now I got to think of the source because I can't just say this on a recording without

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.680
 knowing who to attribute it to.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.800
 Most I'm trying to remember who said it so I can know if I, if I want to say it out loud

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:50.960
 because it said this and I was like, that's kind of nuts sounding, but like, huh.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.320
 Somebody said, I'm going to think of it halfway through who told me this.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:59.040
 They said they thought it would have to come from like, like someone like Musk, someone

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:04.320
 really powerful in the private industry that could somehow disrupt, how did they say they

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.320
 would do it?

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.040
 Like, I don't know if they said just through traditional like buying up lobbies or something.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.040
 I don't know.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:16.400
 I do like had some reason that they wanted to see humanity move forward sort of muskying

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:22.320
 in the way he talks about like going to Mars for good reasons that like somebody like that

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.560
 would have to disrupt it because it'll never like they'll never get rid of the filibuster.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.640
 They'll never set term limits.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.840
 They'll never do anything that makes their life less good just that they're not going

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.840
 to do it.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.560
 So it would have to be like an outside force, like a private outside source, the force that

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.560
 did it.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:38.560
 Anyway, I thought it was interesting.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.480
 I've never heard anybody else say it and the person who said it, oh, I can't think of

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.480
 who it was.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.480
 Yeah.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.560
 I mean, I think that is a fantasy we all have because we imagine a benevolent effectively

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.080
 dictator because what we're saying is a person has a limited power.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.080
 Say the day.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.120
 But like they're going to use it correctly and they're in history, there have been them,

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:02.920
 but was way more common in history is there for people that seem that way and then immediately

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:09.040
 just get sucked into the corruption that happens when you have all that power.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.040
 Yeah.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.040
 So I think it can happen.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.180
 It's just like every single dictator that you see today was at one point a charismatic

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.180
 rebel.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.180
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.180
 Everybody got into power.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.180
 Yeah.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.180
 Yeah.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:24.120
 I mean, they talk about this with Fidel and Cuba a lot like like Liz's dad.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:29.880
 It took Liz's dad a while to realize that he was a bad person because he just looks so

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.880
 fucking cool in the photos.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:38.200
 The good looking guy smoking a cigarette like just in his like like gorilla rebel gear,

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:43.360
 just super photogenic, like every guy saw that one was like, that's who I want to be.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.360
 Yeah.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.160
 But yeah, you know, it doesn't work out.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.160
 Yeah.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.160
 Yeah.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.160
 It doesn't work out.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.160
 I did have this thought their day.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.160
 Not a while ago.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.200
 It may last presidential election.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:58.880
 I forgot what it was, but I looked up like how much a presidential candidate spends on

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.400
 the campaign.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.120
 And both candidates roughly spend the same amount.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.120
 It's in the billions.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.120
 I think.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.120
 Yeah.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.040
 But it's not an amount that an individual out there does not have.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.560
 So I was kind of like, I mean, there might be laws against all his campaign finance laws,

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:20.680
 but hypothetically, yeah, I think I looked up at that time, Mark Zuckerberg's net worth.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.380
 And I was like, I divided it by how much a presidential campaign costs every four years.

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:29.240
 And I was like, I think he could literally, if he just donated as much money as it needs,

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:34.120
 he could pick every single candidate for the rest of his life whoa.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:38.760
 And and the, can you even like guarantee victory if you spend like 20% more than what you're

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.920
 supposed to, what like they do on average?

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.920
 That is insane.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.400
 I'm assuming there's like laws that make this difficult because you have to like route money

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.880
 in difficult ways and makes it like super packs.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.880
 Yeah.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.880
 I don't know.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.880
 I know that comes up a lot.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.880
 Yeah.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.120
 But I'm like, could someone literally say, I'm just going to spend my entire fortune picking

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.680
 the next 20 presidents of the United States.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.680
 Wow.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.680
 That's kind of wild.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.680
 That could be disruptive in that way.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:07.520
 And I feel like I don't, again, it, besides that being laws against it, I don't know what

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.520
 would stop that.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.520
 Yeah.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.160
 I just don't think anyone would really like the thing is you can pick the next 20 presidents

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.240
 and like nothing can happen just because it's like so good.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.240
 Yeah.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.240
 It's difficult to do anything.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.240
 Uh huh.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.240
 So I don't know if anyone would like bet their whole fortune on that because it might not

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.240
 have any impact.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.240
 Yeah.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.240
 Whatever.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.040
 Would they have more chances of impact if they like bought all of Congress?

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.040
 Yeah.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.040
 There's different ways, I guess.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.040
 Yeah.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.040
 I don't know what the best.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.040
 Oh, maybe all maybe both those branches of government.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.040
 Yeah.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.040
 Everything.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.040
 Yeah.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040
 Okay.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.040
 I don't know if you can buy the judges.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.040
 Well, maybe.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.040
 What do the judges make?

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.040
 I'm sure they're viable.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.040
 Oh, you pay them to retire?

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.040
 Yeah.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.040
 Maybe.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.040
 There you go.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.040
 That's so true.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.040
 Like if you offered a judge a billion dollars or a tire, a Supreme Court judge.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.040
 Yeah.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.040
 Would they not?

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.040
 And is I know you?

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.040
 Is it?

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:59.440
 It's like you just retiring, you know, like, but he can't ever retire, like, it's just-

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.440
 Right.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.440
 Yeah.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.440
 Huh.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.440
 That's wild.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.440
 Yeah.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.240
 That's actually that reverse bribery thing that happens a lot because it's very hard to

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.040
 prove where you're in a position of power.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.120
 You do a bunch of things because you know if you do a bunch of things, you have a cushy

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.240
 job waiting for you when you leave.

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:21.840
 So they don't have to directly pay you to do something, the promise of a future payout.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.840
 Yeah.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.400
 It's like a consultant and you'll get lots of-

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.400
 Yeah.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.400
 Even like the oil.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.400
 Yeah.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.400
 A lot of the oil lobby stuff works that way.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.640
 They're like the revolving door they talk about, but-

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.640
 Okay.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:33.640
 This is getting depressing.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.160
 Does the world just suck?

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.960
 What's the takeaway here?

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.960
 Is it salvageable?

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:39.960
 I don't know.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:40.960
 Not takeaway.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.960
 I'm actually an optimist.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.960
 I think I'm actually an optimist.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.720
 But when I have these conversations, I start sounding like a doom and gloomer.

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:51.360
 I'm an optimist in that I'm seeing all this and it's all negative and I can't think of

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.800
 a single positive thing in it.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.840
 I just, it doesn't make me feel anything negative about the world.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:01.840
 I just kind of, in my head, I'm like, "Ah, I probably wanted a matter, you know?"

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.840
 Yeah.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.840
 No.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:04.840
 I think that's where I am.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:05.840
 I think it doesn't really affect me.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.320
 After we get off this call, I won't think about it again though.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.200
 I mean, I hope, like my, it's like a coping thing.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.520
 My brain is like, it probably won't matter because I don't want it to matter.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.520
 Yeah.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.520
 Maybe that's it.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.080
 We're just good at coping.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.080
 Coat more.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.080
 Coat more.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.040
 I used to think I wanted to like be in politics.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.880
 I was an asset, you feel like you have, you have like this stuff you need on paper.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.520
 Oh, I do.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.520
 Tell me more.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.520
 Strategists.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.520
 Strategists.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.120
 You know, you're successful in business.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.320
 That's like a good check mark.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.780
 So you're not like someone trying to be a politician as their career.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.920
 You're like, I'm turning it.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.920
 Yeah.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.920
 After.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.920
 Mm-hmm.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:41.920
 Your family is like a good looking family.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.920
 Like I think you guys photograph well.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:43.920
 That's an important thing.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.920
 It is important.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.680
 You look, you look like, you look like, if I like to like imagine a charismatic politician

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.560
 type, you look like, I think you fit that image.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.560
 Okay.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.520
 I fit the image of like, I'm going to like, give you money from corrupt places.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.720
 Like that's my job on the scenes.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:06.160
 That's funny.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.160
 Yeah.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.720
 So I can see you doing that.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.160
 There was like a period four or five years ago where I was like, Hey, what would it take

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.840
 to win like the House of Representatives as a local?

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:23.260
 No, no, no, like US Congress, well, because this like guy that wins here, it's just like

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.260
 doofus.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.260
 Okay.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:30.200
 And I'm laughing because I'm realizing you're going to take the 12th cert approach to this.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:34.040
 You're like, you know, like hyper fixate on it, and you're just going to be like, how

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.640
 I got elected to Congress in 90 days.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:40.880
 What would be the fastest way to get elected to Congress from no political background?

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:46.640
 It's just like, he's just this, I don't know, but then like, I'd have to win in an area

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:51.160
 where if you're not just like, I'll go into the best thing in the world, I will buy all

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.560
 the guns and give them to everybody.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.240
 If you don't just say that and like, yeah, you have to, I don't think you would win in

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.240
 your area.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.240
 I think you would have to move some mouse.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.240
 Yeah.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.240
 You have to move somewhere else.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.680
 I don't, I don't feel like I affiliate with either party.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.920
 So it would just feel bad to like run under either banner.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:12.440
 I would just, I would like see myself from the other perspective and hate myself, whichever

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.440
 side I chose.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.440
 Yeah.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.760
 And then like running third party makes no sense also.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.760
 Yeah.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.760
 It's a waste of time.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.560
 Like why even, you know, just to say you did it.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.560
 Why?

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.560
 Oh shit.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.560
 I have a DM.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.560
 Okay.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.560
 Never mind.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.560
 I have a DMV appointment on Thursday.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.560
 I just remember.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.560
 Oh no.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.560
 I thought it was today.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.560
 It sounds awesome.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.560
 I haven't pushed my Florida license in Florida.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.560
 Yeah.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.040
 I pulled over by a cop like a month ago.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.040
 I don't know.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.880
 It was like, you know, this isn't true.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.880
 Like this isn't true.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.880
 You just wanted to make sure they just want to make sure people switch their license.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:46.880
 It was like, yeah, I'm like supposed to arrest you and you would spend your weekend in jail

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.120
 because you didn't switch your license in 30 days because like, yeah, it's technically

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.120
 arrestable.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.160
 But like they're like not going to spend time doing that.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.160
 And I can also say like, oh, it's like my wife's car.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.560
 She lives here and I'm like traveling back and forth from New York and like it just like

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.560
 it doesn't make sense.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.560
 There's a million excuses.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.160
 So if you move to another state and Florida, you have to switch licenses.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.160
 The plates.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.160
 Yes, we've done that.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.160
 But my license is still a New York license.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.720
 I just switch it within 30 days of moving to Florida.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.960
 Are you serious?

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:14.960
 Yeah.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.320
 I lived in Florida for six months.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.320
 I never switched.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.320
 No, I know.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.320
 It's like not a priority.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.320
 Like you know, you're supposed to do it.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.640
 And you're just like, but anyway, this cop was like, what was the last time he got pulled

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.640
 over?

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:30.800
 Oh, so my dad, you know, my dad was a harp scholman.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.800
 Like, yeah, yeah.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:39.040
 So like when I got pulled over, sometimes there were special circumstances where I knew

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:44.360
 the person, you know, I knew the person I see just like dad's coworkers.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.360
 That didn't happen very often.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.360
 It did happen a couple of times, like to our family.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.000
 And I think it happened once to me.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.080
 But the last time I got pulled over, I isn't an adult.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.400
 I don't know if I have been pulled over as an adult.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:58.560
 I think I have to remind me Casey one day, okay, the last time I remember getting pulled

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:04.080
 over, like I was in the car in the passenger seat, Casey drives, by the way.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.080
 She doesn't let me drive.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.480
 She just says I'm a bad driver.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.600
 She stops and then listen to this story, we stop at a red light and there's a police

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.480
 car turning left in front of us at the light.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.240
 They're also stopped.

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.240
 It's read for them.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.240
 It's read for us.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.080
 And she just starts going.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.600
 Like we come to a stop and then she just goes, she's thinking about something else and

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.760
 we just go right in front of this police officer's red light and he's like, I guess I have to

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.760
 pull you over.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:37.880
 I tell you didn't meet like, that wasn't like malicious, but like, what are you doing?

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.880
 Last time I remember getting pulled over.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.880
 We didn't get to take it or anything.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.480
 It was just kind of like, are you, are you mentally capable of driving vehicle?

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:47.280
 What's going right in front of a police car like what's going on?

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.280
 That's really funny.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.280
 Yeah.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.280
 I guess if it's egregious enough, they can forgive it.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.280
 Yeah.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.560
 It was just almost funny to him and it was funny to us.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.560
 Yeah.

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.000
 So the strategy that they use and maybe know this from your dad or maybe it's like a Miami

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.480
 anything, I don't know, but I've seen this in a few places.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.280
 When they first pull, you know, how they pull you over, they come to your window, say a

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:10.240
 bunch of stuff to you, then go back and then come back again with the results of what's

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.400
 going to happen to you.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.240
 That first step where they come and first pull you over, super mean, really, really,

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:21.840
 really mean and like so serious, like barely giving you any information.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.280
 Like you have no idea what's going to happen.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.280
 So that's what happened.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.280
 Yeah.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:30.560
 He made you nervous and he went back took so long, like he took so long in the car and

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.760
 I was like, yeah, what the hell, like I might just, they like, it's like a warmth in my

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.760
 arrest or something.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.760
 What was going on?

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:42.000
 He comes back 100% a different dude, like just like the friendliest guy, he's like,

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 I turned off my camera.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.920
 Like, I'm not supposed to say he's like saying like all this stuff like really, really friendly

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.520
 and super nice.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.880
 And I think that's just a strategy.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.360
 They scare the shit out of you.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.240
 It's a good cop bad cop, but within the same person and they come back and they're super

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.240
 nice.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.240
 Interesting.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.000
 Because at that point, you're just like happy to like be like, accept anything that happens

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 to you.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.920
 You're like, Oh yeah, you know, I deserve to take you like it's like the fact that they're

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.960
 so nice after making you like sit.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.960
 Yeah.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.680
 It started as a good cop bad cop psychology.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.680
 Yeah.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:13.360
 It's just one person pointed it out this time and I'm like, okay, I think let's see if I'm

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:17.640
 like a more immune to it now that I'm like very aware of it, but you look at different

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:21.680
 person like he's like accent change, like the way he spoke saying that everything was

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.680
 completely different.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.480
 And it just makes it seem like he's doing me the biggest favor in the world by giving

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.480
 me this ticket.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.280
 Yeah, he got you.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.760
 And it's the same right here.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.720
 I'm like, Oh, here's another annoying thing as a diligent citizen of Miami.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.920
 I got the ticket and later that week I went to go pay it and it wasn't in the system.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.420
 I spent like 30 minutes looking everywhere, putting in all the different freaking like

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.640
 numbers that were on the sheet trying to find it.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.280
 Not there.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.200
 It turns out there's like a three week delay from it getting into the system.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.200
 I'm just like, what is the process where?

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.200
 Wow.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.200
 What is happening for those three?

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.000
 That's like ACH transfers.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.040
 I'm always like two days like what is happening is someone actually physically handing like

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.800
 pieces of paper to other people in the office?

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.480
 Like what is happening for two days that my money takes that long to transfer?

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.480
 I don't understand.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.480
 Yeah.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.640
 Well, ACH is funny because it's a, have you ever seen the raw format of an ACH transfer?

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.760
 I had to implement it at some point for some reason, but it's okay.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.200
 So you imagine like someone like Jason, right?

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:25.160
 You like imagine the format of a Jason blob and it makes sense.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:31.520
 This format is super weird until you realize it was originally meant for a whole punch.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.520
 Whole situations.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:38.880
 So like stuff like lines up visually, Oh, it's like tab like fixed column.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.880
 Yeah.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.880
 Yeah.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:46.360
 And then like leave enough space for the next, it makes no sense when you're just randomly

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.360
 trying to do it.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.800
 But then you realize like, Oh, this is like perfect for a whole punch machine for a whole

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.800
 punch.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.800
 Yeah.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.800
 But it's the same protocol, but it's just not.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.800
 It's like more digital now.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.800
 But yeah.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.800
 Yeah.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.800
 Yeah.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.800
 I know what's happening.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.800
 What is up with that delay?

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.800
 And now I've like forgotten about it.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.800
 And I like wonder if I like waited too long.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.800
 I'm in trouble now.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.360
 So I got to make sure I pay it.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.360
 It's happened to me in Portland.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.880
 Also, I have like a ticket and ever paid in Portland because I try to pay it and wish people

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.880
 to pay it.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.880
 I'm just not going to go back there.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.880
 It's fine.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:17.520
 I did get a ticket in Florida when I was in high school, living in Missouri went to Florida

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.600
 for vacation and I got a speeding ticket.

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.520
 I didn't know how fast you're supposed to go and I was going way, way too fast.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.520
 Did you pay it?

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.520
 I thought it was a highway.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.520
 And it was like one of those roads.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.520
 Yeah.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.520
 And I had to go to like an online course.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.520
 Oh my God.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.520
 I had the high school too.

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:37.120
 I got pulled over, got two tickets, five points each was bad on my own streets.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.320
 Oh, man, it sounds like a lot of points.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.520
 I don't remember the point system, but I remember that being obsessed with that in high school.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.960
 Oh, you can get your points removed.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.960
 This lawyer is so good.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:46.960
 You can get your points hanging off.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:47.960
 Yeah.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:48.960
 Yeah.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:49.960
 It was down to four.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.960
 They were done.

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.120
 It was going to be like eight or nine point or like maybe 10 points and they drove it to

00:43:54.120 --> 00:44:01.800
 four then minus two for doing the course, but I had a program on my computer that could

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.040
 speed up any other program I would.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:07.080
 So instead of a six hour course, it was like a 30 minute course.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:12.040
 And there's something like that where I just like sped, played it like extra fast and

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.040
 I spent through it.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.040
 Us hackers.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.040
 We just get all the perks.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.040
 I know.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.440
 Never have to follow the rules.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.440
 But yeah, I got it.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:23.920
 I make sure I pay this because I remember like every, every driving age high school kid

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.000
 in my school knew like the protocol like, Oh yeah, you have to plead guilty and take

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.680
 the plea bargain and like there's like all these like the set playbook for like the least

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:38.960
 demanded damage for the speeding ticket. So dumb. I also wonder like if like there's a

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.200
 world where everything's self-driving, does that revenue just go to near zero?

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.160
 And then how does that work?

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.720
 It might like break like city's budgets and stuff.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.320
 Well, it'll happen over such a long period of time, right?

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.800
 Like, yeah, yeah, it'll be adjustment, but it is something that.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.760
 Are there actual self-driving cars?

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.280
 Has any, is there actually stuff on the road?

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.280
 I saw only the other day.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.280
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.280
 What?

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.280
 Yeah.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.280
 I was driving behind it.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.280
 Is it Waymo?

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.280
 Is it Tesla?

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.520
 Like who, who has stuff on the streets?

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.080
 This one was Cruz, I think.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.080
 They've even heard of it.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.160
 Waymo has it and Cruz, I don't Cruz has it too. I mean, I think a bunch of companies

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.160
 do it.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.200
 So it's legal in, in some places, but not everywhere?

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:22.640
 I think in Arizona, you can straight up like order a robot taxi. Like there's an app.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.760
 Are you serious? Oh, this is way further along than I thought it was.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.760
 But it's like an Arizona.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.040
 Yeah, like who lives there?

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:31.800
 No, it's not like who lives there. It's just like, it's like a flat desert.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:37.120
 It's a city is a proper city, but it's like maybe one of the simplest places I can imagine.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.440
 It's like a new city and like a flat desert.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.440
 Easy to drive in.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.160
 That's like, yeah, versus like New York would be impossible.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.160
 Yeah.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.160
 Yeah.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.160
 Okay.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:51.560
 And Miami also impossible because you cannot predict any other driver on the road here.

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.560
 That's South Florida.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.560
 Naples was like that.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.560
 The worst driving I've ever seen.

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.560
 It's insane.

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.280
 Everyone thinks they have the worst drivers in their state.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.280
 It's here.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.040
 I'm telling you, it's, it's here in Florida.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.040
 Yeah.

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.760
 I don't think so, but not Dax.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.760
 He knows objectively.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.520
 I moved here and I was like, I'm an idiot for ever thinking that anyone was a bad driver

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:13.400
 because nobody in the world is a bad driver except for the people that live here by comparison.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:20.120
 I remember backing out of like a grocery store parking space and I'm just backing the car

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:24.200
 out at a normal pace that you'd back a vehicle because you don't want to run over a pedestrian,

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:28.120
 you know, and there's a person waiting to come into my space at mid backing out.

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:31.160
 They're honking at me, like, what am I supposed to do go faster?

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.480
 Oh, no, the honking is insane.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.480
 It's insane.

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.640
 People just, the people just love to catch you and like tell you that you were going to

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.640
 sell like.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:40.640
 So it's so annoying.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:45.560
 If you add a red light, okay, and you're the first car, you see it turned green.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.880
 If you don't hit the pedal with like the reflexes of an F one driver, the person is

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.400
 going to honk, like guaranteed every single time.

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.400
 Have a single light honk.

00:46:53.400 --> 00:47:00.720
 And there's like pissy, I'm like, yeah, I mean, I haven't seen that anywhere else.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.440
 Nobody uses their turn signals here and we're just like flying between planes every time

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.960
 on the highway.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:11.160
 There's like, okay, the way I describe it is when you imagine danger is driving.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:16.400
 You imagine everyone's going really fast, but in Miami, it's dangerous and everyone's

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:21.960
 only going 55 and that should really explain to you how chaotic it must be to like make

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.000
 people feel unsafe going like below the speed limit.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 Yeah.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 People just like veering.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.200
 I, there's so many grand theft auto type situations that happen in Miami, like there

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.360
 was a guy driving a Lambo shooting a gun out the roof, like a pistol out the roof just

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.360
 for fun.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.360
 Are you serious?

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.360
 Yeah.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.360
 I mean, they found him and got arrested.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:45.840
 I was, I wasn't an Uber once and I saw some, like a Lamborghini or something like that.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:53.200
 Out of floor it passed us lose control and then just repeatedly slam an SUV over and over

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.920
 into the side of the barrier till they both stopped.

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.000
 And I've never really seen a car I saw before.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 It really is.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 It's on the new video game.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.200
 Huge grand theft auto six is going to be announced soon and it's going to be in by

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:10.000
 city in Miami and yeah, it's going to be like the stuff that happens in Miami is crazier

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 than what happens in Miami.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.520
 I've seen you tweet some of the like police videos from Miami.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.880
 You won't think of the naked guys.

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:16.880
 Yeah.

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:17.880
 That was really crazy.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.880
 Oh my word.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:22.880
 That defies any I expected explanation because he just looks like he just looks like a product

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.360
 manager at like meta.

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.360
 Yeah.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:30.000
 He's just naked at the gym punching people like running around the streets like punching

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 people naked.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 Something.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 But he didn't look crazy.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 He wasn't like talking.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 He wasn't saying anything.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.960
 He just he looked like just like hitting people naked.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:39.960
 Normal stuff.

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.080
 I think he was being controlled by like like someone playing a video game like it just

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.120
 felt like he wasn't saying any word.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.120
 He was running around.

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.120
 It's his start up.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:51.040
 He's got a startup where you can control human beings.

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.040
 He was testing it out.

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.040
 I feel like he even did that.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.040
 They were just like jumped.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.680
 Like someone's like jumped in the air but like for no reason, you know?

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:02.600
 I didn't know people could be just naked like that on a Twitter video like that.

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.560
 I remember when you posted it, I was like, Dax, you know, like, do you know that he's

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.560
 funny?

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.360
 You should be saying this out of the photo.

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.360
 Yes.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.960
 I close on, I don't know what you're talking about.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.120
 There's a lot of implication is all.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.440
 What is that?

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.640
 I don't know what that means.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.640
 Okay.

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.640
 Here's the thing.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.640
 It was drying off of the towel.

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.960
 But it was like a sexy photo because like we knew you were naked but it was okay.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.840
 Here's the thing.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.800
 The implication of being naked is more sexual than being naked.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:35.920
 But it wasn't an implication of being naked because I'm very clearly clothed.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.520
 Do you have shorts on?

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.240
 I have like a speedo on.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.240
 Okay.

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:43.080
 It didn't look like you had any clothes on and you were just like wiping yourself with

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.080
 towels.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.080
 Oh, you didn't think I had anything on?

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.800
 But even this speedo, Adam, is like the implication of being naked.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.240
 No, I just, that's how I get my Simon.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.240
 I get it.

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.000
 But like you get what I mean, right?

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.160
 The implication of being naked.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.160
 I see.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:58.560
 There's like a tension or like a, like a, it's like a secret, you know, there's like.

00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.560
 Okay.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.560
 But you really didn't think I had anything on?

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:01.560
 That's alarming.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.960
 I thought you just had the towel in front of you.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:04.960
 And I was like, Oh geez.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:05.960
 Okay.

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:06.960
 Why don't want that?

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.960
 It's too late.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:08.960
 It's too late.

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:09.960
 Just too late.

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:15.400
 By the way, for everyone listening that didn't know what we were talking about, Adam posted

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:20.520
 a really good, you look great, by the way, really great shirtless picture of himself.

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.680
 He's in the best shape of his life and you can tell.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.360
 It's been, it's been kind of a theme.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.000
 I feel like I've done this a few times now.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.160
 Is it getting overwhelming too many shirtless photos on the internet?

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.160
 Just be yourself.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.160
 I don't know.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.160
 Okay.

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.160
 You know what?

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:40.320
 It honestly does like help with the, you know, like the identity thing with fitness.

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:45.680
 Like if you, if you believe you're a fit person and you believe you're like someone who's

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.920
 very active, that's half the battle in like keeping up good habits.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:53.880
 And something about like public accountability where it's like, people perceive me now as

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:57.320
 this fit person just helps bolster that identity even more.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.920
 It just makes me want to work out even more.

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.800
 It's like, it's this cycle that I do quite enjoy.

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:04.520
 Maybe that's a blog on Twitter, maybe it's more of an Instagram thing.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.520
 No, I think it's fine.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.280
 I think it's entirely fine.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.680
 And yeah, it's that thing where like if the more you feel like you have to lose by dropping

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.200
 a habit, like the less likely you're going to drop the habit.

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.200
 So exactly.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.200
 Yeah.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.200
 Totally get it.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.200
 What, what are you even doing by the way?

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.200
 Like, what have you been, how have you been working out?

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:25.680
 So I got this question a lot after I posted my photo.

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:30.400
 So I do like the same stuff I've been doing in terms of weightlifting.

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.480
 Like I, I do like the main, so squat, deadlift bench.

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.480
 Yeah.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.480
 I do over head press.

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.480
 Yeah.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.480
 Those are the four that I do as well.

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.480
 Yeah.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:42.920
 So the main lifts, I do a lot of pull ups because it turns out in jiu-jitsu pulling strength

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:43.920
 pretty important.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:44.920
 Oh, I see.

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:48.280
 You do a lot of pulling more so than pushing.

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.000
 So I, well, I say that I'm, I'm done at jiu-jitsu.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
 I don't know anything.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.400
 So people who actually know jiu-jitsu can correct me.

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.640
 I think your current ball neck is the ability to pull.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.640
 Yeah.

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:00.160
 Currently I feel like being, it's more advantageous to build a pull.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.240
 So I do a lot of pull ups.

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:05.360
 I put on my way to this and I do pull ups, which I'm slowly building up that ability

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.580
 to do heavier and heavier pull ups.

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:08.580
 What else?

00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:11.160
 I do, I've got this a rogue bike.

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.160
 It's like a rogue echo.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.160
 It's like one of those full body.

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.160
 Yeah.

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.160
 That's so bad.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.160
 Man, what is that called?

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.160
 Attack bike.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.160
 Assault bike.

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.160
 Assault bike.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.160
 Yeah.

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:23.200
 Assault bike I think is actually another company that makes one.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.200
 Oh, it's not a type of thing.

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.200
 It's like a fan.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.200
 Yeah.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.200
 We have a bunch of those.

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.200
 Yeah.

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.200
 Yeah.

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.840
 It's like your whole body.

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.340
 It's a cardio experience.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:35.640
 So I got that to cut for my competition.

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.640
 And that's probably the main thing is like I've been intentionally kind of like trying

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:43.320
 to shed all body fat just for like jiu-jitsu purposes.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:49.040
 It's like if I can not carry, if I can have like 195 pounds but just be completely muscle,

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:52.160
 that's advantageous over the people who don't really care about fitness and they still do

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.320
 jiu-jitsu.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.680
 Most of the people actually, like in my little gym here in the Ozarks and we got a great

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:57.680
 gym.

00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:58.680
 I love my gym.

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:02.920
 It's like people are not really physically fit.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:07.280
 And I found even as a no-stripe white belt just coming in, I can like, I can kind of

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:10.640
 like beat all the blue belts who are just out of shape people that work the best.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.640
 It lasts longer.

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.640
 Yeah.

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.640
 Just physically.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.640
 Yeah.

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.240
 Just like they can't physically like I'm too imposing physically.

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.920
 Anyway, that's mainly it.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:24.360
 It's like I've shed all the extra weight just eating habits and stuff like that.

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:27.000
 So it's not really I changed anything exercise wise.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:33.880
 It was more like eating and just having a thing like jiu-jitsu is the thing for me.

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:39.580
 I needed a thing that was like competitive and active and gives me a reason to like,

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:43.240
 I want to get better at this and if I can be physically more fit, it'll make me better

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.240
 at it.

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.240
 Yeah.

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.240
 At least theoretically.

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.240
 I still suck.

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.240
 I'm terrible.

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.240
 Just do.

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.240
 But it's so fun.

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.240
 Yeah.

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.240
 That makes sense.

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:57.000
 That's the same thing is you like for me, I'm trying to get to certain weights on everything.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.680
 I want to flip to just maintaining that because again, it's like that's not yeah.

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:07.800
 I actually do like doing all the barbell stuff with those four lifts, but yeah, I have a

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.720
 lot of nostalgia with it like from football days and all that.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.720
 Like I just did high school.

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:12.720
 We did a lot.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:16.520
 I've just done them so many times and I'm like very good at doing them now and like yeah,

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.640
 because at the beginning, they just feel so impossible to like even do the form right

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:23.320
 in like it feels weird, but now just feels very natural.

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:28.560
 So I like them, but I want to get to a certain point and then which is like, I really like

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:31.200
 what Adam Waffen does, the tailwind guy.

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.200
 Yeah.

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.200
 He wears the vest.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.200
 You told me this.

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.200
 I think.

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.200
 So I've been going on walks with Zuko every morning now or the mornings that I don't go

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:39.200
 to the gym.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.200
 I never thought.

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.600
 I mean, everyone loves walks.

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:45.640
 I never thought I would be someone that would enjoy solo walks, but I've been doing that

00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.360
 a lot more and I've been actually really enjoying it.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:53.120
 When I get stuck on something, I'll just go for a walk for 30 minutes and yeah, I never

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:58.680
 get away to vest, but yeah, yeah, it's so hard to talk myself into a walk because it

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:02.160
 always feels like so much time investment, but I've never like gone on a walk and be like,

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.160
 I wish I would never know.

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.160
 Yeah.

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.160
 Well, as soon as you're walking, you're like, yeah, yeah.

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.160
 Yeah.

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.800
 I mean, everyone's super nice to walk through and all those restaurants so close.

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:09.800
 You've told me.

00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.280
 No, I go the other way.

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.280
 I go.

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:13.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.280
 I don't go to the restaurants.

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:18.760
 I go through all the houses, a lot of beautiful, quirky houses with weird, with weird trees

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:19.760
 everywhere.

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:20.760
 100 year old.

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.760
 Mango trees that aren't underwater yet.

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.760
 Mango trees.

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.760
 Mango trees also.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.800
 You know, we have that original mango tree in our neighborhood.

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.800
 I sent you that.

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:30.800
 Wait, you've told me.

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:31.800
 Yeah.

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.800
 You've told me about this.

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.800
 I don't know if you sent it to me.

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.800
 Yeah.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:40.560
 So for most of the mangoes that are produced in America, the original mango tree that was

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:44.840
 they all grafted off of is still alive and it's in my neighborhood.

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.440
 That is so wild.

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.840
 Like what a claim to fame.

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.840
 I know.

00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.840
 You live in like the mango mecca in America.

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.840
 Mango central.

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.840
 Yeah.

00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:55.080
 I somehow have to pee again.

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.240
 We've made it two hours.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.240
 Nice.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.240
 So the point that I have to pee a second time.

00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.240
 So I think it's time to call it.

00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.840
 You didn't drink water, did you?

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:01.840
 Between the two?

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:02.840
 I did.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:07.040
 I drink this guy and this guy.

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:11.080
 All the fluids, I haven't drank water once since I woke up though.

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.080
 That's a good idea.

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:16.440
 You don't have to pee all the time, but I'm dehydrated all the time.

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.920
 That's a problem.

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.680
 If the two of us combined, we'd make a pretty good person.

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:21.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.680
 We should.

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:23.680
 Let's just figure out how we can do that.

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.680
 If we could just like line ourselves over extremes.

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:26.680
 We need the weaknesses.

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:27.680
 Yeah.

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.680
 Yeah.

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.680
 Okay.

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.680
 Got a few.

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:31.680
 It's been a marathon.

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.680
 Look at us.

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:33.680
 Two hours.

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.680
 Easy.

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.680
 All right.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.600
 We'll see you in the next video.

00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.600
 Bye.

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.600
 Bye.

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.600
 Bye.

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:40.600
 Bye.
