WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 - Did you like cut the cord?

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.240
 - What cord?

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.880
 - Like when the baby's born, you cut the cord.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.480
 - Sorry, yeah, I forgot baby.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.360
 I'm holding my headphone cord,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.080
 and I was like, cut the cord, what?

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.720
 Sorry, I forgot we were talking about babies.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.300
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.860
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.920
 - So I remember those protein bars I was telling you about?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.120
 - Yes.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.200
 - They're really like messed up.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.400
 I mean, so I think they're like a natural, but I love them.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.400
 So I ordered a box and they left it on my front,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.040
 like in my front yard.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.300
 It was awesome.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.300
 So I opened it and every single bar was like totally melted.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.360
 Like I could trade up liquid on the inside.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.720
 And I was like, oh, I guess I can't eat these,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.640
 but just for the hell of it, I threw it in the fridge.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.040
 - I was like, let me see.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.320
 - Yeah, and the next day I pulled out of the fridge

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.120
 and I opened one and it's like completely intact.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.680
 (laughing)

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.120
 It's like, I can't do it so rich.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.960
 (laughing)

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.080
 - That's amazing.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.520
 - It highlights how like messed up this product is.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.160
 - Does it look different, or does it look like

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.000
 it would have looked--

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.760
 - It's like a little bit messed up

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.200
 where it's like kind of cracked.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.960
 And like a little bit, and like some are worse than others.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.520
 But the first one I tried, I was like,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.440
 this basically looks normal again, but the day before,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.720
 it was like a bag of like--

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.080
 - Completely melted, yeah.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.920
 - Yeah.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.760
 - Oh man.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.420
 (laughing)

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.560
 I'm so ready for the heat to leave.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.660
 Like next week is supposed to be,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.660
 here in the Ozarks, it's supposed to be like 70s.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.880
 And I'm very excited.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.040
 Just the last couple mornings, it's been like 65

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.100
 when I walk in the morning instead of like 75.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.200
 I'm very excited.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.800
 - I guess you have the issue of it.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.880
 Was it, is it humid?

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.000
 - Like what is your, what is it like extra hot there?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.840
 - It's humid.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.600
 - Yeah, it's been like heated visories.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.920
 It's like the combination of the humidity and the heat.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.760
 - We have heated visor, too.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.600
 - Yeah.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.440
 This is really gross.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.280
 The Ozarks just gets all the worse weather.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.760
 Like we have like a, I think Springfield, Missouri

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.040
 was the number one most diverse climate in the United States.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.160
 The temperatures vary so much,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.080
 whereas like LA is on the bottom of that list

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.440
 where it's like always the same.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.280
 - Yeah.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.560
 - Missouri is like one week, 95 degrees

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.040
 and 100% relative humidity the next week.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.080
 Like this happens in the fall

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.040
 where it's like we bounce between the summer

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.520
 and winter for like a month and a half

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.360
 where it's like one week, it's blazing hot.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.560
 The next week it'll be like 55.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.640
 It's just the, it's the battle of like the Canadian air

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640
 and the Gulf Air.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.920
 They're just like constantly competing

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.320
 and they do that battle here in the Ozarks.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.000
 - So I don't get it like, why is it humid?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.600
 Where's the water coming from?

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.720
 - I guess the Gulf, like when the Gulf Air wins,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.760
 we get the hot humid South air.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.920
 - That's crazy, it comes from that far away.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.880
 - Yeah.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.480
 - It's like several states away.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.800
 - Yeah, it's like the I-44 corridor

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.360
 which cuts Missouri in half.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.200
 - Yeah.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.680
 - Is basically the line where all the storms come in.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.160
 Like all the fronts meet right here,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.040
 at least for now until, I don't know,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.920
 I don't know, in like three years maybe

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.560
 that'll push more north as it's getting warmer.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.000
 (laughing)

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.040
 But right now in historically my whole life,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.240
 it's like all the storms happen along that 45 degree angle

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.080
 in Missouri.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.120
 So it's like the warm air and the cold air from Canada,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.360
 they just, they meet right there.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.280
 - Is there anything good about living in Missouri?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.720
 What's like the best aspect of living in Missouri?

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.600
 - No, yeah, I'm sorry.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.280
 I can't think of any at the moment.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.280
 (laughing)

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.600
 - Like the whole state.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.680
 - Well, historically people have liked the cost of living.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.320
 Like you can buy like 800 acres in Missouri

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.920
 and it's like, I don't know, a small townhouse in LA.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.200
 - Two and a half dollars in a can of quarters.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.040
 (laughing)

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.880
 - Something like that, right?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.440
 - Can of quarters.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.280
 (laughing)

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.120
 It's funny.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.960
 Yeah, no, it's very,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.520
 land has historically been very cheap.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.600
 So that was, I think that was the main draw.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.320
 Like there are a lot of people, it seems weird.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.960
 Maybe it's 'cause there's so many people in California,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.440
 but how many people you meet that are new to the area

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.200
 in the Ozarks and they came to California?

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.720
 - It's happening that way too, yes.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.360
 - Yeah, it's always people coming from California.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.200
 (laughing)

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.440
 So I only like, whenever I'm out in my neighborhood,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.400
 and I talk to anyone, literally anyone, from New York.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.480
 Really? - Every single one of them.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.320
 - Every single one of them.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.160
 - Every single one of them.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
 - I just live in New York basically, yeah.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.200
 It's embarrassing 'cause I'm also one of them.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.040
 - Yeah.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.240
 - Obviously, I see myself as different.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.480
 I'm sure everyone sees themselves as like,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.760
 well, I'm technically, you know, different somehow.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.280
 - Yeah, but it's the best place I've ever meet.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.520
 (laughing)

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.360
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.480
 (laughing)

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.840
 What am I most from here technically?

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.240
 So, you know, that's my whole thing.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.080
 - You got to have something to hang on to.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.120
 - Oh, yeah, it's just all people from New York.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.760
 And, 'cause I know that if I was not from New York

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.680
 and I lived here, I would definitely just be like,

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.920
 bitching about it all the time,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.760
 or like, making fun of them,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.240
 or like, I would see them in a certain way,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.400
 and I hate that. - Yeah.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.240
 - That's me.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.360
 (laughing)

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.480
 - There's so many cliches I fit into that I hate that it's me.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.640
 (laughing)

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.480
 But so everyone around you from California?

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.240
 - Yeah, a lot of people that are new.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.040
 I mean, like, those arcs is this,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.720
 it's mostly people who've lived here their whole life.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.760
 And just have no plans to leave.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.200
 But then there's like, at our school,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.200
 it's like, there's a new family.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.080
 Oh, where are they from, California?

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.080
 That's just a very common thing.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.760
 It's like people come from the West Coast.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.280
 - They're just here randomly.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.280
 Like no, prior-- - No, I mean,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.120
 a lot of them were seeking something else in life.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.560
 And they thought they were like here brand new.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.760
 - Like that? - Yeah.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.840
 - That's pretty crazy.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.640
 So I'm wondering, is this good for you?

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.920
 'Cause you're, are there more people like you moving in?

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.200
 Like, is there more stuff catered?

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.480
 'Cause I feel like you're more like someone

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.440
 that would be from California than someone that would be

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.840
 from Missouri, given that you are vegan.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.760
 - That's true.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.600
 - Vegan, by the way.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.360
 So I will say, like, I don't know,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.880
 every time we visit, like, we go out to LA,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.840
 we've been out there quite a bit.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.120
 They're like early in my career,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.040
 we had reasons about there.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.800
 And like, we just always enjoyed being in LA.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.040
 'Cause I mean, we're vegan.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.360
 There's lots of vegan food.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.000
 The weather is crazy.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.640
 - Yeah, if you're not vegan,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.240
 like, I think lunch in LA is like my most absolute favorite.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.680
 It's like that category of like,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.880
 nothing crazy, just like a casual lunch spot.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.640
 Everything is just so good.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.080
 I think a trip is the raw ingredients

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.000
 are just better out there.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.800
 - Yeah, Casey and I talk about how like,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.840
 in the Ozarks, it's like every restaurant is just so bad.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.600
 And it's because there's no competition.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.320
 Like in LA, it's like, you gotta be good to like survive.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.320
 - Yeah. - And out here,

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.640
 we just have so little, like there's like one

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.840
 vegan restaurant's actually just shut down

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.120
 here in the Ozarks, well, not in the entire Ozarks.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.200
 - You didn't go there enough, Adam.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.040
 You should have went there more.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.280
 - Yeah, that's the thing.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.520
 Like, we went there one weekend.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.960
 We hadn't been there in like six months.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.400
 And then the next weekend they shut down.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.920
 And we're like, well, there goes that, I guess.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.600
 But like, the amount of like, they opened a date

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.120
 is this whole deal where they're supposed to open a date.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.480
 We got there at like 8.15.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.720
 And like, they opened the door for us

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.840
 and they were just getting there.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.280
 And then like, they hadn't started making the breakfast stuff.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.800
 So like, we had to wait an hour.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.280
 It's just like, and the whole thing for me is like,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.280
 there's no other vegan restaurant.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.600
 They literally have zero competition.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.280
 And this is what happens when you have no competition.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.280
 You scroll in at 8.15 and like people have to wait.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.760
 - Yeah, that's a, it's a fine dynamic

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.440
 because I've had this realization the other day

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.240
 where I think I am now old enough

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.560
 that I've gained enough experience in certain things.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.600
 And that sounds like a very positive thing.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.640
 But I think it's manifesting in a weird way.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.120
 'Cause I've noticed now whenever I go to a restaurant,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.000
 I'm like, this was good, but like, it wasn't great, you know?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.400
 Like, yeah, I have a steak.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.640
 I'm like, oh, this is pretty good.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.680
 But it wasn't like the best.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.440
 So in the past, like when I was dumber about this stuff,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.080
 every experience was amazing.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.720
 But now I've had so many.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.560
 - Like this is amazing.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.400
 - Yeah, exactly like a kid.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.240
 Yeah, this is the best thing I've ever had.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.040
 I don't remember anything before this thing.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.920
 But especially, I mean, the steak one is specifically funny

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.560
 'cause I've made so many myself

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.040
 and I've been to like so many good steak houses now

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.280
 that I like can't, I still enjoy it.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.080
 But something is, it's like I'm cursed with the knowledge,

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.160
 you know?

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.000
 - Yeah.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.920
 - A nicer way or like a less nice way to say this

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.480
 is that I'm just being pretentious,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.760
 but I'm not being pretentious out loud.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.280
 It's like internally, I'm like, ugh.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.000
 There's this really interesting thing like lifestyle creep.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 It's like, it's related to this.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.160
 It's like as you get older, your tastes are more refined.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.560
 It's just, and it's very hard to like,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.720
 I've been thinking about this stuff.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.280
 I've been thinking about like retirement,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.000
 like what is retirement?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.600
 Like how much should you have saved for retirement?

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.920
 All these things that like, I don't know,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.920
 I'm getting ready to turn 40.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.880
 I'm like, I just had my 39th birthday.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.280
 So I'm on my last year of my 30s

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.280
 and all these like morbid thoughts of my mortality

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.960
 or creeping into my brain.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.480
 But it's kind of like in the same vein of like,

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.600
 you get older and suddenly like,

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.040
 you just won't settle for stuff that you would have settled.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.240
 Is that why people get paid more every year

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.080
 as they get older?

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.600
 Like, I have these like weird hang ups with this stuff.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.560
 Like I've always been so upset about how,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.040
 oh, if you live in San Francisco,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.960
 you get paid more because it's more expensive there.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.320
 Well, that's your choice.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.560
 I don't want to live in San Francisco.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.480
 And if you want to live there,

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.280
 then you're just gonna have worse lifestyle.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.480
 Cause you, I don't know.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.240
 I've always been hung up on like,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.160
 people getting paid differently because they're older

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.400
 or because they're living in a certain place.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.120
 But now I'm kind of starting to understand it, I guess,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.960
 is what I'm saying.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.560
 That was a big rambly thing.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.880
 - Well, I mean, people get paid more when they're older

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.200
 cause ideally you're like better at your job.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.920
 I know it's not always true.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.320
 It's often not true, you know,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.520
 like in my previous job I was doing a lot of interviews.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.960
 It was a, I talked about it before.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.160
 I think the issue that I saw with getting older

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.840
 and getting paid more was after like 10 to 15 years

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.280
 of experience adding another 15 years of experience on top.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.480
 Unless you're like being really smart about it,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.920
 like doesn't add up to anything.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.480
 So you're already senior enough by like,

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.720
 you know, 15 years of experience.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.080
 The 25 years of experience doesn't like do anything.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.000
 - You've kind of like peaked at 15 years

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.320
 is what you're saying?

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.160
 - Like you're in your prime.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.800
 I mean, at least in a certain vein of software engineering,

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.920
 like it can only absorb so many years.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.640
 Like I can't, you can't become better at certain things

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.040
 unless you start to branch out.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.140
 And a lot of people don't branch out.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.160
 So yeah, and that in this case,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.800
 I'm like, you should get paid more.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.900
 But the cost of living thing and people bring this up.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.320
 I know that's how it's phrased,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.360
 but that's not really why companies are paying more.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.400
 They're paying more 'cause they have to.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.560
 They're never gonna pay more than--

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.400
 - Yeah.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.240
 - No, right.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.720
 It's competing.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.040
 - Yeah, like, I mean, the cities are so efficient, right?

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.520
 There's so many companies there.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.640
 There's so many pooled resources.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.240
 There's so many people there.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.400
 I mean, we're talking about this other day

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.400
 where I'm like, wow, any career that services other people,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.800
 in a city, your customer base is just gigantic

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.200
 and you become rich automatically.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.400
 So I think all the numbers just get higher.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.680
 Like if you're a plumber and there's 100 people

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.400
 in your town versus a million people in your city,

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.400
 sure there's more competition,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.640
 but like, you know, that kind of adds up non-linearly.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.800
 So that's why cities, people in cities make more money.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.960
 And you know, you can choose to live there too, Adam.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.720
 - It's true, I could.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.560
 I don't want to.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.880
 I'm not an anti-city, like I--

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.840
 - It's so funny 'cause you're--

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.920
 - Both you and Casey from what I know about you guys,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.320
 like all the amenities of a city are literally catered

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.440
 for people like you.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.280
 - I know.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.000
 - And I find it funny that you guys don't live in a city.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.200
 Like, I feel like it is interesting.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.320
 - Where I live, you would actually take more advantage

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.640
 of the stuff that's available than I do.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.160
 - Yeah, there's stuff we wish we had in life

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.520
 that we don't because of where we live.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.760
 I just, I guess I can't imagine,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.520
 I guess what your situation, you live in Miami,

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.640
 but it doesn't feel like you live in a city, like--

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.800
 - No, yeah, it's not gonna live in New York anymore.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.120
 - Yeah, I just can't, it blows my mind,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.200
 I can't fathom living in like Manhattan.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.480
 Like when we go to New York for something,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.320
 if you're walking down the street

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.640
 and you see people pushing like a stroller,

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.920
 it just blows my mind to think like,

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.760
 - Yeah, it's crazy.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.640
 - People live here and they raise their family

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.880
 in these nasty-ass streets.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.760
 I just can't imagine, but I get it.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.080
 Like, it's not as bad as I probably make it out to be,

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.280
 but I mean, it's one of those things

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.000
 that you just get used to anything.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.880
 But I will say, when me and Liz went back

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.880
 this last time and she was pregnant,

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.240
 we were looking around being like,

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.480
 all the stuff that we're very used to,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.360
 we were like, oh, it'd actually be really weird

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.960
 to have a stroller in this situation.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.720
 And we're like, it's just like,

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.480
 we could like really visualize it,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.960
 now that we're about to have a kid.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.160
 And yeah, I don't know how people do it.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.040
 That's how we have friends that do it.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.480
 And yeah, everyone just gets used to anything.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.800
 - I would just be so like on edge.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.720
 - And that's what it was, it was an on edge thing.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.160
 'Cause I'm used to doing that for myself in New York.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.240
 And to be fair, like 99.9% of the time in New York City,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.520
 there's nothing crazy going on.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.280
 You're surrounded by like 100 normal people.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.120
 So even if there's like one crazy person around,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.120
 like there's 100 people that are gonna help you.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.480
 But every once in a while, you turn a corner

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.240
 and you end up on a block that's empty

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.000
 and there's one person.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.360
 And I do that thing where you like are walking faster than them

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.280
 and eventually you'll go buy them.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.720
 And there's a community of, you know, feel it.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.680
 And then I saw that happening.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.320
 So we were in a situation like that,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.600
 but there was a parent with like a small kid.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.560
 And I was like, man, I do not want to be in a situation.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.400
 - Yeah.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.160
 - Yeah, that's like way more vulnerable.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.920
 - Okay, so this is an interesting conversation that came.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.440
 I mean, it's interesting we're having this conversation

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.320
 just right after something in my life.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.200
 We go, so mama jeans, you know, mama jeans.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.000
 It's like the name of the grocery store here.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.520
 Yeah. (laughs)

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.080
 They have like a brunch on Sundays at one of their locations

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.480
 and we go sometimes and it's the mama jeans.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.480
 There's three mama jeans.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.120
 There's two of them in great locations.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.720
 One in a not so great location,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.320
 which it's right across the street from Bass Pro Shops.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.560
 Some people know of Springfield because of Bass Pro Shops.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.520
 It's the original Bass Pro anyway.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.560
 Right across from Bass Pro,

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.560
 there is a mama jeans where they have brunch.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.240
 And it's the rough part of Springfield.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.800
 It's like the not great part.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.800
 And actually Springfield, kind of a shithole.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.680
 Like number, it's like a,

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.120
 - I was going on the mission at the other day.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.040
 And I don't know if I don't know if Springfield

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.840
 or if it was like the specific town you live in.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.560
 And the first picture that came up, I was like,

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.960
 it was like of a shitty intersection.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.080
 I'm like, is that, how is that the first picture

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.080
 that comes up?

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.120
 Like a shitty intersection was like

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.280
 with like some rundown building.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.320
 So I'm like, why is that the photo?

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.160
 - Yeah.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.120
 - Well, Springfield's like really bad on the crime index.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.480
 Like it's whatever the worst crime index you can have.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.320
 Springfield has it.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.560
 It's like terrible like against children crimes

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.400
 and like violent crime.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.360
 It's like not good stuff.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.960
 It's like bad stuff.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.920
 So Springfield is like, has a reputation,

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.640
 especially North Springfield is just rough.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.800
 Like you don't, there's just something getting shot every day.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.640
 It's on the news.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.320
 It's just adorable.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.640
 Anyway, this is like the rough part of Springfield.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.200
 And there's a lot of homeless people

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.200
 that live on this little like sidewalk next to this mama jeans.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.320
 And you don't realize until like,

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.920
 I mean, until you have kids that they don't know

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.760
 what a homeless person, like what does that mean?

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.600
 homeless person?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.880
 Like we live in a nice neighborhood and like,

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.680
 there's no homeless people in suburbs in the Ozarks.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.120
 Like that's not a thing.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.640
 But this area of Springfield is kind of where they congregate.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.560
 If I say something insensitive or something, I don't know.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.280
 It's just like a thing you can't talk about.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.280
 - No, it's fine.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.320
 - I just never know what, I don't know.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.400
 I had to like explain to my 10 year old,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.240
 like there was a, there was something that happened.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.080
 What was it?

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.480
 Like just the getting into the car,

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.080
 not wanting to leave him outside or something.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.800
 It was just like, oh no,

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.400
 it was the bathrooms that this mama jeans have a code on them.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.760
 You can't just like get into the bathroom.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.880
 You have to like get a code to get in.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.200
 And he's like, why do I have a code on them?

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.040
 Like, that's probably cause there's a lot of homeless people

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.560
 here and they don't want them just like wandering

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.800
 into the bathroom.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.200
 He's like, why not?

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.080
 And I'm like, how do you explain this?

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.920
 Yeah, it's okay.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.760
 - Why not?

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.440
 And I was like, well, yeah, there's layers to it.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.360
 It's like, well, cause I just don't want homeless people

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.720
 coming into the store, I guess.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.920
 And like, why not?

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.320
 This is like a hundred wise.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.760
 And I just have to dig down deeper.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.320
 It's like, I guess cause we're just afraid of homeless people.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.840
 And like, yeah, I'm afraid of homeless people.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.680
 I don't know.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.200
 Are you afraid of homeless people in your island?

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.920
 Is that normal or am I like--

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.280
 - No, no, it's definitely normal.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:36.720
 I think the thing with, it's like there's two kinds.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.480
 Most of them are fine, but then some of them are like mentally ill

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.200
 and like they're chaotic or like potentially violent.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.800
 Like we've had some weird situations.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.800
 Someone like can't, this was really stupid.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.800
 This was walking Zuko, who was a big scary doorman.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.600
 And a homeless guy like walked up really close to them.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.880
 And like, Zuko was like in guard mode.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.800
 And then he like freaked out.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.240
 And I'm like, ah, get the dog away from me.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.440
 But I'm like, why did you walk up to--

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.640
 - Why did you get close to?

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.480
 - Yeah.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.240
 And now he's like freaked out by this.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.360
 Like he's like always giving us like dirty looks whenever

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.800
 we see them.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.840
 But yeah, some of them are really unpredictable.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.120
 - Well, when we were in New York,

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.800
 like the terminal crew, when we were in New York,

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.960
 there's someone like on that block

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.000
 that was stabbed by a homeless person

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.240
 or like multiple people.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.040
 - Oh, yeah, that was great, that was really random.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.600
 That was really random.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.680
 Some guy was gonna run inside and people, yeah.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.360
 Yeah, just one of those things where you think about like,

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.080
 think about actually ending up homeless.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.640
 It's a pretty extreme case because if everything went

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.080
 to shit in my life, a complete shit,

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.280
 there's like so many layers of people

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.840
 that would be able to help me.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.680
 - Like support you.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.880
 - Yeah, like stay at their house or whatever.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.520
 And I would say most people have that.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.960
 And some people are unfortunate where they don't have it.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.400
 So it's a pretty extreme situation

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.440
 where they're either so mentally ill

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.960
 that nobody that they know like wants anything to do with them.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.640
 So then the people that end up there are like often

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.680
 in that type of situation.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.120
 So yeah, I get why people are scared of them.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.840
 Plus being in New York, like 9% of them totally fine.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.880
 Every once in a while, there's a guy flinging around

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.160
 like a wood stick, like, homeless people.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.240
 So yeah, okay, you just never know.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.360
 - Yeah, that's interesting.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.360
 I like, I don't wanna be overly protective

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.080
 or overly like, I don't know.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.120
 Just trying to explain to your kid

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.080
 is it's just like, you have to start questioning,

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.120
 why do I have all the things that I have in my brain

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:40.960
 about this?

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.480
 Did my mom like get me overly scared

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.320
 about homeless people?

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.960
 And I'm like, I mean, I have literally see,

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.400
 I've had personal living in New York.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.720
 I've had so many personal experiences.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.400
 So it's like, I haven't had their limb.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.720
 So it's interesting.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.840
 - I mean, like saying it's true.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.680
 So anyway, just moving on.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.520
 - Well, that's funny, bring this up.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.840
 - I totally forgot it's happening.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.320
 So I went to the gym this morning and I was driving.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.400
 And I looked to my left and every single street

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.240
 has a cop car blocking it.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.120
 And I realized I'm hearing a helicopter.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.840
 There's a cops everywhere, basically.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.320
 I was like, what is going on?

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.840
 When I went to the gym and I forgot about it

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.480
 and Liz texted me that there's current,

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.680
 she was like, there's a fast and furious situation

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.400
 going on in her neighborhood right now.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.920
 And I was like, what?

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.360
 She's like, somebody stole a car.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.080
 And, but then like, couldn't get away.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.400
 And now it's like hiding somewhere.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.360
 Like, you know that like downtown area

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.640
 where I live, these are hiding somewhere.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.840
 So everyone's like locking their doors

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.000
 and hiding inside in case they're like,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.880
 geez, hiding their house.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.880
 But it's just funny to me because there's no proof

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.760
 that you live in a nice neighborhood.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.360
 But the best proof, I think, is a police response.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.480
 'Cause this is one vehicle theft.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.200
 And there's like a million dollars of deployment

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.300
 going on right now.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.160
 (laughing)

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.200
 Like there's, there's a little fly helicopter

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.040
 around this area.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:03.880
 - That's amazing.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.720
 - There's a cop car everywhere.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.080
 Oh, you could not feel safer.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.560
 (laughing)

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.760
 It's just like they always materialize it in nowhere.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.680
 - Yeah.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.160
 - And I always wonder how this works.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.760
 Like, is it that this area has like,

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.760
 'cause we all pay taxes to Miami City.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.320
 And then they like pull that,

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.560
 but then do they basically like redirect a lot more money

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.880
 into like our police department?

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.240
 And is that why we get more or is it like just,

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.240
 is it totally just like,

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.600
 everyone knows it's a nice neighborhood.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.840
 So whenever something happens,

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.600
 the chief is like, definitely sent a lot of people there.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.960
 - That's what I'm getting at.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.560
 - It's like, it's a nice neighborhood.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.360
 Do they get more police resources?

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.320
 That seems like, how do they make that decision?

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.960
 And like, I don't know.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.280
 - Yeah, it's like, it's confusing.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.520
 But it's always a case.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.840
 Like anywhere you live, that's nice,

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.800
 especially in this city.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.600
 Any little thing happens.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.880
 Infinite police show up.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.040
 Like they just materialize.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.040
 Like they come up out of the ground.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.360
 It's wild how they show up so quickly.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.840
 - Well, it's also just interesting.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.320
 I'm not lived in a city.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.240
 Like you paid city taxes.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.480
 It's to the city of Miami.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.960
 There's not like individual.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.520
 - No, property taxes, those are property taxes.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.560
 I don't pay any city taxes.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.640
 There's no city taxes in Miami.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.560
 - Oh, well, that's, yeah, that's Florida, I guess.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.200
 But like normally, you live in a very specific

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.520
 little neighborhood in the broader city of Miami.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.080
 They don't collect taxes individually.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.920
 These little like neighborhoods?

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.920
 - No, so you pay your property tax to your state, I think.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.040
 - Oh.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.280
 - I guess this is different everywhere.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.880
 - I'm pretty sure it's, yeah.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.800
 'Cause I'm pretty sure New Jersey,

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.080
 like I'm thinking about New Jersey.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.520
 - Actually, no, maybe it's to your--

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.120
 - We pay a property tax to our city or our county.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.920
 - Maybe it's a county, maybe it's something like that.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.480
 And in our case, the county is the city.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.840
 Yeah, and I guess they redirect.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.240
 They like pull it and they figure out

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.480
 how to allocate resources.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.920
 I'm sure it's not like one to one.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.120
 I'm sure like they are like trying to make it

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.280
 a little more fair and like using some of the resources

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.680
 from like the nicer neighborhoods in other places.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.480
 But it's not that extreme because like, yeah.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.280
 - Clearly we got like a crazy one to where anything happens.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.800
 - Have you ever done software stuff with like,

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.880
 have you ever written software for like mapping stuff

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.400
 where you're doing like census tracks and blocks?

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.160
 And like there's so many different arbitrary names

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.480
 for like different circles.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.720
 It's like bigger or smaller circles

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.440
 or just like how many people are in it.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.360
 There's, it like seems that when you really think about it,

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.640
 like what is it county?

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.920
 Like a county is just like a tiny state.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.080
 It's all made up.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.800
 - Yeah. I mean, it's really confusing for us

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.160
 because there's Miami, which is the city,

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.640
 then there's Miami-Dade, which is the county,

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.160
 which includes Miami, the city.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.600
 But like it also includes more than just Miami,

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.000
 the technical city.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 But there's like a mayor of Miami, the city

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.120
 who's like really visible.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.120
 But he's just kind of like a puppet mayor.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.480
 There's like a real mayor of like Miami-Dade.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.800
 It's very confusing.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.720
 - It's very convenient. - The Miami mayor,

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.240
 the city mayor, he's like this tan guy

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.160
 that's like totally onto Sauceron, like looks jacked.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.760
 And he's just like never doing anything besides just like

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.200
 be like Miami, it's awesome.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.760
 - Yeah, we're cutting ribbons.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.360
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.120
 And the other person is just like doing the,

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.680
 okay, we got to balance the budget and, you know.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.480
 - Yeah, actual work.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.560
 - I think it's a great setup.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.520
 I think every place you have two mayors.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.320
 One is like the mascot for the city.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.840
 You can go to the ones like running the city.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.840
 I think it's a good setup.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.840
 - I want to talk about just your observation the other day

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.800
 on the phone about like Twitter cycles

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.280
 and the AI cycle that we're in.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.520
 'Cause I, you missed one too.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.280
 You pointed out like right now we're in this very AI

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.120
 centric circle.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.600
 And it's like you don't hear anything on Twitter

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.000
 unless it's about AI.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.200
 And then before that it was, what was the one before that?

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.480
 - I said front and frameworks.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.720
 Front and frameworks, there was also like the serverless era.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.040
 - I was thinking, I was trying to figure,

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.360
 I was like trying to decouple the front and serverless stuff.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.560
 I can't, I don't remember exactly.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.120
 'Cause yeah, there was a time where everybody was just arguing

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.120
 about serverless sucks or like serverless is great.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.800
 Like that was like every other conversation.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.640
 I do remember that.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.960
 - I think that was before the front and framework era.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:22.640
 And then before that was, well, the joke I made was

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.320
 it was just Deborah was talking about.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.320
 - No, yeah, Deborah.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.760
 - There was a Deborah era.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.360
 That was kind of in the serverless era.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.680
 I feel like that was my early days on Twitter,

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.760
 like where I'm really sorry,

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.000
 paying attention to Twitter.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.400
 And like when we met even was kind of that period.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.400
 - Yeah, there was a lot more cloud infra stuff around then.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.720
 Yeah, you know what's funny?

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.040
 I think this is making me realize like,

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.520
 you know how there are certain music artists

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.680
 that were really popular for a couple years and fade away?

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.440
 And there's others that are just like somehow still doing it.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.280
 - That's an element.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.400
 - So yeah, making stuff.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.520
 And I always would think about that.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.040
 I'm like, Dan, it's so hard.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.800
 'Cause I point this out with Kanye all the time.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.600
 'Cause any, you take any like artists

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.200
 that got popular for a while.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.480
 Shortly after they get popular,

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.880
 Kanye will do a collab with them.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.800
 And there's like a song with the two of them.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.320
 I never hear from them again.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.720
 You literally never hear from them again.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.600
 It's like, I feel like he just like sucks.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.440
 - The Kanye curse.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.640
 - Yeah, he just like sucks up.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.880
 It's like the, what's it called, the space jam.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.960
 He's just like just sucking up their time.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.960
 - Oh yeah, there's so many examples of this.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.440
 But yeah, that's how he stays relevant.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.280
 Like he just, yeah, he makes sure that he doesn't,

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.960
 he's like, you know, in there with everyone.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.520
 But he's like, you know, always around.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.480
 Obviously he's crazy now, but it's like that.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.600
 'Cause I remember there's certain people that I could remember

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.080
 with these eras where they were like really tied

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.800
 to whatever the thing that was being talked about.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.000
 But then when the thing, when the trend shifted,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.440
 it's not like they were generally tied to technology.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.560
 They were tied to a specific technology.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.240
 And when I tie it shifted, I just stopped seeing them entirely.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.560
 And then we shift again and then we knew people

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.400
 and then we shift again.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.760
 But there's other people that like, you know,

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.320
 get interested in each little thing and kind of,

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.040
 and then they keep seeing them.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.000
 So on one hand, I was like, it's really hard

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.360
 to be a musician like that.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.040
 But then seeing it from this perspective,

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.520
 I'm like, I guess if you have a type of person

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.200
 that's just broadly interested in stuff,

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.280
 it's kind of natural 'cause you kind of follow the trend as well.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:31.280
 Can we talk about the AI cycle a little bit self-reflectively?

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.360
 I don't know if that's the word.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.840
 Self-aware, Lee.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.760
 Should we introspect?

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.600
 Is that what you're saying?

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.480
 Yeah, can we like look at it from an angle

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.760
 that's maybe not the angle people working on

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.480
 an AI harness would approach it.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.880
 But it's feelings I've had,

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.680
 and I wanna just like say them out loud.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.560
 Yeah, do you wonder about the,

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.520
 like nothing seems to escape the Gartner cycle or whatever.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.240
 Like obviously there's an extreme amount of attention

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.480
 and excitement and hype and VC funding

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.160
 and whatever in the AI space.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.280
 There's no way it's gonna avoid being overhyped.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.920
 Doesn't mean it's not still incredibly useful and valuable

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.600
 somewhere on that curve.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.280
 But I do wonder, here's what I wonder.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.000
 I'm starting to have these feelings of like,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.040
 I miss just programming.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.720
 Like just normal programming.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.640
 Like where I didn't have any help

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.520
 and I just had to figure shit out and Google stuff

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.520
 and stack overflow or whatever.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.240
 Like I kind of miss some of that stuff

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.920
 and I wonder like, is that gonna be a thing

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.640
 other people are gonna feel in mass?

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.320
 And that's what the Gartner cycle is gonna look like.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.880
 Like is there gonna be this pullback from AI assistants

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.080
 where I know there's people who've been

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.880
 kind of like nay savers all along.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.080
 I'm not saying like they're right.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.960
 I'm just saying like, is there gonna be this like,

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.400
 longing for the old times?

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.360
 - I think that I would probably agree that.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.320
 Yeah, so I think when people think about hype cycles,

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.840
 they think about in terms of like,

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.960
 people hyping something up and setting expectations

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.840
 and then going back down.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.360
 But I think you're right that,

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.400
 there's also like a usage cycle that happens.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.240
 - Yeah.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.040
 - Where people try to use it for everything

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.800
 and they overuse it and they like show it everywhere.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.800
 So I think in terms of coding,

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.200
 I think we're past like the pure hype cycle thing.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.880
 I think people hyping stuff up and saying stuff is,

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.200
 it's gonna be crazy and it's gonna change

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.680
 every six months like that type of thing.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.240
 I think we're past that.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.120
 But I think we're in the middle of

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.880
 the way people are using it.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.040
 Because when I look at the way people use open code

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:44.160
 or quad code, it's so different to how I use it.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.600
 Like I work on this thing and I use it every day.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.040
 I use it very slightly.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.760
 It's like a really nice addition to everything else I'm doing.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.760
 But so many people are like digging into like,

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.960
 trying to make it do so much.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.640
 And I never really got that interested in doing that.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.200
 - Yeah, I think that's what is like,

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.680
 we from our perspective see all the crazy shit

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.920
 people wanna do.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.120
 And I think it's that that's making me disenchanted

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.880
 with like some of the extreme cases people are,

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.320
 I mean, it's like everybody knows

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.760
 that we've talked about the cases of the people running

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.880
 like 10 parallel instances of a AI thing.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.160
 And it's like, I generated 14,000 lines of code today.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.920
 And I don't wanna like side with Paul Graham

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.700
 and his weird tweets about like,

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:32.080
 it's like I had a founder tell me he writes 10,000 lines

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.520
 of code and they're perfect every day.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.440
 Like there's just something about all this,

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.840
 the usage of these tools that smells funny to me.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.400
 Like I think people are going too far

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.080
 and trying to like, I don't know, overthink it.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.080
 I think the way you use it is the way I wanna use it

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.960
 which is refreshing and I get sucked into using it

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.560
 in some of these other dumb ways.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.920
 And I'm like, that's when I start to feel gross

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.280
 and I just wanna go back to the old ways.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.440
 - I mean, it's like this with any technology, right?

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.480
 You like, I'll give you a really simple example.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.080
 I told those before, someone recommended to me

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.920
 to read the book Art of Postgres SQL.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.840
 So I read the book Art of Postgres SQL

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.600
 and it fucked me up for like a year like the idea.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.160
 But it's a good book, it's useful to read

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.640
 'cause it gives you an engineering perspective.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.280
 They basically show you how all this stuff

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.520
 that you're doing in code,

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.520
 the database can actually just do for you

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.440
 and return final result.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.720
 So people tend to, the argument was people tend

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.960
 to do stuff in code 'cause they, it's like familiar to them

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.640
 but it's more performant and like,

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.160
 there's a bunch of other reasons why you should like

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.360
 pass it into the database and have it do everything.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.480
 So for a year, even though I was like,

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.480
 even when I finished the book, I decided like,

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:49.240
 oh, this isn't for me, it's still stuck in my head

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.560
 where anytime I did something in code in the application layer,

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.080
 I thought I was doing something wrong.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.360
 It like over rotated me into trying to do way too much

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.840
 in the database and there's something wrong with that

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.400
 and like some people do that and it's fine.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.040
 It just wasn't for me.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.880
 So I think that's like any technology,

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.120
 you can't ever like use it the exact right amount.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.120
 Like you have to overuse it

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.560
 and then kind of pull it back.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.160
 - And then come back interesting, yeah.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.120
 Well, I also, I think it's coupled with feelings.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.600
 Like I played around with V zero

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.440
 because I wanted to, I mean,

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.720
 it's not like a secret work on a desktop app, right?

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.120
 Like I wanted to see other tools play with,

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.480
 I've heard good things about V zero.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.360
 So I kind of like got into V zero

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.520
 and just tried to like vibe code something.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.280
 You had talked about doing this and I was just very curious.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.760
 I'm pretty out on the current state of vibe coding.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.080
 I'm not played with level or bolt or any of these,

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.960
 but I can't imagine they have more success than V zero.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.240
 I feel like V zero seems great at what it does.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.800
 But like building something where you don't touch the code.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.200
 - It's kind of, I do not understand.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.480
 - I don't understand how anyone's getting anything out of that.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.800
 - Yeah, same, it makes absolutely zero sense.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.480
 I, that thing that I built with V zero was actually awesome

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.240
 because it's a tiny little utility

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.320
 that nobody's gonna build or maintain for me

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.800
 that like figment for the two E thing.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.920
 That's perfect.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.400
 But like sometimes I would tell it to do something

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.120
 and it would totally break the whole app.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.120
 Like everything would just be broken.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:20.960
 - Same experience.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.880
 - Yeah.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.080
 Like that means from underneath at all,

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.720
 if adding one feature can break everything

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.200
 in such an intense way,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.240
 whatever that thing, like the way that's built

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.560
 is like definitely not, not good.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.960
 - Yeah, so like these people trying to build their SaaS business

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.480
 or whatever, like they're gonna just become

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.280
 this technical founder because they have this tool.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.440
 I am totally out on that.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.200
 And it made me feel really good about being a software engineer

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.680
 in terms of job prospects.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.880
 Like it's not going away, not yet.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.560
 - Yeah, but for like prototyping or like making

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.520
 these little utilities, like I'm really excited

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.120
 that that exists because my reflex has always been,

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.160
 I did this with this figment for the two E thing.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.440
 It's always been post the idea on X,

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.040
 see if I don't want bytes and like make something.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:05.880
 - Yeah.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.600
 - But then now, when I post that,

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.000
 somebody was like, dude, just vibe code it.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.620
 And I was like, that's a really good point.

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.460
 - That's a good idea.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.400
 - And I took you 15 minutes and it's great.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.240
 I'm glad this exists.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.080
 And this is awesome.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.360
 And I think playing with design ideas

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.960
 or like product or UX ideas is pretty interesting.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:25.160
 But I don't understand anyone talking

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.760
 about using this for anything else.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.920
 It like breaks the whole app breaks so often.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.960
 And you just hit undo and you're like,

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.280
 should I try again?

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.000
 Or like, should I just go on this feature?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.520
 'Cause this feature like, it just gets confused

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.360
 and breaks the whole app.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.240
 I've done that, I did that with a few features in that app.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.560
 I like wanted certain stuff and it just kept breaking.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.920
 So I just gave up on the feature even existed, you know?

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.120
 There's just so much grift going on.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.760
 And I feel like there's so many people trying to like

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.280
 carve out this like, you can be a one man software company

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.800
 niche and like, it just feels very fake.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.720
 I don't know.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.840
 - Yeah, but I do love the use of it for like,

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.000
 the Figma Tui thing that you built like is a good example.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.280
 I think like people have seen make browser extensions

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.880
 like personal software like, like I want a Mac app

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.280
 that runs in the toolbar that does something for me.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.440
 And I'm not trying to distribute it.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.920
 I'm not trying to like, grow it into something.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.080
 I think for when there's a very limited like scope,

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.640
 a very finite endpoint, that makes a ton of sense.

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.320
 I do love it for that.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.240
 There's a lot of good stuff that I feel like

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:30.680
 the current state of the models makes life better.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.600
 Like doing sys admin stuff on your machine,

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.560
 like your dot files.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.840
 I had it help me with some stuff in my dot files.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.520
 It just like, I enjoy customizing my machine

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:45.200
 and tweaking with stuff, but I don't enjoy the time sync

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.320
 and to the extent that the model can make me faster

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.360
 doing some of those things, love it.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.840
 And then the way you use open code, I think I knew,

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.720
 I need to like, watch you more.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.960
 You need to make something.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.600
 'Cause I still feel like I get carried away

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.960
 with my usage of it and I do too much relying on it.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.400
 And I know you have this workflow down.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.200
 That's kind of like, it's your little junior dev

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.120
 sitting next to you.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.440
 I need to get more into that.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:12.520
 - I was thinking about how to articulate this this morning.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.600
 'Cause I saw Prime's, Prime posted a few things

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.960
 about being frustrated with how much time you waste

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.840
 on trying to get AI to do something.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.440
 And the examples he gave, I saw that when I was like,

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.840
 surprised, it was surprising to me

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.600
 'cause in my head, I'm like, Prime dislikes AI more than me,

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.800
 but he seems to go to it in times

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.520
 that I wouldn't even think to go to it.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.240
 And I'm trying to codify what are these situations?

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.720
 So there's some situations where I'm just like,

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.480
 I know exactly what needs to be done, it's just tedious.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.000
 AI's always gonna be great for that.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.240
 Like I know I can describe it correctly,

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.800
 I know if the results are right.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.240
 There's other times where I know what needs to be done,

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.680
 but not exactly how to do it.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.920
 Or I don't know it from memory.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.520
 So normally I would Google it

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.760
 and try to find something explaining how to do it

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.680
 or like a library, where I would look at the source

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.760
 and copy the code and stuff like that.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.480
 Then I tell it to do stuff, do that.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.880
 Or the third case is this new feature

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.000
 is identical to an old feature, minus a few things.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.520
 It's kind of the same thing as the first case,

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.040
 but that's another time I use it.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.600
 So an example of that is whenever we add a new concept

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.160
 to our config and open code, it's like,

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.360
 I write out the shape of the object myself,

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.800
 'cause I'm like thinking through how it should be.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.280
 I guess what the config object is.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.280
 But we need to support loading it from the config JSON,

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.120
 but also from a markdown file.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.800
 And also search up all that whole thing.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.120
 I just tell it to do that and it does that perfectly.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.120
 - Yeah, 'cause it's got that pattern, it can look at it.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.200
 So to me, it's almost like,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.480
 you take like this idea of snippets,

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.280
 which has been around forever.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.600
 And I never got into that

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.040
 'cause like all the same snippets is like,

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:54.880
 it's thought to be like,

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.120
 "No, who remembers to do that ever?"

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.760
 So this is like that on steroids.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.720
 - That's so funny, I forgot about,

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.000
 I remember feeling self-conscious

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.520
 that I didn't have custom snippets

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.200
 like in my Visual Studio era.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.480
 Like I just remember thinking like,

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.040
 oh man, people really gotta figure it out.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.080
 They're making all their snippets

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.560
 and saying it's so much time.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.000
 They're probably spending just as much time

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.600
 on authoring snippets as I was coding.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.600
 So it nets out.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.840
 But that's how I feel about like cursor rules now.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.160
 It's like, oh man, people really know how to use AI

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.480
 and I don't, I just, I'm dumb and I just say.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.080
 - That's actually another good point about the,

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.160
 'cause we're talking about over usage,

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.000
 this obsession with,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.360
 'cause this whole like agents.md standardization,

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.160
 people are arguing like,

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.040
 oh, it's too simple, it needs to do more.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.360
 And I'm just like,

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.760
 one, the LM barely pays attention to these rules.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.240
 It really, they don't really work that well.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.400
 And people spend so much time like authoring these rules

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.240
 and like trying to create.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.040
 So I'm just like, I feel like you guys are over using it.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.160
 If it worked better, then yeah,

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.360
 maybe I invest more time in it,

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.640
 but it just doesn't care about what you put in there.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.680
 - Yeah, there's this real problem of like,

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.400
 everything is anecdotal and there's no way

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.600
 to know what works better.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.480
 And like everybody thinks they're set up.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.040
 I mean, there's people, not everybody.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.720
 Some people like me think my setup is terrible.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.440
 But a lot of people that are really convinced

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.040
 their setup is the way.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.160
 And there's no way for them to really show

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.640
 that it's better because it's like so context specific,

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:22.200
 like my workflow feels good to me.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.400
 That's about as the most you can say.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.240
 - Yeah.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.000
 - I think the GoSoup Coder stuff is,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.760
 it's an interesting tangent on this conversation where like,

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.760
 even the people deploying these open source models

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.880
 don't really know if they're doing a good job.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.600
 Until somebody came along and was like,

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.400
 hey, for at least for this use case,

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.000
 you're doing a pretty shady job.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.080
 You should do better.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.040
 Like we're gonna make this harness

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:47.360
 that like tests real world programming tasks.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.480
 And that's like the first feedback

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.920
 that these people deploying these models

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.880
 and trying to sell inference on these models.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.200
 It's like the first feedback they've gotten.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.120
 - Yeah, it's crazy.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:59.360
 It's crazy that they've had these models up for a while.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.240
 That's one, that's one thing that's crazy.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.960
 Two, it's crazy there's been a bunch of tools

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.920
 that plug into these models.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.920
 And just now, like literally as of today

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.400
 is the first time it's getting improved.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.720
 I'm like, how has no one brought this up before?

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.040
 It actually just took a week.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.720
 Like goes a quarter, posted it.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.160
 Was it the beginning of this week?

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.040
 Or like the end of the last week posted it.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.120
 I said, I talked about it and I was like,

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.520
 we're in the market for provider.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.160
 Anyone that can fix this, we want to talk to.

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.040
 It's been a couple of days and they just fixed it.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.800
 It took one week of focus and it's now like, you know.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.520
 - Every dev knows like when you don't have a feedback loop,

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.480
 you're just in the dark and you can't make stuff better.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.400
 And they just didn't have a feedback loop.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.280
 And now they kind of do.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.200
 - It's kind of surprising.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.600
 The other thing I want to say about this anecdotal thing is,

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.600
 I've talked about this before,

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:52.000
 but I realized I never connected it to this context.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.920
 Whenever you switch your workflow,

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.120
 doesn't matter what it is, you switch to a new editor.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.240
 You get a new monitor, you switch to a new OS.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.280
 You feel a crazy productivity boost

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.160
 just because things are a little more exciting.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.040
 Everything feels like you're going faster.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.720
 Everything feels like it's better.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.720
 And it's all that's happening with all these people being like,

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.240
 I switched to this new coding tool and like, wow,

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.320
 like it's great or like, wow, I'm going so fast.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.800
 You're like, oh, I added this new thing

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.800
 where I'm using this new pattern

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.800
 with these AI coding tools and it works really well.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.800
 It's just like people need to understand

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.440
 there's a crazy bias when you invent a new workflow.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.040
 You're just loving it for the novelty.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.880
 And you're probably like, you're more plugged in.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.960
 So you probably are getting more done

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.920
 'cause you're more excited to that point.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.000
 - Yeah, it's a real temporary productivity boost

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.360
 but any change would give you that.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.600
 - Yeah, you could rotate your monitor.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.120
 - I change my color scheme sometimes

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.600
 and I'm just pumped for like two days.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.120
 Like this looks awesome.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.120
 I am so into this.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.200
 - It's actually a good thing.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.160
 - That's why I think people should spend more time tweaking

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.520
 their setup because it's like a free boost

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.520
 every couple of months or so.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.360
 You can manage it.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.000
 - Yeah, it just, it gets a little like,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.240
 it has a little spice to life.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.040
 Like when you've just been looking at the same editor

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.600
 for a while and then you change things up a little bit.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.600
 - Mm.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.440
 Yeah.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.280
 - Feels good.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.120
 - Exactly.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.840
 - Keyboard, sometimes I just use a different keyboard.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.680
 - That feels nice.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:12.520
 - Yeah.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.280
 Like I switched to this Mac Studio now a couple of weeks ago

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.120
 and I'm like,

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.120
 - Oh yeah, Mac Studio.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.560
 - I'm like, whoa, this is all great.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.560
 - I'm about to ask you, how do you like it?

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.760
 - To be honest, I feel like I'm going slower and I am

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.080
 because I'm just not as used to.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.960
 - Well, so you're running on your desktop.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.320
 You're running Mac OS now?

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.080
 - Yeah, I'm still using Arch for like,

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.600
 basically everything but my entry point is no.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.440
 - Oh, 'cause your server is.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.520
 - My server is, yeah.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.240
 - Your server is Arch.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.080
 - Yeah.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.320
 - And you still just SSH into your server to do everything.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.840
 - Yeah, so the only thing outside of that is

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.520
 Discord browser slack.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.680
 - Yeah, so your browser now, are you using,

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.600
 well, I have so many questions.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.680
 Are you using a window manager in your Mac

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.520
 to manage your browser in a terminal session?

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.440
 - I tried, I tried a few window managers.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.240
 There's just like nothing like i3.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.840
 Like it's just i3 is so good.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.440
 And the second annoying thing is,

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.000
 I guess Mac OS doesn't have APIs to make the windows

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.840
 like Chrome-less.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.720
 So when I use a window manager, it feels like clunky,

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.440
 where I'm like, this just doesn't feel like

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.200
 this is a way Mac should be used.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.160
 So now I'm just like, I'm just full-screening

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.560
 every single app.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.640
 - Oh, really?

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.120
 And you do like the workspace thing?

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.400
 Like you swipe, no, not Mac OS, full-screening.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.560
 I'm just like, like I have the window.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.400
 - Oh, mm-hmm.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.560
 - And I just have a different hotkey bound

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.920
 to every one of my standard apps.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.760
 So like-

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.640
 - Oh, okay.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.400
 - Meta one, I don't know what the key is.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.120
 It's option one brings up my terminal option two

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.560
 brings up my browser option three brings up Slack option four

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.960
 brings up this code.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.600
 And that's like my like boot, like window manager.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.360
 I just built this on like raycast shortcuts.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.800
 - Oh, interesting.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.480
 - And they're all full-screened, but I'm gonna go deep

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.320
 into this.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.800
 So I currently have an ultra-wide monitor

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.360
 and it was great on Linux because I could cut it up

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.560
 into two virtual numbers.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.240
 - Yeah, like one of those curved ones?

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.080
 - It's not curved.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.320
 - It's not that crazy.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.240
 It's a 5K monitor that is, it's like a 4K monitor

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.400
 plus another third on the resolution.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:14.080
 Just, it's like the same DPI just extended.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:14.920
 - Okay.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:20.560
 - And on Linux, there were APIs to split a single monitor

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.320
 into two virtual monitors.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.040
 So my OS would see this as two monitors that were plugged in.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.320
 - Even though it was one physical monitor.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.680
 - Yeah, so I could have like,

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.080
 I could have independent control of this like left third.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.640
 And then independent control of like the main two thirds.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.880
 So everything we got main two thirds

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.240
 and I had like auxiliary stuff on that

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.360
 and I don't know if it's between them.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.000
 - That actually sounds really nice to be honest.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.640
 I feel like I need another third of a monitor.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.480
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.120
 - I'm struggling with like, I don't need a whole second monitor,

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.080
 but like another third would be really nice.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:49.920
 Sorry.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.760
 - Yeah, so I used to just put like Slack Discord,

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.880
 my browser there.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.600
 So my terminal would basically always be up

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.640
 and I would just like flip between those on the secondary

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:00.760
 screen.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.680
 So that was really nice on Mac OS is not possible to do this

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.200
 at all, which sucks.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.680
 So now I'm not even using that third.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.720
 I just like, I literally set all my windows to be

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.720
 just the main 4K space and I have like kind of something

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.880
 on there, but it's not usable.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.840
 So I now bought a new monitor.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.520
 All right, pre-order is not out yet,

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:28.400
 but it's for someone finally put out a competitor

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.080
 to the Mac OS studio display, the big one.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:31.920
 - Oh, really?

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.800
 - Yeah, it's like basically all the same specs,

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.840
 a lot of nice details and is 1400 as opposed to 5K.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.920
 - Yeah.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.120
 - So this is now just a normal, so it's a 6K screen.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.000
 So it's not ultra wide, it's like a normal dimension.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:45.840
 - Yeah.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.040
 - So when that comes, I'll just switch to that.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.000
 I'm just gonna be like a one app at a time,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.080
 full screen situation.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.000
 - Oh wow, okay.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:51.840
 What was this?

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.000
 So I never really asked what was the impetus

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.120
 to switch to the Mac studio?

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.560
 Like what drew you into that change?

00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.920
 - You were just tired of building your own PCs?

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:05.080
 - I wanted to simplify my desk.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.760
 It just, there's way too much on my desk.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.320
 - That's a big pro of the Mac stuff.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.040
 Like the studio just looks nice.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.040
 It takes up all the space.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:11.880
 - Yeah, it looks nice.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.640
 And then I had so much auxiliary equipment

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.240
 because of my desktop setup.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:19.480
 Like I had, okay, I had the DSLR camera,

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.280
 which needed like a dummy battery.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.200
 And we needed, it just had like so many wires and stuff.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.320
 If I got the Mac, I could use my iPhone.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.960
 So now I'm just using my iPhone on the camera.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.280
 So that simplified like a whole bunch of stuff on my desk.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:37.040
 I also just wanted to simplify all my media stuff

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.240
 on my like, my audio stuff as well.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.000
 Like my mic got simplified 'cause I'm able to use

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.440
 an interface that is nicer that works well with Mac.

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.640
 So yeah, that was a reason.

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.840
 And I think I basically traveled with my MacBook Air

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.240
 'cause I've been using my MacBook Air

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:56.360
 as agent to Linux and I basically don't miss anything.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.680
 All the things I love about Linux,

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:01.560
 I still get most of my days spent in Linux.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.680
 But like some of the just nice day to day stuff

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.360
 is better on Mac like, oh, like my text messages

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.100
 are on my computer now and all those integrations and stuff.

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:14.720
 So yeah, I'm pretty happy with the setup.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.400
 But yeah, some of these monitor things

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.120
 made my workflow a little bit worse.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:19.960
 - Yeah.

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:23.080
 Have you with the Mac studio, have you run any local models

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.200
 like LM studio?

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.580
 - Yeah, I did.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:29.200
 Yeah, so I did the Quen3Coder 30 billion.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.040
 Works super well, super fast.

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:35.400
 I'm pretty blown away by how literally the moment

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.000
 like Apple came out with this new architecture,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.220
 their M chips, they have this like integrated memory thing.

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:46.200
 They came out with that and two years later

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.920
 this local LM thing showed up as like the perfect use case.

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.760
 It really is.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.160
 - So it's kind of wild the timing of all that.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:55.720
 - Like at a minimum that Quen3Coder 30 billion

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.040
 feels like I should be using that for certain tasks,

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.960
 like for agents that are very specifically,

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.440
 I don't know like the task agent,

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.920
 like doing gripping and stuff,

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.640
 just like searching through files,

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.240
 that being or just being your small model in open code.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.560
 I feel like it's good enough to do that stuff.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.640
 And then it's just local and fast and free.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.640
 - Yeah. - Like, I mean, not that the small model

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.040
 is really costing you much, I guess,

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.400
 when you're doing like title generation

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.200
 or whatever in open code, we're getting into the weeds.

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.400
 But it does feel like at a minimum running a local model

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.120
 just to do those kind of stupid tasks.

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:33.440
 It's not your big brain model that's like doing more.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.240
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.800
 But maybe it's good enough for that, I don't know.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:41.000
 - Yeah, I mean, it's, I'm pretty like overall,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.080
 like the max video thing is really cool.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.880
 It's like a single box with like a single wire

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.560
 that comes out of it. So they have like their exact right ports.

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.320
 It's also fun to me, like this thing is so stripped down,

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.040
 but they still have an SD card slot.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.240
 Like the thing that they would never need.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.560
 - Yeah. - Like it's made for like,

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.440
 you know, creative, so like people get there.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.680
 But it's like the one special port they have in it up

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.440
 but besides that's a bunch of Thunderbolt things.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.960
 Yeah, it's $2,000 like I think that's totally reasonable

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.240
 for something that's good.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.240
 Yeah, so I'm pretty happy with it.

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:14.600
 I just wait, like I said, I wish window management on Mac,

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.400
 honestly on anywhere except for Linux,

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.720
 has like never really been figured out.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.120
 - Yeah, I use aerospace and it's funny, like,

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.200
 there's all kinds of weird quirks.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.640
 And it's probably just like you said,

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.680
 the limits of the Mac APIs or whatever.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.560
 Like it actually, when you use the multiple workspace thing

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.840
 in aerospace, it's actually just shoving all the windows

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.720
 down to the bottom right corner and like making them tiny.

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.640
 So you can kind of see them, like you can see the edge

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.520
 of them and you can actually grab one and pull it.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:46.400
 - It's just like very ghetto version

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.420
 of what a real window manager does, I guess.

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.160
 - That is funny.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.760
 - Yeah, I guess there's one of the right APIs.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.160
 But you know, I was able to get WES term to be

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.240
 bit chromeless and like edge to edge

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.160
 and it looks really nice.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.320
 - So make the WES term pitch.

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.480
 I see a lot of people really praising WES term.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.880
 I just, I thought ghosty was just like the one

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.000
 and just we all had been waiting for ghosty

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.320
 and now it's the best.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.320
 But WES term's better.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.640
 - No, I mean, ghosty is really good too.

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.680
 I think for me it was just that ghosty,

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:20.280
 I tried to use ghosty and it had a few bugs initially

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.720
 in their 1.0 around like clicking links

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.520
 in my specific setup.

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.800
 It was like some combination of like,

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.360
 if you remove all the window decoration stuff,

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.120
 like something messed up with the links, especially on Linux.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:31.960
 - Yeah.

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:32.800
 - And I just didn't feel like dealing with that.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.040
 So I went back to WES term.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:37.640
 The other thing is, is when I switched to WES term,

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.440
 I was also doing a bunch of new them config

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.600
 and they both use Lua, so there was just like a nice synergy

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.440
 there.

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.120
 Not that there's like a ton of config.

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:45.960
 I don't know.

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:50.200
 For me, it's just that it's basically as good as ghosty

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.120
 and I feel they're equivalent.

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.240
 I'm sure there's like technicalities

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.080
 that are different to them,

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.720
 but I could probably switch to ghosty and not tell.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.600
 - I've seen like a little resurgence

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:04.280
 or just like a little movement on Twitter around like,

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.080
 why are you still using Tmux?

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.080
 Like just ghosty has tabs.

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.480
 It's like people trying to make that.

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.880
 - That was the whole point of ghosty, right?

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:16.080
 Like, I mean, it is funny, like ghosty puts in all this effort

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.920
 of like parsing and see and rendering it really fast.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:24.680
 Just for you to run Tmux, which then does all that again.

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:28.360
 - I felt the pain as we've worked on these twoies,

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.560
 I felt the pain of having Tmux between the twoie

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:35.360
 and the emulator, because it just like intercepts certain stuff

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.800
 and breaks certain functionality.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.120
 Like a lot of people shift enders not working

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.720
 'cause they're using Tmux and you have to configure it

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.560
 to make it.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.400
 - Yeah, that's me.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.360
 - So, but my problem I guess,

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.880
 and maybe you know the answer to this right off the bat,

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.440
 like if I wanted to get away from Tmux,

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.320
 like I have reasons I would like to actually get away

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:54.400
 from Tmux, does ghosty, like I know I can open tabs,

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.120
 but like does it have this notion of like it's running

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.560
 outside, like if I close the ghosty window,

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.240
 am I killing all those processes?

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.120
 - Yeah, I'm pretty sure you are.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:07.320
 - Yeah, they don't have something equivalent to Tmux.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.200
 - Yeah, and for me, like I'm SSH 10,

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.960
 so like I can't use ghost.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:11.800
 - Oh.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.240
 - I have a new space session for each ghosty tab or whatever.

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.480
 So I have to use Tmux, like that's never gonna change.

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.120
 And the other thing is like the Tmux model of like

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:23.320
 their sessions, sessions have windows

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:24.440
 and then windows have panes

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.560
 and you can like run through between sessions.

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:29.200
 I don't think ghosty is set up with that exact structure.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.560
 I really like that.

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.480
 - I do too, yeah, I use each one of those things.

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.800
 I know you don't like the way I use panes and I zoom

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.360
 and do stupid stuff, but like I use,

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.720
 like I navigate through sessions, windows and panes

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.480
 and Tmux and I don't, yeah, I didn't think

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.680
 there was an equivalent ghosty, it's just you have tabs.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:46.520
 - Yeah.

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.160
 - And they're all just kind of laid out full stream.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.880
 - Well, I'd like to see, I think I've seen this somewhere.

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.600
 It was actually, maybe it's an I-term.

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.400
 It's like, I think it was like really random

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.680
 what terminal it was.

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:59.680
 There was some terminal that integrated with Tmux,

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:06.120
 but then like showed the splits natively in the,

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.480
 I don't remember exactly how it works,

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.560
 but what I would like is if my terminal somehow

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.600
 was like aware of my SSH session.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:18.200
 So it just created one SSH session at stage connection.

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:21.540
 And if I opened up like native tabs in my terminal,

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:24.440
 that should still just use one SSH session

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.080
 and like stream like different processes over it.

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.880
 That would be cool if I went that deep,

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.320
 but yeah, like Tmux is just like a normalizer.

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.640
 It like normalizes whether I'm SSH'd

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.880
 and I manage different sessions

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:38.480
 or I'm using doing something local,

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.320
 it's like the same experience.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.160
 - Yeah.

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:42.120
 - So because of that, I can't give it up.

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.160
 But yeah, it is weird that I'm like,

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:49.160
 there's so many layers of this anti-processing going on.

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:52.040
 - Like just dealing with seeing all the GitHub issues

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.960
 with random environments people have,

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.720
 I just want things to be simpler.

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.000
 So it's like, I want to rebel against this layer

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.040
 of Tmux/zellajay or whatever.

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:04.640
 I like I want those things to just not exist anymore

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.920
 because I work on Tmux, it would just make life easier.

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:10.960
 But yeah, as a user of Tmux,

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.920
 I'm so, my muscle memory is so bound

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.280
 and to be tough to leave.

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.120
 - Yeah, but it is funny.

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.480
 Like I'm pretty sure a lot of reasons

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:23.480
 why Mitchell made ghosty was to get rid of the need for Tmux.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.320
 But yeah, I don't know.

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.840
 I think for me practically,

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:28.680
 it cannot.

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.500
 - We haven't talked at all.

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:30.840
 Have we talked on the podcast but open to me?

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.680
 - No, we haven't.

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:32.520
 We should talk about that.

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:33.360
 - Not really, right?

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.600
 Man, so exciting.

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:38.880
 Like the developer is working on it.

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:42.600
 I mean, Sebastian for one shot at Sebastian is incredible.

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.200
 And then there's like a little team forming,

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:47.120
 building out adapters for solid and React.

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:47.960
 - Yeah, it's very exciting stuff.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:48.800
 - They're all really good.

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.160
 Like all of them are very talented.

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.760
 I think there's now the Sebastian plus three,

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.520
 I think there is working on this stuff.

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.520
 And everyone's on different time zones.

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.240
 So like, there's always something going on this.

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.480
 'Cause it's like someone's going to bed

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.320
 and someone's waking up.

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.600
 So they're just like continuing as a work happening on this.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.440
 - Never stopped.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:07.280
 - You can just look at it.

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.720
 - Some of my favorite channel in our Discord.

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.480
 - It's like trading Bitcoin, it never sleeps.

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.760
 Mark has never closed.

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.080
 - Yeah.

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:15.400
 - And yeah, they're so good.

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.400
 And yeah, Sebastian's so good at like handling

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.840
 some of these low level things natively.

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:22.560
 Like so he's working on Unicode support right now,

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:24.080
 which means he's into hell like being like,

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.280
 "Oh, Arabic characters are like run me weirdly."

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.120
 But which is awesome.

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:29.600
 'Cause once he solves it there,

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.240
 it's going to be so that translations we do,

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.880
 like all the people using us in Chinese,

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:36.400
 like it's all just going to work nicely.

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.200
 And that is really important, valuable.

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.000
 - I was just going to say,

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.880
 I can't believe I've built like all the time

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:46.000
 building these two Tuis with something else.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.720
 Because Open Tuis is going to come along

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:50.520
 and be such a nicer developer experience.

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.120
 And it's like, I didn't know this could exist

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.120
 for building Tuis.

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.320
 How nice it's going to be.

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:59.120
 I mean, I know people have a similar sort of dev touch point

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.400
 with something like ink.

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:04.320
 But like if ink were like super performant

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:07.520
 and like way more low level primitives available

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.880
 to do crazy shit.

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.560
 Like I mean, people just immediately,

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.520
 as soon as Open Tuis went up,

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:15.080
 like the GitHub repo was on GitHub,

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:18.320
 it's like people started building some crazy cool stuff

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.680
 and just with the low level primitives.

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.360
 And now he's kind of baking in the layout stuff

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:24.480
 and then the react and solid library.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.360
 So I'll let you just kind of do the ink thing.

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:30.440
 It's just amazing how good Open Tuis is, how fast.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:34.280
 Like how impactful this is going to be in the landscape.

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.800
 - Yeah, I think one, there's going to be so many Tuis

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:40.480
 that now exist just because it's so easy to build one.

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.400
 And some of these other,

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:44.160
 I'm hoping some of these other projects move to it.

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.840
 I think it's kind of like a no brainer.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:50.120
 The other thing that I've been super excited by is seeing,

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.200
 'cause so I've always known that Bun had good FFI,

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.060
 like the foreign function interface.

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:59.080
 And I know that Zig is very good across compiling

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.920
 and all of that.

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.520
 But seeing it up close with Open Tuis

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:07.560
 with how easily Sebastian like moves stuff into Zig

00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.120
 and like makes it accessible,

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:14.320
 it's really motivated me to do that more.

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.480
 That's actually one superpower of us using Bun

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.120
 is it's like that stuff is really figured out

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.880
 and it's super useful.

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.440
 So I was thinking, like, you know, we use rip-grap

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:27.040
 in a bunch of places and we spawn a rip-grap process

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.720
 and like do it in this hacky way.

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.200
 And this also means we have to download rip-grap

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.800
 and like, yeah sure, there's so many complexities

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:35.840
 that come with trying to do that.

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:38.280
 And we did handle them and it works.

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:42.080
 But we should just compile rip-grap into our binary

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:42.960
 and call it natively.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:47.240
 And we can do that because the Bun's FFI is so easy

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.280
 to use and so good.

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.560
 So I'm like looking at all, now I'm like,

00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:54.920
 oh, I need to look at the whole world of what's available.

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:58.320
 It's not just JavaScript libraries that are available.

00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:02.200
 It's C libraries and C++ libraries, there's Rust libraries.

00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:05.200
 And that's got me really excited.

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.520
 Like all the Git stuff we do right now we're spawning Git.

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:11.520
 No, I should just compile libgit2 into our binary.

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.600
 No, that's gonna be awesome.

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.760
 And the second thing is anything that we do implement

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:20.360
 in JavaScript, if it turns out it's a bottleneck,

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:23.720
 now we can easily move it lower level as we need to.

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:24.920
 - Yeah, very cool.

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.680
 - Yeah, so we need to figure out some of the CI stuff

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.640
 to make sure we're cross-compiling everything properly.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.600
 Yeah, once that's set up, this is just like

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.720
 a really awesome stack.

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.960
 - That stuff hurts my head.

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:40.960
 Like every time I'm made aware of the fact

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.040
 that we have to distribute this to all these

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.280
 different types of environments.

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.120
 - Yeah.

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.640
 - And all that you must be doing in CI,

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.080
 just like hurts my brain.

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:50.160
 Just I'm glad you do that stuff 'cause you.

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.560
 - Yeah, just, I mean, that's just, again,

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.720
 this is one of those things where you just develop

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:56.760
 a sense of that over years of doing open source stuff.

00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:00.760
 Going back to like some of the things that are annoying,

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.160
 people are always telling us like,

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:05.080
 oh, you should have built this stuff in Python

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.520
 or like in some other language,

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.880
 'cause they'd like some library or whatever that's there.

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.000
 And I always explain to them, we don't do,

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.240
 we had to eliminate a whole bunch of options

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:19.240
 because it adds an extra step to someone using our product.

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:21.800
 Oh, they have to install UV.

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.480
 And every single person, when I say that,

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.480
 it's like, oh, that's not a big deal.

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.480
 Yeah, that's like what's so hard about that.

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.200
 I'm like, you're right, it's not that hard,

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:31.120
 but it's an extra step.

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:33.200
 You're trying to build something from like mass adoption,

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:37.760
 like you have to be so maniacal about eliminating those.

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:41.200
 And almost nobody and like no developers understand that at all.

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.920
 So they all have, they like look at our setup

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:45.440
 and they're just like, oh, that's weird, that's dumb.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.920
 And I think we chose it because we didn't know

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.480
 about alternatives, but like what we,

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.640
 you remember when we were initially like starting this

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.960
 from scratch, I was like, hey guys,

00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.320
 I landed on a really weird setup.

00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:00.400
 I know it seems really weird and crazy,

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.440
 but I think it makes sense because of these constraints.

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.160
 And once we talked through them, it was like, yeah,

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.400
 this is actually the only option that satisfies everything.

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:11.040
 So yeah, people always underestimate how much work

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.320
 other people put into like the decisions they made.

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:15.640
 It's not just, oh, I didn't know about it.

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.800
 I just went with whatever I knew, you know, it's a day.

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:18.880
 People kind of assume it's who it is.

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.160
 - Yeah, it's very easy to be a Twitter person

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.640
 and just be like, oh, you just like TypeScript?

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.280
 You just haven't learned any other language, you're dumb.

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:27.880
 - Yeah, should I use this?

00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:30.800
 - Yeah, it's like that one's so funny

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.320
 because like, why did we do that?

00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.880
 A big reason for me using BUN was,

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:38.280
 oh, we can load TypeScript files dynamically.

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.600
 And that means our plug-insism is going to be better

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.900
 than everyone else's plug-in system by far.

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:45.320
 You know, we could do Lua,

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.880
 but again, the percentage of people that know Lua

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:50.840
 versus no TypeScript, totally different.

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.840
 So yeah, like every decision is very,

00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.520
 we've agonized over every decision.

00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:57.960
 Nothing is done like flippantly.

00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.920
 - Yeah, from the outside, it's not always clear.

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.760
 There's just seems.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.120
 - I think people kind of telling themselves,

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.360
 'cause they're like, oh, usually this

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.080
 'cause you like this or you know this.

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.040
 'Cause that's how you make decisions, right?

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:07.880
 (laughs)

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:08.720
 That's how you see the world

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.560
 'cause that's how you make decisions.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.600
 - Yeah, you should just have done it and go

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.000
 'cause you just like go and use it for everything.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.320
 But yeah, it's coming together really, really nicely.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.400
 And I think it's showing up in the fact that

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.360
 all these really super talented people

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:26.560
 are like excited about working on this stuff

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.960
 and doing like pretty crazy things with it.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:32.960
 - There's like a very medium to short-term date

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.320
 on the calendar where I will never write go again.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.160
 And I cannot tell you.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.240
 - I was thinking about this too.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.480
 - Yeah. - How exciting.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.320
 - That is to me.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.560
 And I'm not like trying to shit on go.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.400
 I don't care.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.600
 Like go is whatever.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.920
 But just like the process of building the two E's

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.720
 that I've built and go, I do not enjoy.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.080
 And I am ready to never have those problems again.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.160
 I'm so tired of subtracting random numbers

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.440
 till I get layout to work from like (laughs)

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:00.040
 just like there's so many things

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.520
 that are not baked into the framework we've been using

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.840
 that it's very frustrating.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.600
 And I'm excited to not do anymore is what I'll say.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.040
 And just like go has a lot of stuff

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.560
 when you're just like interacting with an API.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.080
 There's just like, you're smart enough to understand.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:13.920
 - So much overhead.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.680
 - Yeah, there's just so much like boilerplate

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.160
 to like send an API request.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.400
 It just makes me so sad

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.000
 'cause I know it doesn't have to be that way.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.680
 - Yeah, everything has to be a pointer.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.360
 So then everyone has to wrap it in like some other function

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.200
 that turns it into a point.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.040
 It's just, yeah, the API stuff is really bad.

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.160
 'Cause I think what's interesting about go

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.960
 is if you look at a self-contained go app,

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.600
 it's probably fine

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.080
 'cause like it's following goisms everywhere.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:43.280
 Like, oh, there's no, the concept of zero values

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:47.400
 and like, you know, it's weird to make an integer a nil.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.440
 Okay, that's fine in like your little self-contained go app.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.840
 Like there's no like type unions.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.160
 You just have to make interface

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.720
 with every single subtype

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.880
 and then they're all nil except for the one that it is.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.380
 Like that's all fine.

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.200
 The moment you need to interface with a real world

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.280
 outside of a go like an API or something,

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.280
 all those things exist.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.880
 Like there are fields that can be nil.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.000
 Like there are type unions.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:09.840
 Like there's all that stuff.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.560
 So it just gets painful there.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.960
 I had the same feeling about realizing,

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.880
 I probably won't be writing anymore go,

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.120
 not 'cause of the two-y stuff,

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.640
 but doing the bun single file executable stuff.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.280
 'Cause that to me is when I went to go.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.760
 I was like, okay, this is the only way

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.400
 I can make something that can run anywhere.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.120
 Single binary download run anywhere

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.120
 is really great for that user experience.

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.960
 So I am willing to write go to make that happen.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.960
 Also like decent performance and all that.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.040
 But now we have that with bun.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.080
 So all the reasons where I was going to go

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.480
 is now finally gone.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:49.320
 And all the FFI stuff is much better in bun than a go,

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.720
 which is great.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.200
 Like go has some weird C stuff

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.720
 when you have like C libraries involved.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.880
 It's kind of annoying.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.240
 Yeah, so I also probably am never gonna write go.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.080
 Pretty crazy.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.680
 Would detractors and Twitter people say,

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.240
 like the downside to these bun single file executals,

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.120
 it's just the size, like it has to bundle,

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.640
 it has a shoved bun in there too, that's a run time,

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:17.320
 but like has anyone, has anyone, a single person

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.800
 on the open code repo complained

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.400
 about the size of the executable?

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.520
 I've not heard one complaint.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.600
 Yeah, so the executables are big.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.200
 So I think it's like around 100 megabytes,

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.320
 like on average across all the different cross platform builds.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.160
 But our previous, oh, by the way,

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.040
 20 megabytes of those is the go binary

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.360
 that we have in there.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.880
 Which we can't get to that point.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.080
 Yeah.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.840
 The previous pure go one was like 40.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:43.160
 If you take out the go binary, we doubled.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.160
 We doubled there.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:49.000
 So it's definitely bigger, but like 40 versus 80 to 100,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.720
 like nobody, that's not practically making a difference

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.560
 for anyone.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.400
 Yeah.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.880
 Is it just worth the stage of internet bandwidths

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.360
 and adoption of like high speed in that?

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.480
 For a tool like this, that's like running

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.800
 you install one since like running on your local machine

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.880
 or it gets downloaded during CI.

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.920
 If it's running GitHub actions, it's getting downloaded

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.440
 from GitHub.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.040
 It's like, yeah, it's like telling it from itself.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.080
 So it's pretty fast.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.440
 It's all the place where it would show, but it's fine.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:17.560
 I think you could argue like maybe embedded use cases,

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.880
 like you already considered it about.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.760
 Yeah, it probably doesn't doesn't work well there.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.880
 And I will say the like codec CLI,

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.680
 which doesn't do much yet at all.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.800
 The one that's written in Rust, it's a lot smaller.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.960
 It's like sub one megabyte.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.640
 Yeah, it's very small.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.400
 So that's, I can see that being a kid.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.440
 OK, that's like a total difference, but I get like the draw

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.400
 to like a lightweight binary.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.800
 I know why that's attractive to people.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.720
 But it's just funny that no one's complained.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.960
 Like I feel like no one has said.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.920
 Yeah, it's not an issue.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.640
 And I thought going in, I was self-conscious.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.320
 Like, oh, it's going to be this giant binary

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.040
 and people are going to be upset.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:54.840
 Yeah.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.720
 Maybe they didn't know.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.840
 Maybe now they know and we're going to go all the complaints.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:58.560
 Well, that's the point.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.280
 If you didn't know, then it didn't matter.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:00.760
 Then why not?

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.440
 Yeah, exactly.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.080
 It didn't show up.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.720
 But anyway, the codecs one is I am like, wow,

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.560
 it's crazy how small these things can be.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.800
 And to be fair, like there's just a thing that calls API.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:11.320
 So like it could be pretty small.

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:11.640
 Yeah.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.080
 But you know, eventually you're going to have to put--

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.680
 the codec CLI is not doing much.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.920
 If they want implement snapshots,

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.240
 you're going to have to put get in there.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:19.720
 Yeah, sure.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.720
 That's going to inflict the size.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:24.280
 So yeah, this is one of those things where like,

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:28.240
 it's good to be memory efficient, space efficient,

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.480
 et cetera.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.440
 But it's bad to not use the resources.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.920
 Like memory is there to be used.

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:37.000
 You can use memory to make things go faster.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.720
 You can use this space to have more functionality

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.880
 or simplify other things.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.720
 So yeah, I think infinitely trying to optimize M to 0.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.840
 Does it make sense?

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.720
 Yeah.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.280
 All right.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:48.800
 Yeah.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.720
 Anything else you want to talk about today?

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.120
 No.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:53.640
 No.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.680
 It's everything.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:55.200
 It's Friday.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.040
 Hey, have a baby.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.440
 Why not do I want to?

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.360
 Every morning I wake up opening, there's a baby,

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.520
 but there isn't.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.760
 I just hope you wake up and she already had it.

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.520
 I've got to tell you.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:06.040
 I just want to end what's in her sleep.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.080
 [LAUGHTER]

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:08.600
 It's funny.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.920
 I keep telling her, just text me when you're done.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.280
 And I've been saying this from the beginning as a joke.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.840
 But now she's like, I kind of just want to do something

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.320
 on my own.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.840
 I just want to go off my own and have the baby.

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.680
 I'm like, I can't even lose saying that.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:22.920
 It's so funny.

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.840
 I kind of get that.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.760
 Because if I have to do this intense, kind of scary thing,

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:31.240
 I know some people want a bunch of support around them.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.360
 But I just want to handle it in private.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.880
 So I kind of get that.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.920
 I'm sure.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.280
 Did you cut the cord?

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.000
 What cord?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.920
 Like when the baby's born, you cut the cord.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.520
 Oh, yeah.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:43.880
 Sorry.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.400
 Yeah, I forgot.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.480
 Baby, I'm holding my headphone cord.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.240
 And I was like, cut the cord.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.240
 What?

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.760
 Sorry, I forgot we were talking about babies.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.560
 Yes, I did.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.280
 I cut the cord both times, I think.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:57.080
 I have no-- it's not like I don't want to do it.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.880
 I just don't have a particular desire to do it.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.480
 He's saying.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:06:59.800
 Yeah.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:00.640
 I didn't do it.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:01.320
 But they asked me.

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.800
 They're like, do-- and you can't be a dick and be like, no.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.120
 I'm rather not.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.400
 It just sounds gross.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.280
 But Liz really wants to do it.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.280
 Like, she really--

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.640
 Oh, she wants to do it.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.000
 So we're just going to let her do it.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:12.440
 Yeah.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.200
 Wow.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.040
 She's multitasking.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.680
 Like, she's busy delivering the baby.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.640
 And she's like, oh, it is in a moment.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.240
 But yeah, we'll see.

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:20.960
 Yeah, it's funny.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:21.800
 There's things like that.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.600
 And it's like, I guess some people are like, yes,

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.400
 I want to do that.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.800
 And that is not me.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.400
 And I don't know what's missing in my brain.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.920
 Yeah, for me, I mean, I'm not against symbolic things.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.680
 Like, I'm into symbolic things in a bunch of places.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:38.960
 This one, I just don't pay this internet to me in any way.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.600
 It feels like a technicality, symbolic thing.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.400
 Symbolic.

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.280
 Yeah, but we'll see.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.680
 Could happen today, could happen tomorrow,

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:50.600
 could happen a week from now, could happen two weeks from now.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.320
 Two weeks from now, geez.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.640
 Because yeah, technically, she's 40 weeks on Sunday.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.080
 Yeah.

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.440
 So I guess I go, it would happen a week.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.040
 And they don't.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:03.480
 They wouldn't induce until 41 weeks, 41 weeks.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:07.440
 So my older or my littlest, but he went 42.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.520
 He was two weeks late.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:09.400
 And they induced.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.640
 I don't think he was ever coming out.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.520
 He was just good.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.600
 That was me.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:13.440
 I didn't want to come out.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.200
 Really?

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.360
 Just like chilling.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:15.880
 I was chilling.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:16.920
 Got everything I need.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:17.560
 It's warm.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.160
 It's cozy.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:18.520
 Yeah.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:19.640
 Being born sucks.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.280
 [LAUGHTER]

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.080
 I think about it.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.160
 Think about that transition.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:24.680
 You're just like--

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.400
 Oh, yeah, no.

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:26.200
 You're really cozy.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:26.800
 You're safe.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.720
 You don't have to do anything.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.720
 You don't have to poop.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:29.240
 You just--

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:29.760
 True.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.320
 And you're just like, it's in your field position.

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.160
 It's like you're a Google employee.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:33.840
 [LAUGHTER]

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.240
 It's just like--

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.600
 It's amazing.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.760
 And I think born is like founding a startup.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:39.600
 Yeah.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.480
 I mean, it's like an uncomfortable experience

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.480
 to come out, I'm sure.

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.000
 Yeah.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.520
 And that's like your head is being smashed and deformed.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.440
 And then it's cold.

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.440
 And then it's cold.

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:48.920
 It's cold.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.680
 Yeah, you're keeping cold for the first time?

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:51.480
 Yeah.

01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:52.320
 Huh.

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.320
 What do you call?

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.400
 Are you going to learn how to eat?

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:57.040
 And you've got to poop on yourself?

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:57.600
 Yeah.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.680
 It's pretty miserable.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.360
 It's so weird.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.000
 Is this so weird how we don't remember being a baby?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.840
 Is that weird to you when you really think about it?

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.880
 Yeah, it is crazy.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.000
 Why don't we?

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.400
 Is it because our parents remember?

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:07.920
 No, absolutely.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:08.240
 We don't.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.400
 It's weird that our parents remember.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.920
 But from my point of view, it's like I didn't even exist until--

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:12.920
 Yeah.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.600
 Like there's some arbitrary moment

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.480
 where you start having memories and like, why?

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.600
 I keep joking about this where I'm like, there's

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.640
 no point interacting with the baby until she's three,

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.680
 because she's not going to remember this.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.600
 I'm like, why take her to the playground?

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.520
 Why take her to the museum, is that remember?

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:29.240
 There are things that I think--

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.280
 Yes, I know.

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.040
 It still affects them.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.720
 But yeah, it's weird that they won't have the memories.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.720
 Yeah, it's like from their point of view,

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.480
 it's like it literally didn't happen.

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.160
 Yeah.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.840
 So crazy.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.440
 Man, biology and just human everything.

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.000
 Once you have a baby, you realize how wild we just

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.320
 made this thing.

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:51.200
 This is half you and half me.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.720
 And it's like a lot.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:53.520
 It's creepy.

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.520
 It's like sci-fi.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.560
 It's so freaking hard.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.840
 And people used to do this in the jungle, like what the heck?

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.360
 Oh my god, yeah.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.160
 That's crazy.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.400
 Well, and then also half of them died after childbirth, so.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.040
 Yeah.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.560
 I mean, but the ones that didn't, you know, now you just have--

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.560
 Yeah.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.520
 This baby was affected by the same--

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.160
 it's not like the babies were different back then.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.160
 Like, this is totally helpless.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.320
 Yeah, can you imagine the stress--

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.600
 Maybe the stress.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:19.280
 Yeah, trying to keep a baby alive in the woods.

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.280
 When you're like--

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:23.000
 I guess you're just literally breastfeeding in 24/7.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.320
 Is that how it worked?

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.520
 Did they need more milk then?

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.540
 It's not that they need more milk.

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:29.960
 It's just that there was nothing else for you to do.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.440
 Like, you would just sit and focus on the baby.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.360
 And you would just--

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.080
 Interesting.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:34.960
 --feed it constantly.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:39.040
 And I guess whoever's around you, like, would try to feed you.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.080
 Like, it's not like they were like, oh, my husband

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.280
 has to go to work.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.720
 Like, I have to go to work, or like, I have to do the laundry.

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:45.240
 You know?

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.640
 This is your only job.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:47.140
 Yeah.

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:48.040
 It's like--

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.040
 I have to feed this baby.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.040
 Because it's so difficult.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.720
 So I don't know how else they could even pull it off.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.880
 No modern technology.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.340
 Interesting.

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:55.840
 Yeah.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.480
 You also don't even know when it's going to come.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:00.240
 You don't know, like, hey, guys, I can't believe we survived.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.160
 Our ancestors, people were related to.

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.040
 I can't-- it's actually wild.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:04.400
 Yeah.

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:07.080
 It's actually kind of wild when you think that, like, humanity

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:07.920
 made it.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:12.040
 Like, when you think about how hard-- even just like 150

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:16.560
 years ago, like, it was hard in, like, a semi-modern world

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.720
 where they had to, like, farm for their food.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.440
 Can you imagine, if we spent all our time

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.160
 just, like, raising and growing food so that we didn't die

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.640
 in the winter, like, that's crazy.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.120
 And that was like our great-grandparents.

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.120
 You know what I mean?

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:29.560
 Yeah.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:32.120
 We've made it through some tough eras, all the--

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.960
 the eras with all the castles and dragons and chicks

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.840
 and, like, people stabbing each other with having a shield.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.600
 Can you imagine owning a shield?

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.360
 What in the world?

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.520
 We survived some crazy stuff.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.920
 Yeah, I always think about how, like, war back in the day

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:51.640
 was so crazy, because, like, it's just a big wrestling match.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.240
 And it's not like you just half your people, like,

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.680
 you go one-on-one with someone.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.600
 Like, it's a 50-50 chance that one person dies.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.800
 You do that with the whole army.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.000
 It's just like, there's no victory.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.720
 Like, one side makes my tightly win,

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.560
 but you're just-- there's a bunch of people

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.160
 when you feel like wrestling each other to death more or less.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.080
 It's not like there were, like, these cool sword fights

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:11.480
 happening.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.920
 I'm pretty sure that was, like, the movies.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.320
 Yeah, like, Troy, where they're--

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.600
 Did swords for a little bit, and then it just

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.920
 starts to match them with their helmets.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.920
 Like, it's probably why--

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.880
 Yeah, oh, man, that's so true.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.080
 I'm surprised there's not some movie

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.920
 that tried to get really realistic with this stuff.

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.800
 I feel like that's, like, an artistic thing somebody would

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.320
 have done.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:25.880
 There must be.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:26.560
 There must be something.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.880
 Make a way more barbaric.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.520
 There probably is.

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:29.680
 That was war.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:33.280
 Like, it was just, like, a bit total 50-50 shot.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.320
 And then, like, the king would, like, lead the battle charge.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.120
 Then, like, you have, like--

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:38.720
 Oh, really?

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:39.160
 --a chance of--

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.680
 Did they actually fight back then?

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:41.800
 That was a huge thing, yeah.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.160
 Like, I mean, that was your job as a king.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.160
 Like, you had to--

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.080
 Wow.

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.520
 --lead the charge.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:46.960
 We were--

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.520
 Casey and I were just talking about how much it

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:51.760
 sucks that, like, all these fat cats in there, like--

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:52.680
 Yeah, bird.

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.180
 --offices.

01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:53.680
 --totally changes.

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:54.160
 --totally changes.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.240
 --totally changes at this.

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.760
 Yeah, like, OK, they're going to fight them.

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.160
 Send them off.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.080
 Like, they're not suffering any of the consequences.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.760
 And it's crazy to think that I was thinking about this yesterday.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.800
 I'm like, if there was a war today that was really intense

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.720
 and there was a draft, I would not get drafted.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.200
 I'm already too old.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.400
 And I've been too old to get drafted for a long time.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.160
 Oh, really?

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.720
 You're too old to get drafted?

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:16.560
 I can drop that fear out of my mind,

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.400
 along with book sand and all the other ways.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.800
 [LAUGHTER]

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:23.440
 I still thought I could get drafted.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.760
 Honestly, I'm almost 40.

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:25.680
 I didn't know there was, like, a job.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.720
 Like, if you look at wars, they literally just

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.680
 pick people from the ages of, like, 18 to 22.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:32.400
 And they just throw them into--

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.240
 Are you serious?

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:33.880
 Oh, my god.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.920
 Now I got so stressed about my kid getting drafted.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.320
 And, like, 10 years--

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.320
 It's, like, so messed up.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.280
 It's, like, a certain--

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.520
 Like, think about it in terms of high school.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.840
 Like, imagine, like, you're a cohort in high school.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.560
 Like, people in your class, upper class,

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.520
 and you remember, the people below you remembered.

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.560
 And imagine that there's, like, a war that happens.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.960
 It's just that cohort of people that just gets fucked.

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.720
 And, like, they all just go die.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:56.720
 And everyone else is just like--

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:57.680
 That sucks.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.000
 It's fine.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.720
 We look at, like, World War II and stuff, you know.

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.480
 Like, 18-year-olds are babies.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.960
 I mean, 20, 22-year-olds.

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.920
 They're just babies.

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.960
 Like, that's crazy.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:06.440
 And that's what we do.

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.280
 And that's what we do.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.640
 We send babies off to kill each other.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:09.880
 What in the world--

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:10.760
 I'm sorry.

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:11.960
 I'm just like, I'm not trying to, like,

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.280
 get into, like, anti-war propaganda or something.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:15.960
 Is that propaganda?

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:16.800
 I don't know.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.000
 No, I think it's good to be anti-war, yeah.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.240
 It's actually kind of insane.

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.720
 It's crazy that it's how that works.

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:22.360
 But it's also what makes sense, like it.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.960
 But it's crazy that's what makes sense.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:24.600
 Damn.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.440
 You just wish it could all not have to be that way.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:27.640
 Yeah.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:28.640
 Does it have to be that way?

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.400
 I don't know.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.600
 Yeah, it has to be that way.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:31.200
 It has to be that way.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.760
 It's like, somehow out of the world, then, it makes sense.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:35.320
 But then, honestly, like, there's a lot of wars

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.360
 that are just really stupid.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.040
 No, yes, a lot of wars are stupid.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.400
 It's like, George W. Bush is considered, like,

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.240
 the worst president ever, because he just basically,

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.640
 like, made up a war.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.480
 And, like, that was the first time we've done it.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.160
 But, like, the whole Iraq thing, like, why did we go to Iraq?

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.080
 I still don't understand.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:49.640
 It's a dumb.

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.520
 I remember that era.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.720
 9/11 happens.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.240
 And it's like, we're going to Iraq.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.640
 Wait, what?

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.880
 Why?

01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.960
 Because of those Saudi Arabian terrorists

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:00.920
 who are going to Iraq--

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.960
 Yeah, well, in the world.

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:03.760
 Oh, my god.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:07.000
 This guy-- I get why they're just people across the world

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
 that don't like us.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:08.720
 I kind of get it.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.720
 Yeah.

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.960
 But that's-- well, how do we even get on this topic?

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.880
 I don't know.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:18.040
 How do we land this plane?

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.480
 Anyway, don't go to war.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:20.520
 Don't go to war.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.760
 Don't send your babies to war.

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.560
 Maybe we got on it because you're having a kid.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.360
 And we just started realizing life is precious.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:26.920
 I don't know.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.240
 Oh, OK, that's another thing.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.760
 It's like, any time you see these movies,

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.280
 and there's, like, soldiers dying, whatever,

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.800
 each soldier that dies, like, man,

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.720
 so I'm not going to be pregnant with them for, like, nine months.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.800
 And then, like, raise them for 18 years.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:45.280
 And that's one-- that's one casualty.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.160
 Think about these, like, crazy Russian casualties

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.680
 and, like, all those wars that I lost, like,

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:51.200
 one in three people or whatever.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.280
 That was so much work for each person, you know?

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:53.520
 Yeah.

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.720
 To feed them, keep them alive, like,

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.880
 teach them about life and all that.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:58.840
 Oh, my god.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:15:59.320
 Yeah.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.600
 Wow, I never really thought about that.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.160
 Like, in these, like, crazy days in history, like,

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.200
 D-Day or whatever, where there was, like,

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:07.800
 where the battle levels, where there's, like,

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.600
 huge numbers of casualties.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.240
 Just, like, the human toll that that is.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.400
 Like, yeah, like, so many parents put in so many hours of time

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.440
 for each person.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.560
 It's like, you think about, like, building an airplane.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.600
 That's a lot of work.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.160
 That's, like, you think about an airplane in, like,

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.440
 less than a year, you know?

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.200
 Yeah.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.400
 This is 18 years of raising a child.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:31.640
 Yeah, a person is a lot of work.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:32.000
 Yeah.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.040
 Oh, man.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.360
 And it can't be paralyzed either.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.400
 You can't make it go faster.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.640
 It's wild.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.520
 Ugh, I'm feeling gross now.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.480
 I don't like the end of the, did we keep doing this?

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:41.520
 The end of our last podcast.

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.520
 We were like, and then that guy died.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.360
 Okay, see ya.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.280
 [LAUGHTER]

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.840
 We got to stay away from like--

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:50.400
 This is what you guys get for listening to the end.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.720
 You listen to the end and you're going to get the morbid stuff.

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:54.840
 Yeah.

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:56.680
 Well, anyway, have a good day, Dax.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.040
 All right, Dax, see ya.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.080
