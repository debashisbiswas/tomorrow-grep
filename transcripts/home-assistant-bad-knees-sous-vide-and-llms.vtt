00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.360
 Bertrand is telling us. We're muted on on Twitter. Oh my God. What the hell? Oh, it's funny. Okay, I fix it. There we go.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:19.720
 Way to go, Dax. Why do you have so many buttons and knobs in your system? Why is it so like you have to, you have to open the floodgate for my volume to come to the outdoors.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.480
 It's because whenever I record with, I was recording with someone, it's not worth explaining.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:54.920
 We have zero viewers. Hey, I want to be the first year. Can you send me the link? Or did you tweet the link?

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.080
 I sent it to you here.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.840
 This is a riveting start to a podcast, really. I hope this is all in it.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.120
 Does anyone use this? I've like never, I don't think I've ever seen this.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.720
 I think I did it the first time I streamed, like before I streamed a Twitch, I tried streaming to Twitter and everyone is like, no audio.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.920
 That's awesome. You can't hear me. This is probably pretty dumb. Okay, I see us. I see our faces on Twitter.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.640
 Okay, so now, and that's a tweet. I don't think it got posted. So I've used, because we used to use StreamYard.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.440
 And it would stream to Twitter, but it would like make a post. I'm going to try making a post. Make a post.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.320
 I'm trying this Twitter, I think. By the way, you're good at Twitter. You're really good at Twitter, Dax.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.160
 And I just noticed you have 15,000 followers. And I'm so glad I got into 20 before you beat me to 20, because you're going to beat me to every other milestone.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.880
 Yeah, I've got a lot of growth this year. I feel like something clicked for me in January.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.320
 Just found the right blend of grandma challenges and being a jerk.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.640
 Oh, okay, it works. I tweeted. It tweeted. And it's embedded in my tweet, which is great.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:13.520
 Oh, it's just there. Our faces are right there on your timeline. Look at us. Look at us. Look at us. Hey, look at us. Look at us. Who would have thought? Not me.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:24.280
 I'm a viewer. We have one viewer. It's me. Okay. I guess this will be good. It's good, actually, for the podcast, because we don't really want to interact when we're recording the podcast.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.600
 It's weird to talk to Twitch chat. And we probably won't be able to interact this way.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.960
 I don't think we're going to be seeing people tweet. And I don't know. You know what I'm saying?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.160
 Yeah, I think this makes sense. And our audience is bigger on Twitter, so we'll see.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.920
 Yeah, we'll see how this works. We'll see if we get above one viewer. That'd be great.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.600
 So just one viewer. What the hell is this? It's fine. It's fine. I'll retweet it.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.720
 How about that? Someone corrected me. It's X live, not Twitter live. Oh, X live.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.160
 We're at eight viewers now. Oh, there are people listening to us record.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.600
 I mean, normally there would be people listening on Twitch, but we'll take Twitter.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.320
 It feels different than Twitch somehow. I feel like more nervous because I've never done this before.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.160
 Yeah, it does. It's a different group. Like Twitch is just, it's all the degenerates.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.360
 It's like just a bunch of doofuses that we know. Twitter, it's like, I don't know who those 20,000 people that follow me are.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.760
 I have no idea who those people are. That's true. I know like 10 of them.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.080
 All the people that followed you, because they like your house. Yeah, basically.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.880
 There's still a person that wants me to send the layout, the blueprint for my house.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.680
 I don't know if they're planning on building exact house. Like they just want to build my house wherever they live.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.160
 I just had a funny thought that they're going to rob you like they're like playing a house.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.400
 The plan out like a little treasure map. Yeah, yeah.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.800
 We actually enable our alarm now. Just putting that out there into the world.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.240
 We have an alarm and it's actively monitored. We need to enable it now.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.720
 Well, I've had it for, I don't know, six months and we didn't turn it on.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.440
 Do you, if you ever done that, you ever bought an alarm system and then like just you don't want to arm it because you hate false alarms?

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.480
 We hate false alarms so bad.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.880
 Well, so I set up like a homemade alarm system through Home Assistant sounds sound sketch.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.480
 Yeah, I know. But it's it's it's I think it's both effective and comedic.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.400
 And I'll explain why. I think I talked about it before. I don't know.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:24.400
 But so Home Assistant literally lets me connect any device, any device to it so that I can be controlled like a toaster.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.680
 My car, I connected my car and it like knows like everything about my car open because some it's open source.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.440
 So people build plugins for everything. Someone reverse engineered the app for my car and then bridged it to this thing.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.080
 And so Home Assistant, wait, your car has an app?

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.680
 Yeah, I think I need like, wait, you have a Tesla, don't you? I'm sure Tesla's have an app.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.760
 Yeah, I mean, it has an app, but I expect that. But what's your car? What is what? What are you drawing?

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.400
 My car was the number one rated car in 2022, Adam. Did you look this up on x5?

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.440
 Is that why you bought it? Why is that ridiculous? It's it's not ridiculous.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.640
 It's just a purchase. No, I just feel like I learned something about you that like, I don't know how I didn't notice about you, that you look up the best thing.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.600
 And then you get the best. Always. Always.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.400
 I always look up. Well, my purchase decision with my car was actually pretty simple.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:23.240
 We know we needed like a sedan wasn't big enough for us. We wanted a cross over. Yeah, cross over everyone else in the world.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.640
 And now it's the default car. Yeah. And we wanted to go electric. I didn't like the Model Y.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:38.760
 And there were like two other options. And then that one of the options behind the eye on x5 happened to be like crazy, crazy well rated.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:51.120
 Like people were super obsessed with it. So it's just obvious choice. Yeah, but yes, it has an app and home assistant has like this nice abstraction where there's like things that are sensors and there's things that are that can like be controlled.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.680
 You can take actions on them. And it exposes all that stuff like this guy's plug in exposes all that stuff in there.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:08.200
 So like there's like a sensor for each one of my doors so I can like detective one doors left open or the trunk is open or there's like also a gauge for like how much mileage like all that stuff.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:17.800
 So can you control it? Can you like flashlights or on the horn and turn on the air conditioning? OK, so I can I can like tell like before I'm about to leave my house.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:26.240
 Yeah, free conditioner. Yeah. And then like two minutes later that Miami heat. You got to get cooled down. Yeah, it's great. It's a great feature.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.040
 But because you can set up all kinds of workflows and automations, you can effectively build alarm situations.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:42.400
 So I can do stuff like if my car door is opened after midnight, turn all the lights in my house and like blast music on all my speakers.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.720
 Geez, yeah. Yeah. I've seen I've seen people do this kind of thing where like it's not a normal alarm that goes off.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:57.160
 It's like you're going to die and like the lights turn red. Exactly. It's actually extremely easy. I haven't done it. I haven't done.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.520
 I do want to do that because it's hilarious. Yeah, it's and it's very easy. It's extremely easy to set up.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:11.560
 Well, you have to have all that. Do you have like color changing bulbs and everything? Did you go that far? Yeah, pretty much all my lights are either smart switches or they're color changing bulbs.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.600
 And do you use Hue? No, I don't use Hue because Hue bulbs are like five times more expensive than anything else.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.640
 I don't know how they've gotten away with it. Have you if you looked at the prices? So I have I have one Hue device.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:37.360
 So behind my TV, there is a strip of LEDs that I stuck behind there. And so when I watch movies, there's like changes the edges, like whatever clubs at the edges of TV, like that LED also goes off.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:45.240
 So you get this like crazy nice immersive experience. That one is a Hue, but Hue sucks now because they all need the additional hub.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.080
 Yeah, I hate the hub thing. Yeah.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:56.960
 So now there's common protocols for everything, like matter and thread. So pretty much any device you buy as long as matter of thread certified, it'll just work when you bring it in.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:05.200
 Those are much better brand names than the previous Zigbee. Zigbee was built on top. Yeah, it's built on top of Zigbee. Yeah.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:12.320
 So I like went through and I I saw that. OK, finally, we've converged on some standardization after like 15 years of this stuff. Yeah.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:22.240
 And yeah, so now like everything like just works. I have my home assistant bots, my one box I need any device I buy. Like it has a way to just to connect to them with the same. Yeah, yeah.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:28.640
 So I'm not worried about like, it's just compatible with this. And is that compatible with this other thing? Like all those different combinations? Yeah. Yeah.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:38.560
 So when you buy stuff, like when you research, do you end up like in the forums? Like that's where the real hardcore knowledge is? You end up like I usually end up on I saw on Reddit.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:48.280
 Like all. Yeah, Reddit's its own brand of. But like, there's like the weird dedicated 1995 forums from everything. They're super old. I love those.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:57.280
 I guess Reddit has replaced all that. I'll start on red to just get like the sense of the option. So I did this when I was looking for a grill and I ended up with the Kamado Joe, highly recommend.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:13.160
 So I went on Reddit to then to just be like, okay, best grills, Reddit. That's what I searched. And I found a few threads and I'll get like a list of like five to 10 options.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:21.760
 Then I'll go down their YouTube rabbit hole to find like the one weird guy that just obsessed with this thing and has like a detailed review on each one.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:28.880
 And at that point, and then sometimes I end up on some of those weird forums as well. Like there was some like meat forum that I ended up on, which is really funny.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:37.400
 I visit that one all the time. That's one of my favorites. I know exactly. Oh, yeah, I forgot. I forgot it was like an alien topic for you.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:44.760
 There's a when we were buying a mattress, we ended up on there's a site. I still remember sleep like the dead. Have you ever been to sleep like that?

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:54.720
 I have heard of this. Yeah. Now that I wish every category of product had a site that good because it's like it's so neutral. It's like refreshing.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:02.560
 You just when you spend time reading like the blog posts that top rank SEO stuff, like it's just all garbage and it's all affiliate links, but you find a site like that.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.520
 And it's like, you know, you can trust every word they wrote because they're just so unbiased and they're so at the root of it.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:15.840
 Like they're trying to cut to the truth. Love it. I wish every I'm always looking for that type of site. It's hard to find.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.840
 There's always just like one weird person or a group of weird people that have just like are obsessive about this one thing.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:33.200
 We'll do that. I'm looking for a new mouse right now and Theo licked me to this guy. That's like just obsessed with mice and he has his website and it's he has like a huge list of every single one.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:43.760
 And he has like a standard way if he has a valid way every single one. Yeah, a single mouse has a video and then it's a ranking. I saw that and I was like, great, I'm just going to pick I'm just going to look at the top three and just pick one of those and get to go.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:54.320
 He's good with products. He knows. He knows products. He finds good one. If he doesn't, he knows that weird guy always. Like I never heard of this mouse guy and like everyone needs a mouse and I haven't come across.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:05.040
 There's a guy. There's always a guy or a girl for every every topic. Yeah. It's interesting. Yeah. Why do we like buying things so much? Why is it? What? There's something fun about shopping about buying things.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:16.000
 I love feeling like I got the best thing. Yeah, I love my research. Yeah. Yeah. And for me, the buying process and the research process is like so enjoyable.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:25.440
 I know some people hate it and they just want to make the decision. I don't like agonize over the decision. I like like that process of discovering the best thing.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:35.000
 Yeah. Yeah. No, it's it's most of the fun of it. Like I love just kind of like discovering a new subculture because like you said, there's there's people that are obsessed with this thing that you just thought.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.240
 It was like a thing you need to buy, but there's like a whole community around it. I love that. I do. I love getting up to speed and trying to sift through all the noise.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:54.840
 I also like and I don't. I think we all shop a lot more online and we usually have like a specific thing. We want to buy and we'll do research for it, but there's a there's a Home Depot walking distance of me.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:04.920
 And sometimes I just go there because then I walk to go that way and we'll walk through the Home Depot. I just like going through there because there's all this stuff I didn't know exists existed and just like going through the eyes.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:13.560
 I'm like, whoa, that's a thing or whoa, that's a thing. I get kind of overwhelmed in places like that loads, Home Depot. I just I'm so disconnected from that world.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:20.600
 Yeah. I mean, if you have no purpose of being there, just kind of, I'm just like perusing. So yeah, it's it's fun. I'm like, well, I'm going to attach this thing to my hose.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:34.880
 I like. Okay, the same experience I have with kitchen stores. I like to go in kitchen stores because there's always a new gadget that they've come up with like a new way to peel a very specific thing with like a device.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:46.120
 It's made just for that thing. And it's always it's amazing. But every year they keep coming out with new stuff, those people should put them in charge of more things, put them in the material sciences or something. They're good at discovering.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:58.040
 They've come up with more ways to cut things. Yeah, those, those like single purpose kitchen items. It's funny because when you because I live in New York for so long, those are like the culture around the people hate those things because nobody has space in their kitchen.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:08.520
 It's a single purpose that there's a phrase like a single use kitchen, whatever plans, whatever it is. Yeah. People hate them because they're like, this is so dumb. Like, why would you buy a thing just for this one purpose?

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:26.200
 But my my friends parents who live in Arizona, they had this huge, amazing kitchen. They literally have every single one of those things. And it is awesome. Like, I remember one time he was telling me that he was visiting his parents.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:40.200
 And they were going to make burgers and they were like, Oh my God, we can't make them. We have to go to the store first. And he's like, why? He's like, well, we don't have those like little rings that you like put in the pants or you put a meat into shape to meet it.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:52.200
 That's like the level there is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. His dad has this thing where, I mean, I have this too now, but so a sous vide, which I think we talked about the sous vide before. Do you have a sous vide?

00:13:52.200 --> 00:14:10.200
 I don't know what that is. Is that is that a thing that attaches to the toilet and she's water instead of paper? It's a water though. It's a water. So you're close. Basically, it's a way of precisely cooking food. And it's good for vegetables and meat. So you guys might be interested in this.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:21.200
 Basically, it's like a cylindrical thing. It clips into like a container of water. So it might be like a big, just like a rectangle bucket of water. Yeah. Are you put it in there?

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:36.200
 A pot works. No, but I mean, people usually use it with like these, these like rectangle containers. Okay. So cylinder down in the water. Yeah. Then you take your food, which, you know, we usually make steaks.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:50.200
 You put them in a bag. You kind of press the air out and then you drop the bag in the in the water. The device, the sous vide device will bring the water to a very specific temperature. It's crazy accurate. It's like off by like 0.5 degrees.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:15:00.200
 And then it'll hold there. And your food basically gets brought to an exact precise temperature with no effort from you. So it like gets cooked to the exact temperature you want. Okay.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:07.200
 And for steak, you take it out, then you like sear it on both sides of the pan, which takes like a minute or two minutes. And you have literally a perfect steak every single time. Okay.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:16.200
 And it works for all kinds of all kinds of foods, like different meats, different vegetables, things like that. Like grill bros, like people who are real and they're grilling.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:31.200
 Do they, do they like turn their nose up at this stuff? Is this like nerd way of cooking? Sort of, but it's one of those things that everyone just loves. I think it's just like a beloved thing because you can sue V to steak and then toss it on the grill for the final sear to kind of get an exit both.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:44.200
 Because when you, you have to like put in a lot of effort to cook a steak correctly because you might overcook it, but you still want to see her. So this is an amazing device, but my friend's dad, he takes to the next level where he has like a vacuum sealer as well.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:51.200
 And he'll buy like just like a ton of like a hundred steaks and vacuum seal them all and put them in the freezer.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:58.200
 And whenever he wants a perfect steak, he just pulls it out, drops it in the sous vide and our lady has a perfect, perfect steak.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:04.200
 Cause they'll, they'll just, they're already wrapped up. You don't have to put them in the bag, you just drop it in there. Interesting.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:12.200
 Kind of almost making me want to eat steak. Just want to try this. The more I talk about this, ruin your, what is it? How long have you been vegan?

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:22.200
 It's 10 years now of 10 years in February. Wow. One day. Long time. I feel like it's paying off at my, I just turned 37 just had a birthday.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:36.200
 I don't feel 37. I feel like I'm, I'm not like Brian Johnson, like reversing my aging. I'm not 18 again, but I do feel like eating the way I eat and some of the other things I'm doing.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:46.200
 I do, I feel like I'm staving off what would be a very painful 37 with all the Jiu Jitsu. I'm training so much, man. I'm, I'm obsessed. I'm completely obsessed.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.200
 Like in a way that I haven't been obsessed with something in a while. It's bad. How many hours do you do a day?

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:59.200
 It's like two hours every morning. Like on your, on your highest days. Okay. Yeah. It's like two hours every morning. Then Sunday, two hours in the afternoon of, of just open mat, like just rolling.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:05.200
 Yeah. So I don't roll that much every day. Like I'm only rolling like 15, 30 minutes at the end of class.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:14.200
 But we go in early before class. I'm taking private lessons from this brown belt who is amazing. He was like a college wrestler. Yeah, man. I'm obsessed.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:20.200
 I'm competing next month. I'm doing my first tournament. Oh, nice. I'll be like two months into my journey. And I'm going to just throw myself into the fire.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:29.200
 It's like a Kansas City IBJJF tournament. Oh, you're going to Kansas City. I'm going to Kansas City. To the big city. I'm going to drive up from the Ozarks.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:39.200
 White belt and toe. My friend, who's everything into into into into your in New York told me to tell you to go. If you're ever in New York, you should go.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:47.200
 Roll with him at his at the gym. He goes to because it's like the sounds awful. Why is that awful? How long has this person been into it?

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:56.200
 And they they roll in New York where there's actually good people. Well, so I mean, that's why because he was like, so his gym has some like people that compete at like an international level.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:03.200
 Yeah. Yeah. Like someone coaches. But I mean, it would probably be fun for you to like stop in there once. Oh, it'd be awesome to see like a big gym where, yeah.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:11.200
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're not getting any more invite you if you're ever happy to be there. I don't know if you happen to be in New York and I happen to have my gee.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:22.200
 I will stop by. Well, bring your gee if you go to New York. Yeah. I thought about taking it when I went on that last trip. I don't know. It just feels weird to pack a gee. It just feels like I've gone full nerd.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:30.200
 That's where you're going to stop. Yeah. I mean, like maybe the gym will have geez. I could just wear one of their geez, but like to show up.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:40.200
 And I don't know. It just feels weird visiting. Yeah. I mean, going back to the thing you were saying, it's good that you feel like you are cheating your age, which I think is the goal.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:47.200
 Yeah. The first, I mean, the first few weeks, it was very, I mean, like any new physical activity, very painful, very sore all the time.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:53.200
 But now I feel like, and that thing you sent me, the knee thing, how about that? That's awesome. Yeah. I want to talk about that too.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:19:01.200
 There's like all these experts that are like, I've seen this guy on TikTok that Casey's shown me. He's at the end. I don't remember his name at the end of everything.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:08.200
 He's like all into flexibility and he does this crazy stuff, like the way he rolls around his ankles and stuff, but he always says, stay flexy at the end.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:14.200
 I feel like there's these crazy experts that are emerging with this new age of media that just, it wasn't a thing.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.200
 Like you didn't have access to this kind of information 20 years ago. It's awesome.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.200
 Yeah. I was talking about this with Liz and she was, I think she was talking to a physical therapist or something.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:31.200
 And yeah, we were talking about how usually if you go to a doctor for some of these problems, so I used to have like that shoulder issues.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:37.200
 And now I have this like knee thing. You go to the doctor and they're always just like, oh, you have to like not use it.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:43.200
 You have to lay off it or like you're kind of done using that thing. It's very common to hear that.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.200
 But then like, you just, it just gets weaker and deteriorates even more because you're not using it.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.200
 Yeah. Yep.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:58.200
 And there's all these people that have a completely different take. And I love this because as mentioned before, I've had shoulder issues, like two years, all kinds of doctors I went to.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:08.200
 Nobody could help me. And I found like that one person that was just obsessed with the shoulder and completely fixed my issues and I haven't had issues in like five or six years now.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:16.200
 And now, you know, the other guy sent you for the knee thing. And they just are like obsessed with this one thing and we'll figure out a way for you to train it.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:25.200
 And you can stay active for a very long time. The guy I follow for most of my diet and my workout stuff, he just turned 70. He actually lives here in Miami.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.200
 And he's been active like forever. Just doing all this stuff.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.200
 Is that the slow rep guy? No, no, that guy. I don't know where that guy, I think I live in Texas.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:43.200
 Okay. That's McGuff. This is Mark Sisson. Mark Sisson. Yeah, I'm sure you might have even come across his stuff. Like, do you know Primal Kitchen? Like the...

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:57.200
 Oh, I've seen that. Yeah. He started that company and he sold it a couple years ago. But he used to be an ultra marathoner. And his whole, he has a very interesting journey where he would do those like crazy, crazy long distance ones.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:08.200
 Like a hundred miles? I've heard that's a thing. Yeah. And he talks about how when he was doing that, he was doing all kinds of stuff that let him achieve those things, right?

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:17.200
 Like eating a shit ton of glucose, like drinking, like inhaling those packs, those like those glucose packets while on runs, wearing certain shoes that let him run super long.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:26.200
 And he talks about how all these things like nearly killed him because like he was doing these things that were your body can technically do if you push it with all this technology that we have.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:34.200
 But it really showed in. So even though he was achieving these superhuman feats, he was never like in worse health. And he learned to retire from that.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:43.200
 And now he's found like all this stuff that and his goal is always he loves doing certain things. Like he loves playing ultimate. He loves like biking. He loves doing all these things.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:55.200
 And he works out so that he can do those things, not just to like do the workout. So I really like his perspective and he's like been able to be very, very active to a very, very late age.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.200
 So running not the best is what you're saying, like pushing yourself with long distance.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:14.200
 Running is fine. It's just like the level that he was doing it at the ultra marathon. You just forget that we have so much technology assisting us now that we're capable of doing things, not we as in the general population, like the people at the high end of the spectrum.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.200
 Yeah.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.200
 They're doing things that technically are bad for them, even though it's like in the category of exercise.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:29.200
 Yeah. So Jiu Jitsu, I don't feel like it's the best long term activity. Like I do feel like it's like a serious injury is inevitable. And then.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:37.200
 And then what? And then do you recover to get back into it to just like, I'm not going to be able to do this when I'm 65. Like I just don't think it's the thing that.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:45.200
 And that sucks. But at least for now, I'm trying to regain my prime and feel like I've still got some youth left in me and enjoy it while I can, I guess.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:55.200
 It does totally change like having a purpose, like a sport changes everything about my nutrition, my fitness, like I'm focused on.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:06.200
 When I strength train now, it's like I'm specifically doing stuff that's good for Jiu Jitsu because I want to be stronger, getting out of guard or whatever like I'm doing Turkish get ups and all this stupid stuff that I never would have done.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:19.200
 I'm pushing myself harder just to get better at this sport. I love having something like that. Like I focused. I just, when I go into the gym with no aim, like before I discovered Jiu Jitsu, it's just like, I'm not going to push myself that hard.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:25.200
 I'm not going to do stuff. I don't want to do. I'm just going to kind of do the normal bench and squat and deadlift. Call it a day.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:36.200
 It just fixes all sorts of things in your life too. I'm having the same experience. I want to be in better shape as I start the kite surf because I don't want to drown, which is a pretty good motivator.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200
 That's a good motivator.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:45.200
 But it also makes it so like I sleep on time because I want to make sure I wake up on time so I can go down in the morning, so it just kind of clicks everything in life into place.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:58.200
 It does. It just puts a lot of good habits. Yeah. It enforces a lot of that. Love it. Did you want to talk specifically about this knee thing? Did you want to go into that guy or what were you going to say about the knee thing?

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:07.200
 You just sent me the link. You didn't say anything. I was like, what should I say? I'm going to figure it out. I watched the video. I'm going to watch the whole thing.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:22.200
 The end got a little like emotional. I don't know. It was weird, right? Thanks, giving. And basically, there's this person on Twitter. His YouTube is a knees over toes guy.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:31.200
 He can do his like something serious. Yeah. And his whole thing is just a lot of people have knee problems and I stopped being active because of that.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:41.200
 And he just has a few basic things you do every day or whenever that can kind of extend that. So if you're someone with that issue, go check that out.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:50.200
 Yeah. I just started doing it the last two days. I don't think I'm some of the knee problems. I think that one thing was just a freak thing, but this is always going to give me the confidence to not worry about it.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:25:00.200
 I had heard the walking backward thing. Casey had always told me it's good for a lot of points. Yeah. I'm just going to be walking around my neighborhood now with my ruck on backward.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:11.200
 I wasn't weird enough looking with my backpack. I'm going to be backward all the way up the hill. Everything. I'm going to be really good for you. Actually, let me explain to you how I'm doing it, which is why I make you laugh.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:17.200
 Do you put pants on first or are you outside your box or just depends? Just depends.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:28.200
 Before looking up this backwards walking. So basically, you know, 10 minutes of backwards walking every day, like helps reorient some of the stuff in your knees and your legs every morning for the past month.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:41.200
 I've been doing this forever. You know, I play with Zuko in the morning to get his energy out. He's very excited in the morning. And I found something new that is very, very, very good at getting his energy out and it's blowing bubbles.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:51.200
 So every morning I said in my yard, blowing bubbles and my neighbors walk by and see me and there is no way to make this look cool. I'm a little adult.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:59.200
 - Blowing bubbles to you every single morning. - Blowing bubbles to you every single morning. Yeah. And I walk around while doing it so that you can chase them. So they kind of put some distance.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:08.200
 - So you walk around backward for 10 minutes, blowing bubbles. - So now, yeah, this morning, instead of walking forward, I walk backwards for 10 minutes. So it's perfect. He gets his exercise. I get my exercise. Beautiful.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:20.200
 - Do you ever feel like shame in public? Like, do you ever feel like I'm embarrassed by strangers seeing what I'm doing? - Yes, I do. It's definitely diminished as I get older and will only continue to diminish.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:27.200
 And now I see what I get why they're just old people, completely naked in locker rooms all the time and stuff. I see that too. - Is no longer care?

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:42.200
 - Yeah. The added layer is something about being in my own property. I just cannot give a shit with my own property. I get doing weird things in public places. I'm embarrassed to do that, but I just don't feel it in my... It's arbitrary, but I just don't feel it.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:55.200
 - No, I really have no cares about, like, public. And Casey notices this and points it out that she gets embarrassed that I'm doing something. I just don't think about it. Not just on my own property. Like, I don't know. I don't...

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:11.200
 - What kind of stuff are you doing that's embarrassing her? - Ah, okay. So the last thing that I was doing, there's this on the topic of weird body fixes, so the knee guy, there's this thing, if you get tennis elbow. So, just so you get tennis elbow pretty commonly.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:19.200
 I haven't both elbows. And there's this rubber... It's just like a stick. It's like a rubber stick about yay long. Where's the camera?

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:29.200
 - Okay. - It's like, I don't know, almost a foot, maybe 10 inches. And you hold it like so and you twist it, and then you kind of torque that arm. I don't know.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:35.200
 You just like... It's this goofy looking... - Yeah. - I mean, it looks like something, but I'm not going to say what it looks like.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:48.200
 - Hopefully not that aggressive. - Yeah, you just sit there and do that. And I was just doing it in the car, and people are driving by, and it's kind of like very clear. It's this weird motion I'm doing with this weird object.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:58.200
 Yeah, that was the last thing. Whereas I have the shame. - In your car? Yeah. In my car, that's my property, I guess. If I were walking around like the mall doing that, I don't know. They'd be a little weird.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:07.200
 Man, but people, they're just different degrees to this. Like I see people doing all kinds of weird stuff. I mean, we live in a city. It's just you start to see...

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:16.200
 I mean, New York is like the epitome of this. You just get so used to people doing the weirdest stuff all around you that you just don't even... It doesn't even register for you at all anymore.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:22.200
 - Yeah. - Like clipping your toenails in this subway. Like, just stuff like that. It's just... - Even I'm good at stuff like that.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:35.200
 But you get to a point where you're just seeing weird stuff every single day, and you kind of get it too. It's a hard way to live, and sometimes you end up in a situation where you miss times something and you've got to be doing something weird in public on your way to the next thing.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:42.200
 - No, it makes sense. I mean, we get that in the Ozark too, but it's not because there's so many people. It's just because people are weird. I don't know.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:49.200
 You go to Walmart and the Ozarks. That's hell on earth. It's like the worst place in the world to go. It's Walmart.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:58.200
 Casey and I were just talking about this Saturday. We had to go to Walmart to get something, and we generally don't go places. We mostly insta-card our groceries, and we go to Mama Jeans. I've talked about that.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:06.200
 But we went to Walmart, and it's like... It's where you rub shoulders with all the kind of people in the Ozarks. We don't really get a lot of exposure to it.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:15.200
 It feels like we've got a nice little bubble. Our neighborhood's really nice. And Mama Jeans is pretty nice. Like people who go there. It's a little more health-conscious. It's not just common folk.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:24.200
 This is very classic. I'm being very... - I'm just letting you go. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cancel me, please, before I go any further.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:30.200
 It's just scary. Honestly, it feels like this is where people get shot. This is where the mass shootings happen.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:43.200
 - What is shot in Walmart? It's all the time. - Not mass shootings, more weird personal situations. But yeah, I mean, the way I've always thought about New York is, let's say 1 in 100 people are truly weird.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:52.200
 You're passing 100 people every 10 minutes in New York. So you're just constantly seeing the weirdest people in the world all the time. And it's actually kind of fun. I don't know. You get used to it.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:30:02.200
 - But Miami is not that way, I guess. - Well, there's definitely a lot of... It's still that. You still definitely get that. It's just not as dense as many people.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:11.200
 - That makes sense. - It's a different one. You're in a subway crammed with 50 other people in a car. And one of the 50 people is super weird and they're three inches away from you.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:25.200
 - I just cannot imagine choosing to live in New York City, choosing to ride the subway every day as part of my life. I don't understand it, Dax. Could you help me understand it? It was worth it to you. Something about New York was worth it.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:36.200
 - Here's the thing, and you can probably relate to this. Any situation just starts to feel normal after you're in it enough. And you just tend to focus on the positives and kind of forget about the negatives.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:51.200
 And realistically, there's different experiences of this. I mostly work from home, so I wasn't taking the subway on a daily commute. That sucked. Even when I did go into the office, I rode my longboard. I found other ways around it. Lizz biked a lot.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:31:08.200
 The subway is also very radically changed. It's kind of the inverse of what you'd expect. Pre-COVID, they were generally packed and they were this routine. It was really packed in the morning. And then when work let out. But it's still pretty busy throughout the rest of the day.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:17.200
 You would think that's worse than post-COVID where subway ridership went down a lot. But it actually made that subway was really scary.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:30.200
 Because before, like I said, you'd be packed in the car with 50 people, one person's weird. And that's okay, because there's four of none of the people around you that aren't weird. Now you're in a car with two people and the other person's weird. Why don't you see?

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:43.200
 - So, subway started to feel a little bit weird after COVID. But in general, it's just not a big deal. I don't know. It's never really something that I noticed or even thought about that much.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:53.200
 - Because you're just focused on all this other stuff that is pretty great about being there. You're just immediate walking access to the best stuff in every category without even thinking about it.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:59.200
 - Yeah, I guess I don't know what that stuff is or if I care. Like Broadway shows? Or like...

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:11.200
 - No, no, no. Anything from like... I mean, my current neighborhood is like this too. I'm walking distance from some of the best restaurants I've ever been to in my hope.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:20.200
 We can just decide any evening, just to walk 10 minutes and go have... There's this new Amakase sushi place that opened up, which is amazing.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:28.200
 Just go walk there, do that across the street, another incredible restaurant as well. Place to hang out, kind of just things to do.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.200
 - Yeah. I guess we don't have that here. - It's just nice. You just get used to it.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:38.200
 You just get used to being able to decide to do anything and just extremely low friction to go do that.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:45.200
 - Interesting. Yeah, we mostly don't do things, so maybe that's why I haven't noticed this. Maybe we don't do things, nothing to do.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.200
 - Exactly. Yeah, exactly. So you just kind of adapt to whatever the lifestyle is.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:55.200
 - Interesting. - I mean, I love my time there and I still think it's the best city I've ever been to.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:03.200
 - What really gets me is when I see people with strollers, like imagining raising a family in the city, that would be so hard.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.200
 - I wouldn't be that hard. - Yeah, that sounds so hard.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.200
 - But people do it. Yeah, even people that aren't super rich.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:14.200
 - They probably think the same about the Ozarks. Like, how could you raise your kids in a place like that?

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:20.200
 - They're just sort of things. They have to think about that you don't and things that they don't have to think about that you do.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:30.200
 - Well, we tried the Twitter thing. We tried to stream on X live, mostly successfully. I mean, if you count, I mean, your audio was there the whole time.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:35.200
 Mine was there part of the time. - Yeah, I'm looking at it. It's there now. It's working.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.200
 - Are these recorded on Twitter? - I think so.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:43.200
 - I feel like we can come watch this after on your profiles to be there.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:48.200
 - I mean, we're not going to.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.200
 - Trash says, "Adam is still alive." - I am still alive.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.200
 - If the trash doesn't know it's still alive, I'm getting ready to see trash.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:01.200
 - And Vegas. - And a lot of people, man, you would not believe this DM group has grown. I can't believe everybody's going decks.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.200
 I'm not just trying to phone with you. - How big is it?

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.200
 - It's crazy. It's like 15 people now. Let me just check.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:13.200
 - That's too many people. - It's a lot of people. Yeah, 16 people. It's people I didn't know were going. A lot of people.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:19.200
 I don't want us to name names because I don't forget some people, but like everybody I know from Devstreaming sans you, honestly.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:25.200
 - It's like everybody. It's like you and Teach. That's it.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.200
 - Me and Teach are having our own conference. - How are you?

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:34.200
 - We're going to do a conference call. - Are you going to go up in Michigan? Oh, you're going to do a remote virtual conference.

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.200
 I'm not jealous. I'm literally not jealous.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:42.200
 - Don't make me paint that picture of you sitting at the corner of a table for dinner at dinner again.

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:47.200
 - I'll stop. I mean, that will be the case, but we won't be at dinner the whole time.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.200
 Some of the times we'll be standing awkwardly in rooms, probably.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.200
 - And gambling. Gambling all your money away. - I've never gambled in my life.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.200
 Should I gamble? I've been to Nevada a few times now. Should I be gambling in the airport?

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:06.200
 - You should definitely just put, yes. Not the airport, but you should definitely allocate some amount of money.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:12.200
 - Why not? It's fun. - I don't know. Do you tell me? Is it like a thrill? It just feels good?

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:25.200
 - Well, so when we were in Vegas during re-invent, me and Liz took out a hundred bucks and we went to the toilet table, lost it instantly, like instantly vanished.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:30.200
 - Just a hundred on red. Is that how that went? - Yeah.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.200
 - And Liz was like, that wasn't fun. And I was like, I don't think we did it right.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.200
 Then we took out another hundred dollars. - Okay. - Oh, this is the problem. Where does it stop?

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:45.200
 - I put it in a slot machine and this time I pull the weather and we won like two hundred something else.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.200
 - So it's Liz. She's the problem. - She didn't have a lucky hand on the red table, I gotta be honest.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.200
 But we want to learn all our money back plus like 40 bucks, I think, something like that.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.200
 - And then you just stopped? That was enough? You were satiated? Okay.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.200
 - 'Cause I'm very obsessive and my concern is I will never be satiated.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:07.200
 - Probably. - And I will just get addicted. And then I will be living on the streets come December.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:14.200
 - I think the things that are addicting are the things that have a slow burn like playing blackjack with like small amounts.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.200
 So you're there for like 30 minutes to an hour like slowly losing your money.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:23.200
 - Okay. - Alan did that and he made money. And then at like 2 a.m.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:28.200
 he like left the room and then just went to go play in the middle of the night by himself.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.200
 And I was like, okay, I think, I think the book-- - The addiction is set in.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.200
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - 'Cause you can do it all night. You can even play blackjack all night.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:38.200
 Like they've got dealers there. Wow. I guess, of course they do.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:45.200
 I hate Vegas so much, man, I hate it. - Crazy optimize. Everything you're smelling is engineered to make you want to stay.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.200
 Everything you're hearing is make like all the music is like explicitly curated.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.200
 Like every little step of it, like the distances things are from each other.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:59.200
 Like everything is micro-optimal is 'cause every 1% improvement they have is significant at their scale.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.200
 - Wow. - It is, it is crazy. - That sucks.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.200
 [laughter]

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.200
 I wonder if TwitchCon was in Vegas before Amazon bought Twitch.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.200
 Wait, was there TwitchCon before Amazon bought Twitch?

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.200
 It's just an Amazon fixation with Las Vegas.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.200
 Could we convince someone in Amazon to please pick another city?

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.200
 One that doesn't, I don't know, smell like my grandma's house.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.200
 [laughter]

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.200
 - Is she so bad? - Is she a smoker?

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:32.200
 Yeah, no kidding. It's, and she wasn't, but that's, it's like a grandma smoker.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.200
 Yeah, yeah, it's bad. I hate that place.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.200
 Yeah, I think it's just a certain generation.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:42.200
 I'm assuming like all the generation of people that are like execs at Amazon.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:47.200
 They're into the Vegas conference thing, which is a thing they grew up with.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.200
 Yeah, the buffets, the gambling. All right, let's get off here.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:56.200
 It's been long enough to be on Twitter talking to Twitter people.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.200
 I don't know, it's a different feel. The Twitch thing I'm used to now.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.200
 I'm used to talking to people on Twitch.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.200
 I'm not used to these 16 people that are watching us on Twitter. It just feels weird.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:09.200
 There's no dialogue, except for when Bertrand called me and sent me a bunch of messages.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.200
 [laughter]

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.200
 But other than that, I don't really, I don't have any feedback.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.200
 It just feels like we're talking to air.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.200
 I guess this is what we do when we record a podcast.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.200
 We don't actually have to stream it to somebody.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.200
 Could just record the podcast.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.200
 And I think, I want to give us a try a little bit more.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.200
 Oh, no, for sure. Yeah, it's nice.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.200
 I'm going to be on Twitter so much. We might as well stream to it.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.200
 51. Can you believe we've done this 51 times?

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.200
 You think we'd be getting better at it, but I don't know.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.200
 [laughter]

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.200
 We are.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.200
 It depends on where our focus is. I think about the focus.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.200
 Oh, yeah, we're both busy right now. That's what it is.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:48.200
 I have been, this past week, I have been finally diving deeper into all the LLM stuff.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.200
 Just kind of getting more into the technicals. Yeah.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.200
 I'm still, I'm just now setting up my first smart contract.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.200
 So I'm way behind you.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.200
 Smart contract.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.200
 What?

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.200
 I'm just kidding.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.200
 Like a big trend.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.200
 That's funny.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.200
 Yeah.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.200
 What are you doing with LLM?

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.200
 Is this boomy?

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.200
 Are you going to incorporate?

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.200
 I'm trying to understand, yes, yes, but I'm also generally trying to understand it better

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.200
 because AWS bedrock is coming out and we want to figure out

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.200
 if SC needs to do anything around it.

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.200
 Like what's, I mean, generally, I want to understand this space and have,

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.200
 yeah, just, it's a great tool.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:26.200
 I think I found in the last week, I've actually fit on something that I think is pretty interesting,

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:33.200
 at least for myself, because most of where we have seen these LMs is generative text,

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.200
 like you prompted something and it generates some, an answer and people have scoped it

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.200
 to different things like if it better than their products.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.200
 But effectively it's, that's a UX we've seen.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.200
 Yeah.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:48.200
 But there's this whole other way of using them that I think is actually where a crazy

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.200
 amount of value is because I can think of a million tasks.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.200
 Well, summarizing is also generative text, but there's other way of using them where

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.200
 it's about like extracting information from unstructured text.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.200
 So from going from unstructured to structured.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.200
 Yeah.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.200
 OCR.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:08.200
 I think it's going to change like use cases with OCR drastically because it's so hard to take

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.200
 a big blob of text from OCR and do anything with it.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.200
 Yeah, exactly.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.200
 But then the question is like you want it to come back in a schema that you can digest.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:20.200
 Yeah, so you want to be able to define something like a JSON schema and constrict the LM to

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:26.200
 only output stuff that's valid for that, which is not an automatically solved thing yet.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.200
 People have found some pretty good approaches to doing that.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200
 Yeah.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.200
 My friend actually ran it like I was kind of looking through all this and he randomly released

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.200
 something yesterday.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.200
 It's an API.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.200
 There's two, there's two things that API does.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:42.200
 One is it's like a singular API that you can switch between open AI and like all these other

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:46.200
 different models so you can play with them without changing your application code too much.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.200
 Yep.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.200
 But it also had it also implements some of these new constriction methods.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:56.200
 So you can specify a regex pattern and say that the response needs to correspond to the

00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:01.200
 regex pattern and he has some funny examples where he'll like he has a regex pattern where

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:09.200
 it's like the first word has to be a number, second word has to be of or has to be calories

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.200
 above, then the third word has to be whatever.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:17.200
 He'll ask it for like what's something I can eat, blah blah, and it'll say like 500 calories

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.200
 of this thing.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.200
 Nice.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:25.200
 So that's like it's like a low level tool of being able to constrain the output but I can

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:29.200
 imagine how people are going to get really creative with this type of thing and do all kinds of

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.200
 stuff.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200
 Conforming to a JSON schema is also really cool.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.200
 Someone wrote out a schema for what like ingredients look like a recipe looks like.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:39.200
 This is literally done this, Dax.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.200
 I'm about to tell you that I've actually played with this because we wanted to just OCR.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:45.200
 My wife has all these cookbooks and we like like five recipes from each one.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.200
 And I just wanted to be able to take photos of all of them, take the OCR from Textract,

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.200
 like takes the text data and then run it through OpenAI.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.200
 It works.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.200
 Great.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.200
 I mean, I'm probably doing it the dumb way.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.200
 I'm just literally using OpenAI.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.200
 But you just pass it a schema and you pass it to raw data and it sends it hand the right back

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.200
 to you.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:05.200
 So OpenAI has, if you just really talk to the prompt, you can probably get it to respond

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.200
 roughly correctly, like so amount of time.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:12.200
 You can make this even more correct by using their functions thing where you like give it

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.200
 a function and you say the arguments that function is a JSON schema.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.200
 That's still probabilistic though.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.200
 There's still a chance that it's not going to conform to it.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.200
 It's not going to conform to it.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:27.200
 But then this new approach, basically the approach is like whenever the L image generating a new

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:33.200
 Bias tokens up that are valid based off of how much what is generated so far.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:38.200
 So you like, you negatively score tokens that don't conform to your schema.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:42.200
 And if you do it that way, the L image restricted to only outputting stuff that conforms to

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.200
 it.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.200
 How do you do that?

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.200
 Like when you say bias to tokens, it's like a training level or what is this?

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:53.200
 OpenAI actually has a way to pass in biases for tokens.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.200
 It's not an amazing API and they need to just integrate this at a lower level.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.200
 But it technically allows you to do this.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.200
 It's just like, let's just say 10x more expensive.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.200
 You just need to like rerun stuff a bunch of times.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.200
 Like a few optimization things you need to do.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:12.200
 But the takeaway is you can say every single time this output something, it's definitely

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:16.200
 going to be this key so you can trust it from that place forward.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.200
 Man, I've had the exact same thought that like the other thing I've thought is summarization.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:24.200
 I just feel like nobody's, there's not a lot of like people using the summarization capabilities

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.200
 of this stuff to like take a lot of information and then sit down.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.200
 Maybe there are people and I just haven't seen it.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:34.200
 But the schema thing or just like the unstructured data to structured very much on my mind.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.200
 I feel like there's tons of ways this solves problems that are just really hard to solve.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.200
 Yeah.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.200
 There's so many business processes that I've like just worked on in the past that have

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:48.200
 been like categorized these PDFs are like, yeah, pull up this stuff.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.200
 It's just, it's just such a common thing.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.200
 So yeah, I think there's a lot of opportunity there.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.200
 The recipe example I was talking about though is so they have, they define a JSON schema

00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:01.200
 of like ingredients look like this and they have like a description and like a quantity

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.200
 and a unit and then steps look like this and they have these different things and they

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.200
 reference these ingredients.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:10.200
 And it basically can convert a recipe into that exact structure.

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.200
 So then you can just render it in a consistent way.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.200
 Is this a repo?

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.200
 Can you send this to me?

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.200
 Because it's probably better than what I've done.

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.200
 Yeah, I'll send you some stuff.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.200
 There's basically, I think there's so many approaches to this.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.200
 I think I found this repo called clownfish.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.200
 I think it's called.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.200
 Okay.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.200
 It has a, above all, it has a really great read me explaining the exact approach.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.200
 Yeah.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.200
 And then my friend's thing is kind of similar.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.200
 And I'll show you the open A, open AI like JSON.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.200
 Yeah.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.200
 Yeah.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.200
 That's all very holistic, but so pretty good.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.200
 Yeah.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:42.200
 Have you looked at like the open source models at all, Lama two or any of that?

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.200
 Yeah, I'm still trying to at the phase where I'm trying to understand like, I don't even

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.200
 know what it means to be an open source model.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.200
 Like, what exactly does that mean?

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.200
 Like, when hosting it, like what?

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.200
 Well, so there's an article that works together.

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.200
 So there's an ABS here that works at Hugging Face.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.200
 And I'm blanking on his name, but he writes about two articles per day on LinkedIn.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.200
 It's insane.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.200
 I don't know how he has time to write all this stuff.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.200
 He writes it with LMS.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.200
 Maybe.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:10.200
 So he's got an article on training, doing like a custom Lama two in SageMaker.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.200
 So you've got a serverless inference endpoint.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.200
 That's all just SageMaker and you can use Lama two.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.200
 I've wanted to play with that.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:21.200
 Like as an alternative to OpenAI, just to have a cheap way to kind of use these LMS.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.200
 And I think it's like the highest, it's like 70 billion parameters.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.200
 It's a pretty big model.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.200
 Yeah.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.200
 Yeah.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.200
 And then there's all the fine tuning stuff, which is interesting too.

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.200
 And OpenAI has an, yeah.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.200
 And betting's I'm a little bit familiar with because we have to like understand what that

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.200
 was to add some of the AI stuff to our docs.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.200
 Oh, right.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.200
 SST.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.200
 That like overnight.

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.200
 So cool.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.200
 Yeah, exactly.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.200
 But that's kind of what I feel like.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:52.040
 I feel like the focus, the stuff that has made it to me as an end user has been like kind

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.040
 of narrow.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:57.600
 And now I'm seeing like, Oh, I think there's all these more hidden approaches that are

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.600
 more hit.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:02.240
 Like you just never see like it's probably someone automating some really obscure business

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:07.120
 process that like saves them like a million dollars, like multiple million dollars a year.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.120
 Yeah.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.160
 And there's just so many of these that probably exist.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:15.080
 And I think that's, that might be where a lot of the AI companies that have been founded

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:18.280
 but aren't necessarily making products for the average person that might be what they're

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.280
 focused on.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.280
 Things like that.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.280
 Yeah.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.280
 That makes sense.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.440
 I love how we were done like because we've just been talking about stupid stuff and then

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.280
 we actually talked about an interesting stuff.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.520
 I'm glad we didn't just end it because this podcast will actually have something technical

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.520
 in it.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.520
 Yeah.

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.520
 Kind of mix it in.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.240
 This is still a tech podcast.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.240
 Is it?

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.240
 Is it though?

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.240
 Can we claim that?

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:41.960
 I think that sounds have been, been like my body hurts podcast.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:42.960
 Yeah.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.960
 But I think we're getting old back.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.640
 I feel like we've, we've included it.

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.800
 You just did an interview with AJ?

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.240
 I mean, that's, that's going to be very technical.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.240
 I would assume.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.240
 I love bass jumping.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.240
 Actually, it was.

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.240
 Yeah.

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:57.600
 It was like, I, I found it interesting because I'm like, Oh, now I get to just talk about

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.600
 talk to people that know about something really random and learn about it.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:04.480
 Like you talk about bass jumping stuff and aviation stuff for like 25 minutes.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.480
 Oh, it's the end.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.480
 That was cool.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.480
 Aviation.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.480
 I didn't know that.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.040
 It was a place that, I forgot where it was, but he grew up in a place where aviation's

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.000
 big and a lot of people had like built their own planes.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.840
 Like that was a very normal thing built their own planes.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:22.440
 He talks about it in this funny way where he's like, Oh yeah, my friend built this thing

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.520
 and we were like 90 feet up in the air and we like couldn't, we were like struggling to

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.520
 get out to now.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.520
 I was like, I should have packed the other shoe.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.520
 And I'm like, Oh my word.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.520
 This is the whole part of your life.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.040
 I've never heard of someone building their own plane.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.640
 I mean, aside from the right brothers, that was, that was the only plane at first time.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:42.960
 Yeah, I'll stick to not base jumping and not flying in homemade planes.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.680
 Well, he thinks that because you are doing Jiu-Jitsu and he was willing to do Jiu-Jitsu

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:51.480
 for a while, he thinks that you might and I might also be into base jumping.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.120
 I didn't know he was really into Jiu-Jitsu.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.880
 It's amazing how many people are into Jiu-Jitsu.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.840
 Once you get into it, you recover.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:58.840
 It's a lot of people.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.840
 Yeah.

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:00.840
 Yeah.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.840
 I think we're going to roll in Vegas.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.840
 Me and Melky, at least.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.840
 Maybe I'll get trash to roll too.

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.320
 It's funny because when I hear a roll, I immediately think doing Molly because that's

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.920
 what people that do Molly, like you really?

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:09.920
 Oh, really?

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.920
 I don't know.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.920
 Molly.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.800
 When I heard you say we're going to roll in Vegas, I was like, oh, wait, Molly, is that

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.800
 a drug?

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.800
 Yeah.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.800
 It's ecstasy.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.800
 Oh.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.800
 They call it rolling.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.640
 Like let's roll some ecstasy.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.640
 Would you like to roll some ecstasy with me?

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.300
 Did I do it right?

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.300
 Actually yes.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.000
 Go to Vegas and set it up to someone.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.600
 Would you like to roll some ecstasy with me?

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.600
 Could I call it X?

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.600
 Would you like to roll some ecstasy with me?

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:36.600
 Would you like to roll some X?

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.600
 It doesn't want to go to Vegas.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:38.600
 Yeah, please.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.600
 Oh, I found the thread.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:40.600
 I just got to pull on that thread.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.600
 I really want to get you to come.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.600
 There's no chance.

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:43.600
 You and Lizz will just fly out for.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.600
 It's just like two days.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.600
 It's like totally different than a week at re-invent.

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.600
 No chance.

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:48.600
 I know.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:49.600
 I know.

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.600
 But no.

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:51.600
 I need to stick to it.

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:52.600
 Okay.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.600
 Fine.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.600
 Yeah.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.600
 All right.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.600
 All right.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.600
 Let's go.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.600
 I got a P anyway.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.600
 I know.

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.600
 I can tell you.

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:07.600
 I think I can like I've picked up on your.

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.600
 The cues.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.600
 Yeah.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.600
 Exactly.

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.600
 Yeah.

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.600
 All right.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.600
 Why do I have to pee so much?

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.600
 I have to pee.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.600
 I have to pee today.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.600
 Two hours.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.600
 I had to pee twice.

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.600
 What?

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.600
 Is something wrong with you?

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.600
 I think something.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.600
 I might actually have a prostate problem.

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.600
 Twice in two hours.

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.600
 Twice in two hours.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.600
 And I have to pee again.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.600
 And I've pizza.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.600
 No matter how much water you're drinking.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.600
 It's like a lot.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.600
 It's like every hour.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.600
 I think I should probably get it looking.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.600
 I'll tell them to help.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.600
 I'll get it.

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.600
 I might still have it.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.600
 Yeah.

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.600
 Maybe.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.600
 Maybe.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.600
 Okay.

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.600
 Speaking of.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.600
 We'll see you.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:40.600
 See you.
