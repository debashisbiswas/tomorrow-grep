WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 - Hey, did you see the DHH article?

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.440
 Of course you did.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.920
 We said we were gonna get on and talk about this.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.000
 I know you've seen it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.840
 I'm in it.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.100
 - Yeah, I mean, it's been everywhere.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.000
 And a lot of quote tweets, 'cause I guess no one can reply.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 So it just becomes like a quote tweet flame test

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.320
 with every single post.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.160
 Which, you know, everyone says it's a part

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.760
 of their marketing strategy, but.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.160
 - Does it work?

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.720
 Like who ends up being like, this DHH guy, what a jerk.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.520
 And then like, hey, base camp looks nice.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.640
 - I don't know, is that actually a strategy that works?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.600
 I just would love to see one case where that worked.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.940
 - Yeah, I don't know what that funnel is.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.840
 It doesn't make any sense to me, but.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.420
 (upbeat music)

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.080
 Over the article, it was pretty short, pretty straightforward.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.720
 And I think it, I can probably summarize it pretty quickly.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.800
 It was just, they looked at their bill for AWS

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.920
 and what they're paying for, you know, RDS, Elasticsearch.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.440
 Paying half a million dollars a year for those services.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.360
 And, you know, this is too much just for renting these servers

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.600
 to run the software.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.120
 There's gonna be cheaper for us to host it ourselves.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.320
 And I think in general, a lot of people were replying,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.200
 saying, oh, like for this many users,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.840
 like there's no way your bill should be that high.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.800
 I think in general, I try to stay away from stuff like that.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.880
 I just don't know.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.240
 Like I don't know what their product is.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.080
 I know what it does.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.160
 Like everything's always more complicated than it seems.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.280
 But I think the thing that's more interesting is

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.120
 that their conclusion was so broad.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.160
 They're like, we're paying too much for these services.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.720
 Therefore, the cloud has no value period.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.720
 We should go to self-hosting

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.920
 and more of you should consider this as well.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.800
 Does that sound right?

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.960
 - Oh yeah, it sounds right.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.640
 And I guess like is the majority,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.000
 isn't the majority case people not using the cloud?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.040
 Isn't cloud adoption still pretty small?

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.760
 And like to make the case that they're like the empire

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.720
 and where the rebels and we're gonna go out and prim

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.240
 and do dumb stuff, like where the rebels,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.160
 I think that's the normal thing.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.760
 He talked about like the cloud

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.560
 and their big like marketing cycles

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.720
 and how they've really like convinced everybody.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.560
 Have they?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.440
 I feel like they're just like barely touching the surface

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.800
 of what people should be doing on the cloud.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.640
 - Yeah.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.480
 There's a post, again, another post on Hacker News

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.840
 that it's the same thread every time

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.040
 about how the cloud is a scam.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.400
 And it's that same comment.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.360
 It's, yeah, we've had a decade of like people tricking us

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.920
 into thinking everything's gonna be cheaper.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.040
 And then I don't really know what that,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.000
 what people are referring to.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.560
 But yeah, that is like a sentiment

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.080
 that I think people generally have.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.480
 - Did you wanna defend DHH?

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.600
 Did you wanna like make the case for why maybe you should

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.680
 move away from the cloud?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.320
 Is that what you were getting at earlier?

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.840
 - I think there's some legitimate gaps

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.120
 that because of their service,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.800
 they're running directly into.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.860
 They are an email service that's indexing text.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.200
 There is no great serverless option in AWS for this.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.840
 You're effectively just renting servers

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.080
 from them to run a lot of stuff.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.160
 - Classic search is expensive, right?

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.360
 - Yeah, which is pretty expensive.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.760
 You have to like provision clusters,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.320
 you have to over provision them so that you can meet growth

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.480
 and then continue to over provision them.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.560
 So that sucks and it's not a good experience.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.440
 And I can see why they might say,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.380
 yeah, this is not worth it for us.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.320
 - It's definitely a gap.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.760
 And then also on, they're also using RDS

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.760
 and there is no, I know AWS has their serverless RDS

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.000
 which I actually think is pretty good,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.280
 but it's not really serverless, right?

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.800
 Like you're still kind of more or less.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.800
 It's just kind of like a good auto scaling RDS

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.360
 in like a normal RDS instance.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.480
 So again, like very low value in terms of what the cloud

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.320
 can do for them.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.440
 They're kind of just roughly managing these servers for you.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.080
 So I get their point of view and why they switch

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.080
 and that like specific decision.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.240
 I think I would have still stuck with it

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.240
 because as some people point out,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.400
 500K is like two competent engineers times.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.600
 - Yeah.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.600
 - So like how much money are you going to get?

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.920
 - Yeah, I feel like you're going to add

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.080
 two engineers worth of concerns onto your plate

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.560
 by doing all that yourselves, I would think.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.920
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.480
 But I think the thing with stuff that they typically publish

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.520
 is it's like it makes sense in like their narrow band

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.040
 of what they're working on,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.440
 but the conclusion is pretty broad that the cloud is useless

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.480
 and then that feeds into like some larger debate

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.880
 that's happening on the cloud being useless

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.840
 and people are pointing to it saying,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.160
 hey, look, look how expensive it is.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.080
 It is useless or is it scam, et cetera.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.000
 So yeah, I think that's just how this conversation is gone.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.480
 And I think that most of the people,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.600
 I think Zachary Cantor are the perfect summary of all this.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.840
 I don't know if you saw it, he was saying,

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.720
 it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.840
 People are skeptical about the cloud.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.120
 So they build stuff in a portable cloud-neutral way

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.600
 that doesn't take advantage of the cloud.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.840
 And then they're like, wait, I'm just renting servers

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.800
 that are really expensive.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.200
 Why am I using this in the first place?

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.760
 So I think that's just a cycle.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.880
 - Yeah, it's the lowest common denominator.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.520
 Like we don't know that we want to be here.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.320
 So we're going to put one foot in the door

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.600
 and that ends up being really expensive.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.960
 - Yeah, but yeah, I don't even know.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.680
 Is it that much more expensive than what you're doing,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.400
 even with using that lowest common denominator stuff.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.600
 But then serverless and event-driven and all of this,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.720
 like is that the answer?

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.000
 We can move to that for their use case.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.520
 Can you imagine building hay.com

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.400
 on event-driven stuff that you build like an SSD?

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.680
 - Yeah, I think, I actually like the way you phrase it

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.920
 in your video that you put on YouTube.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.280
 I think building stuff in this like neutral way

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.520
 can work, but it hasn't changed in 15 years

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.160
 or whatever the timeframe was.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.600
 There's all sorts of new interesting ways to build stuff

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.040
 that is very different and throws out a lot of the old stuff.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.360
 So you're kind of starting from scratch.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.040
 But yeah, for something like, hey, like,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.840
 I see no reason why it can't be mostly serverless.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.920
 At least on the compute side.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.480
 On the database side, I think for a lot of just like

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.880
 the business logic stuff like their users

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.800
 or accounts, things like that.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.160
 Dynamo, all those serverless database options.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.480
 What we're great, it's really just a search thing.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480
 That's a good killer.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.280
 - Yeah, that's missing.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.520
 Were you triggered by the renting computers?

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.560
 Like just that summation of what the cloud is

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.800
 'cause he makes the point to be like,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.280
 this is what the cloud is.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.760
 We're afraid to say it, but that's what it is.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.600
 - Yeah.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.920
 Yeah, I mean, I always have this dual thing where I'm like,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.720
 that annoys me, but then I'm also like,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.240
 I remember when I used to say that.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.600
 (laughing)

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.400
 - You're a Kubernetes, right?

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.720
 You're doing all that lowest common denominator stuff.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.560
 - Yeah.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.080
 I agreed with every single point in this article at one point.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.640
 - Oh, who, DHH, this article?

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.480
 - Yeah.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.320
 - That's awesome.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.920
 So do you agree, what do you agree with still?

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.720
 What do you not agree with at all?

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.320
 - I mean, I think I just, I agree with all of it,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.400
 except it's like, but you haven't discovered

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.480
 this other thing, you know?

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.000
 It's like within your limited view of the world,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.440
 your logic is flawless.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.600
 - And could they discover the other thing,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.360
 or are they always going to use Rails?

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.080
 And can you build a Rails app that takes advantage

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.960
 of all this stuff?

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.560
 - I actually don't know.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.960
 I'm not, I'm not that familiar with Rails.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.120
 I don't think so, 'cause I think it's great.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.360
 - I've actually, I've done some hosting for clients,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.080
 hosting Rails apps on AWS.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.360
 And I don't know that you could really take advantage

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.040
 of like modern, and a bit driven stuff.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.240
 You can replace like your Q with SQS instead of sidekick,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.240
 and you can replace, I guess like instead of running Redis,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.680
 just in another compute like your Rails app,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.400
 you can run it in a last cache or whatever, but I don't know.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.040
 It's all still, again, that pretty expensive stuff

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.120
 on AWS, it's not the new thing.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.520
 - Yeah, with this type of thing, it's,

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.280
 I think everyone's looking for the incremental step of,

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.480
 here's how it used to do things, I'm moving to the cloud,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.680
 and here's this incremental way of moving my stuff there,

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.200
 which is just lifting what I have and putting in the cloud.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.440
 And the result is just appointing because these incremental steps

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.160
 aren't gonna get you to anything game changing.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.000
 You kind of have to, realistically,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.400
 I don't think moving to the cloud is really an option.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.800
 I think you have to wait for new companies

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.040
 to just start in this cloud native way,

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.000
 'cause when people move to the cloud,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.360
 they just run servers in the cloud,

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.840
 and they're like, this is expensive, and it sucks.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.360
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.240
 Yeah, so that's something I think about like,

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.000
 incumbent companies and the disadvantage they have,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.600
 if they built their thing a decade ago,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.240
 like, I think it's hitting exactly what you're just saying.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.680
 Like, I don't know how you've moved that stuff

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.280
 into this new world, like, can you strangler pattern your way

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.680
 into, well, I guess Lego.com, so Lego did it.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.520
 - Yeah.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.880
 - But I mean, did they end up, like,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.240
 it just rewrote most everything over time,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.960
 but they had like a successful migration

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.840
 into now, like, best practice it,

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.840
 like, they're leading the way,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.160
 kind of showing how teams can build this way

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.240
 with multiple teams, and yeah,

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.440
 but I think of, like, a company, like,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.760
 what is the company that makes basecamp?

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.840
 What is their company called?

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.760
 - 37 Signals.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.880
 - 37 Signals, I think of them as being like,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.800
 they're never gonna change in that way,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.480
 that article is sort of reflective of that.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.640
 - And they have so much experience building things

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.320
 the way they build it, like, decade,

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.520
 like, literally creating that pattern, so.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.720
 - So it's probably better for them?

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.840
 Like, they would never move as fast with the new stuff

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.360
 than they can move with the thing they've been doing

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.520
 for a decade?

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.240
 - Yeah, and it's a pretty small company, too.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.920
 It's not like you're, so yeah, I get it.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.760
 It just makes sense for that.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.720
 - Smaller all the time.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.360
 The more inflammatory DHH can be on the internet,

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.600
 the more people leave.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.880
 - 36 Signals, 35.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.320
 (both laughing)

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.880
 - I love making fun of these giants,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.360
 like, I've ever done anything in my life,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.920
 like, I can just sit back here and throw stones.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.240
 What do I know?

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.840
 I can't even find, I'm looking at the article

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.680
 trying to find the thing that I totally blanked on earlier,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.680
 and I literally can't find it.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.800
 It's not even that long of an article, I don't know.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.120
 And he does talk about, like, it works on two ends

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.120
 of the spectrum, the one end, and I feel so called out

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.720
 when he says, "The first end is when your application

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.680
 "is so simple and low traffic that you really do save

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.920
 "on complexity by starting with fully managed services."

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.240
 I feel like that's a sentence I would say,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.520
 like, you can start simply with these fully managed services,

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.920
 and I never make it out of that part.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.880
 Like, I never get to the part where it's not just simple

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.760
 and low traffic.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.720
 But then what's he say about the higher end of the spectrum?

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.560
 Oh, yeah, second is when your load is highly irregular.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.680
 Okay, so he's saying, "The cloud doesn't make sense

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.320
 "if you have predictable anything.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.880
 "It only makes sense if you need to be able to burst

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.560
 "and scale at these crazy bursty rates,

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.760
 "or if you're tiny and you don't have any traffic."

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.640
 What do you take from that?

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.600
 - Yeah, I think the math on that is actually counterintuitive.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.000
 I think he's kind of intuiting that,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.400
 "Oh, if we have consistent load,

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.800
 "there's not gonna be a big difference

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.560
 "going to something that's serverless."

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.920
 But if you actually do the math, it's pretty crazy.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.920
 If you're constantly serving 10 requests a second, for example,

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:35.200
 that seems like a lot, like a constant 10 request load.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.680
 I should pre-provision stuff.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.680
 But if each of those requests only take 100 milliseconds each,

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.280
 you're actually overpaying by 90%,

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.680
 'cause in that one second, you're only using

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.440
 like 100, like 100 milliseconds of that second.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.560
 So if you actually do out the math, run the math out,

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.600
 the savings can be pretty crazy.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.160
 You have to multiply this by high availability.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.320
 So you don't have to have one copy,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.600
 so if you have multiple copies of stuff,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.200
 it's kind of surprising sometimes

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.960
 for what feels like constant loads,

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.560
 actually mostly empty space.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.120
 So yeah, I think, again, just have to do the math out

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.920
 on your own and see what you get to.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.920
 But I've always been shocked when I've moved companies

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.640
 to serverless stuff.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.840
 I knew it was gonna be cheaper,

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.040
 but it's often like a crazy, ridiculous multiple cheaper.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.240
 - Yeah, and it shouldn't be cheaper

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.640
 when you have less you need to do.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.520
 He makes the argument that you would have like cloud,

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.280
 his promise, you'll need less staff to manage your thing.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.080
 And if it's cheaper even without factoring that in,

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.560
 I think like if it were the same,

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.240
 it still should be cheaper, total cost, right?

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.800
 It's a whole total cost of ownership thing.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.960
 Like ultimately having fewer concerns,

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.040
 fewer operational burdens should mean

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.360
 your team can focus on things that are more important.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.600
 But DHH is making the argument that medium-sized companies,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.120
 that's not the case.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.040
 You can afford to just hire people

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.880
 who manage infrastructure.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.800
 Oh, that's the thing, that's the thing,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.960
 the thing that I forgot earlier.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.480
 I should stop emphasizing it 'cause I'm gonna forget again.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.200
 The thing is he makes the claim

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.240
 that it's really complicated to have people

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.600
 that can manage your AWS stuff.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.040
 Like that's just as complicated as managing your on-prem stuff.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.280
 And I think again, we're talking about the difference

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.560
 in running lowest common denominator, like VMs and stuff

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.720
 and using event-driven modern managed services.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.360
 Yeah, which again, he's correct

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.200
 because back when I did all the Kubernetes stuff,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.360
 I much preferred managing bare metal Kubernetes

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.480
 than like AWS's flavor or like Google's flavor.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.920
 Google's flavor is actually pretty good, but yeah,

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.280
 again, makes total sense.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.400
 I think the other thing he mentioned was

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.480
 no company he knows of has scaled down their operations team

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.120
 as a result of moving to the cloud.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.080
 That's totally, yeah.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.600
 I mean, that's so substantiated.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.560
 Like I'm sure there are plenty of cases.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.360
 I'm not gonna substantiate them as well, but.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.680
 Well, even if it's not substantiated,

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.520
 I think this is one of those paradox things

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:19.520
 where when something becomes cheaper or easier to use,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.040
 you use more of it.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.520
 So it's okay that your operations team didn't shrink.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.280
 Your engineering team might've even grown even

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.080
 as a result of moving to the cloud.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.120
 But if you break it down to what they're doing,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.720
 what they're focusing on, like if you have resources

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.480
 to spend on hiring and you're not gonna like cut that, right?

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.080
 'Cause presumably you have good stuff

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.200
 that people can be doing.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.600
 So yeah, teams generally don't shrink.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.760
 They might even grow, but it's maybe because

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.680
 they can more easily add more people

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.840
 and have them do the useful things they need them to do.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.920
 So this like simple way of just looking at it as,

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.520
 oh, did you fire people or not?

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.360
 Like I don't.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.480
 The company, why not a good company?

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.720
 If that's what they ended up doing.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.680
 - I've heard you in the past say like at companies,

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.440
 there's never a shortage of things to do.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.160
 You're always sacrificing what you could be working on

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.520
 to work on something.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.920
 So. - Yeah.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.400
 - Yeah, in that sense, I guess he's,

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.640
 maybe he's trying to argue that like you have people

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.680
 that are specifically, they have expertise

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.840
 with managing AWS stuff and you need those people,

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.400
 if you don't have the people who are specifically good

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.280
 at managing infrastructure and like on-prem stuff

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.360
 or whatever hybrid cloud, I don't even know all that world.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.400
 I know nothing about it, but like I guess my view

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.120
 of the future is people who are good at all of it.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.600
 - Yeah, exactly. - And like one role.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.840
 It's like the event driven serverless stuff

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.880
 feels much more, one developer has so much more leverage

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.200
 than they did 10 years ago, and that's a good thing.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.560
 And you hire everyone you can get your hands on

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.280
 and convince to work at your company.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.920
 And you don't think about what they're doing,

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.880
 you just know they're capable of doing

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.320
 any of the things across the stack.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.320
 I don't know, maybe that's some utopia that doesn't exist,

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.120
 but that's how I like to think of the future.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.000
 - No, I think it is happening, or even myself,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.440
 I'm doing more, you know, quote unquote ops work

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.480
 than I ever have before, not because of anything with me,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.640
 it's just become much more accessible and easy for me to do,

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.080
 so I don't need to outsource that into another person.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.400
 So yeah, I agree, it's just ideally you want a company

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.400
 where everyone's the less specialization

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.720
 and better in a lot of ways.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.520
 So yeah, I think more people just do the ops role

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.920
 and you have the same number of people,

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.840
 but it's not this thing where like the developer

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.720
 finishes their work and they give it to the ops person

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.640
 to figure out their thing, and there's all this overhead

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.160
 and communication and stuff that goes wrong in that process.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.160
 So yeah, I think to me it's more about making ops work

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.540
 just become normal application developer work.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.680
 And that's kind of the ultimate goal.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.560
 - Yeah, I'm trying to find the Simon Woodley

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.440
 had a tweet and I loved it so much in response to this DH thing.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.560
 I love Simon Woodley because you'll be like,

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.800
 hey, did you see that article from DHH?

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.400
 And he's like, no, who's that?

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.040
 (laughing)

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.440
 He's just so, he's so cool.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.880
 And he's like retired from cloud,

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.880
 but he still knows more than we'll ever like unlearn.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.440
 But he basically was laying out like,

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.640
 what are you even talking about like cloud infrastructure

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.560
 stuff, like if you're not on serverless, you're dead,

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.960
 like it's over, you missed the boat and I love it.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.880
 I just love that it takes so much 'cause I just hate,

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.040
 I hate when I see these arguments pop up

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.400
 and it's like that we're having to defend,

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.240
 it's better to do less undifferentiated dumb stuff

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.080
 at your company.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:36.920
 I hate having to defend that.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.040
 Like it just seems so obvious to me.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.000
 And I guess like there are edge cases,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.840
 that's Simon's point is like, there are these edge cases.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.880
 The problem is too many people thinking they're the edge case.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.960
 And like the majority of people should be building

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.800
 their thing.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.720
 When I think about base camp, like task management

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.760
 or something, I've never seen base camp in my life

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.760
 and I hope to never have to because I don't work on teams,

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.440
 not a slide at like 37 signals.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.400
 I'm just saying like, I don't use software to coordinate

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.160
 with people 'cause I don't coordinate with people.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.920
 But if I did, I imagine software where you're just like

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.880
 managing tasks and like action items and like workflows

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.800
 and all that nonsense and communication.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.320
 I would imagine you can build that on the thing

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.720
 that allows you to not think about literal servers and OS's

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.560
 and networking.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.760
 And like if you're thinking about that stuff

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.880
 to build that app, then there is no use case for serverless.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.440
 Like if serverless can't solve that,

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.360
 if event driven applications can't be built

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.080
 that solve that problem.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.880
 Like there's nothing complicated about that problem.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.920
 Am I wrong?

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.480
 Is there something about base camp or that use case

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.800
 that like demands serious infrastructure investment

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.480
 and understanding on your team?

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.000
 - No, I think pretty much in every category now

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.840
 you can find one company that's doing fully serverless stuff

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.680
 and not a whole product.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.400
 You can probably find a comparable product

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.080
 that is built with this new architecture.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.800
 So yeah, at this point, it's like, you can't argue it doesn't work.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.160
 And I actually think this is the way it's always been.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.280
 I'm sure there was a time where someone was like,

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.320
 if you're not literally, you know,

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.200
 putting your CPU on your motherboard and building your server,

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.200
 like there's something wrong with that.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.200
 Or like, you know, you're getting tricked

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.480
 to buy these preassembled servers.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.160
 - You bought into the marketing.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.000
 - Yeah.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.240
 - With these machine makers.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.040
 - Just life goes on and we build higher and higher abstractions

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.480
 than we build on top of other things that exist.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.480
 Like all the way down to like,

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.280
 we're not worrying about the electricity getting towards it.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.400
 Like it's just, there's just so many infinite layers

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.920
 over the thousands of years of work.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.120
 So yeah, I think it's just kind of dumb to fight these things.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.080
 - So is there just this, what is the like,

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.800
 what is the ending here that makes me feel better?

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.640
 'Cause I all these stupid arguments crop up

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.000
 because of these dumb blog posts.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.040
 Sorry, I'm so inflammatory.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.600
 I think I'm an inflammatory person.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.880
 I'm learning.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.560
 I think I'm very upset about things and I shouldn't.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.560
 'Cause it doesn't affect me.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.600
 But like, I get all fired up.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.440
 I see this article.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.000
 I see the whole debate rage on again.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.160
 And I just bothered me so much.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.240
 Is there gonna be like an unceremonious ending to all that?

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.440
 Like, this is not gonna be some big moment

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.400
 where I get to be like, see, it makes sense.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.480
 - You know what, that's what sucks.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.200
 There's never that satisfying moment.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.040
 - Yeah, it's not going to.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.680
 - I feel like I've seen this enough times now

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.840
 where there was a time where everyone hated static,

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.560
 not everyone, but there's a lot of debate around static

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.840
 typing and type safety.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.280
 And it was just like, that's dumb or like,

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.600
 that's just dumb overhead.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.560
 And TypeScript came out

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.760
 and just slowly got incremental adoption every single month.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.920
 And now everyone's using it.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.040
 And no one is, there was never a moment

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.480
 where it was like, ha, ha, yeah.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.320
 - Yeah, it's just, you go six months

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.920
 and you realize, and this is real, like honest assessment

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.400
 for me, I feel like I've gone six months

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.480
 and not seen somebody argue against TypeScript.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.760
 And that's like the first time on Twitter,

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.800
 I think I've gone six months without seeing that argument.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.480
 So it does feel like it just, oh yeah,

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.320
 people used to argue about that.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.280
 It just disappears.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.760
 - It just disappears.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.560
 - Yeah, we should maybe do like,

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.640
 someone out there should like archive this stuff of like,

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.240
 okay, here's the debate.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.240
 I should publish the debate it's over, hasn't come up.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.080
 And like, you know.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:09.900
 - I feel so good.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:10.740
 - Yeah, I feel so good.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.400
 - Remember when people were saying XYZ?

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.640
 - Yeah, I think of it, I've got kids.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.720
 I think of it like, we forget all about like the first year

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.840
 when we didn't sleep at all.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.840
 Like, in the moment it feels like,

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.160
 this is never gonna end, this is my whole life.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.040
 It's so consuming.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:25.960
 And then years later, you're like,

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.880
 oh yeah, that just stopped.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.240
 I mean, I didn't think about the fact that it stopped.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.200
 So eventually the DHH article is about dumb stuff.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.000
 Well, it's not DHH, this is his first

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.760
 moving away from the cloud article, I think.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.360
 It's not DHH, he's just the symbol right now.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.680
 But eventually these arguments will stop cropping up

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.040
 and will stop having to defend why it's good to focus

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.480
 on the thing you're trying to build

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.120
 and not all the other things.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.960
 And that's what it is.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.480
 I mean, that's what, I don't think of the term cloud

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.240
 or serverless as being clear in that regard.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.760
 I think that's what we're focused on though.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.680
 When we talk about a thing,

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.880
 we're talking about more focus on real problems,

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.320
 less focus on undifferentiated stuff, right?

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.360
 - Yeah, I agree.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.960
 And to be honest, it is as annoying as it is

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.480
 not as much energy it takes up.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:15.840
 On some level, I think we all enjoy being part of a group

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.960
 that's trying to make what we see like the next thing happen

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.320
 with a bunch of people being like,

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.800
 no, this old thing is better.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.640
 - Oh yeah.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.400
 - Again, that's why I can't sign with Vercelle

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.440
 'cause they have like one.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.280
 So I want my looking for the next thing.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.640
 That same thing in me that I kind of want

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.840
 to be the underdog to somebody.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.200
 - Yeah, that's why the Star Wars movies are good.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.360
 They're the rebellion.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.840
 So this was harder to talk about than I thought it'd be.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.520
 I thought like when that article came out,

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.400
 I was like, I gotta get on with DAX

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.400
 and talk about this 'cause it's so fired up.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.100
 And then we got on and it was kind of like,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.000
 I don't know, do I have coherent thoughts

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.840
 about this topic?

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.760
 Maybe not.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.600
 We'll see.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.160
 The podcast listeners can tell us.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.960
 - Yeah, you know, I kind of feel the same way.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.440
 I think it turns out we've,

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.680
 there's nothing new in this.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.920
 I've kind of heard this a lot of times

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.360
 and we've probably talked about it a million times so.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.520
 - I feel dumb even saying like TCO.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.880
 I feel like dumb like I'm like being pedantic

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.160
 or like I'm being, not pedantic.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.240
 I'm being like, I'm talking down to the audience

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.600
 trying to say terms like that

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.160
 when I feel like they've been beat so hard

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.480
 that drum has been drummed

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.280
 and I don't need to explain total cost of ownership

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.400
 to anybody anymore.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.320
 But I guess I do.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.360
 I guess there's people that still don't see the world that way

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.200
 and maybe never will.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.040
 I don't know.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.560
 Okay, I really don't have an ending for this one.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.440
 I didn't have a little, I didn't have a beginning.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.160
 I don't have anything for this one.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.300
 I'm just fired up.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.640
 This has been fun.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.320
 I'm really enjoying not doing new guests

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.960
 and just talking to DAX all the time.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.960
 - Yeah, it's good not to just have these conversations

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.160
 with myself and my head all day.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.000
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.880
 - Yeah, we leave it out here and we can kind of move on.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.120
 - So yeah, my listeners may disagree.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.480
 They might wish some of my things just stayed in my head,

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.960
 but it feels good to me.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.840
 I'm enjoying it.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.400
 I'm enjoying getting it all out of my head.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.880
 - Yeah.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.360
 - All right, it's been good.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.640
 Thanks DAX.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.480
 - See ya.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.320
 - See ya.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.900
 (upbeat music)

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.540
 (upbeat music)
