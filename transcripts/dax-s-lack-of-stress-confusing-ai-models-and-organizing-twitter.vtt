WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
 And this is supposed to be the first episode we put on a terminal YouTube

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.740
 What's the deal with whiteface thing what whiteface? Are you talking about why you trying to look like a white guy?

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.840
 I'm trying to look like a white guy. You look you look wider than me

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.900
 You're right, you know what I do that's really messed up. Yeah, I thought you were a white guy

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.440
 Yeah, I was getting pretty good. You do look more tan than me right now in this video, right?

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.140
 Yeah, and this is the week before I go on vacation

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.020
 Come back with us on burn

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.620
 My my cameras all messed up not capturing reality

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.340
 Yeah, when you start getting natural light into the picture and then you haven't adjusted your camera

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.260
 I know that feeling I know those days have adjusted my camera

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.700
 But the natural light keeps changing because you know the sun moves around. Mm-hmm. It does move around

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.620
 I've heard that probably just adjusted for exactly this time because it's the only time where

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.100
 Yeah, we're on the camera. Yeah, yeah, maybe I'll just do that. That's a good idea. Oh

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.040
 It's Friday. It is the day before vacation. You know that feeling when you have so much to do the day before vacation

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.860
 And we're recording a podcast. This is like dedication right here. Yeah. Wow. We gotta like pack

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.220
 I mean you have the whole kids thing which I don't know what that's like but like we're not it's we're not leaving till Sunday

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.660
 But this is my last day of work before vacation. Oh, I see I see so it's like wrapping up all the work stuff

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.020
 Before you go out and you're gone for a week when you really want to be gone

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.620
 You know, you're like gonna really like not do work. You know nothing over your head. Yeah. Yeah, exactly

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:59.900
 So it's like lots to do always do are you stressed? Like do you generally feel like in life with work with whatever?

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.900
 Are you stressed often?

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.740
 I

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.220
 Probably would say technically yes, but it's just been a constant thing for years now

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.260
 So I don't know if I really register it. I think I have moments where

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.860
 They'll be I think it's probably how everyone feels. There's like

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.940
 random

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.540
 That's of weeks where it feels like nine different things are

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.180
 crashing together at the same time and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.500
 I get pushed like

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.500
 to the edge of what I can possibly

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.300
 Have the capacity for but most weeks. I'm like right under that. So I think just one of those things where okay

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.180
 I'm pretty much maxed out. So if anything like coincides in a certain way. I like will feel

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.100
 like it's

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.580
 overwhelming but

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.180
 Generally, I don't think I'm like a stress person. You don't seem very stressed

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.180
 Do you feel like that stress like when you do have stressful weeks?

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.940
 Or above average stressful weeks. Does it leak into your daily life? Like when you're not working like with Liz

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.100
 I mean, I think in those moments, there's like not really many minutes where I'm not working. Yeah, okay

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.260
 I that's kind of way to find it. It's like there's literally no room for anything even a little thing outside of work

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.340
 So, okay. Yeah, my memories of that is just all I can remember is just doing a lot of work

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.180
 Yeah, I think I think I'm stressed way too much

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.060
 I think it's a there's some health signals that I just spend most of my life. I think stressed it affects my sleep

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.300
 It affects my relationships. I'm told I have a fact just fact check this

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.580
 But I'm told by someone that I trust that when you're stressed you can't bond like when you have like a high level of stress

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.660
 You can't really like build relationship or bond with people. I would say I can think of the perfect counter to that

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.900
 so I'm like maybe that's true, but

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.700
 There's also the classic thing of like going through some traumatic stressful situation with someone that like permanently bonding with

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.420
 Yeah, like really intensely

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.540
 So maybe they mean something a little bit more nuanced, but yeah, maybe yeah, the stressing is funny

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.140
 It's like me and Liz always talk about actually post is yesterday

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.500
 like whenever you see someone that's like I'm a hundred and fifteen and then like you hear about their life and it just seems like

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.300
 Very low stress like their whole life was like pretty low stress

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.620
 And that's how they get there or the other thing which I was saying is they're really evil

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.420
 I feel like that's like another aspect, you know, like there's always just like that evil people their family that just

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.100
 It is horrible, but like we'll never die. Yeah, I think that's like another factor

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.580
 So if you can't lower your stress, I think you got to up the evil

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.940
 I'm thinking okay. Well, I'm not sure which of those is easier. I'm really trying to like do the math in my head like

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.540
 Could I become evil? Am I already evil? I just need to lean into it. I think you'll be a part for you

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.540
 I think it's a little bit easier for me

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:56.700
 Yeah, you've got that you've got that evil streak. Yeah, it's some evil things just like thoughts things you post on Twitter out loud

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.360
 You're referring to my post yesterday about slavery. Oh, yeah, I saw that. I was that was a tweet

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.700
 Someone someone was what I posted

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.540
 Man, if slavery was legal, I'll get so much more done and a bunch of the replies were like you're like this is

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.940
 I'm like, this is why people think you're white. I was like, no, you dummy if I was white

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.100
 I could never post this is actually proof that I'm not white. It's like the most definitive proof

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.420
 I actually had the thought like how confused the people who think you're white and the people who think you're black are like

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.420
 They all have very different interpretations of this tweet

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:34.520
 It's like people on those sides. I got some messed up replies like I got a reply being like aren't you black?

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.520
 You would be the slave and I'm just like

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.020
 That's like wrong and so

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:48.620
 Twitter's fun, but what do you want to talk about today? That filters a lot of directions we could go. I don't know

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.520
 What do you have?

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.100
 What do I have like what do you have on your mind like I wrote something down on a little notepad?

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.580
 Let me go through my list. You just said we have a lot of direction we can go in and then I asked you what are they?

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.580
 And then you're like, I don't know why you're asking me

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.460
 Maybe I didn't have a lot of directions in my head

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.340
 There's one. I mean, there's open code. We could talk about open code now that you've tweeted publicly

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.180
 That's kind of a tough one to talk through. I don't know, but we should probably I guess we haven't talked about it

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:23.020
 Yeah, so we ended up having this split from the other person working with us on open code

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.900
 We just you wanted to pursue selling it to another company

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.740
 Just didn't make sense for me or Adam for that to be the outcome

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.300
 So we ended up forking it. We're doing our own thing now. It's going pretty well. We've got like a

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.020
 Bunch of nice functionality that you've added I started digging into the code base yesterday

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.860
 And I just see all these places where we can just make the experience nicer. It's just funny. It's like

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.860
 Again so much easier when you are a user. I just identified all the places where I was like

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.940
 I'm avoiding this part of the product because I don't get it or it's confusing. I'm just

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.740
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, so just kind of working through that. Yep. I'm excited for you to

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.180
 Do some things to the code base. I've just been like pushing the main

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.620
 like lots and lots of little commits and I'm just I'm moving at a weird like

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.020
 I don't know what I'm focused on pace like I'm bouncing on different stuff

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.740
 Uh to have you come in with your like nice chill unstressed vibe and just be like

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.780
 We work all this and you'll just do it like next week while I'm out. It's gonna be amazing very excited

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.580
 Yeah, I hope so. I would just say they're staring and just trying to absorb

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.020
 The whole code base into my head. Uh, I think I didn't do that. I just started slinging

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.380
 I just started like making changes and that was my problem surprise you're capable of doing that because I literally can't

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.900
 I'm just like I just get really like what is going on?

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.420
 Like where is it coming from? Like what and then I'm like I can technically make this change here

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.740
 But I know I just get really lost in in those things and I can't do anything to my mind

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.300
 I think what I was trying to communicate that I did a poor job of it

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.940
 Like I just start from like the feedback loop of I'm running it. I don't like that thing

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.860
 I fix that thing. I did and I just keep doing that and then eventually

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.780
 It goes all over the place because it's some of the stuff's just like not important

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.620
 But I'm like I hate that I want to fix it and it's just like all of it's mixed in

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.860
 So I don't really look at the code base as a whole. I'm just kind of like as the thing

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.500
 Yeah, I'm using what would I want better about this?

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.460
 Yeah, but I actually think this works out perfectly because you're working on fixing this stuff for

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:31.100
 People at the end of the funnel like they're using every day and then like here's the stuff that sucks

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.540
 my immediate place where I'm going to is what does

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.180
 the initial

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.460
 Thing look like like getting it set up and like how do we make sure that high percentage of people are again through that flow?

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.860
 I wonder how many people like read the read me and like try to run it and it doesn't even run

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.020
 I have no idea because like I've just been well

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.660
 It's funny because like it's even before then like I look at the read me and I'm like this already

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.940
 The way it's structured right now. We're probably losing x percent of people just because yeah

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.860
 Yeah, it feels a little overwhelming in some places

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.100
 Um and that thing I ran into where I tried to start it just to test it in my home directory

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.500
 Like it just completely froze. I was looking at that this morning

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.220
 Which by the way if you comment out like the lsp discovery stuff. It's still freezes. So I don't know what it is

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.020
 That's something else. Yeah, so I look into all that. So yeah, I think I just really want to focus on

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.060
 If someone hears about open code

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.580
 Making sure they get to the aha moment of being like whoa, I was able to like, you know, build a feature with it

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:31.180
 How can we get as many people through that as possible? Yeah, I'm very excited for you to do that do that this week and then we'll tell everybody

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.220
 Jump on board use open code

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.580
 The people listening the podcast unfortunately you're going to come in before dax is done all that and you're going to have the rough

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.540
 Like founders series experience

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.780
 There's a dish where you have to dig in and find stuff out

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.780
 It's amazing though the people who have like there's already awesome PRs

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:54.140
 Crazy like yeah, people understand the code base better than I do already. I know it's crazy

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:59.260
 Like they don't complain about tech choices or they just start jumping in and making stuff. That's awesome

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.660
 Yeah, I love those cars. Yeah, so I'm going to spend some time just absorbing a lot more of it

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:08.700
 Um, I think the nice thing is it roughly is the same shape as the sst cli

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.780
 And I've gone through a few

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:16.540
 Iterations on like kind of the architecture for that. Mm-hmm. Uh, I'm like giving you an API like a real-time API and

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.740
 All that stuff like that's gonna be be really cool

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:25.180
 Nice. I looked into connected. This is like very obvious. I don't know why I thought it was possible

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.340
 I looked into like can open code just connect to your

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:35.740
 Running lsp's like if you have vs code up or near them up and they're already spawning lsp's could open code just jump into that

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.500
 But all these lsp's use standard input output, which is like

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.380
 One client. Yeah, so they can only yeah, so it's like you have to spin up too

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.820
 So now you're using twice many resources, but whatever it's uh, it's not a huge deal

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:53.740
 I mean every time you run the oven, I guess like in different projects and stuff. You're you're doing that right like there's an lsp

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.220
 They're just for different code bases, right? What do you mean?

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:02.060
 Yeah, I'm saying like if I run the oven for different projects at once which I do every single day like different code bases

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:08.780
 It's spawning repeat lsp's for any technology that overlaps but any language but the lsp's scope to the project

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:14.460
 So yeah, you can't run less than four, but if you're running open code and neo van in the same project

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.940
 I was hoping they could both use the same. Oh, it's got it. Yeah. Yeah, but whatever. It's not huge

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:24.540
 I mean, I was the reason I think about that is uh, I have one project that is like an lsp torture

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.660
 It like destroys the ts favor and I've yeah never fully been able to figure out why

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.580
 Um, so whenever I think about long it's been dubbed two of those

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.460
 I'm like really sensitive but most most most like 99 percent of people don't have that problem

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:43.180
 Well, are you sure about this the standard IO thing because

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:49.820
 Well, never mind. I thought I I guess it varies based on the lsp, but I thought I read

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:58.060
 That they had a different architecture. It's not it's not required like you can it can serve over http and there's like different protocols

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.380
 but uh

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:06.780
 It depends who spawned it. So if uh, neo van spawns in it spawned in standard input output mode then

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.180
 You know, they know their process can really got to happen to what that like a lot of really crazy

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.740
 Yeah, I think it'd be nice if we just like copied over into like an open code directory

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:22.860
 Cop like install them into that. Yeah, like you could copy them if they already exist on a system or re-install their whatever

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:29.100
 Yeah, again, it varies similar to the sscli like there's a whole thing where like we have binaries that we depend on that

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:34.540
 We just auto download for you and and all that so love it. Yeah, there's a lot of familiarity there

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:39.420
 So stepping back a bit. There's so many people working on this. I mean like this problem this like

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:44.300
 Actual software developers building stuff. So there's like the whole category of like lovable bolt

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:51.900
 Uh, whatever. Yeah, yeah, replica you put in words and it just builds you an app or a website or whatever

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.860
 Uh, and then there's like cursor and wincerf and others probably

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.180
 That are like I would call them more accessible

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:06.700
 It's like developer focus but more accessible and then there's like this whole other category

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.700
 Which is the only one i'm even thinking of just

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:14.620
 Throw all those other ones out. I'm only thinking about like you're a real engineer. You use the terminal a lot

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.180
 Claude code was kind of like the beach head where it was like, hey, we're just gonna interact your file system

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.260
 And like you don't have to have another editor

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.940
 We don't make any assumptions about how you edit code or run your code

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.020
 We just we work on your file system and that just kind of like created this whole

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:35.420
 Category, but now there's so many different teams and when I think about like what am I like?

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.460
 What do I think I can't get out of those first of all clog code

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.700
 Once you've used one of these tools one of these agents that has

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:49.660
 Diagnostics in the loop like lsp diagnostics clog code feels so dumb. I don't know if you've used it. Yeah, I have

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:56.220
 Yeah, so you but yeah, I don't know if you use open code with lsp diagnostics. I got it working. Okay. Yeah

00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:03.900
 The difference is night and day. I mean, it's like it's a it's a huge change and it makes clog code just untenable for me like until they add

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.140
 Diagnostics, I don't even go back and play with it just to see what they're working on like all the features

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.940
 They add just because it's like it just writes code that doesn't work

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:15.500
 And then you're you're kind of like having to jump in and make edits so you just get stuff to compile

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.700
 When you put lsp diagnostics in the loop

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.020
 That's just kind of like table stakes. I think it doesn't make mistakes

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.180
 Like it makes mistakes immediately fixes them

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.380
 And you just kind of need that I feel like as a bare minimum

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:32.460
 But there's like five or six of these now that do that. Yeah, and I feel like

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:38.700
 They're the other thing. So then why open code? I don't know why am I making a picture open code? I don't know

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.340
 I just kind of jumped into this

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.980
 Open source

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:49.740
 So open source plus has lsp diagnostics plus it's terminal based. I think that's like the intersection

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:54.460
 That is like the uniqueness of open code not that there won't be other people to do exactly that

00:14:54.460 --> 00:15:00.220
 It's like ours will just be better because we have taste that's it. Yeah, it's it's this funny thing where I was uh

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.180
 I talked to you about this a little bit

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.420
 So it's clear that

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:11.420
 The editor with the ai thing together is a thing that gets the most traction right away

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:16.620
 Because we've seen that with with cursor etc. Um, so I think there's a lot of

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.860
 Projects trying to jump onto that form factor

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.020
 but

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.460
 Long term this feels like it's already too late like

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:31.900
 It should just be VS code. It shouldn't be a VS code fork. Yeah, but that's there

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.100
 Okay, if it's a VS code fork. There's already two

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.420
 cursor and win serve

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:43.820
 So at this point you're like so far down. Yeah to do another one. That's like in this same form factor

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.260
 It feels like just accept that we've lost that opportunity

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.780
 To me. Yeah, that just leaves a terminal opportunity because

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.580
 Uh, no one's really done an amazing job there. So even if the terminal one ends up being

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.700
 not as popular as the

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:04.460
 The VS code flavor of this at least an unsettled space where there's not a clear weather

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.420
 Like I think if you like 100% win that it might be bigger than getting like fifth place on

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:14.300
 On the VS code flavor of things. Yeah, and I think the other thing is um

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.300
 I don't

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.300
 Like I don't really understand

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.580
 So if you look at uh, so the announcement yesterday from

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.300
 win serve they are

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.620
 You know, they they have their quote unquote own model now

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.260
 SWE dash one or whatever

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.100
 and

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:37.100
 I don't know what the history with this is I know that both cursor and win serve the cursor is hired a bunch of people to work on their own model

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:43.260
 Um, maybe win serve was doing the same or this is just some collaboration with with open AI who's now their owner

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:49.740
 Um, it's funny because like I was posting others yesterday. Let's say this is an open AI model

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:55.660
 They developed it and they're gonna only deliver it through win serve

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.540
 to me that is

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:05.420
 a counter to what open AI claims to be and this has been a question this whole time, right is open AI going to

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.460
 Like when they say we're working in AGI. We're gonna like, you know build this crazy future

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.980
 They say that all the time or at least Sam Altman says it all the time

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.980
 But if you look at their business actions, it's not it doesn't look like a business

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:23.740
 Committed to to that or betting on that, right? So there's been so many I think we thought it was before but

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.700
 Like probably even like a year and a half ago

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:32.060
 They announced like some really boring enterprisey type thing with microsoft

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.380
 And then now them acquiring win serve and being like, oh, we have a model. It's like vertically integrated

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.180
 That's such a heavy bet into the application

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:44.380
 And they've set a bunch like oh, we're not going to compete with you in the application layer and here's how we define

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:49.500
 What's application layer and what's not but they're clearly just doing stuff more heavily than that

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.740
 um

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.540
 Like

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:57.740
 If they were really betting on being a platform that SWE thing would just be another model in their API

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:03.180
 That any editor could use because they're not trying to compete on code editors. They're trying to compete on on this

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.340
 This bigger thing. Uh-huh. And who knows like you have a model might end up in the API

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.420
 but I I am kind of wondering like

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:14.220
 Are are they now getting more defensive about this stuff and then they try to make sure their applications have

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:19.820
 Kind of unfair advantages that uh that other ones don't and if that's a case then yeah open code will have some

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.380
 Theoretically some trouble

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.540
 if you assume that

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:29.660
 Uh models are defensible, which I don't think they are yeah, I don't either and if they are then then yeah

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.860
 We'd have some trouble this one that just launched. I mean the SWE one thing. It's not as good as

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.980
 Club three seven. So it's just kind of like I want something better than club. Yeah, I mean, it's not better than that

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.980
 It's just like noise. I don't care about the news

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:47.660
 Yeah, and maybe like there are people I know that that want to use these much cheaper faster models

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.820
 I just don't know what they're doing with them like

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:54.220
 I feel like I have like a super maven type thing for line-to-line completion

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.980
 That's really good

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:01.980
 And then I want like big brain helped me do hard thing. I don't know what these middle ones like what the purpose

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.940
 Like people who get really excited about

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:12.540
 Whatever running quin locally. Yeah, I just I don't I don't really understand like what are you accomplishing with that because I've seen

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:17.260
 How not helpful bad model output is so like

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.900
 It's that much worse three seven which is an expensive

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:27.340
 Heavy model and it still kind of sucks and still you still have to do a lot of like

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.500
 Yeah, your own work to get it to give you what you need

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.620
 Like it can be really powerful when you do the right things

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.580
 But there's still like this learning curve and like doing all the right things

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:43.660
 And still I end up going to gym and I 2.5 dumping my entire code base to ask it the hard problems because

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:52.140
 Three sevens just stupid. It's just it's effective. It calling tools and going really hard until it gets to a solution

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.140
 And if you give it a good plan

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:59.100
 Very effective not like I use three seven constantly have hundreds of millions of tokens at this point

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.340
 Yeah, like three seven is amazing

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.060
 For what it is but like it's still not very smart and everyone that uses it heavily knows

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:13.820
 The big brain questions you go to gym and I 2.5 or maybe oh three and like bounce between those and they can do some amazing things

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:19.980
 Especially I love just with gym and I 2.5 be able to drop an entire code base because usually like I work on pretty big code bases

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.980
 They're under 500,000 tokens

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.140
 And that fits inside gym and I has one million token context easy

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:31.740
 So you just like I use repo mix to just like create a big static file that is my entire repo

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.300
 I drop it into gym and I and I ask it hard questions

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:38.460
 It's amazing like it's really smart, but it can't call tools for shit

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:43.740
 Like it won't do it because it wasn't trained on it. I don't know. It's just not it's not good in that role

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.700
 Yeah, we we end up complaining about this every single week

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:53.180
 Uh, and I imagine it's gonna be one week where it just gets fixed because I don't this doesn't feel to me like an unsolvable thing

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:59.340
 It's a temporary problem. Yeah, I do think google's gonna win this. I mean if i'm looking at the trajectory

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:03.340
 I just I think they're gonna come out with gym and I three or whatever

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:08.060
 It's gonna be really good in these agentic tool calling scenarios because I may not assume

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.740
 I assume they listen to developers and they actually care about this use case being google

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:17.740
 Yeah, and then it's just gonna be it's gonna be like I would never use an topic again. Yeah, which again if you are

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.700
 Open AI or one of these other labs or whatever and you

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:29.420
 See that same outcome that would also make sense why you're trying to share up the application layer because that is

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:34.940
 I think at the end of the day like chat gpt as a b2c product is

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.300
 gonna be really hard at dislodge like I think about

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.500
 people like far removed from our bubble that still use these products

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.380
 They just are not gonna like

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.060
 Which to something out of they're they're not like trying all these different things

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.860
 They're just like oh chat gpt like this magic thing that does stuff for me

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.500
 Like this other thing being 20 percent better like it's not going to be the thing that they switch

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:04.220
 So I will say google on that front. I saw my wife on her phone using AI mode on a google search result

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.900
 I hadn't even seen this there's like the first app now. Yeah, yeah

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:14.060
 So I could see google winning over a lot of normies. Yeah, that's yeah, that's they always have that and

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.660
 I think they have this weird challenge of

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:24.300
 They need to so the benefit they have is obviously like billions of people probably use google search every single day

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:30.060
 They they can leverage that but it's like double the double edge thing because yeah, they can leverage it

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.060
 but two now to figure out how to like

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.140
 Integrate people's assumptions of the product and push them into this direction

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:41.580
 And it's been hard like you've seen them like just insert the AI response at the top which has been like

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.380
 Not great now. They have this new AI mode tab

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.900
 uh

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.340
 Like what people switch and use it like do they get what the difference of these two things are so

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.980
 It's a double edge thing whereas chat gpt. It's just like a completely fresh. Yeah

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:59.260
 Focus thing that said the product worked on chat gpt is horrible

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.780
 It just is look it just looks crazier

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:07.660
 I think a screenshot of what chat gpt looks like now and i'm just like this is insane like there's so many

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.500
 Toggles and buttons and drop downs. I don't really pay attention now

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:18.300
 I need to I specifically need to look at the mobile app and I was just like this is such a busy crazy screen and I think it's um

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:23.660
 Oh, they actually cleaned it up a little bit now. Yeah, it does look a little better

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.620
 But still, you know everything just been under my menus. I mean I just used the web app. I guess mostly

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.700
 It is still kind of like when you really step back and you think about this era

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:36.940
 of like AI that's really helpful being injected into our lives

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:41.020
 Like choosing between these just ridiculously named models

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:46.620
 Yeah, but like search versus deep research and then you've got like this little dot dot dot canvas

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.140
 Which is where you collaborate on writing and code google has a canvas thing

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:53.020
 I don't know when I should use that like can I not ask you questions about code right here?

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.180
 I don't there's just like so many weird

00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:02.300
 Little like idiosyncrasies these things have developed that yeah, you can just imagine in five years all of this will look so stupid

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.020
 You know what drives me crazy about this. Okay, so I'm like

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:09.820
 All right. I get it. There's like different directions. You need to go with the models and you're experimenting

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:15.020
 So there's a lot. I was like trying to make sense of it. Okay. I get your own models do this like reasoning thing

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.420
 Okay, so I I know when I see oh, I

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.060
 The reasoning but then what is for oh like why is your own gbt for like

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.580
 Does that mean it's like also kind of doing that and then

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:31.740
 I talked to these models now and they all seem to converge on the same behavior. So I don't even know what's doing what like

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.500
 One of these initially I was like, oh, this like searches a web a lot

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:41.420
 But then now they're all kind of searching the web. Yeah, but then also there's like a toggle for me to turn on web search

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.900
 What does that button do I have no idea anymore?

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.340
 Anyway, so I'm just like what

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:50.860
 And then and then and then I'm like, okay deep research

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.100
 I like deep deep research it's a great feature

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:57.020
 But like should I be using it with for oh or oh three or oh, yeah

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.780
 Which model when you want to do a deep research?

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.860
 Yeah, I think that one is such an opinionated type of product

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:07.100
 That deep research should be its own tab where it's like yeah, there's like no options

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.820
 You just ask your question and they just pick whatever because it's a slow process. Anyway, it's super slow

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.900
 So I've done the deep research thing with like multiple models on the same question

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.780
 Just to like see it. Can I figure out like which output do I like better? I can't figure that it's too much output

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.460
 It's like it's very hard to read through both and be like comparing in your mind

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.020
 Which is better that think of how plugged in we are

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:33.100
 To this stuff and this is still so confusing to us like why I would choose oh for many versus oh for many high

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.380
 I still don't get the high thing. I get the mini finally like

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:41.340
 Oh for many they've been working on oh for and they just gave us a little like intermediate

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.420
 Here's yeah, here's a little taste of what oh four is going to be like but oh three is like baked

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.660
 It's out of the oven but four is bigger than three, but this is the mini four

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:54.620
 So it's actually cheaper and faster than the oh three. It's just a it's a mess

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.380
 There's a mini highly was a mini high. I don't get it. I don't get it

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.420
 And here's another thing. I I had not seen this before under more models. They have the gpt 4-1

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:08.060
 Which I thought was only available to developers in the API. I thought we were special

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:12.620
 We got four dot one through the API only it wasn't in chat upt when they first launched it now

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:17.340
 They've added to chat gpt. I'm like, what's the point? What's what's what's four one good for?

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:21.980
 It's actually really good at coding like if i'm choosing coding model across the board on

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.020
 it's okay, so

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:30.700
 Yeah, so it's the best if you wanted to like swap three seven

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.860
 For an open AI model because you just love sam altman and his doofus face

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:41.020
 Four one would be like your closest swap that in and call tools and stuff. Oh three super expensive

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:48.860
 But it is smart like I use it like a jimini 2.5 replacement for like hard problems. Does that make sense? Yeah, okay

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:54.060
 But it doesn't have the context window that jimini has so you're limited. You can't just drop your whole code base like

00:26:54.060 --> 00:27:01.260
 I don't know. It's all a mess. I hate it. Four one has really high context windows because it's kind of like made for programming

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.820
 I don't know man. This is it's funny because I think for me

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.660
 I don't I don't even end up doing what you do because I

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.140
 my habits are just like

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.860
 Open chat gpt and start typing right away and hit enter right away

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:21.340
 And after I do that, I'm like, oh crap like I'm on the wrong model or like I guess this one's fine for this. I don't know

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:29.660
 Because I don't want to start it over. So it's just like I just never actually do this intentional thing of I'm doing this task therefore

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.660
 I'm going to use this model. Yeah

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:36.940
 Mostly like if I go to chat gpt, I just use o3 for most of my like questions

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:41.180
 I just hate how slow it is because sometimes I just have dumb questions where I'm just like just tell me off of your memory

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.980
 Like I don't need to do it. I think everyone would say just use o4 mini for that

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:49.820
 Okay, I think that's what people like people love o4 mini because it's like 10th a tenth of the cost of o3

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:54.220
 But it's way faster and not really any worse. I don't know. I just like to use the best

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.500
 So I use o3

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.180
 I think the search also is another thing that I feel it's funny. I think what

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:06.380
 I think the UI reflects is they're realizing that every there's like so few true improvements everything is just

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:12.300
 Moving like the piece around on the board where it just gets better at some stuff and works other other stuff

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.460
 The search thing is a good example where it so clearly solves

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:21.980
 One class of problems that felt like all like that's the problem. I guess my stuff is not up to date

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.740
 But now I realize now that all these models are searching all the time

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:31.020
 Sometimes I just have questions where I actually don't want to get biased by whatever it searches

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:36.460
 I want to like give me like the Wikipedia answer to that of like I'm asking something boring

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.500
 Just give me the most boring like historical

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:44.540
 Like permanent ish yeah information about this like don't get confused by whatever's going on

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.860
 Currently with this because there's like something in the current

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:52.380
 There's something that's like a current event and I'm trying to understand like the historical context borders

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:56.860
 Yeah, so I don't want it searching and getting my bias by all that you need like a don't search button

00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.940
 Don't search

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.460
 Wait, but it's supposed to what it's not toggled. It should be don't search

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:09.660
 It should be but it searches anyway. It's still searches. I forgot. We haven't talked about four five

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:15.900
 Which is like the goofy uncle that I actually do switch to four five when I want to write something to someone else

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.660
 Like there's been a couple of things I've written I'm not gonna talk about it too much

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:24.620
 But like a letter to someone and I need help with the blank page problem

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:29.420
 And four five is the most like who knows what you're gonna get, but it's like more human somehow

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.180
 I don't know. Maybe I've just been like

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.420
 Convinced to that for marketing but that I do actually use four five even though

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.340
 It's so stupid how they named four five oh man. It's in research preview. What does that mean?

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.980
 I don't know the salt everything is in research preview. Everything AI related is a research preview

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:49.020
 Just gonna go ahead and put that up. Yeah, it's research previews of billions of users. It's it's crazy

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.620
 I do I do feel like this is uniquely open AI problem

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:58.780
 Like most of the other companies have reasonable model names. They're not that hard. I feel like Jim and I it's like 2.5 or 2

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:03.820
 That's it. Yeah, and for anthropic. I like never think about their models either

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:09.260
 No, I just used three seven. I just always use three seven. Yeah, and I'm sure like as frustrated as we are

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.420
 I imagine all the people working in open AI like

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:18.620
 They feel this even more because they see users like running into all this and they're like, uh, I'm sure they want to fix it

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:25.580
 Uh, but I don't know. Is it is it fixable? Yeah, it's interesting like thinking about the future of open AI

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:29.020
 Where they did like do this massive

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:35.500
 Hit which had GPT like consumers like crazy growth fastest ever whatever at the time

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.780
 Like they they hit it big with this big app

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:43.980
 Blake from the model side and when you think about like the future of model development and research

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:48.620
 Do you really trust them to like beat these other people? I just don't I don't I don't trust them to beat google

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.540
 I feel like any other

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.380
 Like google in the end. It's just like microsoft's gonna win the agentic vs code

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.780
 I feel like google's gonna win this and

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.260
 Then what is open AI?

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.660
 I'm even more worried for anthropic and I like like the ceo all the things he says

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.820
 Seems great. Uh, but if they lose the coding thing to google, what do they have? I don't know

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.380
 Yeah, it's a lot of money a lot of capital involved right keeping these things going. Yeah, it's funny

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:20.300
 I think we're so used to I guess like if you if you're around our age, I think most of our memory is

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.300
 New things coming out disrupting old things and like winning

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.580
 So I think we're very primed to that type of story

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.940
 But the thing that is common historically is

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:36.380
 There would be a new thing that came out and all the old players would be like that thing's dumb

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.300
 Like that's not gonna go anywhere

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:42.860
 And the new thing ended up being right and it would like displace the old ones and we can remember this with stuff like

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.300
 Like when the iphone came out all the existing phone companies were like

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:51.980
 That's just like a toy like whatever. They didn't look at it being like wow. That's really good

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:57.420
 We need to immediately squash it right. Yeah, but for AI. It's not going that way

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:03.100
 It's it's the opposite of what we're used to it came out and every single giant company

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.820
 Fully over rotated into it and we actually cannot miss

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:12.220
 If this goes somewhere we like cannot miss it. Oh you think about amazon the meme of

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:18.220
 Everything becoming AI yeah for AWS like they just from a marketing perspective from their focus perspective

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:23.340
 It was just like completely shifted. Yeah, so it's very different from them from the previous shifts

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:28.700
 Like it wasn't like when the internet came out. There's a bunch of incumbents being the internet. It's not a big deal like

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:37.260
 Whatever big like retail like walmart or whatever so late to doing anything selling on the internet and then amazon got in there

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:43.740
 Uh, yeah, I just don't see that with this shift. So I don't think it's gonna be the usual disruption flow that we're used to

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:49.740
 I just remembered apple and that they kind of are doing trying to do I don't know is there ever been a more like

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:55.500
 Crazy dichotomy between like amazing company that makes these the physical devices that are perfect

00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:00.140
 And like they still have siri on them like what what in the world

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:05.900
 They've taken so many swings too. It's like something is like broken with that part of the organization

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.460
 I have very little hope for it

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.060
 But it's like so confusing because this stuff just needs to be baked into the os

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:17.500
 I know I want it. I want them to be good at this because I use my watch to say hey siri

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:23.500
 Add this is the grocery list like I want all of my apple devices that I will continue to own forever until they die

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.940
 Like I want those devices to all be connected with this brilliant AI. I want the apple intelligence things to be good

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.380
 And it's just not gonna be good. Yeah, it just makes way too much sense. So

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:36.300
 Yeah, so there's that version of it. There's a version where

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.100
 We want this feature

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.420
 Now we can kind of imagine what a good version of it would be like

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:46.540
 And it's missing from something like apple or ios and macos

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:51.900
 Then there's all these products that should not have added any AI

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:59.500
 That now have like AI features in them. They're just kind of annoying and stuff. That's like we just have to like click around or ignore

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:03.420
 So it's like this weird like it almost feels like this weird

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:07.260
 infection it's infected all of these products and it has

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:12.220
 Made them worse and very few products are good about removing failed features

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:17.020
 They like this internally politically like bigger organizations just cannot do that

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.180
 Yeah, so

00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:24.300
 It just feels like a bunch of softwares got worse overnight and like there's gonna be some kind of

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:29.340
 another shift in the future that just like there's a bunch of new products that just

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.940
 Remove AI from the products that never did it. Well

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.460
 Yeah

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.860
 Like chrome extensions that just rip out anything that makes like an AI

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.820
 looking API call or something

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:45.820
 Or just like just fully like new competitors, you know

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.220
 Yeah, there's a like products get bloated and then like new competitors show up that are more minimal

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.780
 And then they get bloated and then new products, you know the whole loop

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.980
 Yeah, but this AI feels like it affected everyone immediately

00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.060
 So that reminds me of some twitter stuff that happened. I don't know if that was last week

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:04.940
 Uh, the dhh stuff. Did you see this interaction work treatment online? I'm sure you saw it

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:13.340
 Yes, I actually was so annoyed by that whole situation. I totally reassessed how I use twitter and redesigned everything about it

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:20.220
 Because of that one that was the straw that broke the camels back, huh? Yeah, yeah, there's been a lot of annoying stuff on twitter

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:25.340
 It's interesting that that one what we could tell me what was so annoying about it. If you're willing to talk about it

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.420
 Yeah, so the situation was dhh

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:31.980
 Was doing his usual thing where they're doing something

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.340
 Not that impressive and he's spinning it like he's a genius

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:43.340
 So that attracts people to argue with him about it and then so that zach cantor was like, I don't actually remember what dhh started with

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.020
 I remember zach was the quote tweet

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:50.940
 But I don't remember what dhh was talking about like how much money they're saving by moving off the cloud and how it's a scam and how

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.860
 Everyone else is falling for it and they're so smart because they're the ones that aren't flying for this scam

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.460
 And then you have all of these idiots being like, yeah

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:02.380
 I'm also someone that doesn't fall for scams and like I

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:06.140
 Yeah, like they were totally that that makes sense like everyone's falling for this scam

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.900
 But not me me and dh like we know we know what's going on. We're smart

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:15.260
 And it's all like people that just haven't done anything and are basically losers are all like piling on top of this thing

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.580
 so that's going on in one direction and then

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:23.900
 People other another group of people can't help but engage with this. So then zach cantor posted being like

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:28.780
 Well, like, you know, there's opportunity costs with everything and it seems like base camp totally missed

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:32.060
 The ai thing they have no mentions of any ai features

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.580
 which

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:36.540
 annoyed me because i'm like the underlying point is correct

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:43.180
 dhh can't just blanket say everyone is falling for a scam because everyone has different opportunity costs and

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:48.300
 It's embarrassing that base camp does not have more opportunity cost. That's a very good point to point out

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:54.140
 Saying that proof of it is they didn't jam ai features into their product. It was the wrong

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:59.180
 It's just a softball for the other side of the argument to just be like you're an idiot

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:04.220
 Yeah, exactly and then there's all these people being like well like, you know, he has

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:08.940
 he has like expensive cars and stuff so he's successful and it's like

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.420
 uh, and then people are like

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.300
 What's wrong with just like being that successful?

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.780
 Like why do you have to be even more successful than that?

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.780
 Like why not just be happy with your mansion and a bunch of cars and then

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.340
 It's just it's that whole stupid conversation

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.540
 We're like one talking about it. I want you to answer I want you to answer that question

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.580
 But the idiot's asked and I didn't ask just the idiots

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.500
 Why why is that not enough because it has nothing that has nothing to do with this question

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:38.860
 It is and it's totally it's fine. Do whatever you want, right? But the moment you step outside of

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:44.780
 That and be and start to say everyone else is stupid everyone else is falling for a scam everyone else is

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:49.660
 It's long for not doing what I'm doing. Then you open yourself up to be criticized by that, right?

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:54.220
 And the fact that people don't everyone tries to take this angle. It's like

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:59.420
 He's right because he's rich. There's people that are more rich that disagree with him

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:03.900
 So if we're just gonna go down to argument, I'm like, well, yeah, Jeff Bezos is more rich and like disagrees

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.540
 So dhj is wrong. It's just like a stupid line of thinking

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.300
 so

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.500
 Forget about the argument on twitter that made you change your twitter habits

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:15.580
 And I'm just a boy standing in front of a boy asking him

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.380
 Why do you hate lifestyle businesses because I know you do

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:25.500
 Well, maybe not hate them. You just wouldn't ever choose. I don't hate them. I just I just hate this whole culture around

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:30.860
 Like the the problem I have is anytime anyone points out any kind of

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.900
 Failure of base camp and there's a lot of failures of base camp

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.860
 They have it they've like failed in a lot of ways and they're not very impressive in a lot of ways

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.180
 They retreat to

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:44.780
 We're not successful on purpose because if you try to be more successful than this all these bad things would happen

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.660
 Your life would get worse. Your company would be worse. You have

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.260
 Leaguer employees would be more unhappy and that's just not true

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.140
 It's like a really stupid way of looking at things like a false dichotomy

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:59.100
 Yeah, and if we really want to get into that, let's look at a company. That's crushing base camp. Let's look at linear

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:04.700
 Linear's employee retention is like absurd. It's like 98 percent of people they've hired have never quit

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.260
 It's like really outrageous. So to say like

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:12.220
 We're building a really happy nice chill company and any company is more successful than us

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:17.980
 You know is worse on those dimensions. It's just totally their playbook. Like that's just how they've

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.300
 They've beat that drum for so long. Like that's how they market or something

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.900
 I mean, it's not to me. Like I don't think it's like oh, this is how they market for their product. It's just

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:32.300
 It's like a personal thing. It's like an ego thing. I mean like being arrogant is like their their whole thing

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:37.420
 Yeah, and like I you know what I did. This is actually what I go back and I read this all the time

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.420
 I go back and read DHH's

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.060
 Posty put out in 2010 about facebook

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:48.220
 It's a whole big article about how facebook is a total scam how every investors falling for they're never going to make any money

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:53.500
 Their ipo number ridiculous, etc. It's like if you read the way he talks about it

00:39:53.500 --> 00:40:00.780
 It's so convincing. It's really convincing. It feels like he's the one smart person using common sense

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.260
 in a

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:10.940
 Giant crowd of people just not thinking and following each other. Yeah, and he was so hilariously wrong about this because everything

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:16.780
 In business is counterintuitive. So the person showing you common sense of like obviously it's straightforward

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.540
 Like why is everyone over complicating it? Obviously just do the straightforward thing. It's almost always wrong

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:26.300
 So I go reread that and I'm like damn. It's crazy how everything he talks about now. It's the exact same tone

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.340
 Like I'm not even talking about the content. It's this tone of

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:33.900
 Everyone's falling for it. Just use common sense. It's straightforward

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.780
 Again, I don't care about what they're doing personally

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.140
 They're not stoop based camp founders are not stupid. They're smart

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:43.340
 They understand their business more than anyone. They understand their goals more than anyone

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:47.980
 Whatever they do for their business. I'm sure is better than whatever commentary that I would have

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.540
 the problem is when

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:55.500
 They now need to feel the obsessive need to inflate it beyond their own borders and be like yeah

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:59.420
 Everyone is stupid for not doing it like this and then I went everyone piles on again

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.700
 The people piling on are people that just do not do anything. So

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:06.940
 I was watching all this is back and forth and I'm just like I just need to

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:12.460
 Never see this shit. Like it just gets in my head and I get annoyed. I end up thinking about dumb stuff

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:17.180
 As reorganize my whole twitter. So I never see a post from anyone that I'm not actively falling

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.300
 Okay, I want to ask you about how you reorganize your twitter

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:24.860
 But just not yet. Hang on wait two things one. We should have DHH back on the podcast. He could talk like two hours

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.420
 I don't want to talk to him. I don't want to talk to him. I just don't want to interact with him ever

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:33.260
 I was gonna say we could talk he could just talk for two hours and we could just watch him

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.500
 Yeah, exactly. He was listening again

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.180
 I saw he was at uh he went to Austin to be on

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:44.540
 Yeah, so I really hope my twitter has set up so that whatever dumbass

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.780
 Clip goes viral if people are debating just does not know

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:53.020
 Are you so excited? Uh, okay, the other thing I want to say

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.580
 I was still I was trying to get away from

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.700
 DHH and this whole this whole recent experience

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.740
 And i'm really trying to ask you a question that I have like

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.460
 A perspective of you

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:08.940
 From kind of the internal view that the twitter people and our podcast listeners don't see

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:12.060
 You know, I know like a lot of ideas flow your way

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.380
 and most of them

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.940
 Are not big enough like you have a filter

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:22.380
 And I just wonder like how do you how do you stay so like locked in on?

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.460
 I'm only going to go for the biggest possible opportunities like what is that uh

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:33.660
 Like constitution in your mind that's able to do that because it does seem very unique. I don't know other people who wouldn't be like

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:39.020
 Just like most of these opportunities like chase them, but you're so like no

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:42.140
 It's got to be the biggest thing I could possibly do on this earth

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.020
 I think it's really just having been through the loop already

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:50.300
 I remember being someone that would hear a lot of this stuff and be very compelled by it

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:56.540
 Like everyone's trying to do these vc things and they never succeed and like the founders ended with nothing like that whole narrative

00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:02.060
 I remember being like, yeah, I want to live a life where I build these small calm

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:06.620
 Products and like they get they make some amount of money

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.460
 Maybe not enough money for more than just me

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:13.420
 But I like build a foundation and I'll build new things and they'll eventually give me the resource

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:17.180
 I need to do whatever I want right so the common narrative that everyone hears

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:23.420
 And I've pursued that approach and I have saw and I've deeply experienced what

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.700
 How wrong that is in like most cases

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:31.100
 Yeah, it is just so hard to make something small work and the counterintuitive thing

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:35.740
 You hear this from everyone that the linear founder actually he replied to my tweet saying his exact same thing

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:42.540
 Weirdly the bigger crazier ideas end up being easier to work on

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:45.660
 So I just have the scars of thinking one way

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:49.180
 And then shift and realizing like it goes nowhere

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:54.380
 Deeply understanding that my time is limited and I can only work on so many things in my life

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.180
 And being like I got to do things that have

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.740
 A real shot at working so that hasn't changed I'm trying to do stuff that has a real shot at working

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.220
 but there's like a naive

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:08.860
 Understanding of that and now there's like a more sophisticated understanding that that I have now

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:12.140
 And I posted just like one example of that the other day where I was like

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:17.340
 Everyone tells you oh like find like a small niche where there's nobody else in and then like build something there

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.340
 And you can probably like you know get traction

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:24.220
 And there's just like a pure mathematical thing with that like if you're trying to build something

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.780
 Where your audience is 5,000 people

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:33.260
 You find one person that wants it. They love your product. They think it's the best thing ever. It's awesome. They're paying you

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:39.260
 They have no one to tell about it. They're like in some niche and yeah, you can argue like oh

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.460
 Maybe people don't know each other in practice. It doesn't really work that way

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:48.380
 They can't go to their friends and tell them about it. They can't go to their husband or wife and tell them about it

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.140
 They can't go to their parents and tell them about it

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:55.020
 Because it's like too small of a product. Yeah, if you build something that's meant for a lot of people

00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:02.780
 Any user that's happy with your product is going to tell 10 other people and this like thing even if your end goal is the same like you're gonna

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.820
 The size of business is the same

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:09.660
 The one that can work for a lot of people is just so much easier

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:16.140
 Right. So there's like there's like that that thing. I've learned that lesson in like a dozen different places

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.380
 So now when I see

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.940
 Stuff that seems like a good idea but doesn't fit those

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:27.260
 I just see you as a trap. It just looks like a trap to me like looks radioactive. So yeah, that's why I kind of

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:31.100
 I'm able to focus on the other thing just the scars of

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:38.940
 Yeah, okay. So before I ask you about your twitter habits, uh, I think my perspective is so jaded by

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.780
 I don't know if it's a perspective. I'm just gonna tell you my raw thoughts and feelings

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.700
 Uh

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.980
 It's like it feels like it's been a long career like I feel like I'm just tired

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:52.140
 and I've sold like my wife on

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:57.020
 enterprise value for so long and I've made so much less money

00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:02.780
 being a founder and I have so much equity and on paper everything's so great, but like

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:09.820
 It just kind of feels like what if the things don't work out and none of them end up like I've had some small wins like

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.980
 Some things that have you know, if you have a startup for a long time

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:19.020
 like there are ways that you could receive capital along the way or money along the way

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.180
 but like

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:26.620
 It could but all my startups that I'm involved in could just end up dying and then I spent my whole career like 20 years

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:31.500
 Dying and pouring myself into making less like a fifth of what I could have made every year

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:35.580
 Just like doing consulting and like I don't enjoy that work. But like

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.780
 Before I did the whole entrepreneur thing

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:45.820
 It was a much better lifestyle and like it just is very tiring to feel like everything is deferring for the future

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:50.140
 And what if that future never comes and I'm like, why didn't I just do the race car thing the dhth

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:56.620
 Like lifestyle business and had a good lifestyle. I don't know. Well the dhth thing isn't people think that

00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:00.460
 It's like it's not it's not it wasn't a small thing like they

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.380
 That's like a tangent like I don't

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:09.420
 I got you on to that. Yeah. Yeah, so I wouldn't categorize him in this. I even though he claims to be

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:15.500
 But I should just got a hyping job at google and just been like effort. I don't care about my work

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.420
 I think what's funny is uh, this is actually another example of

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.220
 The thing that

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.500
 Seems it makes sense. But it's actually the opposite of thing is true

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:32.060
 So you described the failure case of your current path none of these things work out and you just end up making a fifth of whatever

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:36.060
 Well, obviously I don't believe that's gonna happen or I wouldn't have kept going for 15 years

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.700
 Like like let's say like it just doesn't work out, right?

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:42.460
 What is the actual failure case, right?

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:47.500
 The failure case when you work on these things ends up being like pretty

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:52.940
 Crazy opportunities that most people would kill for right like just take I mean

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.940
 I can't talk about it publicly but like

00:47:54.940 --> 00:48:00.620
 The thing that I was telling you guys about yesterday. Yeah, yeah, that would be a failure case for sst

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:06.700
 Sure quite literally like a impossible to get dream situation for 99 percent of people

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.980
 Yeah, so I think that's the other flip side. It's uh

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.500
 A lot of the opportunities that you have are

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:19.180
 Because you did these you went for these things that were I guess bigger more visible like

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:22.700
 And it's like so hard to tie because it's a whole playing a whole like what if game

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:26.860
 Um, I can talk about the failure case in the other way that sounds also really depressing

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:32.060
 Where you go work at google and you do a good job and you make a bunch of money

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:37.020
 And then like 10 years in they just let you off because you're just a number it does not matter

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.740
 Does not matter anything you did didn't matter

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.540
 You're just laid off because there's they're cutting experts on their workforce

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.180
 It's true

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:46.140
 And then it happened to be a time where the economy wasn't very good

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:50.540
 And you're stuck trying to find a job. No one's going to pay you the same amount as google because you know

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.380
 You're making way more than you probably should have

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:57.740
 Um, you don't necessarily have the skills that make too much sense outside of a company like google

00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:04.540
 And you have no idea what to do because your lifestyle is now inflated to something that only google level position can feel right

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:07.660
 But anyone can describe the failure case in a way that seems like fatal

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.180
 Okay, well, let me tell you a failure case

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:14.380
 It's worse than all of those that I sometimes feel like i'm on this path and maybe this is a rational fear

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.380
 But what if like

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:22.700
 They don't I don't fail these startups don't die. They just go on forever. Yes, that is bad

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:27.580
 That is the death that's actually the death thing. Yeah, like and then i'm 55

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:31.260
 And I don't have any kind of like cool prospects in the job market and it's just like

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:35.020
 I just spent my whole life making less money than I could have

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:40.060
 For a dream that like never really didn't happen, but also didn't ever

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:43.420
 You know i'm saying and this is a function of uh

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:47.900
 Experience as well and this is exactly why I think the small things

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:55.420
 You should not do these like small lifestyle businesses because the worst place to be is in a business that makes money

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.420
 but is not growing because

00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:02.460
 Mentally impossible to drop it because it seems like it's working

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:06.780
 But guaranteed to waste years and years and years and years and years of your life

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:10.620
 Uh, lifestyle businesses tend to hit that pretty quickly

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:17.340
 Uh, these like bigger things i'm talking about tend to be very binary like they very quickly don't seem to work

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:19.180
 or

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:23.980
 They like you're definitely i'm like, you know, a really solid path where you have a lot of options no matter

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:29.260
 How things change so yeah, I do think what you're describing. That's actually the real

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:34.300
 The risk and I don't really like dwell on that or I wouldn't have kept going this long

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:37.900
 Like I i'm optimistic. I'm a founder. I think things are going to the moon

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:39.660
 Uh

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:45.100
 But like after a hard week when I just haven't had vacation in three years and I really need a week off like next week

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.660
 That's when it all just starts to kind of like

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:52.140
 You play out those worst possible case scenarios and you get really depressed and you're like, and

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:56.940
 I might I might like a lifestyle business where my lifestyle mattered

00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:05.100
 The lifestyle business situation is a fantasy. It's not real. Yeah. It's like not like a real option

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:10.540
 It's extremely rare and a lot of the success cases that people point to

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:17.340
 Could not exist today. They kind of only existed in a moment. It's like levels saying you should be an indie hacker when he's like the only one that's ever

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:23.100
 Yeah, it's great. The best time to be an indie hacker is when it wasn't really a term

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:28.860
 Yeah, right all the ones that are successful started then there's no room for new indie hackers

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:33.500
 There's no room for news base camps like it's you got to look at the world the way it is today

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.620
 Not

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:40.540
 How was when these companies were started or these people started? I'm feeling better. I needed that pep talk. I confirmed your fear

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:45.580
 I was like, yeah, I'm gonna pick up on it. I got confused

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:50.620
 I started thinking about open AI model names again, and I just got very confused and it worked out for you

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.140
 So keep going

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:56.700
 What did you do to fix your twitter because I I hate the for you tab and I think you said you hid the for you tab

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.540
 so on

00:51:58.540 --> 00:51:59.580
 on

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:04.060
 On my desktop. I switched to type fully chrome extension. There's a type of chrome extension

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.260
 Uh that that you talk about pretty much everything

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:10.060
 and you can go to the settings, but

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.460
 My twitter

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:17.740
 Now only shows the following tab. It just hit a bunch of other like unnecessary stuff too

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.180
 Actually, I'm gonna see tabs anymore. I just see my following feed

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:23.420
 You don't see tabs

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:27.260
 And it's like it's just the people I follow and then I read up to the point where

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:31.420
 It's the tweet I've already read from the previous time I opened it and then there's nothing else for me to do

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:35.340
 There's really nothing else we need to do on the app. I can't like wow. I did it. Wait. No

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:36.380
 I saw for you tab

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:40.060
 Why don't I say go into the settings and figure it much? There's a lot of options

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:43.020
 But they're all just toggle so easy to easily like toggle stuff and see what I want to

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:46.140
 Um just doing this on the fly real time

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:50.140
 I also unfollowed pretty much everyone and started refalling

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:56.860
 Incrementally to like build up this feed and then on my phone now they have this habit of like only going to the

00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:01.420
 The following tab. I just never go to the for you tab on my phone. I like

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:06.940
 I got into a good habit where like I just don't have that swipe habit where we go into the other one

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:10.780
 Okay, are there is there like a way to export these settings or so many

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:14.940
 Can you just tell me what you did like what buttons you hit? There's so many

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:19.500
 Zen rider mode. Do I want this? No, okay

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:24.540
 Trends on home timeline recent media. I just got a DM from uh

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:27.500
 Rahul Digma

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:31.580
 Because the guy that was fired at twitter fake fired

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:34.060
 Well, I follow him because I like his company

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:39.020
 What's the way? What's this company Julius Julius AI? What is that?

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:43.100
 He was making like a stat music competitor for a while. It's like a basketball search thing

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:48.380
 Yeah, it's like a uh, it's like a nice AI power tool to do a bunch of in data analysis stuff

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:51.180
 It's like if you build chat JBT, but entirely around like

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:57.260
 Processing excel sheets and like creating visuals a data visualizations and stuff. Um, uh

00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.700
 Interesting. Yeah, he was like

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.420
 Because I just refollowed him because I unfollowed everyone and refollow them

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.260
 Mm-hmm because I was resetting my list and he was like, what did I do?

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.620
 And I've gotten a lot of messages like this and I'm like, yeah

00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:17.020
 I bet I bet like because I unfollowed everyone so I think people just saw people saw that I unfollowed them and they didn't realize that

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:22.300
 I unfollowed everyone because it felt like really personal. They got a few messages like this very personally

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:25.340
 Yeah, I mean, I understand the unfollowing. Yeah, it feels it feels bad

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:30.060
 Um, but now I think that's when everyone it wasn't personal well for a lot of people was personal

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.060
 But if I refollowed you it's

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:37.740
 You had to hide the ones that were personal under this like guys. I just unfollowed everybody

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:43.820
 Yeah, that was actually the solution. You know how we always you never unfollow anyone. Yeah, this is a solution

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:48.860
 Unfollowed everybody. Yeah. Did you like use like a tool to do that? Did you like hit a button?

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:54.140
 I think I wrote like I just wrote some jobs ripped in the um, nice console and just let it run

00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:58.220
 And then obviously rate limits and stuff. So I just like left a tab open for a day and unfollowed everyone

00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.540
 Okay, this this whole minimal twitter thing

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:04.700
 I just went through every single setting and there is no way to turn off before you tab

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:08.060
 No, yes, there it is. I turned it off. I don't know which one it is, but I turned it off

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:11.660
 I can show you a screenshot of my screen. It's really just well. I removed the tabs in general

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:18.220
 There's a way to remove the tabs. Oh, remove the whole tab thing, huh? Okay, whatever. I'll do this later. This is

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:22.140
 This is not our podcast listeners problem

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:26.460
 Uh, hopefully minimalist Chrome extension. Yeah

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:33.020
 Um, I'm not going to endorse it yet. Jerry's still out for me, but dak says it's great. It's great. It's great

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:35.420
 Oh timeline tabs

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:42.620
 Okay, I can X them remove distracting on it. See I thought these were checked. Okay. Nevermind. That's just

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:45.420
 Inverted

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:48.700
 Anyway

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:52.780
 There's something else I want to talk about man. I just saw it now. I'm on twitter and I just saw tweets

00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:57.100
 There's like I'm developing this list. It's not actually a twitter list. Just like

00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:02.700
 This small group of people that I follow that I wish I could just unfollow everybody but them and only see their tweets

00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:06.380
 I think that's what lists are for but the people who are like super smart about

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:09.500
 Evaluating all these models. I've talked about it before but

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:14.620
 Uh, now that I just have the following tab. I'm just seeing lots of those tweets and it feels good

00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:17.980
 I want all of those tweets. It's great. Yeah

00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:23.900
 And uh, so now I'm like, I want to follow more people because I want to see more stuff in there. It's uh, um

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:28.380
 It's good, but it takes commitment because I'm like on my phone. You can still just

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:33.900
 Use the other tab. But like I said that last round of stuff. I found so

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.700
 annoying man

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.580
 It's crazy how deeply it hit me. I was literally like

00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:43.020
 I I'm like I just give up on people

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:49.420
 Like why am I trying to help people like all everyone is just so stupid and just falsely same stupid cycles like

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.540
 I was like seeing myself totally like retreating from

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:56.060
 Talking about anything publicly

00:56:56.060 --> 00:57:02.540
 That's how we get that's how deeply it hit me. I hate you so deep. We got breaking news on the podcast

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:07.740
 I feel like our podcast is half an AI podcast at this point. Yeah, it's hard not to talk about AI constantly

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:10.620
 Uh, open AI introducing codex

00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:13.820
 Oh, I thought they already introduced codex twice

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:15.420
 You might say

00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:19.500
 Because they're used to be like an old model called codex and then they released a cli tool called codex

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.500
 No, this is an actual new model called codex

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:28.060
 Yeah, it's an open AI codex. It's an open AI new model. It's supposedly beats three seven

00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:34.140
 In the sweep inch, you know riding python. Oh, yeah, because open AI did say they were now just gonna take 11

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:40.540
 And it's 11. Yeah, okay. They just did wait. So wait. What is this? It's a it's a model specifically for code. I think

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:43.740
 it uh

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:49.500
 Yeah, it be three seven. It's number one now on the sweep inch verified. Wait, but is this what sw one is no

00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:52.940
 This is codex one, but like forget the wind surf thing

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:57.580
 They probably been working on that for eight months and it had nothing to do with open AI and it sucks

00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:04.220
 And we don't care. Okay. Okay. This beats. It's not a frontier model. This beats. Oh my god. Okay. I'm so pissed now

00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:05.820
 I'm reading the stupid

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:12.060
 The blog post codex can be guided by agents.md files placed within your repository. These are text files akin to read me

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:17.100
 So now we have another one agents.md now. There's agents.md cursor rules

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:22.300
 Agents md seems generic. So it seems like maybe that's what we have to use. It's better

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:25.100
 I just I was trying to make open code use context indeed

00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:29.980
 That was gonna be the one and then like amp just launched they use agent not with an s

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:35.980
 Agent dot md so now they're gonna have to change like everybody just sees it can just converge on one thing

00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:39.820
 Let's go with agents. I feel like open AI has the weight the billions of dollars

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:43.100
 I can't even find this blog post uh introducing codex

00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:50.780
 A cloud-based software engineering agent that can work on mini tasks in parallel powered by codex one available to chat gpt pro

00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:57.820
 Oh, it's cloud-based agent. Oh, I'm sorry. This is not so the model is separate codex one is the model

00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:06.700
 Codex. Oh my god. Why did they release a cli tool and a cloud-based agent named the same thing within like I literally cannot find this

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:11.660
 I'm like going to their news news page. Maybe I have an inside info

00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:17.580
 Where do I give this to you? I'm gonna give it to you and discord not discord. The other one. We use slack introducing codex

00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:23.820
 Okay, it's a mace. It's a problem. Adrian. It's cloud-based. It's it's amp

00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:27.340
 No, it's not amp is a VS code extension. I'm sorry

00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:34.140
 Is Devin what are there any other cloud? It's Devin. Yeah, it's Devin. It's cloud-based

00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:37.900
 So you like it connects to your repos. I'm assuming

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:45.420
 But the more interesting thing to me from an open code standpoint is codex one as a model. Yeah, so I'm assuming it's available today

00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:47.500
 it's better than

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:50.140
 it's a best one on so

00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:52.140
 Okay, well, this is the

00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:53.340
 Switch

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:58.300
 Every time they're like this model beats is the best benchmark and they go use it and I'm just like well

00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:04.780
 Yeah, there's the benchmark and then there's actually good like if it doesn't call tools effectively then it's worthless like

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:09.020
 I mean, it surely does their agent thing. Yeah, this is like the purpose of it

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.100
 So I I would trust

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:16.620
 I'm still trying to find in the api as codex mini latest. Oh, it is nice

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:20.060
 Codex mini latest. Let's go

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.540
 Oh, that's a smaller version of codex one

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:29.660
 Okay, so that's specifically for using codex Cli, but this is what yeah, it closely lies using exactly

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:37.260
 I guess we got to try this this product. Damn it. This is the problem with these stupid companies

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.260
 Not knowing that their platforms

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:44.140
 You're just talking about the thing like there. This is another bet into the application layer

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:51.660
 Like this is how you they have like a models page, right? Like open AI just has like I wonder if it's already in there open AI models

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:58.620
 Uh model reference stocks. No, where is it? Of course there are examples all Python

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:04.620
 I know what is it with the resurgence of Python? There's been so much stuff launched around Python

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:08.540
 Like I feel like we let the data scientists win or something and it's so stupid to me

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:13.420
 that like because data scientists all these people with these frontier labs all love Python because

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:22.220
 NumPy or whatever. I feel like that like became this thing that now all of us application developers are going to start writing Python because

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.020
 I don't know if you feel like it feels like it's gonna invasive

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:28.460
 Like species or something and like we like yes

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:32.300
 We kind of push it down and but we didn't kill it and now like for you to be surging

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:35.900
 Ridiculous

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:39.020
 Conplease let's just squash the Python. It's not good people

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:44.780
 Superhuman uses codex to speed up small the repetitive task improving test coverage and fixing integration failures

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:49.100
 Temporal feature development, so I guess some people had preview to this

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:53.420
 Okay, so but like if this is in the app I can use this now. I think I have chadgbt pro

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:59.100
 Where is codex is codex a separate tri codex? It's there's a button where oh?

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:02.460
 It opened chadgbt. I don't see codex

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.260
 I don't see it either and I have pro could be

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:11.980
 Oh wait available to pro team and enterprise. I think I only have plus plus pro. But it doesn't work when you do it

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:15.260
 Well, what does is that what canvas is

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:26.860
 So don't use o4 mini high for your coding anymore or for one. There's codex one for that

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.380
 But it's only the api

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:32.780
 Yeah, or only we we gotta try it now with open code. Yeah

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:36.700
 I don't know if the mini one's gonna be it's not gonna be as good as the cloud base

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.420
 codex one, you know I'm saying

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:44.140
 Like they're reserving the best model for coding for the little cloud tool now. Yeah, which again

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:47.500
 This is just not what they claim to be doing. That's what I thought

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:56.780
 Do I have to get chadgbt pro? I'm gonna have to get pro I guess faster workflows optimized for low latency q&a and editing while retaining the same strengths and

01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:03.820
 Instruction following and style. I like snapshot will be regularly updated as you continue to improve the codex mini model

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.460
 Okay, I mean it could

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:12.220
 Every time I've been optimistic. I've been wrong, but it could maybe it maybe it could be the new default. Oh, it could be

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.500
 I I'm

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:18.300
 like they've definitely been pivoting towards we don't want anthropic to win the developer market

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.700
 and it started with

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:28.460
 For one then codex the cli and now they've got this which clearly they've been working on for a while. So the naming is intentional

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:31.740
 I guess that they have codex cli and they have codex the web version

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:34.380
 cloud based

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:40.940
 I haven't read the article. I'm curious. Did you pick up? Is it like what we would imagine you you just like connected to your github repo and it can just

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:45.500
 Go to town. That's what it seems like connects with github

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:50.140
 But again, if I take me to slash codex and then it just redirects back to chat tv. D home

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:54.860
 Maybe it's not like properly released yet. Yeah, maybe not. I'll probably have to watch the live stream

01:03:54.860 --> 01:04:02.780
 I can see what the deal is. I really hate the thing they do where they like crowd around the table together. I know I don't like their videos

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:05.500
 It feels AI generated to me

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.460
 Yeah

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:15.100
 Uh, we recommend assigning well-scoped tasks to multiple agents simultaneously and experimenting with different types of tasks and prompts explore the models capability

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:23.260
 This is a dev in killer. Yeah, it sounds like it's less like tool for developer more like does stuff in your github repo for you

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:27.980
 Which is also awesome. I mean, I'll take that. I mean, I definitely I mean, I liked

01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:33.180
 The ux of dev in I just I just thought it sucked and was so slow. Yeah, it was just a bad

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:38.300
 Implementation of it. Well, it turns out breaking news is kind of boring for our podcast listeners because we're just reading the blog article

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:43.180
 Yeah, that's what prime does for profession. Oh, that's true. Yeah, it should actually read it out

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:47.820
 Also, this isn't breaking news because this is like, you know, they're gonna hit a podcast next week. Oh, yeah

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:52.300
 Breaking news for us now for you. I don't know. We're on the bleeding edge of

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:59.980
 Internet online to online whatever. Maybe people are just learning about this on monday even because they don't use twitter incessantly

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:03.820
 Those lucky ducks. Yeah, all right. We should probably get off here

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:08.060
 This one's gotten along. Okay, right here. I see ya

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:15.180
 You
