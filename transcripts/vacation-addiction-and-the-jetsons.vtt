WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
 Fantastic experience iPhone, Apple, great, amazing.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.720
 I'm so glad I'm in this ecosystem now.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.300
 (upbeat music)

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.920
 - Can we talk about how I'm so polite

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.320
 and you're such a jerk online,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.520
 and somehow it works together?

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.760
 Am I a jerk online too?

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.920
 Wait, are we both jerks?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.640
 - I am not a jerk online.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.680
 - Okay, sure, Dax.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.160
 - Oh, okay, you know what?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.280
 Let's get into this.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.120
 - Let's get into it.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.800
 - This past week, how many people were upset with me?

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.680
 - Oh, okay.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.920
 - How many people were upset with you?

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.120
 More than zero.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.640
 - Okay, okay, okay.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.520
 So you win this week.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.120
 You're the nice guy this week.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.960
 - I have to.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.960
 I'm definitely, I'm not a jerk, but maybe I'm toxic.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.720
 Is that about to rephrase it?

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.400
 - That's worse, good call.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.880
 - 'Cause I mean to people,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.160
 and that just makes them want to make me like them more.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.080
 - Wait, what?

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.440
 - Like, I feel like I make fun of people,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.160
 but then they're just like, "Oh, okay."

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.120
 But like, you know, next time

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.040
 we're gonna say something nice, you know?

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040
 Like, I make people crave the nice comment I dole out,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.920
 run every 10 minutes.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.040
 - You're the Simon Cowell, it's the Simon Cow thing, right?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.360
 Like, you know what I'm talking about?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.440
 What was the show?

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.640
 Who wants to be like, no?

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.480
 - American Idol.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.320
 - American Idol?

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.440
 - Yeah, I don't think.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.000
 - Who wants to be in American Idol?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.840
 - Whatever.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.680
 He would do like terrible, terrible feedback.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.000
 Everybody like, you're just awful.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.200
 You're so bad at singing.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.000
 And then when he's nice, it's a huge deal.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.520
 - It's like this tear jerking moment.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.120
 Yeah, it's a big deal.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.080
 - You see, I definitely resonate with that,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.160
 'cause I feel like that is more genuine and more honest.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.640
 - I guess, I just made a video about it, actually.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.480
 I can't disagree with you.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.480
 I really want to disagree with you,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.320
 but I just talked about how being honest paid off for me

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.620
 once the one time I was honest.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.720
 (laughing)

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.880
 You know what I mean, like being like super direct

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.760
 and like, totally transparent.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.880
 Sometimes it's really refreshing.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.800
 It can be nice.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.960
 - Yeah, you should go back to that instead of meeting people

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.640
 on Twitter and not unfollowing them.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.200
 - What?

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.160
 - I unfollowed somebody?

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.760
 - Yeah, no, it's probably, you never unfollow anyone.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.560
 You just mute them.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.800
 - Oh, muting people.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.760
 - That's why I said meeting people on Twitter.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.600
 - No, no, no.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.280
 - Yeah, no, I just mute people.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.120
 Never mind.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.860
 (laughing)

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.320
 - Did your brain ever go somewhere

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.600
 and then you're like, "Stop thinking about this immediately."

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.800
 - Stop, it's gonna come out of your mouth.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.640
 Just stop.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.840
 - Well, let's talk about how you're gonna end the week

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.240
 with a nice little vacation.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.480
 - Oh yeah, go on a vacation.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.800
 We're going to Florida and you live in Florida,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800
 so we're gonna see each other.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.600
 It's like the first day we're there, I think.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.440
 - I think so.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.280
 We haven't really booked--

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.120
 - We get there Friday.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.080
 - We haven't booked anything yet.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.920
 So we might do Saturday.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.080
 We might fly outside a morning and then early morning

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.760
 and then we might just go back Saturday evening.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.800
 - So this is a terrible time to have this conversation next

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.720
 but actually talk to Casey

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.960
 and we'd prefer you don't come.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.800
 I hope that's okay.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.200
 (laughing)

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.960
 - Why can't I give a straight face?

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.320
 - Yeah, I couldn't either.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.320
 (laughing)

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.240
 - That'd be fun.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.800
 Like a really good issue.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.760
 - They'll never sneak up on you or something like that.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.960
 You'll just always see through me.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.200
 - I had no response.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.680
 I mean, I honestly had no response.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.920
 I was like, what do I even say to that?

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.280
 - Did you think I was serious?

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.640
 - No, no, I didn't think you were serious.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.480
 - Oh, okay.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.320
 There's just no way to play off the bit.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.160
 I gotcha.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.160
 I wasn't trying to make it a bit.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.440
 I was trying to make it really awkward

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.000
 and hopefully sell you, but you didn't bleed me.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.840
 - So there you go.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.680
 - I was actually kind of relieved.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.520
 I didn't want to go.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.440
 - Oh, okay, yeah.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.280
 - There we go.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.280
 That's the right way to respond.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.920
 (laughing)

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.360
 - You would, by the way, to turn that around

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.760
 and do an insult on me.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.800
 - You guys are gonna be at that resort.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.160
 I'm not gonna say what resort. - Yeah, please no.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.000
 - Who knows, people might show up.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.840
 - You never know.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.680
 - You never know.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.840
 - Our wild rabbit fans might show up.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.520
 (laughing)

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.960
 So I don't know if we can, can we like visit you there?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.800
 Like how does that work?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.240
 - Just like, you want to come hang out on the beach?

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.240
 We can go get lunch.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.040
 - Yeah, there's a good day pass thing we can get.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.360
 That would be perfect.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.640
 - Oh, like a day pass to,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.440
 you don't need a pass that, what?

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.680
 It's a hotel.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.880
 It's just like come hang out with us.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.440
 - But like resorts are weird, you know?

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.280
 Aren't they like?

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.120
 - Are they?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.160
 - Do you don't have a wristband?

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.600
 - We're gonna kick you out.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.760
 I don't think so.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.680
 I mean, it's a public beach, isn't it?

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.520
 I don't know.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.520
 - Is it?

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.200
 - We're not staying somewhere like fancy, fancy.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.800
 It's just a hotel on the beach.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.680
 - Yeah, okay, we'll do that.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.000
 - I'm sure we can figure it out.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.160
 Like there's not gonna be any like,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.800
 I don't know, hall passes needed or whatever.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.720
 We'll just, we'll hang out.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.320
 I mean, but the whole day will just be like,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.560
 for like what we would have done,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.200
 if you're not there is just like beach,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.320
 go out to eat a few times and beach.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.920
 So yeah, we'd love to do all that with you guys.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.760
 - Yeah, I'm excited.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.680
 Liz keeps telling me how the beaches there

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.520
 are beautiful.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.360
 Have you been there before?

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.200
 - No, Casey just went for like a volleyball thing,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.600
 but I've never been.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.720
 I mean, I've been to Tampa.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.280
 I've just never gone to the beaches in St. Pete.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.440
 - Yeah, it's gonna be really convenient for us.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.880
 The flight is like an hour.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.720
 So it's almost like like a train ride.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.640
 - It's like L.A. to San Francisco thing.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.400
 It's just like a three hour drive, right?

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.400
 - Yeah, but like for a single day doing six hours.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.680
 - Yeah, to drive there and back.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.520
 That's what we do when we do the Kansas City thing.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.000
 But you spend more time driving than you do at the place,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.840
 which is no fun.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.280
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.360
 Yeah, we would have stayed for longer,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.560
 but like we didn't have someone,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.960
 we didn't have someone to watch Zuko.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.960
 By the way, it's Zuko's birthday today.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.320
 It's his one whole birthday.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.160
 - One year old Zuko, Zuko's cool.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.320
 Is that a real picture of Zuko

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.560
 that you dressed up in all that like military car?

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.400
 - Car back year.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400
 No, I found it on there now.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.560
 Okay.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.280
 It's a picture of a government holding an assault rifle

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.560
 wearing bulletproof vest.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.000
 Let's show it to her grandma.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.080
 Her grandma was like, "Oh, Zuko's so cute."

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.880
 And I just had no reaction besides that.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.280
 - Nothing said things.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.240
 - No, that's awesome.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.560
 When you get to that age, you're just kind of floating.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.800
 You know, just floating through life.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.640
 But Casey's grandma has coffee with Bailey's in it

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.200
 every morning and I just love that.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.240
 - Wow.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.920
 - She's like 95 and it's like, "Sure, why not?"

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.280
 You wake up and just get toasted every morning.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.320
 - Do you guys drink at home?

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.760
 - Like alcohol?

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.720
 - Yeah.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.320
 - So Casey's never really drank much alcohol.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.880
 She's like just health reasons.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.760
 She just doesn't really,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.920
 I mean, she had like a college phase

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.760
 where she got really into it.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.800
 But in adulthood, she doesn't really care for it.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.200
 I like a glass of red wine,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.100
 although I haven't done it a lot lately.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.960
 It's probably been like,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.840
 it's been six months to a year since I was like,

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.280
 I think I'll have a glass of wine.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.440
 But yeah, I mean, we drink it at home.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.000
 If we do drink it, we don't go out.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.800
 So we definitely don't go out and drink.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.320
 I guess with the tech conference,

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.600
 I was like the last time I drank.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.160
 - Yeah. (laughs)

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.000
 I was other adults, not with my kids.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.840
 - I'm kind of the same.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.120
 I don't really drink that often at all.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.680
 But a few times a year, I will.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.320
 We at me and Liz have a funny relationship

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.880
 because she is like a lot more masculine.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.200
 She has a lot of these like typically masculine habits.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.040
 - Yeah.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.840
 - So it's like way more likely that she's gonna be sitting

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.480
 in like a leather chair, smoking a cigar, like drinking.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.760
 (laughs)

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.200
 - It's amazing.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.640
 - Yeah, I love it.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.280
 I've always thought it'd be cool to be one of those people

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.640
 that has like the little round ice balls

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.560
 and like the little short glass and you drink whatever it is

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.280
 they put in it bourbon or scotch or whatever.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.840
 And just like setting some fancy room

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.680
 and drink that kind of stuff.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.040
 It just seems so cool.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.400
 But I also thought it'd be cool to be like the dad

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.880
 who gets up and like sets at the table

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.160
 and eats breakfast with the newspaper.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.040
 I genuinely have always wanted to do that.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.480
 It's super dumb, but I've just wanted to like

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.520
 be that stereotype.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.360
 - So bad.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.080
 - I can't see you doing the drinking one at least.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.440
 That doesn't seem like you.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.280
 - No.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.120
 - Sorry.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.200
 - I'm not like fancy enough or something.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.440
 I don't know.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.440
 I do like, I like some drinks.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.120
 There are some cocktails and things that are like,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.400
 I do not like just drinking straight alcohol.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.280
 Like that just sounds disgusting.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.000
 - Yeah, this makes a lot of cocktails.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.160
 And she's trying to like cut back

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.840
 on the actual alcohol part.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.120
 So now she's been making them with alcohol

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.160
 which means I can have them.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.560
 And they are like so pretty good, they're delicious.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.880
 - But you can't consume alcohol?

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.720
 Wait, what?

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.560
 - No, I can.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.400
 I just don't.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.240
 For me, I'm not going to bother drinking

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.480
 unless I'm going to get super drunk.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.680
 That's like my day.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.840
 - It's just like, it's like the social element of like,

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.920
 it's going to be a good time.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.920
 You're going to make some memories.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.480
 - So I'm not going to have just like one drink

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.640
 because it's not worth it.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.560
 - Yeah, like why poison your body for no reason?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.400
 - Yeah.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.600
 - The younger generation knows this, right?

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.600
 They figured out like coffee and alcohol,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.560
 not great to just consume every day.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.520
 And like our generations are dumb.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.400
 We did that.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.720
 - Did they inject out a coffee?

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.440
 I feel like everyone drinks coffee.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.080
 - I don't know, I think that's the thing, isn't it?

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.600
 The Zoomers, they don't think caffeine and coffee

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.920
 are necessary to function.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.680
 - Well, you know, it doesn't drink coffee.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.600
 - You don't drink coffee.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.440
 - I don't drink coffee.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.760
 - You know who else doesn't drink coffee?

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.600
 I don't drink coffee.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.440
 We're pretty annoying.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.080
 We are, this is a pair of pretty annoying people.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.120
 I don't drink coffee.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.960
 - Okay.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.160
 - You know what's about me?

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.960
 - They're just a, okay, they're a couple of days

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.880
 where you just got caffeinated and went crazy.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.720
 I do remember that.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.400
 No, I definitely have caffeine on occasion.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.360
 And I used to be really into the just black coffee

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.880
 every morning, I did the whole thing.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.520
 I'm like a reformed recovering coffee drinker.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.560
 But yeah, I just, when you drink it every day,

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.680
 you just have to have it to like be normal.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.960
 And when you don't drink it every day,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.520
 you realize you can just be normal without it.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.720
 And then when you have it rarely,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.560
 once every couple of weeks or something,

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.000
 it's like superpowers.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.120
 I feel like I can run laps.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.080
 I have like 15 new business ideas.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.320
 Just like everything is just on track.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.600
 You feel in such a good mood.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.480
 Everything is just great.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.680
 We got to do it rarely.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.200
 - For me, I just never got into the taste of it.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.120
 And I'm just like, I can't do it.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.440
 I don't like the way it stays.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.720
 - It's objectively disgusting.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.520
 I mean, there's nothing about coffee

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.960
 that is actually attractive.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.880
 It smells bad.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.360
 I mean, it's, okay, it smells good.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.360
 - It smells good.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.360
 - Yeah, it smells good.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.400
 It doesn't smell good on people.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.400
 Like coffee, breath, that stains your teeth.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.960
 It, all the things we just said about caffeine,

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.240
 it's just bitter, it's like,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.640
 it's not good tasting.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.440
 But you do develop this like affection for it,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.320
 where you really enjoy the taste,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.040
 because you've been brainwashed by the caffeine.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.880
 - I say this all the time.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.520
 I was like, oh, I'm just pretending to like coffee.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.080
 And everyone gets so pissed when I say it,

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.240
 which is why I say it.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.240
 And I keep saying it more and more.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.520
 - I mean, if you start out pretending to like it,

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.720
 and then eventually you actually,

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.000
 I get the argument that you do really enjoy it.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.920
 And my wife is like, why can't you just get into teas?

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.840
 And it's just different.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.840
 I don't know.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.400
 It's never gonna be as good as I enjoyed coffee,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.200
 but it's all just the caffeine addiction, right?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.280
 It's just, we're just little mice addicted to our drugs.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.480
 That's a whole nother topic.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.280
 Just like the things we were,

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.000
 have you ever not had something

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 that was like a constant dopamine supplier?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.960
 Have you ever felt like you had no addictions whatsoever?

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.440
 I think I just replaced them.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.080
 - Mate, I've never thought of it that way,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:02.080
 but I guess so I'm always on like trying to do something,

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.760
 which I guess is that.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.000
 - That's your thing.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.840
 Yeah.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.280
 I mean, work has definitely been that thing for me

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.760
 for large stretches of my life.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.600
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.640
 It's like work or is that not normal?

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.480
 - I don't know.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.080
 That's what my question is like,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.080
 does anyone exist where nothing has like that hold on them

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.360
 where like they wake up and it's the first thing

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.200
 they're thinking about?

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.360
 Like I feel like I've always had something

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.360
 like that my entire life.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.880
 It's just different things.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.160
 - Yeah, I'm trying to think.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.440
 I honestly cannot imagine a different way of being

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.560
 and anytime I try to imagine a different way of being,

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.880
 it just feels empty or like lost.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.600
 To me, I can't imagine like a positive version of it.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.920
 I'm sure a positive version of it exists, but yeah,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.760
 I don't know.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.880
 I always need something I'm trying to work towards.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.680
 - I guess I've only experienced a negative version too.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.680
 Like the only time I can think of

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.200
 where I didn't have that was a very wandering,

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.920
 like aimless stretch.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.440
 It was after I got fired at Sam Hughes.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.800
 That was just, it's like I, that was my identity

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.920
 and I didn't have anything else.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.080
 And yeah, it was not good.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.920
 But I don't know.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.800
 People have always told me I should be more balanced.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.560
 Like I flexed one muscle too much.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.000
 So I think about these things.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.120
 - Maybe, but I think what I,

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.000
 the thing I, we might have maybe been talked about before.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.920
 Maybe you know on a previous episode,

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.560
 but I always think about this concept

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.600
 of people like really being eager to retire

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.040
 when they hit retirement age and they retire

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.680
 and then they die shortly after.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.120
 Like they deteriorate really quickly and they die.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.080
 And I've seen this a lot like up close

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.400
 where in the span of five years,

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.520
 I'll just go from like a normal live person

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.800
 to kind of like a shell of who they were.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.000
 And I kind of think it's this.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.520
 It's like the moment you stop,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.800
 you know, start to deteriorate in a lot of ways.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.560
 I think about Warren Buffett and how he's like,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.320
 he is so old.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.200
 Oh my God, he is like so old.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.720
 But he's still working and talking about

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.560
 stuff every single day.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.280
 Like he's been doing that till like the last thing he says

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.880
 is gonna be something work related before he dies probably.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.480
 And he is so mentally there compared to a lot of other people

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.600
 like even 10 years younger than him.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.360
 So I feel like there's something there.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.280
 - But what do you say to people that I feel like

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.040
 I've had these conversations, especially online,

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.400
 it turns into like you're missing out.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.280
 If you're just working like to experience other things

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.160
 in life or do you buy into the retirement thing?

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.880
 Like is that a past generation concept of like working

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.960
 till you're 55 or 65 or whatever.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.920
 And then retiring, is that just like the privilege saying?

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.760
 I don't know.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.000
 All these things are in conflict with my brain.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Like should I just work on this stuff as long as I possibly can?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.520
 Is that what you're saying?

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.000
 Like I'll grow old more gracefully if I do.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.160
 - I think yeah, I think when you don't have a purpose

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.240
 and your brain's not actively working on stuff,

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.480
 it just does tear it as you get older.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.720
 I don't know.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.560
 The people that say you're missing out,

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.400
 I think it's arbitrary.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.520
 It's like you're looking at the stuff I'm doing

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.720
 and you're personally deciding I don't care about that

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.080
 and you like other stuff.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.920
 That's fine.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.240
 But we just say, oh, you're missing out.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.440
 'Cause I can just say you're missing out on the stuff

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.920
 that I'm getting, you know?

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.760
 I don't know.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.840
 I don't really understand that.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.160
 The thing I'm more talking about is the people that are like

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.040
 work sucks.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.800
 There's no form of work that can't suck.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.520
 So the thing you should optimize for is to like retire

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.880
 by the age of 40.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.840
 And then it's like the fire thing or whatever,

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.040
 financial independence retire early.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.440
 Whatever the thing is, the whole subreddit,

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.920
 the whole community and culture around this.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.320
 And I'm just like, okay, but like then,

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.600
 then what, like did you set up a life where,

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.320
 or you set up like a life where once you're that age,

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.240
 you now have momentum to do other stuff

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.880
 or you just kind of like,

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.320
 I feel that most people don't have plans

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.240
 or just like, I don't want to work.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.520
 And I hit that and it's gonna, now what are you gonna do?

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.760
 Like you can spend a lot of time with your family

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.560
 and kids and all that stuff as well,

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.600
 but you know, it's not gonna be 100% of your time.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.440
 - Yep.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.520
 - Especially as they get older as well.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.880
 - Yeah, are the fire people, is that the fire festival?

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.880
 (laughing)

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.720
 Is that people who want to retire early?

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.720
 I honestly don't know.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.840
 - That's no actual question.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.560
 (laughing)

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.360
 - I can't, this is like so like these two concepts

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.720
 cannot be more unrelated.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.560
 - Oh really?

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.400
 Okay.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.480
 - The fire festival was that crazy like,

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.760
 did you never see the documentary

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.120
 or like, never looked into something?

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.280
 - I think I've heard of the documentary.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.480
 Is this the one that's in the desert?

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.320
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.160
 It's Burning Man.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.360
 Also, fire related, I guess, wait, it's not--

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.560
 - Also fire, wow, yeah, that's confusing.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.840
 They should really work on their names.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.000
 - And there's Fire Island,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 which is also a completely different concept, so--

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.200
 - I've never even heard of that one.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.560
 So it must be really spicy.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.800
 (laughing)

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.720
 - Fire Festival was this thing,

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.400
 it was like super hype music festival.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.160
 I forgot where, some island in the Caribbean.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.840
 And it was like, crazy, crazy hype.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.160
 Like so many like celebrities

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.960
 and like, it was gonna be the biggest music festival ever.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.400
 And it just ended up being a complete disaster

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.320
 'cause the guy behind it was just like,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.520
 so, so uncommon.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.000
 Like people showed up and they were like,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.760
 tents and like not even tents.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.320
 And there was like styrofoam things

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.320
 with like one slice of bread in it for food.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.560
 Just like, everything possibly went--

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.040
 - So FTX, but with music.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.880
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.720
 - That's what it sounds like.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.560
 - And there's a whole documentary on it.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.080
 It's actually really hilarious.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.840
 It's like the craziest, funniest stuff.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.200
 - Okay, so it was a one time thing.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.760
 That's not an ongoing festival.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.800
 Okay, so the fire people,

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.440
 they can reclaim that name.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.920
 They could bring honor back.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.680
 - It's AFIRE and I think Fire Festival

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.720
 might've been with a YA 'cause of course,

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.880
 it's gonna be with a YA.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.120
 (laughing)

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.280
 That's so funny.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.000
 - Yeah.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.360
 Fire, retire early, Fire Festival, both not for me.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.200
 - Yeah, not for me.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.440
 I just, my wife has always asked,

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.320
 like, what would you do if you're retired?

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.320
 I just can't imagine a world.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.520
 But at the same time, like AI, all this stuff,

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.080
 it's like, am I actually gonna be doing what I do right now?

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.680
 For another 20, 30, 40 years?

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.520
 - Probably not.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.600
 You weren't doing what you're doing right now two years ago.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.760
 - True, such a measured take.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.840
 Look at you, just off the dome.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.080
 You just had that one ready.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.720
 - Yeah, so I don't know what I'm gonna be doing in five years

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.440
 but I know it's gonna look like work,

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.640
 but it's gonna be maybe completely different.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.280
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.200
 And that's been constant in our careers.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.560
 Hey, I got a question that's random for you.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.560
 If you could only be on one internet place,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.200
 like one social media platform I'll say,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.480
 like you could only hang out in YouTube comments,

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.840
 on Twitter, on Twitch, one place for the rest of your life.

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.680
 What are you thinking?

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.200
 - That's my life.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.120
 Oh, I'm an annoying answer.

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.400
 It's gonna be Discord.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.400
 - Oh, good call.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.680
 - And I'll give you a very detailed reason why.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.800
 - Okay, please.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.520
 - So, for me, the hard choice between is,

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.360
 for me, I would naturally say Twitter,

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.280
 like, 'cause that's where I spend a lot of my time.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.320
 - Yeah, you like drama, et cetera.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.160
 - Yeah, of course.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.000
 And I like, I've invested the most there.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.200
 But if I had to pick one, I'd pick Discord,

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.640
 because, again, just like a chat platform,

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.200
 good for having one-to-one relationships with people.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.760
 SST works out of there, so obviously for work.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.600
 But, this is very specific.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.240
 Nikita Beer works at Discord now.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.000
 And Discord also recently said,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.280
 you see the thing where they were like,

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.520
 you know how Discord does that thing

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.600
 where it's like your username,

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.240
 plus a bunch of random numbers after?

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.240
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.000
 They're going back on that and they're saying,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.520
 everyone needs unique user names now.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.520
 - Oh, seriously?

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.040
 - So, over the next couple of months,

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.160
 like, they're gonna roll that out so people,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.080
 based on the age of your account,

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.680
 you get an opportunity to choose your username first?

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.520
 - Oh, no.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.440
 - Yeah.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.240
 I'm gonna register adam.dev.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.080
 - Stop it.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.920
 (laughing)

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.760
 I'll take the HDXR.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.600
 Wouldn't that be funny?

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.440
 We had a chat.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.040
 (laughing)

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.160
 - So, they're making that shift.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.600
 Plus, Nikita Beer works there,

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.440
 who's like, just the social media, God.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.200
 - Yeah, he's the guy that they found it.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.240
 - They acquired something right, yeah, yeah.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.320
 So, I don't know, he has also tweeted saying

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.720
 that he's like, kind of done with that,

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.120
 but my bet here would be,

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.800
 the reason they're doing the username thing

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.520
 is because they're trying to do something

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.240
 that's a little bit more like global versus like,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.760
 everything in Discord has scoped the servers.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.600
 - Oh, okay.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.760
 - Yeah.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.160
 - I wonder if they're gonna do something like Twitter

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.200
 or like whatever the next generation of Twitter could be.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.360
 Plus, he's just a genius,

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.120
 so I think he would run that really well if he's involved.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.040
 So, I had to pick one to mix up, I like it today.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.320
 I've used it for a long time.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.680
 It's just gotten so much better over the years.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.480
 I've used it, never had to complain with it.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.080
 And I feel like it's still get 10, 100 times better.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:17.920
 There you go.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.720
 - Yeah, I do think like, I've noticed a lot more

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.880
 of taking like my Twitter DMs to Discord.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.880
 Like, hey, do you have Discord?

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.920
 This is just, it's awkward to remember

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.200
 to check Twitter DMs.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.040
 - Yeah.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.240
 - So, I've noticed that.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.960
 - I love the mix that there's,

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.240
 it's like Slack where there's like, you know, workspaces

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.320
 and you have like your company

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.800
 or different projects, whatever.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:42.400
 But, the DMs are global, which is a issue with Slack.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.280
 Like, you meet someone in one Slack

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.600
 and you're just gonna continue to mess with them

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.160
 and that one Slack about like anything.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.600
 So, it's always been kind of weird.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.920
 So, DMs being global, also having that.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.520
 It's like, again, like brilliant design.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.120
 - The number of servers though.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.800
 What is the solve for just,

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.800
 I know you can do like folders.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.640
 I noticed.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.840
 - I've just dropped a lot of servers.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.560
 I don't know. - Oh, really?

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.120
 Is, do I have like a FOMO problem?

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.720
 What, why am I in so many servers?

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.120
 - Do we even look at them?

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.960
 - No, never. - I've been calling them

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.800
 with them.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.640
 - Yeah, it's literally never.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.080
 - You just read them if you need them, man.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.080
 - Exactly.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.480
 Can't believe I never thought about it.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.160
 - I just keep ones that I message often enough in

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.560
 because they're usually like open source ones

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.200
 where I like, I just need trouble shooting help,

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.720
 just like support stuff.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.560
 - Yeah.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.160
 - And that is pretty much it.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.320
 Then I have SST and I have just, yeah,

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.800
 just ones that I'm, if I'm not like actively posting in there

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.640
 at least once a week,

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.000
 it's like there's no reason to need to be there.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 - No, that's such a good point.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.840
 I'm gonna delete them all.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.200
 'Cause I literally get notifications sometimes

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.600
 from some of these things.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.720
 Like when I try and enable discord notifications on my phone

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.840
 'cause I wanna make sure I get something

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.200
 and then I'm getting them from all these random places

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.440
 that I have ever visited once.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.280
 Just gotta leave.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.760
 - Yeah, the server thing can get kind of messy,

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.920
 but I don't know.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.000
 Yeah, I've just loved it as a platform for super long.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.440
 I have also the voice, the drop-in voice thing,

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.400
 such a smart implementation, is it like doing voice call?

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.760
 It just makes it flow away more naturally.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.160
 Like Slack, try to like copy it,

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.560
 but they decided to do their own take on it.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.160
 But then their own take on it just kind of

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.240
 undid the magic of it.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.360
 So yeah, it's just like, I just trust that company.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.240
 - Is there like a walk, sorry, I was listening.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.200
 I totally was listening.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.840
 But is there like a walkie-talkie equivalent in 2023

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.800
 where like me and you could just,

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.400
 I could just like press the button and walkie-talkie you?

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.760
 - Yeah, there's apps that do that.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.880
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.200
 - And if I did it, you would hear it.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.920
 Just like, it would come over your phone immediately.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.400
 - That does sound really fun.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.080
 (laughing)

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.480
 - Like something about that just sounds so fun.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.800
 - Yeah, no, I used to physically have walkie-talkies

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.640
 in my friends.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.400
 - I mean, we can't get some that are internet enabled,

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.320
 can we?

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.640
 Where I could just have a walkie-talkie here

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.920
 and you could have one in South Florida

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.240
 and we could just like beep.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.400
 - I mean, you're just reinventing a phone,

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.040
 but yeah, there are, there are.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.560
 (laughing)

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.520
 - But it's not, there's no permission needed.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.360
 I can just start talking in your presence

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.800
 and you can't do anything about it.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.120
 That's the difference with walkie-talkies.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.080
 - Yeah, no, I know, I have seen apps that do that.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.680
 Do you remember like the next, was it next tell?

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.560
 The little chirp?

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.800
 - Yeah, the chirp, uh-huh, yep.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.200
 - My dad and all his friends had that

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.000
 and that seemed a lot of fun.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.500
 - Oh, do you have an Apple watch?

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.560
 - No.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.400
 - Why?

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.240
 - I just got an iPhone, like glass, you know.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.840
 - And you don't have an Apple watch yet?

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.080
 You've had it for a month?

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.160
 - I have an iPhone, I don't have an Apple watch.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.560
 And I don't have an Apple watch.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.880
 - You don't have AirPods?

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.160
 Those come with the phone now, don't they?

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.480
 - The phone is even kind of the charger,

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.320
 like it's just an idea.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.920
 - Does it come with a charger?

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.360
 - Did I tell you my experience of buying an iPhone?

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.760
 Okay, let me tell you my experience.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.280
 10 years of avoiding Apple, everyone's like,

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.440
 oh, you gotta go to Apple, everything is a great experience.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.320
 Here's my experience of buying an iPhone.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.920
 I show up to the store, okay.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.840
 One of the best retail experiences,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.440
 supposedly the best retail experience ever.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.280
 - It's an Apple store?

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.120
 - An Apple store?

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:49.960
 - Okay, yeah.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.800
 - 'Cause you can't go to like an AT&T store,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.280
 probably, and that would be awful, but go ahead.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.880
 - No, no, no, I go to the Apple store.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.000
 I go, stand in front of the iPhone.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.840
 And I look around, and everyone,

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.160
 the staff is walking around, free form, you know?

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.600
 'Cause they're, they gotta do everything different.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.440
 - Yeah.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.960
 - Trying to get someone's attention, eventually they do.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.120
 They're like, oh, sorry, I can't help you.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.320
 And I'm like, okay.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.600
 And then they're like, you need to go to the front over there.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.720
 - What?

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.240
 - And put your name on a waiting list.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.800
 They go to the front, and I go up with my name

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.640
 on a waiting list.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.760
 - To get a phone?

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.600
 - Yeah.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.840
 - So when I wait, I had no questions.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.240
 I really wanted to buy, pay, and cash and leave, right?

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.080
 I needed nothing from them. - Yeah.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.240
 - I'm okay.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.600
 My name is waiting, let's wait 15 minutes.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.440
 Finally, Apple employee comes up, he goes,

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.160
 hey, I'm not the person that can help you,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.560
 but I'm the person that's gonna help you

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.280
 find the person that can help you.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.960
 So then I have to explain to her what I need,

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.360
 and she's of course asking me the script like,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.200
 do you need that?

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.520
 I mean, no, I just wanna buy the phone, I wanna leave.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.240
 So then she then finds me someone, and this person

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.840
 finally is helping me.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.640
 Again, takes way too long.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.680
 I eventually get the phone, walking out.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.920
 I somehow drop the bag with a phone in it,

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.640
 and it falls on my toe, I'm wearing sandals.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.000
 It falls on my toe in this weird way

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.840
 where the edge of the box gets the edge of like,

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.480
 right where my toenail meets like the rest of my toe.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.320
 - Yeah.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.000
 - And my foot just starts bleeding.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:13.840
 - Oh my God.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.920
 - Like crazy.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.760
 - What?

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.560
 - And then I drive home with like a kind of like a bleeding

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.400
 foot, and I get home, and I'm like,

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.320
 oh, I'm so glad I have an iPhone now.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.360
 - What a weird story, man.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.960
 What a strange shopping experience.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.600
 I've not done the Apple Store thing much,

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.400
 but that sounds, that can't be the normal experience.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.480
 That surely they are more prepared

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.000
 for person walks in to buy iPhone.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.280
 Like that just sounds so incompetent.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.560
 Apple seems competent.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.520
 - I mean, the thing is like, I get the vibe they want,

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.160
 which is like, oh, just like an open space

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.760
 where like everything's free flowing, which is a cool vibe.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.360
 But there's a reason stores have like,

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.760
 grab a thing, go to checkout, right?

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.560
 There's like, it's just whenever something

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.440
 doesn't follow a pattern, it just turns into chaos

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.000
 because no one knows what to do or to expect.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.040
 But yeah, fantastic experience iPhone.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:01.880
 - Apple, great.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.720
 Amazing.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.480
 I'm so glad I'm gonna see you go to some now.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.720
 - I just order stuff because I don't live

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.840
 where there's an Apple Store.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.320
 I'm just used to like, I can't go get nice things.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.680
 I just have to buy them on the internet

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.120
 and they come to me in a few days.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.480
 These are just on that.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.320
 Your toe would thank you.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.120
 - That's what I was gonna do, but I was like,

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.840
 you know what, let me go to the house.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.680
 Let me go do a thing.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.560
 Let me get my thing right away.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.960
 And it cost me my toe, and it amputated.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.760
 So now I have nothing to say.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.240
 - Okay, you need to get an Apple Watch

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.160
 is where this was said.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.600
 - Okay, wait, but I can't believe you can walk you

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.000
 talking to me on Apple Watch.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.640
 - There's a walkie-talkie app on the Apple Watch.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.680
 It's built into the Apple Watch.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.280
 So I think we could just have it native

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.640
 where I could like, chirp.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.980
 And you might have to accept it or something.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:42.820
 I'm not sure.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.920
 - So we like talking to our like, like,

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.280
 we're inspired or something, talking to our wrist.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.120
 - Sounds kind of awesome, doesn't it?

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.960
 Here's a question for you.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.160
 I was just thinking how that sounds so futuristic.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.660
 Why, this is something my wife and I talk about

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.260
 at a minimum once a month.

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.860
 Why has no one invented a shower like the Jetsons?

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.200
 I don't understand how all the advances in technology-

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.600
 - What is the shower of the Jetsons?

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.440
 I don't know what that is.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.540
 - Do you know what the Jetsons is?

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.040
 - I know what the Jetsons are.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.300
 - This is why, this is why it hasn't happened

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.480
 because the brightest minds in the world like Dax

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.440
 don't even know about the Jetsons anymore.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.480
 The Jetsons was like the futuristic TV show.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.580
 - I knew what it is, I remember the shower.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.520
 What was the shower?

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.580
 - It's like a car wash for people.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.920
 You walk through it, or maybe even just like,

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.960
 you stand in it and it just like scrubs you down.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.700
 You do nothing and then you're clean

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.860
 and you get out of the shower.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.460
 Blow dryers the whole thing.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.860
 Like, it should be an experience just like the car wash

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:34.700
 for people.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.700
 And I don't understand how technology is advanced

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.140
 in these insane ways.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.060
 And we haven't thought about the bathroom at all.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.740
 We haven't made showers better.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.580
 - Yeah, please.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.380
 - What's great about cars is they don't have crevices.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.220
 As long as I say.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.280
 - Oh, you think it couldn't, wait.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.080
 You just think it couldn't get you clean?

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.520
 You have to spread your legs maybe, and your arms.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.220
 You're just like, Vitruvian man.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.820
 - Yeah, so it would get your extremities, but you know.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.400
 - Okay, okay, well I don't know, bidets, I feel like-

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.500
 - That's true, a bidet, you're right, a bidet.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.060
 - So it's just like a full body bidet.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.360
 I need one.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.140
 I'm so tired of having to actively wash my body.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.660
 How have we not moved that

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.580
 and like abstracted that away from us?

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.280
 Is someone mowing the lawn inside your office?

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.120
 Or is it outside?

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:22.940
 - Wait, what is that?

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.740
 'Cause I don't even try to roll on.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.780
 (laughing)

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.980
 - It must be a leaf, it must be a leaf flower.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.720
 - Okay, this is so funny, it's so loud.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.560
 - Well, hang on, hang on.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.100
 Okay, so do you imagine it's on a conveyor belt?

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.220
 Are you like standing still on like rotating or something?

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.060
 Or like stuff is going around?

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:39.900
 - I'm good with either.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.140
 - I'm good, imagine it'd be more logistically feasible

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.460
 for it to be a stand still situation.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.780
 If it's like a conveyor belt,

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.820
 you got some runway there you need, you know?

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.500
 - I imagine that it's, this is all technically feasible.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.420
 It might just be that the economic way

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.260
 that a man is just not there 'cause-

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.420
 - Everyone would buy that shower.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.260
 I don't understand what this is.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.020
 - No, really, only you would buy that shower.

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.940
 I would not buy that shower.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.540
 If you had the option between shower that showers for you

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.700
 or you have to shower like a caveman,

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.620
 you're choosing, you're gonna spend less money,

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.300
 save money so that you can spend 30 minutes every day.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.900
 - It's not about the money.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.940
 It's just like, I don't, I don't know,

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.540
 like I don't mind showering, I enjoy showering.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:22.800
 It's like, I'm fine touching myself and rubbing myself.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.640
 Like that's okay.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.720
 - Okay, this is going places.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.580
 (laughing)

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.820
 - Adam's so intentional, he doesn't even wanna like

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.220
 touch his own skin.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.480
 (laughing)

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.180
 - Yeah, I'm okay with it.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.540
 It just seems like a lot of complexity room

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.060
 for error room for things to break for something.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:45.980
 - It would literally save me like 20, 25 minutes a day.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.980
 We do so many things to save off like five minutes.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.860
 I feel like, I don't know, there's an opportunity there.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.900
 I want robots and I want them to do everything.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:55.460
 - Do everybody wants this too, the shower?

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.820
 - Oh yeah, for sure.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.180
 I thought everyone did.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.700
 Apparently we're the weird couple

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.060
 that doesn't like showering ourselves.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.900
 Okay, I'll take that back to my wife.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.180
 We'll reflect on that.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.820
 - I'm trying to think exactly what a car wash does

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.700
 or has those giant like things that like go around like,

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.820
 I think it would just hurt.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.380
 I don't know, which is not a good experience.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.740
 - Yeah, it'd be made for humans.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.700
 You couldn't literally just like size down a car wash.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.180
 - Yeah, but then it'd have to be like,

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.580
 then it'd have to be like really precise.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.060
 And I think machines aren't good at being like,

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:24.900
 precise that way.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.180
 - That's the whole another conversation.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.780
 Yeah, why is the like fine motor skills such a hard thing?

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.340
 She was like, I don't know, babies learn it.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.620
 My three year old understands.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.700
 Like why can't machines and robots do that?

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.540
 I don't get it.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.820
 - Yeah, I know, it's probably, you know, people are,

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.300
 it's just 'cause they're on people smart,

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.940
 like you working on these problems.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.780
 It's probably.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.580
 - Exactly, I should work on robotics.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.420
 That's what I'm gonna do.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.340
 - In five years, who knows?

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.380
 That might be what you're working on.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.740
 - I think we will have robots.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.780
 I think in our lifetime,

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.180
 we're gonna have like walk around robots.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.740
 Go ahead, you're gonna say something totally unrelated.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.380
 - Liz's sister is getting into making jewelry

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.220
 and she's taking classes and stuff

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.420
 and she was telling me yesterday, like,

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.660
 oh, I think this is a good time to get into that stuff

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.900
 because since everything digital AI is gonna do,

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.940
 it's good to have a job like this.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.580
 And then she clarified, like, yeah, I'm glad I'm,

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.100
 I'm doing a hand job.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.340
 (laughing)

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:19.860
 - Is she a native English speaker?

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.180
 Was that, like, obvious to her?

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.940
 - Yeah, it was just a weird, just true born American.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.660
 But, you know, sometimes Americans no speak good.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.420
 - Sometimes you say things like that and you regret them.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.500
 (laughing)

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.140
 - So yeah, we're gonna, I think we need all of us

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.500
 might need to get into hand jobs.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.700
 - Okay, now you've taken it too far.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.540
 You just, you just got a little too far.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:44.340
 This podcast, I'm gonna have to put the explicit flag

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.260
 on our podcast hosting.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.500
 - Not really.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.620
 - So it will have made a comment.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.540
 Let's talk, we should talk, we have a podcast

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.020
 and we don't talk about it much.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.020
 Well, you all know that.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.540
 You're listening to it right now.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.420
 But it's been growing.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.500
 There's more of you, but listen to it every week.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.060
 Feels good, keep doing that.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.940
 Keep telling your friends about it or whatever,

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.100
 however that's happening.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.740
 - How do you think that's happening, Dax?

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.940
 - I think we went from never mentioning it ever

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.740
 to them now, sometimes mentioning it.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.100
 And that has just caused explosive growth.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.020
 (laughing)

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.340
 Growth hacking strategy.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:15.180
 We should write a book.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.860
 - There's people, if they don't know your thing exists,

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.220
 then they will never listen to it.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.020
 - Growth hacking your podcast, 2023.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:22.860
 - There you go.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:23.700
 - Top tips.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.500
 - And on that note, I think we went too long on this one.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.540
 We could have cut, maybe just Chris would cut out the middle.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.220
 Just the middle was probably like, man, we'll see.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.220
 - Okay.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.040
 (laughing)

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.220
 - So it doesn't make any hard choices

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.380
 about interesting things.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.220
 - All right.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.300
 Well, I'll see you.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.780
 - Well, you're starting to say something.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.900
 - No, is it?

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.820
 - Oh, okay.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:41.940
 Let's look back at your face.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.500
 You just had that face, like, one more interesting.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.340
 Okay.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.180
 - No, it's you.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.340
 So you always do the end.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.180
 - I always do that.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.340
 - Throw it in one more, one more thing.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.180
 - Oh, by the way, here's a big thinker for you.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.020
 - Yeah.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.260
 - Say goodbye.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.900
 All right, seriously, bye.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.260
 - Okay, see ya.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.840
 (upbeat music)

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.800
 (upbeat music)
