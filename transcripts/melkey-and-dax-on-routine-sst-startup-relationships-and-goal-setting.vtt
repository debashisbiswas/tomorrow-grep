00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Your emotions are just tied to whatever metrics that you are trying to pull like there's a chart and my like mental stages correlates a hundred percent exactly to you that it's like the doing crew.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 I'm not like just a chart of our like downloads like that's a thing that we.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Oh yeah.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Yeah.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 It's literally like a metric.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 No, no, no, no, like just literally that that's like a chart of my emotions like if you want to do it just go check your MPM downloads.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 How's it going?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 What's up?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 You went right into the recording.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 I was about to say how much I missed you.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 I was good to finally get to talk to you and you're like shut up shut the hell up.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Pause.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Let me give you everything.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 I'm going to record.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 So here's the thing we used to like do like an intro and then start recording but then some of the best stuff was always just in the warm up.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 So now I just record right away like I don't give a shit.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Nice.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 How are you doing?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Things have been.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Dude, things have been pretty rough.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 I'm not even going to lie.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Really?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Tell me more.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Yeah.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 I know I know it's good to you get people like this everything's so great.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 But man, like I've been I've been in it right now.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 It's definitely been difficult for me.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Yeah.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 What's going on?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 I've covered right now.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Really?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 That's been tough.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Yeah.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Bad cough.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 It's hard to like talk for a long time because I have to take a deep breath and my cardio is pretty good.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Look, I don't smoke.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Don't do anything bad.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Train a lot.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 So it's hard.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 It's like weird when I'm like out of breath.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 So.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Yeah.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 That's been pretty, you know, rough work has been like extremely like my work.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 My team is shifting to really make me like a senior senior and like the point of contact technically and that's just been a lot of response.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 A lot of responsibility, like a significant step.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 It's been like typically, you know, ideally want to be like gradual.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 I can't have here and there while you have like an like a real senior or like the former tech lead to kind of still look over stuff.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 But they've like really flipped the switch where it's like now no one's going to look over your stuff.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 You are responsible.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 And that's been a hard transition.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 And then obviously with like content and side projects, you know, when that's not in, you know, the best spot.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Obviously it's at you a little more so.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Damn, dude.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 That's a lot.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 I didn't even know people were still getting COVID.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Is that still a thing?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Dude, I never, I had COVID once and it lasted like three days.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 It wasn't bad.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Like I didn't think I had COVID, but I just came down with a cold.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 I took a COVID test because those were like, you know, you can get them easily and I got tapped in that pot for positive.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Okay.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Three days.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 I'm good.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 This time it's been lasted for over a week and it's been.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Yeah.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Terrible.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 It's been bad, man.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 I was bedridden once for a couple of hours.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Um, but yeah, like it's like some days I feel great.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Like this morning it's a little phenomenal.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Sometimes I cough and then sometimes during the evening, I just get hit with the wave of like achiness, weakness.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 I'm just like, I can't do anything.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 I hate that too.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Cause then it just, you're saying you train a lot.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Like it just messes up your routine too.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Then when you go back, you're like off and you got to like work back up again.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Yeah.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 And the other factors, even when I feel great, I don't want to put everyone else at risk of COVID.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Right.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 So I'm not going.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Like even though I think I can train right now, like at this moment, I'm not going to because I can still probably spread COVID.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 So I have to be locked down.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 And that's like no training, no weightlifting, no sauna.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 And like that is just killer.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Just so bad.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Yeah.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 And I realize like how brittle my life is because I'll think I'm in like a really good routine, like I wake up at a certain time.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 I have my responsibilities.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 I do them.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 I get a lot of work done.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 I go to the gym.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 I do it all.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 And then one little thing will change.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Like yeah, like I'll get sick.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Right now, like Liz has been gone.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 So she just went to visit her friend in DC.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 It's only been two days.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 And literally this morning, I fucking flooded my kitchen.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Like just everything is going wrong.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 There's one little change and I'm just like off my routine.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 I slept at like 3 a.m. yesterday.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 I slept four hours yesterday.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Yeah, like those little things just knock you entirely out of a good pattern.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Dude routine is so key.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Like so key, especially for like certain types of people.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 Like I feel like the primogen, he's very routine based, right?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Like extremely like his time is like allocated to like the smallest second, right?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 And I'm not to that extreme, but I need my routine.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Like I need to like, you know, wake up at this time, walk on you do and then, you know, do all my stuff.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 And like whatever throws me off that I'm just like not in it.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Like it like snowballs, you know, because then you don't do one thing in time.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 And then it bleeds over to the next item and you're like, this sucks.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Yeah, it's funny because when I was younger, I had no routine at all.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 And I was like, oh, I'm really productive.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Like look how much work I'm getting done, look at me hours and putting into it.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Something happened.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 I kind of switched to be like, okay, let me like actually like try to wake up consistently.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Let me go to bed consistently.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Like I've like slotted time for different things.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 And I was like, damn, holy shit.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Like I'm getting the same amount of work done in like half the time.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Because when you just have a consistent day every day, it just adds up every single time.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 So it's hard to know that because when you're not doing it, it feels like, yeah, this is fine.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 But when you're when you actually have that habit of having a routine, you realize the difference.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Yeah, definitely.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 So yeah, that's been like my update a little bit.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 You know, quick one.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 I've been asking you for a ton of CDK help on the side there behind the scenes.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Getting real, real deep in the city.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 It's easy to get more so than ever.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 But yeah, how's how's life with you, man?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Yeah, it's funny you were saying when people ask how are things everyone's always like,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 it's great.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 I always think about this with founders.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Like whenever you ask a founder, like, oh, how's it going with your company?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 They're like, it's going great, man.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Like we're signing deals, like, you know, whatever.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 And I know fucking it's not it's not going great.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 I know you might feel good one day and next day you feel like there needs a disaster.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 But every founder is like, we're doing really well.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 And then like a week later, their company shuts down.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Oh my God.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 But yeah, I've been in like a period of just intense work, I think, and it's been lasting

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 a while.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 And it's probably going to continue to last until the end of this year.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Like basically with SSD, we are we shifted into a phase of like, okay, let's get to a break

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 even point where we're making enough money to cover how much we're spending.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Okay.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 And that's like a key phase of the business.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.560
 Because you know, that's like the shift from being like, oh, yeah, we're just like a startup

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.040
 fucking around to see if we can do something to then knowing, oh, yeah, like we can work

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.440
 on this for the next 10 years if we want to.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.680
 So like, I'm like really eager to get to that milestone.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.560
 We have like, let's say like 12 to 12 months or so to figure it out.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.360
 And we'll see like that there's it's not clear.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.680
 Like I feel like 50 50 shot will do it or we won't.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.680
 There's like a million fall back things that we can we can go to, but yeah, right now it's

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.840
 like we're so focused on the metrics and the numbers and yeah, it's like, it's like very

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.840
 clear.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.040
 But that just for me, when I'm in this mode, I just like can't enjoy other things.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.240
 I'm like, this is just what my life is about right now.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.440
 I'm like not really going to, I'm going to kind of deprioritize some of the other stuff,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.200
 even like just the fun stuff because I feel like if I don't have certain things figured

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:29.000
 out, I just like can't enjoy like much else, but I also can't stay in this mode for for

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 that long.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 So we'll see.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.120
 Dude, I have two things I want to talk about and each of them can go into separate paths.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.760
 One of the topics is like startups and what you said, but how we make one, especially

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.080
 a company like SST, which I want to get into after.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.600
 My first like question or like thing I want to bring up is I saw a recent podcast, I was

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.720
 just scrolling through like social media, starting to know what podcast this is, right?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.320
 Just some people didn't know and this guy was like, you know, a person's always struggling

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.160
 between three things.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.320
 And one of them is supplying for your family in terms of like, you know, you're going to

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.240
 make sure that your family is taking care of, you're making enough money, they have a house

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.360
 or they're, you know, all that stuff, right, the essentials.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.000
 The second one is being the best version of yourself for your family.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.360
 So that's what like yourself improve where you go to the gym, your reading, your building,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.640
 all that stuff, right?

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.680
 And the third one that everyone's always torn between these three is actually spending quality

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.720
 time with your family that you're doing all these things for.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:30.840
 And it's so hard to find that balance and like, I don't know how that's even done at

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.840
 this point.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.440
 And like, I have a really small, like my direct family is obviously like my partner and my

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.440
 dog, right?

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.920
 But it's like, I'm trying to be the best for them.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.560
 I'm trying to give them like everything they want.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.840
 So like money is never an issue or whatever.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.880
 But then it's like to do the, to really like excel those two fields, you're going to have

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.040
 to take away from like spending quality time with them.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.040
 Yeah.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.400
 And at the end of the day, the thing that really matters, if we strip away everything

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.720
 and you're like, we're super old, 80 years old, right, we're going to be like wishing

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.760
 we spent more quality time with these, with these folks, right?

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.320
 So that's something that's so hard.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.560
 Like I'm so torn between those and trying to find the balance is like radical.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.560
 Yeah.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.560
 Yeah.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560
 It's really hard.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.200
 And I think, I think for me, it's a little bit different because there's a little bit

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.000
 more harmony between those three things for me, because me and my wife worked together

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.460
 on like our business together.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:25.200
 So we really enjoy doing that together when we're out, we can more taking walks.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.640
 That's kind of we can talk about that.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.160
 It counts as both quality time and work.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.480
 There's a little bit of harmony there, but yeah, I think overall, there's just for me,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:41.320
 the conflict is really like maximizing my income today, which would mean I would have

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.960
 like a really great like work life balance.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.960
 I wouldn't be working too much.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.280
 I'd be making a good amount of money.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.000
 We'd be able to like move our family forward with the things that we want to do.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.200
 I would kind of be like, that's like always there.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.000
 It's like a temptation, but there's like a ceiling to that.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.040
 Like I know in terms of what like me and Liz want for our future.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.520
 If I just did that and that's all I did today, like we don't really get the life that we want

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.520
 one day.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.200
 So there is this trade off of like, yeah, we need to kind of try to set ourselves up

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.920
 for the next 10, 20 years of real life, but it's painful now.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.120
 And then simultaneously, you can't just wait forever.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.120
 Like nothing's guaranteed.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.080
 So if we like, you know, we want to have kids soon, we can't just wait for like our businesses

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.520
 to be in order, which might take 10 years before we have kids.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.680
 So you just kind of like do everything at the same time.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.200
 It's not really ideal.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.200
 Yeah.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.480
 I mean, it's, it's a, it's really hard.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.480
 Yeah.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.480
 It is.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480
 It really is, man.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.680
 That's why like the older, I think the older I got on the more opinion to like the content

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.800
 space and like really looking up to people, like prime engine, I think is like one of

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.840
 the best examples and trash as well, actually, cause and teach too, like there's so many

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.840
 people I'm going to miss, right?

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.480
 So I don't want to like list every single person, but yeah, like these, these individuals

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:57.400
 have like, you know, families, they have full time jobs and, you know, especially prime,

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.440
 like his content output is at the same caliber, if not more than a person doing this full

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.440
 time.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.440
 Yeah.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.440
 He's streaming multiple times a day.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.440
 He's uploading multiple times to his second YouTube channel while working on like a more

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.720
 political and his main channel and doing extra stuff, which would be like front end masters

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.040
 and all that stuff.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:21.280
 And it's just mind blowing that he's able to fit everything in his day and balance it.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.720
 And it's like really admirable.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.720
 Yeah.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720
 And that's the thing I look up to prime the most.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.680
 Like people always say like when they come up to me and talk to prime, right?

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.160
 Cause I think prime is so massive that he can dedicate like one to one time, but a channel

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.520
 like me, you come in, you pop and you ask a question, I can actually dedicate more questions

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.520
 for you, right?

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.700
 And they're like, oh, like prime is such a good developer, such a good programmer.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.080
 And like to me, I don't think of prime is like this excellent programmer developer.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.080
 He's good.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.080
 He's really knowledgeable.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.240
 But to me, what makes prime stand out and what people should be asking is like, how is

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.680
 he so good at managing his time?

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.680
 Exactly.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.680
 That's key.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.680
 I think like for me, it's always been about building leverage.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:02.120
 So if I spend an hour today versus an hour I spent 10 years, 10 years ago, like what,

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.120
 what is the output?

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.120
 Yeah.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.360
 I just tried to choose things that would kind of build my leverage in that way.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.200
 And oftentimes it's not the thing that seems like it makes sense in the short term, right?

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.960
 In the short term, you like try to be like, okay, where can I make the most money or like,

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.760
 what's the best job that I can get?

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.880
 But oftentimes the things that build leverage are things that like don't seem to make sense

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.640
 in the moment, but they kind of compound over time.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.640
 Yeah.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.640
 Yeah.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.640
 Yeah.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:35.480
 And you don't want to have this like very linear career or life where you're just kind

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.160
 of linearly improving what you can do.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.960
 You want to, you know, like 10 years from now, you should be outputting like 100 X, like

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.000
 what, what you could do before, you know, exaggeration, but like it's kind of how I think

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 about it.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 Yeah.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Yeah.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Absolutely.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.280
 So then the second thing, the more like, I think less philosophical, more like actual

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.640
 business implemented question I had.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:01.680
 So obviously, you know, when bun came out, I was, that would, you know, huge, like ripple

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.920
 in the tech sphere.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.120
 Everyone was talking about bond.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.200
 I actually got approached by investors and like, Hey, can we like ask some question

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.200
 about bun?

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.560
 And I'm like, what the hell?

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.560
 Why?

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.000
 And it's because I made a tweet about bun that went like pseudo viral, like it had like 2000

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 likes.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Yeah.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 There's a picture of TJ.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.480
 And you know, these investors are like, yeah, we want to talk to you about bond and I'm like,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.480
 are you sure?

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.000
 I'm not the right person to be talking about bond.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 And they're like, yeah, yeah.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Like let's talk.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 Okay.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 So we hop on this call.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.280
 I thought the call was going to be like, Oh, look, what do you think of bond?

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.000
 You know, do you think it's a good tool, et cetera, et cetera?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.360
 Which the questions were that, but then the question spawn where it's like, how do you

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.440
 think bun can make money?

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.000
 I'm saying bun and I'm just like, what the, like, I can't answer this.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Are you kidding me?

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.040
 I have no idea how bun came make money.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.800
 I have no clue and they're like, do you think they should compete against Verssell?

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:59.400
 And I'm like, this is not, I'm not your guy, like I'm not the guy to be asking these questions

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.400
 at all.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.160
 But the reason why I bring this up is like an interesting point because, you know, investors

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.480
 and bun, the only reason why they want to invest majority of the time is because they

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.480
 want to make their money back, right?

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.680
 Any investment you want to, you want to see the money come back X fold, right?

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.120
 So like in a company like SSD or any open source company, like how, how do you make money?

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.720
 How does a company like SST where, you know, I could spin up SST and use it for free and

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.640
 you guys will never even know about it only to, only because of some metrics, maybe that

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.680
 will get download, but there's no subscription model.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.840
 There's no like, how do you guys make money with SST or any tool like that?

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840
 Yeah.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.600
 I mean, I love this topic because I just love thinking about like business models in general.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:47.600
 Every project is very different and it ranges from, you can follow a very established business

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:53.120
 model that has like a ton of history or other things need to like be really creative and

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.360
 be really inventive.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.680
 And there's like so much synergy with like the tech you're working on like needs to line

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.680
 up with that.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.840
 So for SST, I think we are, I would say in the simpler range of things.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.440
 So we have like the standard do as much for free as possible.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.200
 Then for the people that are in production, there's like add on services that aren't strictly

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.320
 necessary and there might even be other alternatives to that we charge for.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.320
 So right now, that's kind of saying like we're trying to think about like actually trying

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.000
 to make more money.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.680
 So lots of we've been working on the last couple of months has been in that category.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.560
 So yeah, you can use a super free, you can deploy your application for free, but once

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.080
 you deploy, there's like a lot of things that you need to do in production, an infinite

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.080
 number of things actually.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.600
 And you can actually think about every single dev tool in the space as an option of something

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.600
 we can build.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.160
 So one thing is like basic things like logs.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.200
 How do I go see what's happening issues?

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.560
 How do I get alerted when there's an exception?

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.800
 So typically people might do something like, okay, I'm going to go sign up for data dog,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.080
 set that up, send my logs in there.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:58.120
 I'm going to go sign up for sentry, stuff integration, get alerted in sentry.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.120
 And you can still do that.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120
 And that's, that's fine.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.360
 And you'll get like a very good experience because those companies are very focused on

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.360
 those things.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:08.000
 But for us, we basically took both of those things and said, whenever you deploy an app,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.120
 this is like already set up for you, like both of these things, you have a log experience,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.080
 you have an issues experience, there's a free tier, if you don't want it, fine, go use your

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.080
 own thing.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.440
 And for some people, they like the fact that, again, it's all integrated and like, you don't

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.440
 have to set anything up.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.000
 And every time we deploy all of your functions or monitor, there's like no accidental case

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.240
 of you for getting to do something or setting something up right.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.280
 Source maps, all that stuff is handled for you.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.800
 So that's our approach where we like, cause that's a reflector team, right?

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.960
 The three of us, we like building really good products, like really good web applications.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.160
 Like we're very motivated to build those experiences, but that's how we want to make money.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.520
 We want to make money because you pay us for a really good product.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:53.240
 We built that is complimentary to, uh, to the core thing.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.720
 And the reason that this works is because there's a lot of benefit in being the default.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.560
 If SST is big, our tooling is the default tooling to use with it.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.800
 There's going to be some percentage of people that don't use it.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.800
 That's fine.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.040
 But there's like a really nice, nice channel there.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.280
 And in general, when you're trying to build a business, especially a venture scale business,

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.760
 you want to find something that you can become the default for.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.000
 Most companies cannot pull this off, like even us, like it's very hard to become the

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 default for anything.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.480
 In our case, we're trying to like be the default for AWS on the SST side and then like then

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.440
 our tooling is like default for once you're in production.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.720
 So yeah, but like it varies business to business.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.720
 Like bun is very different.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.600
 I have a bunch of thoughts on bun too, but, uh, does that make sense?

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.600
 Yeah.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.600
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.520
 And so that was like that, that model, like if I break it down is like a very like generic

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.520
 model.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.520
 Like you get, enjoy everything for free.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.520
 Everything's great.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.520
 Everybody's got to be able to do it.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.520
 And then you, you're going to be able to do it.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.520
 And then you, you're going to be able to do it.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.520

 And then you're going to be able to do it.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.520
 And then you're going to be able to do it.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.520

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.520
 And then you're going to be able to do it.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.520
 And then you're going to be able to do it.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.520
 And then you're going to be able to do it.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.520
 And then you're going to be able to do it.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.520
 And then you're going to be able to do it.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.520
 And then you're going to be able to do it.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.520
 And then you're going to be able to do it.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.520
 And then you're going to be able to do it.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:28.520
 Our bet is that if you look at AWS and you're building something new, you're going to do it

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.520
 like the correct AWS specific way, that shrinks to like 5% of AWS.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.520
 Like you're not thinking about EC2s.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.520
 You're not thinking about like, like all these other services.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.520
 So if we just focus on that smaller zone, can we build?

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.520
 It can't be like a 20% better.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.520
 Like that zone of like serverless, what we focus on.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.520
 There is a big enough gap where people see the benefit of using something.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.520
 That's not the default with CDK is.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:56.520
 And to be honest, CDK itself is that like, is the default in some way of looking at it,

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.520
 but like things like terraform are so massively big.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.520
 So it's not like it's not a space that has been one.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.520
 Like if you're going to use AWS, you're going to do, you're going to do this way.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.520
 The thing we're really competing against is not really CDK.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.520
 It's more that we're going to be against Amplify.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:16.520
 Because Amplify is that it's like, okay, let's scope into like what 95% of companies need

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.520
 and build a nice framework and experience around that.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.520
 Amplify just like really bad.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.520
 It's just not a good tool.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.520
 So that has been like that angle has been a lot easier for us.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.520
 We do get that question.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.520
 We used to get it a lot more early, earlier on, like where people would say like, well,

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.520
 why would I use this instead of using CDK directly?

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:37.520
 Because early on, the differences weren't massive, but now there's just like huge gaps

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.520
 in the ability and entities.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.520
 So yeah, the gap is there.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.520
 It's possible.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.520
 I think SST, the way you guys built SST really exposed like the shortcomings of CDK

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.520
 that I think people were just like numb to.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.520
 They're like, oh, well, this is just CDK.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.520
 You know, that was kind of what people were saying.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.520
 But then like SST is like, ah, you know, you can do the exact same thing,

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.520
 but we can make your life a little bit easier.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.520
 And I think a lot of developers didn't know that path of least resistance

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.520
 until you guys built it.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520
 Yeah.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.520
 So I think that's a huge thing you guys got going for you.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.520
 Yeah.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.520
 And the other side of it is there's also something like really basic going on here,

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:16.520
 which is if you use CDK and you're using on a bigger code base with a bunch of people,

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:21.520
 you start to build your own abstractions for certain things for like the area of AWS

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.520
 you're focusing on.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.520
 Those abstractions end up being shitty because they're really narrow.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.520
 They're like, you're not really testing them against a lot of different situations.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:35.520
 So when stuff changes, like your abstractions are brittle, our main advantage is we're

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.520
 doing the same thing.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.520
 We're trying to build an abstraction over something infrastructure, but we get to test

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.520
 it against like thousands of companies that are using SST.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.520
 So we know when we pick a design, we make a design choice.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.520
 We know that it's going to work for most people.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.520
 So we just have a leg up on building the abstraction that you would have tried to build yourself.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.520
 Yeah.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.520
 This might be getting too much into the business SST.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.520
 So you can like just not answer this question.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.520
 We're pretty transparent with everything.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.520
 So, yeah.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.520
 Would another path of making that win being bought by AWS?

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.520
 Yeah.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.520
 So people ask us this all the time.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:13.520
 And it definitely is a possibility, but the reality is that, let's say they made us an

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.680
 offer today, we'd say no, because we'd have a better offer a year from now, make us offer

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.680
 a year from now.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.680
 Is that guaranteed?

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.280
 Like, so that, okay, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, but is that guaranteed?

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.720
 No, because you don't level confidence.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:31.280
 And we're like very, we're like, if we think about the vision of what we want to do, it's

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.120
 only three of us, we just need to fund ourselves for two to three years, and we can probably

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.840
 realize the vision of what we want.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.160
 It's like, well, where we are to where we want to be, that gap is massive.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.560
 So some of the approaches today, like we would say, no, because we see we want to wait till

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:50.640
 we've like, at least attempted it, the reason it doesn't really make sense is if you drop

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.520
 the three of us inside AWS, we would get nothing done.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.280
 We would maybe build a product even worse than a type of products AWS builds.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.840
 It's just a reality of being dropped into a certain environment, like the reason we can

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.400
 do certain things is because we operate in a very specific way.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:09.360
 We found, we found each other, we like, we click, if you introduce like even the smallest

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:14.320
 variables into that, like, it probably is not going to make sense.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:19.320
 But people do ask us all the time, like, what AWS acquire you guys?

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.800
 It would make sense from their point of view.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.600
 It just, I don't know, like, I don't know, I just don't see it making sense for us.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.480
 I remember you and I talked about this, about the whole chemistry dynamics in between you

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.480
 three.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.240
 I was like, I remember you and I were talking like, oh, like, if you ever need, like, you

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.040
 know, asking, would you guys ever expand your team or whatever?

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.440
 And it's like, you traded that very carefully because it's like, you really showcase, like,

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.200
 the sensitivity between the synergy between the three of you guys, right?

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.200
 It's like, and I agree, if you guys bring in a fourth person or another person or X amount

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.760
 of people, that could throw off the entire drive of what you guys have built so far.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.760
 I don't know.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.760
 I don't know.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.760
 I just want to handle that, like, plutonium.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.760
 Like, yeah, exactly.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.760
 You know.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.760
 Yeah.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.760
 Well, the three of us have been doing, it's funny because, like, the three of us have

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.320
 always, like, pretty much like been founders, like, been at early stage places, whatever.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.720
 And so we're doing this company with a bunch of experience.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:15.440
 But if you look at us on paper, we look way less of less, way less like a real company

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.840
 than anything else we've done before.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.480
 And I think it's like this paradox of, like, as you get more experience, you're just like,

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.920
 you just shed all this other stuff that, you know, doesn't matter, or, like, is actually

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.920
 negative.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:31.160
 So, like, previous companies I founded, like, we had way more people working there by now.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.840
 But yeah, it's exactly what you said.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:38.520
 Like, the lesson I learned was literally one person that's, like, slightly off permanent

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.520
 damage.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.080
 Even if you, like, remove them, it's, like, done.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.680
 Like, it's, you, you, like, can't undo, like, culture things like that.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.680
 Yeah.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.680
 Yeah.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.240
 And that's really the only thing we have going for us right now.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.920
 So, there was a tweet between us where I said, like, oh, before, like, before Twitch, I worked

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.480
 at a startup that got acquired.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.480
 Yeah.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.480
 And a lot of people, like, that's bullshit.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.240
 Like, that's, I don't believe you, which is, like, totally understandable.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:07.160
 But, like, that acquisition was, the companies that acquired the startup was, like, a fortune

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:12.000
 500, and they were super old, like, extremely old, and they moved so slow.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.040
 And the second that acquisition went through, I, like, the majority of people left, like,

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:21.280
 yeah, more than 80, like, a significant number, the CTO left, I left.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.000
 Everybody left because it's, like, we knew, without even experiencing the culture, that

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 that's not for us.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 Yeah.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.160
 And we would not, we would not enjoy ourselves working for this new environment.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.160
 Yeah.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.160
 Yeah.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.160
 I mean, it's exactly what, I mean, the acquisitions are really hard.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.760
 Like, especially when you're trying to merge two different companies together and have it

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.760
 continue operating.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.760
 Yeah.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.760
 Yeah.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.760
 Yeah.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.760
 It's like, you probably will lose the best people.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.000
 Like, that's why, like, I don't, I don't understand acquisitions as well.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 Yeah.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.640
 Like I just, because I haven't done them.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.920
 But most of the ones I see, I'm just like, I don't fully get this because this is just

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.840
 going to, the value here is going to evaporate over X amount of years.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.840
 Yeah.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.520
 Another interesting point is like, I was interviewed for a company, like a startup that just passed,

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.320
 like, like raising some capital.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.760
 And they wanted to hire me as their founding engineer.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.400
 So I went through the interview process, like two loops, I built them, like, a few systems,

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.400
 and they were like super impressed.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.920
 They were just like, wow.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.200
 And they gave me an offer.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.080
 And the offer was really good, especially for a startup, like, I was kind of floored

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.080
 by the offer.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.160
 I was like, this is like, and like, I'm talking base salary was like very high and everything

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.160
 looked good.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.360
 And like, I was actually like strongly considering because these people really wanted me like

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:31.480
 that, that sense of like knowing that they see your value and they appreciate it, not

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:37.880
 only in terms of financial, but like we, like we trust you to build this company is so awesome.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.920
 But, but I had to be very, very practical.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:49.780
 And I knew just from my experience talking to the founders that we would not jive.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:54.320
 And it was because of how close I'll be working with them and what I was understanding from

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:59.000
 them, the way I like really looked deeper into the way they operated.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Great people, but to work with at that tight coupling would have been very, very bad, especially

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 for me.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.520
 Like, for me, I'm like, obviously from a content creating, like, I'm fairly social, you know,

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.520
 all that.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.320
 But when it comes to like pro, like my programming life and content life is so drastic, but different,

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:20.720
 the only person truly knows, like my people with a program is like Theo, because he is

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.080
 seeing like, when I like really put on the headphones, like dive in, like, I'm like, I

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.520
 don't talk on Slack, I don't message, I'm not, when it comes to programming at work,

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.520
 I'm like a ghost.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.520
 Yeah.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.000
 Like, all I do is like grunt code work and like, that's all I do.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.600
 I don't join any of the happy hours, none of that.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.480
 But this company was a little bit opposite.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.680
 So I knew like, they really valued that, like, charisma factor that I guess I brought in

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.440
 terms of social like content, but in terms of programming, it was like, what I was being

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.560
 hired to do, it was not going to be right for me.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.520
 I wasn't going to excel at the field that I can kind of do behind the scenes.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.520
 Yeah.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.520
 I know that that's really wise.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.560
 I think I have definitely seen opportunities like that and have taken them, even though

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.720
 I knew that something was off, like, you know, and you're gut that we were going to click

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.720
 or not.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.720
 And when it's that early, I mean, to be honest, like, if you're joining a company that early,

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:12.420
 like, you should expect to become really good friends with the people that you're working

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.420
 with.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.240
 This is going to be a couple of people and you're spending hours and hours together every

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.240
 day.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.480
 And if you can't see that happening, like, I don't see myself really, really driving with

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.760
 these people, it just isn't going to work.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.560
 It's just going to be kind of awkward the whole time.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.840
 And eventually it's just going to, it's going to end.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.520
 It's going to be like, you know, full of friction.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.560
 So yeah, that, it's just like dating.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.160
 It's like the tech chemistry needs to be there.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.160
 Exactly.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.740
 And a bigger company like Twitch or Amazon or wherever, there's more, there's a bigger,

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:43.720
 like margin of error that you can take essentially like if let's say you don't really jive with

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.960
 like the senior engineer on your team of let's say like eight people, like, yeah, that's

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.520
 not great.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:54.600
 But idealistically, like you can manage because there's so many other teams.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.600
 There's the manager.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:01.080
 There's your teammates that like you can make it through a very healthy and good mental state

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.640
 career in position, even if you don't get along with one or two people on a team, but

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:10.160
 when it comes to startup where you guys will be paying each other on your phones, like calling

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:16.000
 each other, like talking 24 seven, like that is where you have to be very, very diligent

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.160
 and be like, are you sure this, the people are essentially going to like date, like like

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.360
 you said, you're going to be in a relationship with them.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.840
 And the relationship is like, you know, creating something's going to make money and deal with

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.280
 clients and she's going to break at 2 AM, you better wake up and deal with at 2 AM.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.280
 Yeah.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.280
 Yeah.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.280
 Yeah.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.280
 And like all kinds of emotional highs and lows and all that.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.280
 I can't do with that, man.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.280
 The emotional stuff.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.280
 I'm so bad.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:43.400
 My feedback every year, like I'm such an asshole when it comes to like, like in terms

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.160
 of juniors, like when they come on the team, like I'm, I'm like always a mentor because

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.440
 like I always have a good idea of like how to introduce people to our infrastructure and

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.440
 code and all that.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:56.760
 But when they come like, like, you know, like, oh, like, it's too tough or like, oh, man,

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.560
 like this is like, I don't know how I feel.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:04.320
 Like I turn off and I'm just like, yo, I don't care about that, right?

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.360
 And it's going to make me sound so bad.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.600
 But like I said, like there's such a clear, like if someone comes up to me, like Discord

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.680
 and they tell me about a bad day, I'll drop everything and I'll talk to them, you know,

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.680
 like I'm yours.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.920
 But when it comes to like programming, doing work and like, like coding, literally, I'm

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.440
 just such a different person.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.440
 Yeah.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.620
 In the exact same way, like it's, uh, I find it fun.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.620
 I don't know.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.680
 To me, like, I think it all comes from like, because I played a good amount of sports.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.680
 Uh, same.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.680
 Yeah.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.280
 So like, to me, it just is the same thing.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.280
 Like you're on a team.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.800
 You're trying to accomplish something like you got to push.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.800
 You got to try like the energy around sports is like, it's pretty like, it's like that.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.360
 It's like, just like, shut the fuck up.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.360
 Top completely.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.360
 It doesn't get this done.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.360
 Yeah.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.360
 So I bring that's like same kind of mentality to work.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.360
 It's not for everyone.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.120
 Like, again, like everyone doesn't, some people have like a negative reaction to that.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.560
 For me, I find it motivating and I find that it gets, I build like really strong relationships

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.840
 when everyone is like in, in that zone.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:00.840
 So yeah.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.840
 Yeah.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.840
 So it clicks for me.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.840
 Yeah.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.840
 100%.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.160
 So before when I wasn't a tech leader team, our attitude was a little bit like, you know,

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.400
 so so like, you know, we're very like friendly, all, all that now that I'm a tech lead, like

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.360
 I've like set very distinguishing lines where it's like, I don't want like junior L4s on,

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.360
 on our team right now.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.880
 Like the state of our team, as much should be a great spiritual L4 to join.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.840
 Like, I do not think that is the best interest of the squad.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.760
 And like, I had to kind of pitch that.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.760
 And it actually was approved.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:34.280
 They're like, yeah, you know what, like we'll, we'll agree, like we'll only hire L5s and

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.200
 the L5s will be higher are the same people like me.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:42.360
 Like, I don't know, like what they do on the weekend, but they have a brief conversations.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.080
 But you know, it's not like that.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.160
 It's like these people like I would trust with code anytime, you know, like it's that

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.160
 kind of relationship.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.600
 But when it comes to like, you know, what they do or like what the dogs are like doing

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.680
 at the dog park, like I couldn't, I don't care, you know, yeah, yeah, again, like at

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.960
 a big company like that, it's, it's pretty different because the fate of the company

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.520
 isn't rusting on you having a good relationship, like the perfect relationship with these people.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:10.680
 Whereas yeah, at a small company, it's like, if you are not like in love with your co-founders,

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.360
 like the company's not going to succeed, that's just kind of a reality of that.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.280
 So yeah, and that's why so many people say like they like make or break relationships.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:22.440
 Like it's a very common thing, like friends that go into founding companies together.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:29.080
 They end up not being friends anymore and the reverse also, but like yeah, it's a very

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.080
 intense relationship.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.680
 Yeah, two of my really good friends, they made a startup and they've been doing it for

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.680
 like three years.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.920
 But now like they come to real like they pour like over a hundred grand into it.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.120
 I thought it was a really clever idea, it's still a very clever idea, but it just doesn't

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.680
 like the, it's just too tough of an industry to break in.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.680
 And like they built it all right.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.480
 They've improved it and like now they're realizing and like these are two of my like homies,

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.880
 like home, like good friends, right?

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.880
 Yeah.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.480
 And they got into this and like there were so many times where their friendship was like

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.120
 dangling by thread because of like the stress of their startup and putting in all that money

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.120
 into it.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.120
 Yeah, yeah.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:10.320
 So what like we've been doing this for three years, we've, you know, moved on from a few

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.600
 different things.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.880
 And like the love for the product is not there yet, but the love they have for each other

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.880
 is still there yet.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.880
 Yeah.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.880
 So they're like, you know what?

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.880
 We're still going to be best friends.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.880
 They are still.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.880
 Thank God.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.720
 But the company, they're like ramping it down, like looking at either just completely like,

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.520
 you know, destroying it or trying to sell it for some sort of recuperation.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.520
 Yeah.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.520
 Yeah.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.520
 I mean, that's definitely there.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.520
 Like I have a business with my wife.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:38.480
 I'm not going to pretend like we don't start work fights that spill over into like marriage

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.560
 fights that it just like kind of gets everywhere.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.720
 I mean, to a lot of people that's like, that sounds like they're like, that is terrible.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720
 Like, why would you ever do that?

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.160
 Like I'm not going to pretend like it's great, but it's also fine.

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.480
 Like it's like, you know, it happens every once in a while, but it's not, it's not a big

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.480
 deal.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.360
 And it's only, I think long term, it's been strengthening for us.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.360
 But yeah, it's not, it's not always like that.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.360
 It's not for everyone.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.440
 Like for sure, like I, what you and Liz have is like very unique.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.000
 And I'm sure like a lot of couples would just like falter like right off the bat if they're

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 putting that same position.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 Yeah.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 We met through work.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.920
 So that like, it wasn't like, Oh, we're going to work together and we have no idea

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.920
 what to expect.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:23.080
 Like she knew how I get with work like I described earlier and I knew, I knew all of her things

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.080
 as well.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:27.720
 So it's not as long as they bother us less, but at least we, we knew going in.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.720
 Yeah.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.720
 That's good.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:34.960
 We went into a lot of husband, wife companies, like we see, there's a lot of companies that

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.320
 are founded by husband and wife teams.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.320
 Yeah.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.280
 So it's like actually not that uncommon.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:45.240
 And if you really think about it, if you zoom out, like historically, you know, a lot of

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.360
 people had their own businesses, like, like you run your farm or like you run your little

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.520
 like whatever, small business, your family operates, and those are all technically husband

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.600
 wife founding founded companies.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.960
 I love his parents have a construction business as a husband wife thing.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.480
 So it is hard, but also has like a lot of precedent.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.480
 Mm hmm.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.480
 Yeah.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.480
 It's weird, man.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.480
 It's weird.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.800
 I'm, I'm thinking of like what my next step is going to be in life.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.120
 And that's why I'm like, I started off wanting to ask you for like questions like your business

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.200
 models, like how you J Frank work, all those, like, cause I'm thinking like the next step

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:21.160
 for me is probably going to be the most significant one as much as I love the comfortability and

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.080
 like the paychecks I get from Amazon, which is nice.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:29.400
 I don't want to like, it's, it's very nice, right? Like if I would just want to rest invest,

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:35.200
 I wouldn't even think about my current thoughts, but like the, the, the unfortunate reality

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.560
 is like at these companies, you know, without lingering layoffs, let's say, like you get

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.560
 way too comfortable.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.560
 Yeah.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:46.120
 And that comfortability is like very poisonous for a person like me and I'm sure like a person

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:52.080
 like you, whoever it's like, I can't, like I'm not working at like my biggest capability.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.560
 And I think like that sports analogy you made is the reason for that.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.520
 Like you know, if you train in a room where you're the best guy, you can get comfortable

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.600
 smashing all these people and like, essentially maybe there's nothing wrong with that.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.280
 Maybe you just enjoy smashing all these people that are just lesser than you and whatever

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:15.440
 and what, like you move on, but like I always want to like improve and the same kind of

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.440
 thing is like, you know, I'm not the best engineer at my team, I'm not even close, but

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.980
 like I want to be pushed to a limit where I can get to that.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:29.600
 And due to the comfortability, I'm not being pushed to be the best and I'm not under that

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.600
 pressure.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.260
 Look, like I said earlier, I'm definitely under pressure, like being ramped up was a

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.240
 tech lead and like that's been stressful.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.280
 But like, I know if I tell my team, okay, like I'm too stressed, like I need like a mental

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.280
 day off the book.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.280
 Yeah, no problem.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.280
 Take it.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.280
 You know, we, we understand.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.280
 And I kind of don't want that.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.160
 You know, I almost, you know, I almost want more like, Hey, no, like you fucked up, you

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:53.240
 know, like you, you need to like, we don't care, stay up, stay up late, fix it.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.880
 I want that more of a pressure situation.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.880
 Yeah.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.720
 It's funny because when you're at least in a situation, I'm in you get that, but it's

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.320
 not from your coworkers, it's just from the market.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.240
 There's like no bigger bully than the market that doesn't give a shit about you at all.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.240
 Yeah.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.240
 Like you're trying.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.240
 They don't, it doesn't give a shit.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.240
 Like, what you're doing is not good.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.240
 Nobody cares.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.800
 So like, yeah, like it just, that's the thing that's beating you up every single day.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.920
 It's just the ignorant, just the world ignoring everything you're trying to do.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.400
 Dude, on content, so you and I talked about the DMS, when we first started talking and

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.320
 I told you like one of my goals was content creation.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.320
 Yeah.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:31.320
 And it's like, that, what you just said about how no one cares does not, like it, it means

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.000
 so it could not be more true.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 Yeah.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.080
 When you make a video that you pour like so many hours in, like this topic is great.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.080
 It's all this.

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.080
 I edited it.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.080
 Like the, everything's perfect.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.080
 Right.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.360
 But you put it out there and no one gives a shit.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.160
 I'm like, that's the reality of it, man.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.640
 Like no one gives a shit about you.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.360
 Content, market, whatever, like they don't care.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.240
 You have to just kind of put out a quality content all the time.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.960
 And like that eats at you sometimes, you know, because you can have like a really good week

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.760
 on content like two weeks ago, all my stuff was popping off.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:06.360
 I was like, yo, this is like, this is it, you know, the exponential growth, it's happening.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:11.440
 This week, like as fast as it went up, fast as fast as it went down, you know, and after

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.920
 like kind of swallow that realization again, it's like, okay, that was a blimp.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.920
 I'm back to reality.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:20.400
 Like where the reality is like, no one's gonna care that just made some random video

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.560
 on go if it's not like what they resonate with, right?

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.280
 I think I don't know how close that is to the market we talked about.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.320
 It's the exact same thing.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.440
 It's the exact same thing.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.080
 It's like the, you get it, like when you're, I mean, I think it's the same job.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.800
 Like when you found a company, you are nobody.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:40.920
 You're trying to find some value you can create in the world that no one has tapped yet.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.920
 And it's got to resonate with people.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.440
 So it's a, yeah, consecration is the exact same thing.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:52.800
 I think what sucks a little bit about content creation is for most people, it's a very solo

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.760
 solo effort.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:59.480
 When you found a company, especially with other co-founders, like having everyone, it's

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:03.960
 still stressful and hard, but like it feel like a team effort is very different.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.720
 It's like if you play a team sport versus like an individual sport, you know, it's, I think

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.120
 content creation is the exact same thing, it's just you're kind of on your own, in your

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.120
 own head.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.120
 That's the thing.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.120
 I've always played individual sports.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.120
 Like rugby.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.240
 I play like high level rugby, like amateur rugby back in Canada.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.440
 And that wasn't the only team sport before then.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:26.920
 Like I swam competitively solo tennis solo, like wrestling jiu jitsu solo, right?

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.400
 Like you only blame yourself.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.040
 And I think that's why like team sports, as much as I like team sports, for me, they're

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:37.080
 like very fun because I can, maybe it's like a conscious thing, but I can always, you know,

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.200
 conscious like, oh, if we did bad, like that's not me, because other people, like, you know,

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.560
 when it's team sports, when you get smashed in jits or wrestling, you, there's no one

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.560
 to blame.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.560
 Yeah.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.560
 There is nobody to blame.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.440
 You got smashed because you got smashed.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.400
 And I think like because of that way, because I grew up that way, like I'm just always a

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.480
 content like I have to do it by myself.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:02.200
 And like now, you know, this, I have an editor, he's great, you know, obviously I pay him,

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.600
 but he's, he feels like a little bit more like he's, he's more involved in my content,

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.600
 right?

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.560
 He's making, he's making sure that he gets a good wage hourly and everything, but he's

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:15.360
 also like looking after my content, which I think is super important, extremely important.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:19.400
 But yeah, like at the end of the day, dude, like it's, it's all me and it's like it, yeah,

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.400
 eats at you sometime.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.520
 When you're not doing good, eats at you.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.520
 That's the same thing.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.600
 Like when you're a founder, like your emotions are just tied to whatever metrics that you

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.840
 are trying, trying to pull like, there's a chart.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.160
 And my like mental stages correlates 100% exactly to that.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.600
 It's like the Dooning Kruger chart.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.600
 I don't know.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.360
 I meant like just a chart of our like downloads, like that's something that we focus on.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.360
 Yeah.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.360
 Literally met like a metric.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.360
 No, no, no, no.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.360
 Like just literally that that's like a chart of my emotions.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.600
 Like if you want to know how I'm doing, just go check her MPM downloads.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.160
 And the thing and the thing you bring up the thing that's why it's the thing I say all

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:56.680
 the time is the people that succeed doing this or the people that can just take that,

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:02.720
 just take that hit for a very long time because it compounds very, very, very slowly.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.280
 So the longer you can stay in it, like that's, that's just how you know, have success.

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.960
 Like I think it's been a bit tough, I think for some people, because in the last five

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:16.480
 years, there's just been so many crazy successful people really quickly, like seemingly successful

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.080
 people really quickly.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.160
 So I think people kind of expect like, oh, doing any kind of like independent thing, whether

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.240
 you're a creator or finding a company, you expect to be like those people that like start

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.480
 something and raise like a hundred million dollars eight months later, and then they get

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.000
 bought for like 500 million a year later, like those are stories that we see all the

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 time.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.160
 But that's, that was like a weird anomaly.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.800
 Like a lot of it just did not make sense.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:43.640
 Most of the people that have like built long lasting things have done it over 10 years.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.640
 Very slowly.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:49.000
 Dude, what you're saying now hits so hard because, so I'm going to bring it back to the

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.600
 content thing because like obviously, you know, like I'm super close like Theo and Brian,

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.840
 and like all the, like everyone, you know, we're all very close.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.680
 And like when Theo start making YouTube, like he popped almost instantly, right?

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.520
 He just popped off his content was good.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.920
 People loved him, you know, et cetera.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:11.320
 And it's so difficult because you see the success of prime and Theo, and like they put

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.240
 out a video and it's like their worst video is like your like best video in terms of

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.740
 matter wise, right?

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:20.160
 And you're just like, you're there seeing them like not complaining, but like, okay,

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.160
 how can I do better now?

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:25.280
 And you're like, man, if only I can even get to that level where you're like not happy

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.280
 about.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.200
 Like being so close to the successful people is good and bad.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.800
 It's only, it's mostly good because you can see what they're doing.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.480
 You can learn from them, you know, it's a good way to like always look up, but it's bad

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:42.960
 for your like mental state because then you're like, like, fuck, why, why, what am I doing

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.960
 wrong?

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:44.960
 Why can I not mimic that success?

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:50.440
 And it's been instances where like another content creator and they make really good videos,

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.880
 like, but they pop off like make like, you know, let's say 10 videos and they're already

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.300
 hitting metrics that you're not even close to hitting.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.680
 And you're already on like video 100, let's say, right?

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.680
 And you're just like that.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:06.760
 That always comparison is so toxic, but I feel like the hardest thing to not do.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:07.760
 Yeah.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:08.760
 Yeah.

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.760
 Yeah.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.760
 Exactly.

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:11.760
 It's, it's, it's really hard.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.040
 I think it's a little as a founder, like one of the key things is like stop watching your

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:22.120
 competitors, like stop, like just stop looking at them, stop doing all that because at least

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.680
 when you're building a business, if you start to pay down to your founder, you just sort

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.720
 of mimic them for no reason.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:31.760
 And especially, I mean, that might be different in the content space, but in when you're building

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:36.360
 a business, like that just guarantees that you're not going to succeed, but you have

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.240
 to come up with a unique angle of attack.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:42.040
 And it's even if you're just looking at other companies, like, I'm just going to like see

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.040
 what they're doing.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.720
 So like an idea of things that like poisons your head.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.720
 It kind of biases you.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:51.720
 So you have to like really be able to handle that stuff, stuff well, and it's super hard

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.600
 to think clearly of like what path makes sense for me because it probably is going to be

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.400
 extremely unique and very different.

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.000
 I think it has to be, but yeah, like different companies go at different speeds.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.600
 And the other thing, some of us stuff is like very invisible, right?

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:08.000
 So being Liz, we're talking about, because I interviewed the founder of linear a couple

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.120
 of months ago, and it was funny because I was asking him like kind of the early stages

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.120
 of the company.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.520
 And I was like, Oh, like, I was asking about like the standard challenges you have when

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.520
 you're a startup.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.280
 And he was just like, I don't know, we didn't really have that.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.920
 Like we built the product.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.920
 Everyone loved it.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.920
 We raised a ton of money.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.220
 And like now we're super successful and everyone loves us.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.680
 They just had this like beautiful shot to the top.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.520
 And Liz was listening and she was like, Oh, fuck him.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.480
 Like you're just like, yeah, that's us.

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:38.960
 But then the thing that's invisible is that was like the third or fourth company by the

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:45.220
 three founders were each individually extremely talented of like 20 plus year career history.

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:49.720
 And this is like what that's culminated in like that coming together.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.380
 So like there's a lot that can be very visible.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.560
 Like you talk about prime, right?

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.800
 You know, he's, he's like been doing this by this.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.320
 I mean, he's been like working on his career for a very long time that has built up a lot.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:10.160
 And that overnight success is a result of all that time that he put in before.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.160
 Yeah, 100%.

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:15.800
 Yeah, there's, yeah, the invisible one's actually a really good like reminder that like, you

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.840
 know, there isn't truly like a overnight success.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.360
 There is maybe like in terms of like the company, but like behind the scenes, occasionally.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:26.160
 And like truly some people just truly have an overnight success and that happens.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.160
 But that's like not in your control.

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.160
 Yeah.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.720
 Post Malone is the best example of literally overnight success.

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.360
 Like drop the song on SoundCloud, next thing he knows, like with Khalifa, everyone is just

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.600
 retweeting it and bang.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.600
 That's it.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.600
 Do you think that it was overnight?

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:44.040
 So I have, we have a friend that he worked for some like German music startup and there's

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:47.360
 a story where he was like, cause he would like see the users and whatever.

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:51.560
 And he was like sending his friends like a photo who's like, dude, look how crazy this

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.560
 guy looks.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.880
 And he was just saying people thought, like, what a weird dude.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.640
 And that ended up being post Malone before he was famous.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.000
 Just like, you know, like happened like a year later.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.400
 So I'm sure he was like grinding to, you know, like it says, work so hard.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.600
 He forgot how to vacation.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:09.600
 Yeah.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.360
 The story I had heard and the story that he comes tells him, I don't know if this is true

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.880
 or not, but like he was kind of, you know, not happy.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.840
 He was doing the same like school path.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.920
 One of his friends was making a big on streaming, streaming Minecraft.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:26.680
 They moved to L.A. and because he was just so like post was so unhappy doing, you know,

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.360
 the regular like finding job, et cetera, et cetera.

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.360
 He was always into music.

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.920
 He just tagged along with his friend in L.A.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.560
 He was like bumming, basically, like a couch bum.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:40.200
 And yeah, he just recorded a song which was white Iverson, because if you really look

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.960
 at post Malone's like SoundCloud, he had maybe like two or like less than five songs guaranteed

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.920
 before white Iverson, right?

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.920
 And those were not like at a high level studio.

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.920
 Yeah.

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:53.760
 They were at a studio, but it was more like, you know, like a basement level studio where

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.520
 there's some nice equipment here and there.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:00.000
 And he recorded white Iverson and literally post on SoundCloud with the art.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.920
 And I'm sure there's a lot of invisible lines, like a grinding and he made the art himself.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:12.200
 But like this, like, the ratio was like absurd because post on SoundCloud somehow gets to

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.800
 the hands of Wiz Khalifa, like you, in my opinion, you won.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.800
 Yeah.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.720
 If Wiz Khalifa's retweeting, tweeting and Mac Miller, all like you are getting hit up

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.520
 by people that want to do business with you after that.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.520
 Yeah.

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.520
 Yeah.

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.520
 No, of course.

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.520
 Yeah.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.520
 So there are cases like that where it's just like, you know, they just hit it.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.520
 Yeah.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.960
 But again, just like how do you, you can't like recreate that, right?

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.520
 There's like no way for you to do that.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:38.720
 All you can do is keep trying and hope that one of your things hits in that same way.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.720
 Yeah.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.960
 And it's like, when you see that story, it's just like, God damn it.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.920
 But it's the same as literally someone winning the lottery.

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.840
 Like that's no different than whoever won like $500 million last month.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:48.840
 Yeah.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.840
 Yeah.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.840
 That comparison, it's tough.

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.680
 It grinds at you, especially when things aren't going well.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.680
 Yeah.

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:55.680
 Exactly.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.880
 So it's always like the mental state of things in terms of like founding or conditioning,

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:02.040
 you have to always be like a step away from your emotions.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:07.320
 And you can, what I mean by that is you cannot, this is going to sound bad and I hope you

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.480
 can correct me, but you can't celebrate the wins in a sense.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.620
 Like you can't celebrate if you're going to post a video and it gets a hundred thousand

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:17.600
 views while your average is like a thousand, like you shouldn't celebrate that because

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:21.160
 then you set up yourself pretty much success because if your next video gets a thousand

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.840
 and you're like, oh my God, what just happened?

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.840
 Yeah.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.920
 And then you're panicking, you frantic and you're just forgetting that like that was the anomaly.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:32.160
 That one video hit the lottery in terms of like in relationship to other videos, but

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.040
 all the other videos are still like on that lower level.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.040
 Yeah.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.040
 Exactly.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:40.680
 That's funny because I've heard you guys talk about this stuff and like I've experienced

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.840
 it to a small degree and I'm like, yeah, that is a, that is a real thing.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:49.600
 Like you just obsess over the fact that your, your next one is going to be worse than your

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.600
 previous one.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.000
 Like that just, that just happens all the time.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.440
 I think that, that is a little bit unique with, with doing stuff in like a, some more

00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:00.720
 creative space, like every product I've ever built has been better than previous one because

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.760
 I've gotten better.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.960
 And so I don't have to worry about that.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.920
 Like there's other factors that determine whether it's going to be successful or not,

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:11.320
 but yeah, with content, it's like, it's so simple.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:15.080
 It's like there's like a number and this video was worse even though you thought you

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.800
 knew what you were doing and you thought you got better.

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.320
 This stuff, like the only advice I'll give to anyone who's listening, who can like, who

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.600
 relates to this and like I'm obviously still learning.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:25.080
 I don't have the answers to kind of like circle back, I guess is like, there's a content

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.560
 creator who I started to be of the year, like in January said, they will post a video every

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.280
 single week once a week.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.280
 That was their goal.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.280
 Right.

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.600
 And they did it very short for the first four weeks.

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:37.940
 They did like the first four weeks of January, there was a video every single week, every

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:38.940
 video flop.

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.400
 And then they stopped because it was too much.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.400
 And I don't blame them.

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.400
 I understand.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.720
 It's like, you know, you set this goal, you set yourself up to success, you do it four

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.640
 times and it's just like, what the hell?

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.520
 My biggest advice to anyone is if you are setting yourself a goal and I think a goal

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:56.320
 of releasing one video a week or setting yourself to that is a very, very good goal.

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.320
 Right.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.480
 And a lot of people may disagree, but I truly think if you stick with it and if you actually

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:06.880
 put the conscious effort to improve the video every week by one small factor, and it's what

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:11.720
 Mr. B said, like look at your previous video release on week zero on and in week one, find

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.240
 one thing to improve on.

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:16.680
 Maybe your audio or shit, maybe your lighting was shit, maybe your editing wasn't choppy.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.400
 Maybe your phone was hard to read.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:22.520
 Pick one of those things and improve in the next video and do that for a whole year.

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.840
 And that's what I actually did.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:28.320
 Like starting March when I started like youtubing, I was like, I'm going to do one video a week.

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:29.320
 Okay.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.320
 Yeah.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.040
 I haven't stopped doing that this whole year, but I was like, you know what?

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.040
 I'm going to like push it.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.880
 So I did two videos a week.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:41.840
 And like that, that like step is so hard, but even when shit's like low, even like my

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:47.280
 last like, you know, 10 videos have been flops, I'm just like, okay, making sure I end this

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.720
 year, uploading two videos a week and making sure I'm improving everybody, but one small

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:52.720
 factor.

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.440
 And, you know, at the end of the year, that's when I will take some time to really like

00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:02.840
 reflect on all the videos I posted on like, did I hit the goal that I not was I happy?

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:03.840
 Was I not?

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:07.560
 But that's the only time I actually give myself an opportunity to reevaluate that goal I suffered

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.560
 myself in the beginning.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.320
 But I want to make sure I don't quit that goal.

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.320
 Yeah.

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.240
 No, that makes that makes a lot of sense.

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:18.200
 I think the thing that brings me a good amount of comfort is the way I look at things is whether

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:21.760
 I'm not like in a binary sense successful or not is fully up to me.

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.880
 Like if you laid out that plan, it's up to me whether I fall through with that.

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:28.200
 It's up to me where I put in the energy to improve every single week.

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.680
 If I do that, I will be successful.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:36.520
 Whether I'm like Mr. B's level successful or like, you know, something lower, that's

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.520
 not really up to me.

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.840
 That's like, I think of that more like, that's like fate.

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:40.840
 That's like things in the world.

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.240
 Things kind of out of my out of my control.

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:47.880
 And I like looking at it that way because I think it's realistic in that like, I know

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.680
 there's some things out of my control, but it also doesn't give me any excuses.

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:54.800
 Like the binary factor, whether you get to a place where you're happy with your life and

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.960
 what you've done is in your control.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:01.360
 But like you don't have to like be looking at the biggest people thinking like, how do

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.000
 I get there?

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.320
 What should pay on people that quit?

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:09.000
 So like that person, like an example of a person sets a goal like one video a week and

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.200
 they quit like after a month.

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.120
 What's like your take on those individuals?

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:15.920
 Yeah, it's funny because like when you see someone set that goal and they do it, you've

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.840
 perceived them in one way and when you see them set it up and then they don't do it,

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.520
 you like see them in a completely different way.

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:27.120
 So when someone doesn't do it, I like to me, it feels like they weren't really thinking

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:31.160
 too hard about why they were doing things and they maybe just picked like something that

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:34.760
 they thought they were supposed to be doing and they like set it up and they got distracted.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:38.080
 That person that person succeeded did the exact same thing.

00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.440
 But it just seems to me, it just weirdly seems like the other person thought about it more

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.080
 and like like set that goal with a lot more, a lot more intention.

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:48.720
 I think I often see people like kind of flail when they like set these goals where they're

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.200
 like, they don't really know what they're doing, they don't really know why they want

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.680
 to do things, they're just like, okay, if I want to do something and that means I need

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.120
 a goal and they just kind of pick something random.

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.120
 Yeah.

00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:59.120
 What about you?

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.120
 I agree.

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.380
 I think goal setting is like super important.

00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:08.840
 Like goal setting isn't just something that you see some person you look up to and just

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.960
 like, okay, I'm going to do what they just said because how can like that's a recipe,

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:12.960
 like that's the secret, right?

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:18.680
 Like a goal is very personal and a goal is like very like, what is your current situation?

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:24.800
 And you have this that goals that set yourself up for success and not goals that will set

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:25.800
 you up for failure.

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.480
 And I think a lot of people don't actually realize that at all, like no one puts effort

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:33.360
 into the goals they set, like if we take it away from even content or found it like going

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.720
 to the gym, right?

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:38.720
 Like the goal is, let's say you're just overweight or whatever, you're like, you need to go into

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:39.720
 the gym, right?

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.720
 And you're like, okay, I'm going to go starting January.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.400
 I'm going to go three times a week.

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.400
 And that's it.

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:50.080
 And it's like, well, that's on paper a great goal, but did you actually see like, what are

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.080
 you going to do with the gym?

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.080
 Yeah.

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.080
 Did you actually set up a plan?

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.080
 Like, do you know what you're going to do?

00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:58.640
 Like you can't just go to the gym on day one and be like, uh, okay, now what?

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.720
 Like, there's going to be machines there that you've never seen before.

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.200
 There's going to be free weights everywhere.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.560
 There's going to be people doing actually that you've never seen before.

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:06.960
 Like you literally can't take it lately.

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.960
 Like for me, every time I go to a gym, I literally always go and I always take that free trial.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:16.320
 I go and before I can set the goal, I checked the whole, like I lay out the entire gym.

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.040
 I want to know everything about it.

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.080
 I want to know where all the equipment is.

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.840
 I want to know if there's like, you know, amenities, like a pool, a sauna, whatever,

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.560
 just so then I can set my goal.

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:26.880
 And then it's more realistic.

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:30.920
 Then it's like, okay, on like, you know, day one, two, it's going to be upper and lower

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:31.920
 body split.

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.880
 And then third day it should be like swimming, right?

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:34.880
 The cardio.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.080
 And then it's like more realistic and you're seeing yourself up for a bit more success as

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:43.680
 opposed to a person showing up to a random like LA fitness and it should be like, uh,

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:45.080
 I don't know what exercise to do.

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.080
 I've never been here.

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:50.640
 It's like, well, no shit, you know, like, how are you going to, what were you expecting?

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.640
 Yeah.

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:54.920
 The intentionality is big and this cost of like, you know, I heard like the phrase cargo

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:59.440
 culting where everyone just kind of copies something that looks like the thing that leads

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.440
 to success, but they don't really understand why it works.

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:07.280
 That phrase originates from something that seems really ridiculous, but it actually happens

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.280
 all the time.

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:13.600
 I think it was during some war, I forgot it was some war where, uh, the military was

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:18.840
 like doing air, uh, which was dropping supplies, um, on some like Island where there were,

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:22.960
 there were like remote tribes that were there that like didn't really contact like the rest

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.000
 of civilization.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.360
 They would see that the cargo drops would come in.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:33.240
 So they started doing these weird rituals where they would like kind of act like the

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:37.760
 people on the ground, uh, like calling in the airplane and doing like the airship type

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.760
 of things.

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:39.760
 They would, they would like do the same things.

00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:43.920
 And in their head, they were like, if I do this, that means a cargo drop will show up

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:44.920
 with a bunch of supplies.

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:46.880
 So it obviously makes no rational sense.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.360
 Like that's not why the plane is coming, but they just picked this random behavior and

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:52.120
 they're like, that's what it is.

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.960
 Um, and you see this all the time everywhere.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.400
 And I think, I mean, going back to linear people, like, cause they've been, uh, they've

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.840
 been just getting a lot of coverage just cause of their, their new fundraise.

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.480
 They talk a lot about like the way they do things.

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:09.080
 I really liked them because the way they do things is exactly the way that I want to

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.080
 do things.

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.560
 Like I really, like, we're, we're like, I have a lot of synergy with the way they want

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.880
 to build companies.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.080
 So everyone looks at that list of things they do.

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.560
 And they're like, okay, I used to check a box and do all of those things.

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.080
 And that means I'm going to be successful.

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:26.800
 But the thing they miss is those people didn't do those things and then they were successful.

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.680
 They found a way to be successful so that they could operate in the way that they want.

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.840
 Like this is, this is the way they wanted to build a company.

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:36.720
 So they found a way to do it so they could, it's like, it's like actually exactly in reverse.

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:37.720
 And you just see that everywhere.

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:40.880
 There's like a lot of box checking of other thingers saying like, okay, I need to go to

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.880
 gym three days a week.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:42.880
 I'm checking the box going to gym three days a week.

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:45.400
 Like, but no, they need to be way more intentional about that.

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.120
 Like, who are you, like what, what clicks for you?

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:50.320
 Like what type of workouts click for you?

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.680
 Like, what can you actually stick with for years?

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:53.680
 Nothing is easy.

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:54.680
 Like nothing is easy.

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:55.680
 Just like checking a box.

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.360
 And there's no like generic solutions that work like that for everyone.

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.480
 Um, yeah, you just see that all the time.

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.480
 Yeah.

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.480
 No free lunch.

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.040
 I don't know how much is related, but I saw this really cool analogy once where it's like

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.680
 the behavior society.

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.280
 And it made me think about the cargo and like the story just said, I don't know how much

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.760
 this relates to it, to be honest, but I just wanted to bring it out.

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:17.440
 It's like a scientist did an experiment where like they had monkeys in like a room or whatever.

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:22.400
 And there was a ladder and it's like a light bulb on top or like a button, a red buzzer.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.400
 And like, if the monkey were to climb up and touch the red buzzer, they'll get like a little

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:26.400
 electrical shock.

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.400
 Yeah.

00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.400
 Right.

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.400
 And so every time the monkey be like, ah, that's bad.

00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:31.800
 And so the monkey would realize every time he touched this, I'll get shocked.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:32.800
 Pain.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.800
 I don't like it.

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:34.800
 They won't do it.

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.800
 And so, and this experiment lasted so long.

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:39.080
 And there was a generation of these monkeys that lived in this like controlled environment.

00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.080
 Right.

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:43.880
 And so the next generation of monkeys, we born the ones after that we born.

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:48.560
 And even like the late generation of monkeys that were born knew not to touch the light bulb

00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:54.160
 because the, like their older generations never did so, but they themselves never actually

00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.160
 touched the light.

00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:56.440
 They didn't know the impact, right?

00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:00.400
 But because society constructed this like their society should say construct this environment

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:04.440
 where they knew, don't touch the light bulb, they were just like, okay, I just know not

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:05.440
 to do that, right?

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.680
 Was that actually experiencing the consequence?

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:13.820
 So I guess what, like it's like the behavior society to follow a pattern without necessarily

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:16.360
 understanding why that's happened.

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.360
 Yeah.

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.320
 You know, it's, it's like when you, that's exactly it.

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:20.400
 It's exactly the same thing.

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:25.960
 It's like, it's actually shocking how much stuff that people put time into that just has

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.640
 no value or like doesn't make it doesn't make sense at all.

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:34.060
 We, I've got, I went through this myself when, uh, because, you know, as I'm working at SST,

00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:37.000
 I'm like, okay, I like, I've been programming for years.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.240
 Like, I'm not, I'm not like super worried about that, but like marketing and like getting

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.240
 stuff out there.

00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:44.720
 Um, I gotta like learn that and I had to get better at that.

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.840
 And initially we were just doing what everybody else was doing.

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:52.520
 You know, when you release a feature, you like do some shitty screencasts if you'd using

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:56.560
 the feature and then you make like some shitty little blog posts that nobody sees.

00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:02.120
 And every single dev tool company does the exact same thing for every single time they

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.280
 do a release and nobody stops to think like, why are we doing this?

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.040
 Like, does this actually get us anything?

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.040
 No, it doesn't.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.600
 Like those things can only ever get like a hundred views, right?

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:13.600
 Exactly.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.800
 If you actually want to do marketing, you have to come up with something that can get, it's

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.880
 not guaranteed by at least as a potential of getting like, you know, tens of thousands

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.880
 of views.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.880
 Yep.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.880
 Yep.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.040
 And if you actually think about that, you would not be doing anything that any of these companies

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:30.640
 are doing, like I tweeted yesterday about case studies of being like, a lot of these

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.200
 early stage companies do these like big, long case studies.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.960
 And to me, when I see that, I'm just like, well, they did that because they have one

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:37.960
 customer.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.480
 They have the time to do this big case study.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.860
 Like nine people are going to read that.

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:47.320
 And that's like what they bucket under the marketing, like, okay, we did marketing check

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.320
 the box.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.680
 But yeah, you just see that everywhere and it's crazy how much just doesn't make any

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.680
 sense at all.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.720
 A company, and I know you're a fan of them, then I think beyond the actual experience

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:02.760
 and the tech they created that do marketing super, super well is drizzle because drizzle,

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:07.440
 the way they do their marketing is so counterintuitive and it works.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:12.080
 And you can't disagree that there's more like they almost like Andrew, like on his personal

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.560
 account would post memes, essentially bashing drizzle, making fun of drizzle.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.000
 And if you didn't know, Andrew's like one of the main people at drizzle, you'd be like,

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.880
 oh, like what that drizzle might suck then, but no, like, it's like this counter like

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:28.520
 curiosity thing that they did, and it's just working so well.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.800
 And even their main drizzle account on Twitter, it's like they post memes and they know that

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.280
 memes on tech Twitter are like the hot, like a hot thing.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.280
 Yeah.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.280
 And that's what gets people to click.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.400
 So it was super interesting to see how that team over there handled their marketing.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.840
 And that's not even talking about how great of a tool it is itself, right?

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.840
 That speaks for itself.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.360
 But no matter how good the tool is, if you don't have a good marketing, no one's going

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:49.360
 to use it, right?

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.360
 Yeah.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.360
 Yeah.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.360
 It's just, yeah, they're excellent.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.200
 I would probably put them as like number one of people that I think it's funny because

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:59.240
 they're so small and they don't, like you would never think of them this way.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:04.440
 But even companies that raise like $100 million, like do not get anywhere close to being as

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:08.840
 good as what these like, you know, three people are doing on the marketing on the marketing

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:09.840
 side.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.400
 So again, that's what's saying earlier.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.400
 It's leverage, right?

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.640
 They found a way to third three people, but they're like out marketing these giant companies.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.520
 They found a way to build this crazy lever.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.200
 They don't have those guardrails, right, they don't have that red, red button not to touch.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.200
 Yeah, exactly.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.200
 Exactly.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.400
 Like if you pitched any of what they did and had to go through like the meetings and all

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.480
 that, like it just would not, it just would not happen.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.480
 Exactly.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:34.760
 But yeah, like it's just, it's crazy to me that people just don't think, and it's not

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.760
 that crazy.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.200
 Because I remember myself, I used to like just not really thinking, I was like, oh yeah,

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.520
 I'm doing marketing, but not realizing I wasn't.

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.520
 Yeah.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:45.680
 It's like, it's once you're on the other side, you just feel like, wow, I'm, how could have

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.600
 been so naive and stupid.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600
 Yeah.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.600
 Yeah.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.960
 The other thing that I find interesting is before you're actually in, I mean, to use the quote,

01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:00.780
 before you're actually in the arena, you have all these like intellectual thoughts on like

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.880
 this idealized version of how things are.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.840
 You're like, well, if I'm going to make content and it's going to be so good, and it's going

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:12.680
 to be so like good content that like, I don't have to do all these other things, then you

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:16.400
 get thrown in the arena and guess what, nobody gives a shit that for like whatever like weird

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.400
 philosophy you have.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.760
 And you just get to the point where you're like, yeah, I'll fucking take my shirt off

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.960
 and dance like whatever the audience wants like that, like I just got to do this stuff

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.960
 that works.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.760
 Like when you're actually in that position, all of your like weird notions of how you think

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.320
 things are supposed to work just, just go out the door.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.320
 Yeah, exactly.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:38.520
 And I think like prime, he DM me saying like, yo, he, he's like recently getting into go

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:42.120
 like not in that recent, but like he's been getting into go heavily and he even sees like

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.960
 the benefits from the content wise, he's like, yeah, you know, when I posted video, like

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.880
 other languages, they don't do as well as like go content.

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.960
 And he's like, that's why he like doubled down on like triple down on go.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:56.040
 He's like, I can see that like, you know, he likes the language, whatever for a practical

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.240
 perspective, but also from the perspective of just like from content, which is one of

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.920
 his priorities, he sees it resonating with his audience.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.120
 Yeah, find a little opportunity.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:07.880
 You start to fall in love with whatever is working, like whatever there is an opportunity

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.880
 for.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.160
 I think so people like I think what's great about being a software engineer is you can

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:17.400
 work in like any industry, like you can be doing, I don't know, like you can be working

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.040
 in the finance industry for a while and like overnight switch like a completely different

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.040
 place.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.640
 And people have always asked like, oh, like, but like, don't you want to find a field you're

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.640
 really interested in?

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.760
 I'm like, well, my experience has been any place I've been in.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.400
 I've just gotten really interested in whatever they're doing because there was an opportunity

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.640
 there to do something.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.760
 So that's what's awesome about being a software engineer, you get to exposure to all these

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:42.080
 different places and you can literally be part of anything that's happening kind of very

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:45.400
 untrue for other fields where you have to like kind of really dedicate yourself to one to

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.400
 one dimension.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.400
 Yeah, exactly.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.400
 Exactly.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.400
 We're at an hour.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.400
 Yeah, anything else?

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.400
 I got nothing else.

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.400
 This is just like a loaded conversation.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.960
 Yeah, I'm glad you suggested this.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.960
 It's a heavy back on.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.960
 Which is these more often.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.960
 I love opportunities to speak.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.960
 Yeah.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.960
 To you.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.600
 I was going to talk about CDK, but I was like, no, this is way more interesting.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.600
 Yeah.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:06.440
 It's funny because we, uh, this is actually a great example of what we were just talking

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.440
 about.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.400
 So interesting when me and Adam started doing this, we were like, okay, this is like a tech

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.400
 podcast.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.400
 We need to talk about tech stuff.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.720
 Like we had these notions of like what this had to be.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:17.720
 And then we just kind of like ran out about tech stuff to talk about because like there's

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.720
 not like new interesting stuff happening every week.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.680
 There was for like a little while, but then there wasn't.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:26.120
 So we just started talking about other stuff and it started doing way better.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.600
 So, you know, there's this idea of what we had of what this thing was supposed to be.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.940
 Turns out like we were wrong, like when you're actually in there experimenting, you like

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:35.400
 you learned that something else actually is better.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.400
 Yeah.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.400
 Cool.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.400
 Thanks for having me on.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:38.400
 Yeah.
