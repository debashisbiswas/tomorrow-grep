WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 - It's good insight.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.100
 You're a smart guy, Dax.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.280
 - Stop talking.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.360
 - Stop talking.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.200
 - Stop it.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.780
 (upbeat music)

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:29.880
 - You know what I love doing?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.880
 - I'm sure everyone loves this,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.280
 but I love getting like the retail box of a thing.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.200
 - So then it feels like I have it at home, you know?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.760
 Like, I can just have one for a second.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.880
 - Yeah, yeah, like you're at the store.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.720
 - Uh-huh.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.600
 - Yeah, I do this a lot, yeah.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.440
 - That's the thing that Laura bars over there too.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.280
 - Yeah.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.480
 Oh, do you still do Laura bars?

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.320
 I haven't done it right now.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.160
 - I haven't for a while,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.300
 but then Liz randomly bought them again.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.300
 - They're so good.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.880
 - She's needed something in the morning.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.080
 - Yeah, despite them not sponsoring us, they're so good.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.000
 - I've been drinking this electrolyte water every time.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.840
 - Yeah, what's it called?

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.660
 - You get back from the gym.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.500
 - Element.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.340
 - Yeah.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.180
 - I drink element.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.120
 - Show me an element, we go way back.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.200
 - Nice.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.040
 - So, Liz had been getting them for a while

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.880
 and I would drink them

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.360
 and I realized I just liked the lime ones

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.960
 and I was like, man, there's no way

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.240
 they just sell a lime box,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.960
 but they do just sell a lime box.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.800
 - They do.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.640
 (laughing)

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.280
 - I buy boxes of the grapefruit

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.200
 at which I highly recommend the grapefruit flavor.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.040
 - Okay, I'll try that one.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.240
 - It's delicious.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.600
 - Yeah, they, I can't believe you drink element

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.800
 and you don't listen to podcasts

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.320
 'cause I feel like everyone who drinks element

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.520
 has just heard it on all the podcast ads

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.360
 'cause they advertise.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.360
 - It's like advertised?

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.200
 - Oh, yeah.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 - Well, people are hearing on this podcast.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.040
 - Well, that's true.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.080
 Yeah, but we're not getting paid for it,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.880
 which is the difference between our podcast

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.960
 and most podcasts.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.920
 (laughing)

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.320
 Now, like all the big podcasts,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.600
 they all advertise element, heavily.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.620
 - Oh, interesting.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.640
 Well, it's good.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.240
 What's crazy is I was drinking it for a while

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.360
 and I was like, oh, this is just like sugar water,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.280
 but then there's no sugar in it.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.680
 It's all, it's like fake sweetener.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.840
 - That's the salt water.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.600
 - And so it's like not like Gatorade.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.880
 - Yeah, okay, fake sweeteners.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.880
 Here's the topic.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.400
 I feel like science continues to advance.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.280
 There are so many different fake sweeteners.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.280
 They're all garbage, except for alulos.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.520
 Do you have an opinion on this?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.280
 - So I think it's less about the sweetener

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.440
 and more about how it's used

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.160
 because I've had things with like monk fruit

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.000
 that's tasted good.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.840
 - Okay, yeah.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.040
 - I've had things without the taste, that's tasted bad.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.840
 So what is this?

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.720
 So this is stevia and I usually hate stevia.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.560
 - Yeah, if they just like, so element drinks,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.840
 salty, delicious drink, doesn't need to be that sweet.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.360
 If it's something that needs to be sweet,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.200
 like it's a dessert or something,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.200
 then like, is xylitol or your rythritol, whatever, awful.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.360
 Like I just, you can tell it's just fake sweet.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.480
 It's like diet coke.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.160
 At least what diet coke used to be

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.360
 when I had it last time when I was a kid.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.840
 Yeah, the alulos stuff is the most recent,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.440
 I think most recent thing in this world

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.320
 because science probably figured it out.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.320
 It doesn't have any side effects that I know of.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.720
 Like it doesn't affect your digestion.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.560
 Like I think the sugar alcohols can mess with people.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.600
 Kind of messes with me.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.600
 Alulos has no nutritional profile.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.800
 Your body just ignores it.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.440
 It's just kind of cool, but it's quite sweet.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.480
 - Does it have like that fake sweetener aftertaste?

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.600
 - No, that's what I'm saying.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.840
 It's got the profile of like,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.800
 they even sell it in like a powder.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.440
 You like sprinkle on stuff like sugar

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.160
 and it just feels like you have sugar on it.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.200
 - They sell monk fruit sweetener in that same way.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.040
 I should.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.040
 - Yeah, monk fruit's another good one.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.680
 - I've probably had something with it in there.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.120
 - Okay, artificial sweetener tier list.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.120
 Let's go.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.040
 (laughs)

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.400
 I'm just kidding.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.960
 - I mean, it sounds like Alulos is the best

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.600
 and it sounds like monk fruit is a pretty good idea.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.320
 - Alulos and monk fruit are up there.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.520
 S tier, the rest of them F tier, dog water.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.080
 - Have you had those?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.240
 It's like, oh, I forgot the name of the brand,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.000
 but they basically copy normal candy,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.040
 but it's made with fake sweetener.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.760
 - It's like 10 times more.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.600
 Is that what that is?

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.800
 They have like the Swedish fish and the fake Swedish fish.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.520
 - Oh, no, that's a smart sweets.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.360
 Wow, I don't wait too much for that piece.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.200
 (both laughing)

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.960
 - Yeah, smart sweets.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.600
 Yeah, we get those for the kids.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.440
 I don't really, I'm not really into fruit gummies.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.840
 I'm not like playing a boy, like I don't eat them.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.360
 I just don't love, I thought I'm a chocolate guy.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.200
 Chocolate carl.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.800
 - Yeah, but I like to mix it up.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.760
 I don't discriminate.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.720
 - The joy rider is like the,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.520
 they have like, fake twizzlers and fake.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.360
 - Are they good?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.040
 - Oh my God, these are real sugar.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.600
 These are not like a fake sugar.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.440
 So I don't even know.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.080
 - Oh, so they're just bootleg?

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.200
 It's not like a hell of a thing?

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.240
 - No, they're marketed as like 80% less sugar.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.080
 - Okay.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.160
 - And I think they do supplement with some other sweetener,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.520
 but they do have real sugar in them.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.200
 Whereas smart sweets, I think don't have any.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.680
 - I mean, 80% less means I can eat 80% more.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.120
 - I know, that's what I'm saying.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.960
 What?

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.080
 So they make these bags of these like ropes.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.120
 They're like cherry ropes.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.560
 They make other flavors probably.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.840
 They are so good.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.160
 And the entire bag is like a hundred calories.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.560
 And you feel like you just ate an entire bag of like,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.400
 twizzlers.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.240
 I mean, it's like, they're very satisfying.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.280
 You should get some joy ride.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.120
 They're delicious.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.200
 - Joy ride candy.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.120
 I haven't heard of this one.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.400
 - While we're talking about candy that is like crazy

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.120
 nutritionally sparse is the word.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.080
 Like low calorie for what it is.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.400
 Like you can't believe when you're eating it,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.880
 that it's not that much energy in it.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.600
 There's these chocolate bars, Gatsby.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.440
 Look them up.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.280
 - Gatsby chocolate bars.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.120
 Okay, so I just.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 - Delicious.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.960
 - So I've been, it's gotten even too hot for me

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.800
 to run outside.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.600
 So I've been going to, I've been using the gas passes

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.680
 at Liz's gym, which is an equinox.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.200
 And they have like a selection of protein bars

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.440
 in the front.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.240
 And there's one that looks like,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.760
 it just looks so like circusy and like over the tie.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.480
 Kind of looks like something that Mr. Beast would sell.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.320
 - True bar?

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.160
 - So I got it.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.960
 - True bar?

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.520
 - No, it's not true bar.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.720
 Okay, I got it and it tastes so good.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.600
 It tastes just like a straight out candy bar.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.680
 It is the most hilarious texture I've ever,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.960
 like I've never eaten a food.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.400
 It's like so clear that this is not food.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.160
 Cause it's like, it's like rubbery and it stretches.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.440
 It feels like a melted eraser or something.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.640
 - When I looked at the ingredients and they're like,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.320
 it's not like it's like bad for you.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.320
 It's just, for whatever reason, it's just, it's like,

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.640
 there's no way food was supposed to be this consistency.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.040
 - They're learning stuff.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.160
 I like they're learning how,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.440
 so protein bars are a good example.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.680
 They're learning how to not have protein bars taste

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.600
 like cardboard and not just like have that terrible texture.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.920
 That's why I said science earlier.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.760
 Like I feel like there is like a food science thing

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.400
 going on, but they just keep finding ways

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.320
 to like make food tastier, but not quite as bad for you.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.360
 - Well, like we don't even know.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.160
 Our bodies have never had this stuff in our body.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.000
 You know what I mean?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.640
 Like humans haven't had to digest aluelos before.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.480
 What do we really know?

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.320
 - Yeah.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.640
 So this protein bar is called a, it's built,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.120
 the name of that is built.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.520
 And then I get this brownie batter one

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.560
 and I just ordered like my own box.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.400
 - Yeah.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.720
 - But yeah, the first ingredient is just collagen protein blend.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.680
 The weird thing in it is like the palm oil,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.520
 but like it's close to the bottom

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.400
 and like so many things of palm oil.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.600
 So collagen and then like I guess a gelatin

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.440
 is what gives it this like crazy like.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.720
 - Like a rubbery.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.240
 - Yeah, but it's like soft.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.800
 So I don't know, for me it's like, I know it's so unnatural,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.880
 but I just love it.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.640
 Like I love how weird it feels and it tastes delicious.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.480
 - Yeah.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.320
 - Yeah.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.320
 - I'm very distracted, Casey is vacuuming right above me.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.840
 Like the way it sounds, it doesn't sound like vacuuming

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.720
 and I barely hear it.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.560
 - You can hear it.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.400
 - I barely hear it.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.320
 - It sounds like low scraping in the background.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.640
 - Yeah, she's got like the little hand vac,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.160
 just like it's the quick vacuuming.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.200
 Do you have like four vacuums?

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.960
 We have like so many vacuums.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.320
 - We've, I mean, our house is smaller.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.440
 So we usually can't store too many of the same thing.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.280
 - Yeah.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.280
 - We've gone through so many vacuums over the years though,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.440
 but we're really happy with what we have now,

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.600
 which is a meal.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.720
 - I forgot how you pronounce it, M-I-E-L-E.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.560
 - It's like not.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.200
 - Vacuums, they make like kitchen appliances, I think.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.120
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.280
 It's not like, so we went through so many dice.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.600
 Dyson is a scam brand.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.280
 I'm like convinced.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.200
 - Did you hear that?

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.320
 - Yeah.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.320
 - I think that was a vacuum falling.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.320
 It was a dyson, so maybe I'll just get a meal.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.800
 Meal after a dyson breaks.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.280
 - We've been through so many dyson vacuums

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.240
 'cause they just constantly break.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.480
 They look cool and you're like, oh, it's cordless

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.360
 and like, you know, all this stuff, but I think they just suck.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.200
 I think we all just fall for the marketing

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.360
 and then we switch to this one and it has a bag,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.640
 which seems like, oh no, a bag, but like,

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.120
 we rarely ever have to change it.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.960
 And when we do, which is like, it's super easy

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.680
 and it's way better than whatever shit happens with a dyson.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.120
 - Yeah, I don't like the dyson.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.720
 I mean, it's just like a giant,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.480
 it just feels like it's gonna break every time I use it.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.760
 It's just this giant plastic thing.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.600
 - Yeah.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.560
 - And like the inner workings of it,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.040
 but it's just like our like, somebody spilled something

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.600
 right there and we've already done floors.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.200
 We have like a central vac that we did the whole house with.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.400
 - Do you like the central vac?

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.880
 I remember my parents had it in our house growing up

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.840
 and, okay, how does your central vac work?

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.880
 The one in my parents house was annoying

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.640
 'cause it just had the slots in the wall everywhere.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.840
 And then there was like this giant like cord.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.600
 - How does he have to carry around?

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.560
 - Yeah, they can plug in.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.600
 - Yeah, so that's not how ours works.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.440
 And this is the life hack.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.680
 If you ever build a house,

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.400
 this is how you do central vac, we've done it twice.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.360
 They have these high to hose that go in the walls.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.520
 They actually go in the floor joists.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.000
 So the hose is in the wall.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.040
 There's like four different points in our house

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.320
 that have a hose and you just like bring the attachment

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.440
 and connect the hose and the hose drags out of the wall.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.520
 It's amazing. - Oh, cool.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.360
 That was really nice.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.200
 Yeah.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.760
 'Cause only the central vac concept makes a lot of sense

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.080
 but this hose thing sucks.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.920
 The hoses are in the wall.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.840
 I know a lot about vacuums.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.520
 I'm just thinking about how much I've thought about this

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.720
 in my life and it's way too GD much.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.080
 Like Adam loves to suck.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.120
 - The two, just the two, I mean, the two times we've built

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.160
 like the central vac was like this big decision point

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.200
 and like all the different, I don't know.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.800
 But we also have the two robot vacuums

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.680
 that are like never used.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.960
 And I don't know why we have those.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.800
 We have central vac.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.960
 - We have a robot vacuum too.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.720
 It just lives under my shelf there and I never use it also.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.840
 We use use it a lot with pets

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.040
 'cause the pets are a huge thing.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.160
 But like in New York, it ran every morning

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.680
 and it was like a huge, it made a huge difference

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.920
 of how much just stuff was on the ground.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.800
 But now we just, we have someone come to our house

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.640
 and clean every week.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.920
 So it just hasn't been an issue.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.480
 - I feel like everybody gets a central vac

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.960
 or gets a robot vacuum with like the idea

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.440
 that I'll never have to vacuum again.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.960
 And then at some point you just never use it again.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.800
 I don't know what it is.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.680
 - Did you, did you try the ones that mop also?

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.080
 - No, we've seen, we've talked about this so many times

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.560
 and I've just known, we'll get one, it will disappoint

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.800
 and then it'll never be used again, like.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.800
 - There's that new one everyone's been talking about.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.120
 - I want it to cube with like the vacuum in the front.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.680
 Everyone's been like, "Oh, this is so good."

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.840
 A bunch of people would really have one, I remember.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.680
 - Okay.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.520
 - Does it, does it mop?

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.360
 - Does it mop?

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.160
 - I think, I think it also mops.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.160
 Everyone says, "It's great."

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.600
 - Mm, okay.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.680
 - The reason I saw it was, it's got this cool

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.340
 onboarding thing where when you open the box,

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.320
 it like knows your name already.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.400
 That somehow they like program your order name

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.040
 and it says like, it says hi

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.680
 and it like rolls out of the box on its own.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.960
 - Oh, wow, you just opened that little door

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.320
 and it just drives on out.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.160
 - That's like a really nice detail.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.720
 - Yeah, huh.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.920
 Well, if it's good at the mopping part,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.040
 I like, I love clean floors.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.520
 I love the feeling on my bare feet

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.960
 when you've just mopped, I kind of love it.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.920
 I use like too much spray, like I like to do it myself

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.640
 'cause I over spray, so it's still a little damp.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.160
 Just love that feeling, I don't think I'm weird.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.680
 (laughing)

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.920
 - That's so funny.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.720
 - There's stuff I want to talk about today

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.920
 and you're going to file it under like,

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.640
 it's our podcast, we can do whatever we want.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.680
 Like, I thought maybe I shouldn't talk about this

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.480
 'cause I don't know, I don't want to come off as like

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.120
 throwing people under the bus or like,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.720
 just shitting out other people.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.900
 - We're going to do it because I just have strong feelings.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.160
 Yeah, okay, you were going to bring it up

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.440
 'cause you just got on a Twitter fight.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.280
 Yeah, of course, of course this would have come up.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.400
 That's why I thought of it even.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.240
 Like, should we talk about that?

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.760
 Yeah, we should.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.600
 - You start.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.640
 - You go first.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.280
 - No, no, you were the one picking it up.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.200
 (laughing)

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.920
 - Okay, well here's what I'm going to say.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.120
 Normally, like on Twitter,

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.080
 I would just quote tweets on something like this

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.400
 and no, everyone can just like,

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.760
 not know who I'm talking about.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.840
 I feel a little better 'cause I got to say the thing

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.200
 that's annoying to me,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.720
 but I didn't have to really call anybody out

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.560
 and be like, everybody look at them.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.160
 And like, I do a lot of these tweets.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.440
 In fact, I think like the last few weeks

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.720
 this is all my Twitter has been where it's just like,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.800
 I'm really like upset about somebody

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.800
 and I don't want to be this way.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.560
 But I'm just annoyed by something

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.120
 and I'm just tweeting for my own sake

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.520
 to like get something out.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.360
 - Yeah, to convince.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.200
 - Yeah.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.400
 On the podcast, I feel like there's more context,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.600
 like I can say more words

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.920
 and you can see that I'm a human being

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.720
 and I'm not just an asshole saying mean things

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.960
 about other people.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.320
 So with all that said,

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.160
 we got to talk about AMP

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.200
 because they drive me crazy

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.360
 and we, I mean, we've definitely talked about it in private

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.960
 and now some of it is made it into public

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.320
 where there's tweets flying back and forth

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.320
 between you and the AMP co-founder or founder source graph.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.160
 Here's, I'm just going to say my piece

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.840
 and I don't know, I maybe already regret this.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.200
 Do you already regret this, Dex?

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.040
 - No, I don't.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:45.860
 - Okay, you don't.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.600
 Of course you don't, your dad's.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.560
 I'm from the Midwest, so I very regret it.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.040
 I'm sure they're all lovely people.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.600
 All 75 of them on Twitter 'cause I swear to God,

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.840
 I've never seen more people work at one company.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.640
 Is it just that I saw one of the tweets?

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.400
 - Every single day, I see a new,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.400
 I discover a new person that works there.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.720
 - It's insane.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.560
 - Yeah.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.880
 - So first observation, there are many of them

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.080
 and they're very vocal about their way

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.360
 and this is what bothers me.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.200
 If you're a co-founder in any like area,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.240
 not just AI tools, but in the AI tool space,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.760
 this is the one that stands out for me.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.520
 If you're building something or you work

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.760
 in an early stage startup and there's just a small team

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.560
 and you're very excited about what you're building,

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.840
 just like understand you could be wrong.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.520
 And I think that's the biggest thing for me,

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.920
 working on this AI stuff.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.360
 We don't have any idea what's going on.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.520
 Nobody has any idea.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.720
 In five years, it's all gonna look very different than this.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.000
 And some of that'll be because the technology advances

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.880
 or whatever, a lot of it'll just be because

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.040
 we didn't know what we were doing when we're building right now.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.440
 And the problem I have with the Hint people

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.000
 is that they're so certain that they will figure out

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.440
 the best way and just let them have their moment

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.280
 to figure it out and they'll come back to,

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.880
 they'll come down from the mountain

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.200
 and the stow upon developers,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.280
 God's gift to AI assistant programming.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.440
 That is the whole vibe and it permeates the entire company.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.400
 So I'm sure it's like a couple of personalities

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.720
 that really have that feeling that they can figure it out

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.680
 and then they'll let everyone know when they figure it out.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.440
 So they tweet in such a way that's like very authoritative

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.080
 and like, we know what's going on.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.560
 And then when you say something,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.720
 if you wanna get into the Twitter stuff,

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.960
 like they try to kind of backtrack,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.840
 but it's like everything they say is just in that light

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.360
 of we know best and it drives me crazy.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.360
 And now there's a lot more I could say,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.280
 but I don't know maybe that's enough.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.600
 - No, that is a good summary.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.480
 It is a, it's, I mean, the thing I would like to learn

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.480
 from them is how did they get such a consistent

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.160
 and tight culture across our company?

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.480
 'Cause all, every time I see, again, every day,

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.240
 I discover a new person that works there

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.520
 and they're always saying the exact same thing

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.240
 and they're talking to the exact same way.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.760
 - Which they got that like, it's not a culture,

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.040
 but it's very, it's very tight.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.200
 - It's consistent, yeah.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.240
 So I've seen a couple companies like that.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:09.240
 Dan Gilbert is like a Detroit,

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.840
 he's a billionaire that owns like sports teams and stuff.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.760
 He has the quick and loans and like a hundred other companies.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.320
 And I remember visiting the quick and loans campus

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.080
 and like getting a tour.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.320
 Every single one of those employees

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.040
 like could tell you their little isms

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.960
 or whatever they call them.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.280
 There's like this crazy, crazy synced culture

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.360
 where they all think exactly the same

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.760
 or they just like all understand Dan's philosophy on life

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.840
 and in business and they can recite it to you.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.400
 It reminds me of that, but way worse way.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.240
 - It's crazy.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.680
 So there's a thing I posted a few weeks ago

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.040
 and this is like something that me and Liz talked about

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.080
 and something that we realized.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.040
 So I posted something about there's this vibe

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.680
 that you can put out there where it's like really chill

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:57.160
 and confident that it's taken me a very long time

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.040
 to understand that's actually a sign of an amateur.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.560
 And the reason that I understood this

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.880
 is 'cause I finally put together that,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.880
 hey, I used to do this.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.640
 I remember like when me and Liz were working on something

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.840
 together like very early on

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.000
 and we would talk to customers,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.080
 we had this exact same like laid back,

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.000
 like, oh yeah, this space is crazy.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.640
 But like, you know, we're good at this stuff.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.440
 And like we're coming in and it's like easy for us

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.320
 and whatever.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.560
 And if I really think hard about that,

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.040
 I'm like, that was just us convincing ourselves

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.560
 that we were gonna succeed despite like having

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.120
 nothing to really show yet.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.520
 So now when I see that, I like recognize it.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.520
 I'm like, oh, this is a thing you do.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.640
 And of course, when you're in it,

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.000
 you don't feel like that's what you're doing.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.920
 You feel like you are confident and you are,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.480
 and you are, you know, whatever.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.320
 - Sure.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.280
 But now I don't operate that way at all.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.880
 I am just like, this space is crazy.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.840
 There's such a small window to get something in that works.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.200
 And like, I'm like, just like spastically like looking

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.480
 for it and chasing it.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.040
 And I know that it's gonna look different every single week

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.120
 and every single day.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.960
 - Yeah.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.240
 - So I can't, I just can't do this calm thing.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.600
 So but now on the other side of it,

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.240
 I'm like looking at the other companies in this space.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.200
 And I'm like, why are you so chill?

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.840
 Like, you should be going insane right now.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.480
 Like looking at like where you are,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.920
 the size of the opportunity,

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.680
 how much money is going into this space.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.040
 Like there is no room for like calm confidence.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.600
 Like it's just not a real thing.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.640
 And going back to the thing that you were saying,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.440
 it's a, yeah, I also find them annoying

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.400
 because it's not like they're just,

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.240
 I mean, it's annoying just to like that to be your culture.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.840
 But it's, they're also like telling other companies

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.680
 in the space stuff.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.680
 So there was interaction with someone that worked there

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.920
 replying to someone at Klein.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.920
 And he was like, yeah, I don't think you guys,

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.680
 you guys' thing will work.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.440
 Like I think you're, the way your positions

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.640
 is not gonna work.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.200
 Like here in, and like, he was basically telling them

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.200
 like it's, your stuff is not gonna work.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.560
 And what's funny is AMP is a VS code extension

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.080
 and Klein is a VS coding extension.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.040
 So I saw the interaction.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.120
 I'm like, oh, like let me go check

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.200
 to see what the downloads are.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.080
 Look at AMP, 32,000 downloads.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.360
 Okay, look at Klein, two million downloads.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.600
 I'm like, how can you go and tell these people anything at all?

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.560
 Like I get, they've been around longer or whatever,

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.640
 but like shut the fuck up.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.040
 Like your hair should be on fire.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.040
 Being like, how are they crushing us so bad?

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.880
 You know?

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.160
 Like to like then go and like try to tell them something.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160
 You're not really telling them anything.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.640
 You're just trying to tell yourself

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.960
 that your thing is gonna work.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.640
 - Yeah, so now that you've framed it that way,

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.880
 it all makes a lot more sense to me

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.600
 that it's more like convincing themselves.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.320
 It's like a, yeah, it's a false confidence

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.880
 that helps them get through the day, maybe.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.800
 I don't know, I've never been a confident person.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.640
 I've always been very anxious.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.640
 Like this has not been a problem of mine

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.160
 when I was less experienced where I was like calm.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.640
 Just never been calm in my life.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.840
 So I can't relate to any of that,

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.680
 but I'm just gonna assume that's what's going on.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.960
 - Yeah, it's just funny.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.200
 And I think it was just like a few people, whatever,

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.880
 but it's just, there's so many of them.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.920
 - There's so many of them.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.880
 - Yeah, so like you mentioned,

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.880
 I finally like couldn't hold it anymore

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.280
 and I like finally dunked on them a couple of days ago

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.600
 or was it yesterday when I remember when it was?

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.800
 And I thought it was so funny

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.200
 'cause their CEO replied,

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.600
 and then I replied with their download count

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.000
 and we were just like completely ratioing him.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.560
 And then I kept seeing employees from AMP retweeting

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.280
 their CEO's post.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.320
 And I'm like, this is so funny.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.280
 Maybe this is why you hire certain people

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.960
 so you can get like more retweets.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.920
 But then even that was done in a stupid way

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.160
 'cause they were retweeting a post

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.400
 where in the reply he was getting ratioed.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.720
 So they were just kind of amplifying the dunk.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.520
 So like this is just like,

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.240
 this stuff blows my mind

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.120
 because I've seen this happen a lot

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.800
 where there are people that are all roughly the same age.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.400
 We're all in the same generation, you know, give or take.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.480
 And in my head, I'm like everyone from our generation

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.800
 like understands the internet

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.920
 and like understands social media

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.360
 'cause we grew up with it.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.720
 But then I always see stuff like this

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.760
 and I'm just like, oh, I guess there's actually

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.320
 a subculture here where people just don't get it.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.160
 Yeah.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.120
 Do you remember all the drizzle and prism interactions?

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.720
 Like the Prisma COO would always just like,

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.640
 he's like a guy in his 50s or 60s.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.000
 He was maybe like five or 10 years older than me.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.920
 But like he just could not understand

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.600
 when drizzle was making a joke.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.160
 Yeah.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.400
 Yeah, it's not everybody.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.240
 I guess not everybody in the millennial generation just,

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.680
 I mean, I guess Gen Z people are laughing at us

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.200
 and saying we don't get the internet.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.320
 But I mean, like we get the internet

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.000
 from a millennial standpoint.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.400
 We get enough of it.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.800
 There's definitely a stark contrast.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.440
 We've interacted with a few different companies

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.720
 in this very specific space that clearly don't get

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.160
 and understand the internet or social media.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.800
 Maybe it's this space.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.920
 Maybe there's something about developers working in,

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.760
 I don't know.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.240
 But like, so you take, I've seen other things.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.280
 Like you see planet scale people, like,

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.160
 the planet scale CEO, like Sam is really funny on Twitter.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.920
 And like even when he gets into like little engagements

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.560
 like this, he's like funny in this way.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.120
 And then I see his competitors just like not be able

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.520
 to process that at all.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.600
 There is like, you know,

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.160
 (laughing)

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.240
 just don't know what to do with it.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.440
 I'm like, what, what were you guys doing?

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.400
 Like, did you just get the internet recently?

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.240
 I don't understand.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.320
 - Yeah, there's some trait.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.560
 And I'm trying to like, I don't have the brain

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.720
 to like figure this out.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.320
 But there is definitely some trait

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.120
 that just does not resonate online.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.280
 And lots of these people, they probably feel like

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.040
 they're resonating, but like, it's just, it's just,

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:58.880
 it's the ick.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.560
 I don't know, something about their social media presence

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.040
 is just like, it's off.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.440
 It's just like Uncanny Valley.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.720
 Like you're not actually a person.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.600
 I don't know what you are, but that sounds, I don't know.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.440
 I just feel like this is, it's our podcast.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.840
 So we can talk about where we want.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.480
 But it does feel weird to be on a podcast,

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.000
 like saying our side of things

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.560
 and talking about interactions

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.720
 when they can't defend themselves.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.440
 So I don't know, if you wanted to defend yourselves,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.280
 maybe take a story.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.800
 - They can do their own podcast, whatever.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.160
 - They do their own podcast.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.240
 Yeah, they can, they can say what they want about us.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.440
 And are we the asshole?

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.120
 I'm starting to wonder, like we're getting in a lot of fights

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.960
 with a lot of other AI assistant companies.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.280
 - Are we?

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.400
 - I mean, I feel like we've got a little history.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.920
 The beginning of "Opencoats" started with,

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.400
 that one doesn't count.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.960
 It doesn't count, okay, so we're not the asshole.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.800
 - Cool.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.640
 - It's fine.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.880
 I mean, Liz did point this out to me.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.400
 She was like, oh, you and your friends

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.520
 are like very good at internet stuff.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.240
 And she was explaining to me, like, yeah,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.360
 most people aren't that way.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.960
 'Cause in my head, I'm like, oh, we all were like

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.600
 on AIM and instant messaging.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.040
 And like everything kind of flows from that origin.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.000
 But I guess for a lot of people,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.640
 that's kind of where it started and stopped

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.240
 and they kind of grew out of it.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.640
 And we just never grew out of it.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.240
 Yeah, that's an interesting way to put it.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.000
 Like they took a break and came back to the internet.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.160
 That's kind of what it feels like.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.600
 It feels like people who came back

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.360
 'cause they had a reason they need to be on the internet

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.720
 to like promote their thing.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.000
 It's like every time I've ever gone to Reddit,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.120
 I'm not a Reddit user.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.240
 I only go when I want to like post something I did.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.800
 Like, look, I did a cool thing.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.200
 So like to them, they're like, who is this asshole?

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.440
 That's how we feel about these people.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.440
 - Right, right, right, right.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.080
 They just don't get like the vibe here.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.720
 Like, this is a Wendy's, sir.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.280
 It's something like that.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.840
 - Yeah, the other thing that's funny is a...

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.080
 So I was thinking about this so much

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.400
 and I'm like, I think I'm gonna take a hard position on this.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:52.400
 When someone is in my face aggressive mean rude to me,

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.640
 that obviously pulls out a reaction.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.040
 When someone is fake polite to me,

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.280
 I think that deserves a 10X reaction.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.440
 'Cause I think that's just like way worse.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.320
 And to me, it's like, it radiates in neon.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.800
 It's obvious that this is like technically polite,

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.800
 but passive aggressive and the words were chosen carefully,

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.520
 chosen carefully, and there's like a political correctness to it.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.120
 - Yeah, for me, that just radiates.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.360
 I can see that and I'm just like, fuck this.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.280
 - Yeah.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.400
 - For other people, they don't register it.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.920
 They're like, oh, this is like...

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.360
 - This is how we speak on LinkedIn.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.200
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.120
 - This is what we do.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.960
 We say, I'd like to be your competitor.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.280
 This is fun.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.000
 - Someone replied to my reply being like,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 oh, he tried to be polite.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.120
 I'm like, you dumbass.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.360
 This is not politeness.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.400
 This is that stupid Silicon Valley saying...

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.240
 - Yeah.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.440
 - Writing a fucking three paragraph thing

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.600
 and the thing they actually wanna say is hidden in there.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.440
 - Yeah.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.680
 - To me, I'm just like, this has gotta end.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.640
 We can't, just 'cause it's technically polite

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.480
 and you look like a dick replying to it in a non polite way,

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.200
 that's the problem.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.880
 So then someone can always employ that

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.960
 and you're kind of paralyzed

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.080
 'cause you don't want other people to think you're being rude.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.720
 But that thing is rude in the first place, right?

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.560
 - Right, yeah.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.880
 - It's better to change you on a scene.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.000
 - Yeah, be rude in the first place or just say nothing.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:19.840
 That's another option too.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.160
 - Yeah, it's just, I feel like it,

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.000
 this is the first time I've worked in AI.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.840
 I feel like this space is even extra like

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.200
 snake oil, sleazy, weird marketing BS.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.840
 - Fake and a legible, I think is probably another.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.200
 - Fake and a legible, yeah.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.040
 - That's what they're saying.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:35.960
 - We're so smart 'cause we, you know,

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.500
 had a call on LLM API, like, shut up.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.720
 - Yeah, just stop.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.440
 - It's a, yeah, the other thing is a,

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.960
 I'm like trying to, 'cause I can,

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.360
 there's some hints here that feel familiar

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.520
 because the previous wave I was a part of

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.520
 was like all this like front-endy tech framework stuff.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.680
 - And I will say it's similar in that there was a lot of like,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.880
 we know the best way you should do it our way.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.380
 But I think the difference was,

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.960
 when they say we know the best way,

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.680
 there was a literal way you could look at and understand

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.460
 and criticize and point two,

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.360
 which made it a lot more tolerable

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.320
 'cause you can like argue against it.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.400
 In this space, it just feels like we know the best way.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.200
 And it's a secret, but trust me, it works really well.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.400
 But it's a secret, we can't show you what it is,

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.040
 but it works really well.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.800
 So there's like, it's very similar,

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.960
 but there's nothing to actually look at.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.600
 - Yeah, there's no way to measure either.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.240
 - Yeah, so what a measure.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.280
 It's very confusing.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.640
 - If someone did have the best way,

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.360
 let's say someone actually does right now,

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.560
 have the best way.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.840
 There's no way of proving that or knowing that.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.640
 Like there's no, right?

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.000
 There's no like benchmark right now that's like,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.200
 it's all vibes.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.800
 It's like, I like Cloud Code 'cause Cloud Code Pretty

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.640
 and it feels good.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.840
 That's what people, they just use Cloud Code for that reason.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.840
 It's not like anyone can measure the difference.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.040
 - Yeah, and there are benchmarks and stuff, but like,

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.560
 yeah, this is such a complex space.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.200
 You change one variable and it cascades

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.040
 in such a crazy way.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.800
 Like, for all you know, all we know,

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.680
 like using short function names across your code base

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.160
 might totally change the behavior of the whole thing.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.720
 Like any like little variable like that,

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.520
 what language you're using, like the patterns

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.760
 that you write with, like the maturity of your code base.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.480
 It's just, it's so hard to take anyone saying,

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.920
 oh, I had a good experience with this tool

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.600
 and it's better than that tool.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.360
 Like you can find someone's in the exact opposite.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.260
 - Almost. - Yep.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.320
 - Almost always.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.720
 So yeah, it's like a dumb space.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.600
 And the other thing that's funny is initially,

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.920
 you know, when I was new to it, I was like,

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.080
 okay, everyone's saying, oh, our team spent a week

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.680
 without sleeping to do all these optimization

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.960
 for this new model.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.800
 So I'm like, oh, wow, that's crazy.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.480
 Let me go look into, I want our stuff to be optimized too.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.840
 Like, let me go look into it.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.160
 What can I do?

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.280
 Oh, I can change two variables.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.200
 Oh, I can fuck with this as some prompt

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.720
 and it like kind of works.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.760
 - Kind of works. - Oh, like, you know,

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.960
 like I guess the edit tool sometimes doesn't work.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.880
 So ignore white space.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.600
 - Yeah. - That took a week (laughs)

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.560
 of me casually poking into it.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.120
 And that's it.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.240
 Like, am I missing something?

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.480
 What am I, what are these optimizations that I'm missing?

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.720
 And then even before I implemented that,

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.280
 people were already using our stuff being like,

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.560
 wow, this is so much better than Clothco.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.360
 (both laugh)

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.360
 - 'Cause it's all vibes.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.360
 And if somebody has a good experience with your thing,

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.280
 then they're sold and they're convinced

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.520
 that every other tool is garbage.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.720
 - Yeah, but which I'm fine with.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.960
 - Yeah, there's a lot of, it's easy to create good vibes,

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.920
 make a product feel good.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.920
 - Yeah, that's what we're trying to do

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.200
 is just make a good product, which is fun.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.040
 Okay, I'm done.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.640
 Now, there's one other thing I wanted to say

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.680
 on the AMP thing that reminded me of just the way

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.240
 they approach it, but I think I've said enough.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.160
 It's fine.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.480
 If you guys, if the AMP people want to like,

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.880
 I don't know, respond to this, I don't know.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.480
 Do we need to like, I don't need to give them an invitation.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.880
 Okay, that's fine.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.080
 - If your response is, I'm gonna be inclined to respond to this

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.120
 and we've already been over how I'm better at internet.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.400
 So it's probably, it does feel weird to call people out

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.240
 on a podcast.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.720
 I don't know, something about it just kind of feels weird.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.280
 - Yeah, I've probably done it like a hundred times.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.120
 And I should just, you know.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.760
 - And we've suffered consequences for it.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.600
 - Have we?

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.680
 - Well, I've suffered consequences for it.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.820
 - I've already got a partially worded email.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.680
 - Oh, no.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.520
 Do you check email?

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.640
 I don't check my email anymore.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.320
 I just realized at some point in the last few weeks,

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.880
 I stopped checking email, maybe in the last few months.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.840
 Like I just don't even look at it anymore.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.280
 And that's bit me a couple of times.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.200
 - I have like, I'm like increasing my email checkage

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.080
 of anything 'cause.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:41.920
 - Oh really?

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.600
 - Just 'cause there's more stuff coming in at us.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.800
 So like, just generally.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.260
 So sometimes I find some good stuff in there.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.720
 - I don't get email 'cause I'm an individual contributor.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.200
 - That's the problem.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.520
 (laughing)

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.720
 - There's nothing that anybody would email me for.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.720
 (laughing)

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.960
 Someone sent me an email, please.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.560
 I'd like to get something.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.520
 I don't know in my inbox that was worth reading.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.280
 - I don't know why, but it reminded me of Frank

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.200
 for some reason.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:11.320
 So what's funny about Frank is you give him a clear task.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.560
 He will just do it.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.560
 No questions to ask.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.760
 He will just do it into completion.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.920
 And we're like, hey, Frank, you should like get a picture

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.880
 with all the AI companies in China and every single thing.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.200
 And like, in fact, that was me.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.760
 I'm like, yeah, like maybe I'll do that, you know,

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.720
 if I remember.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.000
 But every single day, like boom, new picture,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.720
 new picture of Frank next to a logo.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.600
 And like we're up to three now.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.160
 - That's awesome.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.000
 Oh man.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.840
 - Yeah.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.360
 - Are you still, okay, it's getting into the Chinese AI models.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.360
 Are you still using Quintry?

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.880
 Is that your daily driver?

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.320
 - I switched back to Sonic 4,

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.120
 but I'm thinking about switching to the GLM stuff.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.080
 And then GLM putting out some new releases this week.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.800
 And I was looking at our numbers

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.680
 and like GLMs are most popular model now.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.000
 Like last week.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.040
 - On open router anyway.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.640
 - So yeah, so it seems like people are into it.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.760
 Yeah, I think the only issue with it is it's,

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.320
 they only serve a 128K context window right now

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.320
 for me, not a problem.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.840
 But I think generally people will find that tight.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.680
 - Yeah.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.440
 - Yeah, and I think I'm waiting for like,

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.280
 yeah, once we do our like US deployment of it,

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.720
 it'll be a lot more accessible, I think.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.200
 'Cause right now it's a hosted in Singapore.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.080
 - We haven't talked about GVD-5,

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.520
 have we on the podcast?

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.640
 - I don't think so.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.520
 - First of all, where did the prompts land?

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.840
 Where was beast mode prompt?

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.800
 It was nevermind, use the codecs prompt back and forth.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.200
 What is the prompt prompt?

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.560
 - Yeah, so I tried so many different ones.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.680
 I tried them basically.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.280
 We would swap out default in open code every other day

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.160
 and see what people thought.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.800
 The latest one is the newest beast mode

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.440
 that's in VS Code co-pilot.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.720
 I think it landed an okay balance of a few things.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.320
 So the struggle with it was,

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.080
 it's very easy to put it into a state

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.080
 where it just asks you for confirmation

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:57.920
 for every single step.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.080
 But you can do it.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.000
 It's just like, should I do this?

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.280
 Should I do this and you just go, yes, yes, yes.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.960
 Or you can put it into a state

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.480
 where it is just gonna go for two hours

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.800
 and just do like all this stuff.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.400
 So the newest one is like,

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.320
 it seems to thread that balance decently.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.160
 It's still not perfect.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.280
 I still think it asks too much for confirmation,

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.880
 but that's better than it like running running wild.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.640
 But yeah, now there's other people like,

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.000
 I don't know if you saw again,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.800
 this goes back to no one really being able to,

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.400
 I am generally a huge fan of anecdotal evidence.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.880
 And I still am for this stuff,

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.800
 but anecdotal evidence is especially weak

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.960
 given how non-deterministic this stuff is.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.320
 But now everyone's saying that

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.040
 for cursor users are saying that GPT-5 was really bad.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.320
 Theo was saying that what he tried originally

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.760
 with cursor was amazing.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.360
 And now he's trying to say himself again and it's terrible.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.280
 So yeah, it's kind of unclear what variables I'm changing.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.840
 - There's a history with OpenAI.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.000
 This rhymes with every other release they've had

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.440
 where it's like really good for the first week,

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.560
 really bad after that.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.160
 Is it just, are they literally just cutting costs

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.760
 in like quantization or whatever quant,

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.680
 quantizing it, quantizing?

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:13.040
 - Quantizing, I don't know the right things.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.080
 So, okay, so I had a long conversation

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:19.080
 with Claude the other day trying to really understand

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.440
 the practicality of some of these things.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.920
 'Cause I was looking at GOM and I was like, okay,

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.240
 they train it at 32-bit precision.

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:31.200
 So if we deploy a 32-bit precision, like what does this take?

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.240
 And it like told me the hardware requirements.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.240
 I'm like, that's pretty huge.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:38.240
 And I'm like, how many tokens can this support per second

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.960
 with batch?

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.080
 And it was like one to 200 per second.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.120
 I don't know if this is correct,

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.800
 but I'm like, that is so slow for that much hardware.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.480
 Like, that is so expensive.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.720
 - Yeah, I've not heard of people running 32-bit.

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.400
 - Yeah, so I'm like, does OpenAI even do that?

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.920
 'Cause they have, not only do they have that same problem,

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.440
 they have hundreds of millions of users.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.280
 - Right.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.000
 - Like so many more users than everyone else.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.160
 - Do we know things like that?

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.040
 Like, do we know like what they're training at?

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.880
 Like, what, like is it 16?

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.880
 - Pretty much everyone trains at,

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.640
 so it's a mix of 16 and 32.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.720
 It's like, it'll blend depending on operation.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.240
 The reason is because the current generation

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.600
 of NVIDIA hardware is optimized for that.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.440
 - They're interesting.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.440
 The next generation basically can let you train at FP4,

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.960
 I think, or FP4, maybe FP8, I forgot what it is.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.280
 So all the inference providers are hoping

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.600
 that next generation models are natively at this smaller size

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.360
 so that they can perform better and run smaller.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.320
 But yeah, I'm thinking like, man, OpenAI's models

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.600
 must be giant, even bigger than these open source ones.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.520
 And they have way more users.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.320
 Anything with anthropic.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.640
 So I'm like, how, the numbers aren't adding up.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.640
 Like there's no way they could like,

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.320
 they have to do this, they have to.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.880
 - Yeah.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.040
 - Unless there's like other ways to optimize it

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.280
 I'm not aware of, maybe there are,

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.680
 but there's no way that they can possibly serve this demand.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.320
 - Yeah, and it's interesting that goes back to the whole,

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.640
 like there's no way to measure this stuff

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.320
 as a business model, like they can just make more money

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.760
 by making it a little dumber

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.920
 and can people really prove that they did?

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.760
 You know what I mean?

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.040
 - Yeah, that's the other thing when I'm thinking about

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.680
 stuff for open code.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.360
 Because people are always telling me, oh, do this

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.880
 and like it gets like 10, 15% better on the benchmarks.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.640
 I actually don't care unless a user can tell.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.360
 If the user can't feel it, it actually doesn't help us grow.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.480
 It doesn't really help us do better.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.520
 And you can argue that doing 100 of these

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.160
 little optimizations add up, sure, fine.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.800
 But there really aren't 100 of these little optimizations.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:55.080
 So I'm like not that compelled by a 20% increase

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.960
 in quality, whatever that means.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.880
 So similarly, they're probably very compelled

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.560
 by a 20% decrease in quality.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.300
 'Cause people can't really tell.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.760
 And there's so many conspiracy theories about like,

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.400
 oh, I think they're quantizing.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.360
 Like I have proof that they're quantizing.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.600
 'Cause like, you know, this one, the model's been worse.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.840
 But then anthropic will deny it, which is kind of confusing,

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.600
 but maybe they have to go with different definitions

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.000
 that are technically not lying.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.320
 There is a new benchmark finally

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.560
 that's focused on measuring this.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.600
 So they are running the same model

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.280
 against different providers.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.120
 I don't know if you saw this,

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.360
 but bedrock is complete ass.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.440
 - I did see that, that's unfortunate.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.280
 - Yeah.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.640
 Well, it was like 4% lower or something, right?

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.400
 I mean, the spread on those provider benchmarks

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.240
 was very tight.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.960
 - Well, but that's like a very broad benchmark.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.320
 So for our use like the Agentic tool calling.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.960
 - Oh, that makes a big answer.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.080
 - All the thing, yeah.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:51.920
 - Sure.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.440
 - I don't wanna say specific company name

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.200
 'cause I don't think I'm supposed to know this.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.760
 There is a large company

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.200
 that is stuck with a contract with bedrock

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.040
 that they're trying to get out of

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.480
 because they're not having a good experience with it.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.120
 - 'Cause they have planets around chips, right?

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.560
 Like their own internships?

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.400
 - Yeah.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.240
 - Yeah.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.640
 - So it's not a quick fix for them.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.360
 - Or whatever it's called.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.680
 - That's probably the, that's the training.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.800
 - Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.640
 - Yeah.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.760
 And so I think Google just has sort of been video stuff.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.680
 So, yeah, if you use Sonnet

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.200
 through Google, it's probably a better experience.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.240
 So someone's measuring this.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.400
 So I think they'll be able to see, okay,

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.840
 are there like within the same provider,

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.240
 are there like dips and increases and stuff?

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.680
 - Yeah, they should just do the one test

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:37.920
 that every developer wants to know,

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.240
 which is like when the US developers wake up

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.400
 and start working, does it really get worse?

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.240
 'Cause everybody seems to think so.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.480
 It's really interesting.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.320
 - Oh, interesting.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.160
 You think the people that have,

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.360
 oh yeah, I guess the people that have like

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.400
 overlapping time zones, they like feel it get worse?

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.560
 - Yeah, this is the anthropic thing that people complain

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.560
 that Sonnet gets way dumber during US working hours.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.840
 And then like early morning--

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.720
 - I wouldn't know 'cause I work US opening up.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.640
 - Yeah, I work early morning before--

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.480
 - Oh, do you think?

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.640
 - I think most people, I'm not really felt it.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.480
 I mean, I definitely have bad sessions,

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.040
 but I don't ever think like, oh,

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.080
 it's 'cause it's the afternoon.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.280
 Like it does feel like sometimes you just get a session

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.400
 that was like, it was never gonna get this right.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.560
 Like I could have tried 10 times.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.000
 But usually I just think like,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.360
 I'm just framing the problem wrong.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.120
 Like I gotta take on part of the problem

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.720
 and like break out the part it can do.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.400
 Like I generally just assume it was an intractable problem,

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.800
 not their quantizing.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.760
 I think like it is kind of a boogeyman thing

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.120
 where you can just,

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.840
 you can start blaming everything on quantizing.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.000
 But it is an interesting situation where,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.480
 here's the two things for me.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.000
 One, they have every motivation

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.760
 and very little consequence, I guess, if it can't be proved.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.840
 - I think they literally have to,

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.680
 given a number of things.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.000
 - Yeah, just to support the demand, yeah.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.080
 And they're already melting.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.760
 Like they're already like, especially entropic

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.280
 has so many outages, so many overloaded errors

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.880
 that like clearly they have a reason they need to do this.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.200
 And then two, the Shrek guy on Twitter, XJDR.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.040
 - Yeah.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.200
 - He believes that they do.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:07.880
 And if he does, it's not a conspiracy theory, it's fact.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.400
 He seems very smart.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.960
 - He does seem smart, yeah.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.960
 Yeah, it's so weird 'cause like, imagine you pay,

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.240
 'cause this is a, it's kind of confusing

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.900
 and I get why it's carved for them on their end

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.280
 because they have a consumer market,

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.240
 which is their Claude and Chachie PT, whatever.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.560
 And then they range from that all the way

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.440
 to like enterprise B2B.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.280
 - Yeah.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.640
 - And if I am an enterprise company paying you

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:43.640
 for a low level primitive, it's like paying for one CPU

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.240
 and they're randomly like, oh, we're actually just gonna

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.620
 give you point one CPU for like this hour.

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:48.460
 - Yeah.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.800
 - So that's really weird and I can't really think.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.640
 - It is.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.160
 - I know Amazon has like the noisy neighbor,

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.400
 or like cloud generally can have like the noisy neighbor thing,

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.240
 but it's not that big of a deal.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.400
 It doesn't really impact things that much.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.400
 Whereas here, I'm like, they're kind of ripping you off

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.240
 in a way.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.080
 - It is.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.080
 I mean, there has to be some kind of like,

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:04.920
 this is the kind of thing

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.160
 that I feel like gets regulated, right, or something.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:10.120
 But I've seen like Sig Kitten and I've seen XJDR

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.040
 say things about this.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.680
 Like the economics of it are like,

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:17.840
 you're basically like paying for this idea of something

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.200
 and they can just totally change that

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.040
 without your knowing.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:21.880
 - Make it not work.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.200
 - Yeah.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.400
 So you're not really getting what you paid for.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.240
 I don't know.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.760
 It seems like there's consumer protection stuff

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.760
 that would come into play there.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.600
 I don't know.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.720
 - Yeah, I mean, this gets really hard

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:34.680
 with the people building the next layer of stuff.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:39.200
 Like let's say like both lovable V zero, et cetera.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.960
 So one, they're not in control of this,

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.280
 but they're kind of in the worst position

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.880
 because they're charging users for a tool

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.580
 that's supposed to do something.

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:48.420
 - Yeah.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:51.160
 - And if the tool doesn't work and you paid for the tokens

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.080
 and like, what the heck?

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.120
 It's like, they charge you for a chance of it working.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.400
 But at the same time, there's no other model

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.240
 that can work.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.080
 Like what's the alternative?

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.480
 Like they can't only charge you when it works

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.080
 'cause then it's totally unfeasible economically.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.680
 - It's already unfeasible economically.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.520
 Let's be honest.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.360
 - Yes, right.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.600
 - All the way down to the bottom.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.800
 - I feel like that's coming out.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.200
 Like there's more articles coming out.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.640
 Like the cursor thing yesterday,

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.720
 it was like a word document,

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.120
 which why did somebody share a word document on Twitter?

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.800
 So they just wanna like track how many people read it?

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.720
 I don't know.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.720
 But did you see the like cursors problem?

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.000
 - Yeah, but that came from the VC who led the round

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.200
 into Klein, so I know that.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.520
 (both laughing)

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.360
 - Did you read it?

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.200
 - Yeah.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.040
 - I mean, like it seemed logically--

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.800
 - It's true, it's true.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.980
 Like this whole model where you just charge

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.760
 either a fixed price and then like

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.880
 people can use whatever usage.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.640
 That's obviously not gonna work.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.560
 This whole thing where like you're delivering a tool

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.800
 that's supposed to do something

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.200
 and you're paying for a situation where it fails.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.640
 That's like also kind of weird.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.640
 So these are problems to figure out.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:58.600
 I think what is wrong about everyone's take on this is

00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.960
 if their model is wrong

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.720
 and there is a correct model that is discovered,

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.600
 they will just move to it.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.960
 - Yeah, it's true.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.360
 - It's this thing where everyone harps on,

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.480
 oh, we're different 'cause this is our differentiator.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.560
 This is our differentiator.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.400
 - Yeah.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.440
 - The problem is the moment the market realizes you're right,

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.680
 the guys bigger than you just adopt that.

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.360
 And now there's no differentiator.

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.200
 What are you at this point?

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.840
 - And like half the world knows what cursor is

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.080
 and like 32,000 people download an amp.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.040
 So good luck with your pricing model.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:26.880
 (both laughing)

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:30.280
 - Yeah, it's just not, it's not sustainable.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.720
 The more you talk about it, the more you write these things,

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.000
 the faster maybe they consider that maybe you're right.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:37.920
 - You know?

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.760
 - Yeah.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.840
 - And they shift, but I guess they have tried shifting, right?

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.800
 Like in the cursor case, they've tried shifting their pricing

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.800
 and gotten some backlash and then they had to back.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:46.640
 - Yeah, people got pulled it back or?

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.640
 - I don't know if they pulled it back.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.720
 People got mad, but guess what?

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.440
 Still, we're all still a rounding error compared to them.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.480
 - Yeah, it's so true.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.120
 Yeah, they turned some big chunk.

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.480
 It could be a big chunk for every other company,

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:04.160
 but for them, it's like, yeah, they're a giant.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.520
 - Cursor only has, this is a funny thing.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:10.040
 Whenever people write company's problem,

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.200
 they compare a big company to a smaller company

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.560
 doing it differently.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.840
 The smaller company is never there, they're a problem.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.200
 It's never gonna be an issue.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.040
 - Yeah.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.480
 - Cursor's problem is Microsoft.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.320
 That's it.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.680
 That's really all it is.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.120
 At the end of the day, they're gonna have

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:27.280
 some big battle with Microsoft and someone's gonna win.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.680
 Just like Slack had that big battle and they lost.

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.720
 That is, it's always a bigger company.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.800
 The smaller company is not gonna like snipe them

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.000
 on their own territory, it's just not gonna happen.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.820
 - Good insight, you're smart guy, Dax.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.960
 You should write a document, a word document

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.080
 and spread it online.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.840
 Like, you're all idiots, just stop.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:51.360
 - Stop talking, stop talking, stop talking, stop it.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.640
 Shut up.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.080
 - We should start off at GBD5

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.520
 from more of a normally perspective,

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.280
 like the launch, the drama around it,

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.800
 'cause it was like a big internet story.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.440
 Like, I think the consensus that I've gathered is like,

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.960
 well, one, the launch of that was, I mean, it's so bad.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.720
 Just like, I don't know why that entire company

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.080
 doesn't understand something.

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.800
 They don't have like any introspection or self-reflection.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.160
 Something about that event going off like that

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.360
 and nobody questioning any of it, I don't know.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.520
 That's a big smell.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.480
 - Super boring event, like four presentations,

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.000
 like just for a company, just types you gotta meet it.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.840
 Like, the amount of like fake trying to be excited

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.840
 was just, yeah, I don't know.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.920
 - Okay, another key thing.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:40.400
 If you are building a company that,

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.640
 where your product uses an LM,

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:47.040
 you need to understand that there is a huge challenge

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:50.160
 with demoing, because LM's are slow.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.960
 Do not build your demo around,

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:55.480
 or your launch, whatever, around showing what LM can do,

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:59.360
 'cause you are stuck waiting for it to do its thing,

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.640
 and then everyone turns to each other

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.440
 and it starts bullshitting for two minutes.

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:03.840
 - They're not even bullshitting.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.400
 In the case of the open AI launch thing, the GPT-5 launch,

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.120
 they are like reading scripted banter.

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.000
 It's like they're still reading a script,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.520
 but they're trying to be normal people

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.400
 sitting around a table waiting for the LM.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.960
 It's just like, yeah, just read the--

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:18.800
 - I don't know, that's a solution,

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.640
 but this is a challenge.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.720
 Like, it's hard to demo these things in this format.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.880
 So do whatever to avoid that format.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.160
 - It is funny, just as a step back, meta,

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.840
 LLM technology wave.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.920
 Like, technology got slower.

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.480
 Like, the biggest thing in technology right now

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.360
 is just like 10 times slower than anything

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.160
 we've ever had to use.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.360
 And we all just kind of like accepted it.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.320
 We're like, I guess this is just, it's smart.

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.760
 - Feedback loops are gone these days.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.560
 - Yeah, it's rough.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:50.080
 - Yeah, even before LLM's like,

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.800
 moving more development to cloud stuff,

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.920
 way worse feedback loops, now with this, yeah.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.920
 - Somewhere, DHH is talking about how his feedback loop

00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.760
 didn't get bad.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.880
 He still just codes on his little Linux,

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:06.600
 Omarky, the Rails app, locally, running Redis,

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.000
 I don't know, something.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.320
 - Well, we also need to talk about Omark,

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:14.080
 you probably, in the AUR repository going down.

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.400
 But GPT5, I think this consensus was,

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:20.720
 boring launch event, even more boring model.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.000
 Like, people are mostly disappointed,

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.640
 but mostly just because, I mean, it is better

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.880
 than the last model.

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.640
 It's better than their, whatever the previous model,

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.840
 that they've been hyping GPT5 since,

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.800
 like before I knew about any of these things,

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.680
 I think I'd heard of GPT5, like somehow,

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.600
 that had been like this big milestone

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.000
 that they put out on the calendar,

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.600
 that when GPT5 comes, just wait.

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.680
 And I think everyone was kind of like,

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.000
 disappointed in light of the hype.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:49.840
 Do you agree?

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.640
 - Yeah, yeah, 'cause they've been saving this,

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:56.480
 this like product name for like a big moment.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:00.800
 Yeah, my feeling is that,

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.440
 'cause like, yeah, like they, they were,

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.520
 I mean, back when like 4.1,

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.600
 and all those little smaller, not smaller,

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.160
 they were just, they didn't give it that label,

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.920
 but they were improvements.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.200
 They're like, oh, but the GPT5 one's like much better,

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.420
 so we're saving it.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:17.840
 And I think they failed to deliver,

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:21.520
 because we've gotten used to seeing,

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.880
 like the jump from like three to four

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.440
 was like really crazy.

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.320
 And what everyone kept saying was,

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.720
 oh, there's no signs of slowing down,

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:29.760
 there's no signs of slowing down.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.800
 - Yeah, scaling law, everything.

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.100
 - Yeah, exactly, there's no signs of slowing down.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:39.100
 And what I'm seeing is everyone has just shifted,

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:43.160
 not just open AI, Grok also,

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.880
 to just the reasoning approach, you know?

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.840
 Which all it is is just like,

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.760
 fronting them even slower and making them do even more

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.080
 even slower. - Even slower, yeah.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.680
 - And I'm sure there's like some training process

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.160
 to make it good at that, to like squeeze out.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.720
 Oh, technically it's like getting the right answer more.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.600
 But like, this isn't an advancement,

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.680
 you just like shifted stuff around.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.800
 Like now they're slower,

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.240
 which means for a whole set of use cases,

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.740
 they're not very fun.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.080
 So people like, oh yeah, GPT5 is nailing this stuff.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.560
 I'm like, but it's so slow.

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:16.120
 And I hate, like most of my questions tell us

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.860
 whether it is coding or just using it as a consumer.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.000
 - Especially as a consumer, oftentimes I'm using it

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.440
 as an alternative to Google.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:28.240
 I just need it to like, from its own memory,

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.960
 spit out whatever it knows.

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.200
 I don't need to do a web search.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.800
 I don't need it to reason.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.480
 So when I do that, all of a sudden it's like,

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.720
 taking a minute to reply.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.000
 I'm just like, this is a horrible experience.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.240
 The product got worse.

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.760
 So for me, like, yes, I get that it's technically better,

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.880
 but this feels like a signal that

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.760
 the whole scaling is all we need is,

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.200
 they're like admitting that that's

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.280
 not really yielding the results that we'd expect.

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.920
 - I mean, I'm not a smart guy about this stuff.

00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.160
 I mean, maybe about any stuff,

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.720
 but I don't know anything about it.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.320
 But I feel like logically, it seems very obvious to me

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.400
 that the whole premise of the scaling thing,

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.040
 and you can correct me if I'm wrong on any of this,

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.120
 the whole premise was, as long as you just keep scaling

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.240
 the compute and the data, it's gonna keep getting better.

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.640
 But like, didn't they hit all the data of the internet?

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.840
 - Like another problem, yeah.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.080
 - Two years ago or something?

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:21.160
 So it's like, everyone, it just feels like

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.880
 they glossed over that part where we can't keep

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:23.720
 scaling the data.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.760
 Actually, it's gonna be very hard to add incremental data,

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.040
 and we're gonna hire poets to set around and write,

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.640
 but like, how fast is that compared to the entire internet?

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.240
 Like, it just seems so obvious that,

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.400
 obviously, we ran out of data.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.120
 So the scaling law is kind of like moot

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.640
 if we can't just keep feeding it,

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.920
 unless we find some other galaxy with intelligent beings

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.520
 that have been writing English and whatever,

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.720
 we're just out of data.

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.200
 So scaling is done until they come up with some new thing.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.160
 The cool thing, I will say, the light at the end of the tunnel

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.840
 for me, or just the silver lining, not silver lining,

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.640
 whatever, the optimistic case is like,

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.880
 as a not smart person in this field,

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.760
 I just get to wait around for the next big advancement.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.360
 So somebody's gonna come up with it,

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:02.840
 and the money always wins,

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.600
 and they're gonna come up with some new thing

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.640
 that's the better version of LMs,

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.320
 and it's gonna do the thing where it grows again.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.440
 So I get to just wait for that to happen, which is fun.

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.280
 - Yeah.

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.120
 - I get to be completely ignorant

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.920
 and just know that some days, some of it will be like,

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:18.960
 well, it turns out if you diffuse the models with whatever,

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:23.400
 extra ciphers and stuff, I don't know,

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:26.920
 it turns out now we're at GPT-6 and it's amazing.

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:27.760
 And I just get to wait.

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.920
 - Yeah, it's possible.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.640
 So, but I think we're definitely in the face of optimization now.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.560
 I think we've, I would say we've firmly entered that

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:39.640
 because the other issue is, the other side of scaling is,

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:43.000
 okay, you've made a bigger model, but now how do you serve it?

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.720
 You're already having trouble serving the previous big model.

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:46.560
 - Yeah.

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.400
 - Having a new bigger model that's 10% better

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.760
 to the average person, but now costs like 10X more.

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.960
 Yeah, it's just like, that doesn't really work.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:58.200
 - Yeah, little advice, just to all the frontier labs.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.840
 We've done the whole keep getting slower and bigger thing.

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.040
 I got just a little advice.

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.720
 Let's try smaller and faster.

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.440
 Let's just, let's go the way of mobile phones.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:09.080
 - So that is what's, so that's what's interesting about this.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.120
 China is entirely focused on that.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:15.360
 They're focused on, okay, we're not going to provide

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.280
 much better quality, but maybe we can get close to matching it,

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.120
 but it's smaller and it's cheaper.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:25.640
 And almost every single Chinese lab,

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.240
 their model that they produce fits that.

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.560
 No one in China has built GPT-5.

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:34.880
 They've all built sonnet four-ish type models at best.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:35.720
 - Yeah.

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:40.880
 - And American companies don't seem to be pursuing that.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.480
 So I finally met one that is an American company

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:47.400
 that is building approach, smaller size models

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.400
 that are cheaper to run, faster run,

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.120
 can be really customized, if you will.

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:54.280
 (laughing)

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.080
 - Quim three is basically like,

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:57.760
 sonnet four with monk fruit.

00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.160
 - Three calories.

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.000
 - Yeah.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.800
 But China's entire focus is there.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:07.040
 And I'm like, I think practically speaking,

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.760
 that might just be the thing that gets way more usage.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:15.760
 Today, if you made it possible to use sonnet four

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.240
 at like a quarter of the price,

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.400
 don't know why anyone would use sonnet four.

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.320
 You benefit from 10% worse, this alternative.

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.320
 So that's where the demand is slower,

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.640
 or sorry, cheaper and faster.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.840
 Especially for the coding agent stuff,

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.040
 like using open code, like man,

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.240
 imagine if it was like 10 times faster.

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.080
 - Oh, it'd be amazing.

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.160
 - So it would just go boom, and do all this work.

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.000
 - Yeah.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:39.840
 We'd have flow back.

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:40.660
 - That'd be amazing.

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:42.400
 - We wouldn't just like have to go to Twitter

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.720
 for 10 minutes.

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.640
 (laughing)

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.080
 And we've had hints of that, right?

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:50.920
 With these like, optimized things,

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.400
 like cerebras or grok.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:56.080
 So we can kind of see what that would look like,

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.360
 and like, wow, that would be pretty crazy.

00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.480
 - Yeah.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.920
 - Yeah, they've had trouble, right?

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.120
 From a infrastructure and scaling standpoint.

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.680
 As soon as they announce something super cool,

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.480
 everybody's like, well, I'd rather have that.

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:08.320
 That sounds good.

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.760
 And they're servers melt and they go away.

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.600
 - Yeah.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.000
 I mean, the, yeah, both grok and cerebras stuff.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.760
 I don't, whenever they launch something,

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:20.320
 the most impressive aspect is the speed,

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:24.440
 but it like never is good enough to actually replace.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.800
 'Cause they make the models worse.

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.160
 - Yeah.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.600
 - Yeah, so that's where I'm really interested in.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.760
 That's like where I want to see all the advances.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.000
 I don't give a shit about what Sam Altman is saying anymore.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.480
 - Mm-hmm.

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:38.040
 - I want to see like people pushing the tokens per second

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.080
 at the price.

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.560
 - Yeah, it's interesting that it landed,

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.480
 like the LLM seemed to taper.

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.520
 They're hitting that flattening out and optimization phase.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:50.000
 Right after they kind of like changed programming forever,

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.440
 we're all like gonna either lose our jobs

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.280
 or have a very different job.

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:56.280
 And then nothing else is affected,

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.920
 basically the rest of society is stuck with

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.680
 all their hopes and dreams dashed.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.520
 Like there's no-

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.320
 - No, remember that tweet I posted a long time ago

00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.800
 where I was like, everyone's worried about

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.480
 people losing their job,

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:13.120
 but this maybe sounds too optimistic,

00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:16.480
 but a funny outcome of all this is you take programming,

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.640
 which was already the cushiest job you can imagine.

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.920
 You work from home, do whatever you want.

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.280
 You can work two hours a day.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.120
 You have paid a lot.

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:28.000
 And then someone events a technology that is good enough

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.700
 to make that job even cushier but not eliminated.

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.120
 (laughing)

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.640
 - I do rest of society is still the same.

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:40.240
 - It made people hate programmers even more than they already did.

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.680
 - It's like you can't even get rid of them

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.480
 and you still have to pay them a lot of money.

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:46.280
 And now they're just watching the LLM people.

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.480
 - It's wild actually.

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:50.280
 Yeah, I didn't realize until this whole LLM thing

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.360
 that people hate engineers or hate, sorry.

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.600
 I'm an engineer.

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.240
 I don't know.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.440
 Hate software developers.

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.280
 Like there's a lot of hate towards software developers.

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.240
 I guess like it's been doing, I do get it.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.640
 Yeah, if I were on the outside looking at it,

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.920
 I'd pretty much feel the same.

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:10.200
 - I mean, I've always thought this was like so weird.

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.480
 So I remember some of my friends that worked

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:18.480
 at like serious financial companies in New York.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.000
 I remember one of them was telling me that this,

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.560
 so the whole, the company has a whole building.

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.720
 It was like Black Rock or one of those.

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.520
 And every single floor, you know,

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.760
 you look at, it's like standard corporate office.

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.160
 Everyone's dressed in a suit, whatever.

00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.840
 And the two engineering floors,

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.440
 it just looks like a, like a stereotype

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.180
 of what you imagine the startup is.

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:39.000
 Then you know, the other floors are still the suits.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.840
 And I'm like, man, imagine working there

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.280
 and being on one of the corporate floors.

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.000
 And you're like, why the hell does that team

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.920
 get to have this little playground of stuff?

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:51.400
 Because they're like smart.

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.800
 They're like, they're like, no computers.

00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.960
 And like quote unquote, like the smart people.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.280
 But like whenever I interact with them,

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.560
 they just are kind of annoying, you know?

00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:01.760
 So I think that's the average person's experience

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.920
 with like the engineering team, the programming team.

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:07.480
 So I get it, like I would get that.

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.480
 By the way, they also all make more money than you.

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:10.320
 Like that's another thing.

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:12.640
 - Yeah, how did it happen this way?

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.200
 I mean, the money part I actually get,

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.320
 like we create a lot of value.

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.360
 Software developers do.

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:21.240
 And it's a very valuable thing to use technology.

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.080
 There's a lot of leverage.

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.400
 I get the money part, I guess.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.680
 But like, how did the culture part where like--

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.040
 - It's cool. - Software developers.

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.380
 - It's entirely Google's fault.

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:32.240
 - Oh, they set the precedent for developers

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.400
 getting everything they want.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.840
 - There was a period of time where if you were smart,

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.440
 you went to finance, even if you were in tech.

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.880
 Like that's where they make all the money.

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:42.240
 Then all of a sudden the, like the bank companies

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.200
 started offering stupid high salaries

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:47.120
 and like all these crazy like cultural things.

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.080
 They treat you like a baby and people like that

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.240
 'cause they wanna be babies.

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.520
 (laughing)

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:54.960
 And then people, and the finance companies

00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.200
 had trouble recruiting.

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.960
 So they had to like kind of mirror that offering.

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.280
 - Interesting.

00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.360
 So then everybody just had to treat,

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:05.760
 had to let software developers wear whatever they want,

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.600
 do whatever they want.

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:08.440
 - Yeah.

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:09.840
 - Work from wherever they want.

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:10.680
 Interesting.

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.840
 So now society hates us.

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:16.080
 - But the stupid thing is it's like 90% of the programmers

00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:18.120
 are like whatever and annoying.

00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:21.680
 So, oh yeah, it's like the field had to do that.

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:26.180
 But then like 10% of people, okay, maybe that makes sense.

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.680
 But then you get all, you get like the long tail of everyone

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.320
 that gets them like hop on.

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.160
 - Yeah.

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:33.320
 - So I think that's why there's so much resentment

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:34.160
 around programmers.

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.920
 - Like we don't all deserve the Google perks

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:36.800
 is what you're saying.

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.000
 We just kind of get them.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.600
 We inherited them from the pavers of the way.

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.240
 - I found that, to be honest,

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.200
 I find the Google situation creepy.

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.800
 I hate the whole campus thing.

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:47.640
 - Oh, yeah.

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.840
 - The campus thing where like they certainly like,

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:52.000
 they're like here, take the bus to school.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.160
 And then like you can go to tech on your computer

00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.480
 and then like, hey, like we got your food

00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:59.280
 and go to the cafeteria and get your food.

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.040
 - Yeah, it is kind of bizarre.

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.720
 - And like here's like a little like career plan for you.

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:07.680
 You like check off this box and you go to go to the next grade.

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.520
 That whole thing is--

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:10.360
 - That's great.

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.480
 - That whole thing is creepy.

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.000
 It's like you got to grow up at some point.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.760
 - Yeah, I guess like it's happened over our careers.

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:22.600
 Sort of like when I, before I became a programmer,

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:25.400
 like I was in the Geek Squad, everyone loved me.

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:26.840
 Like you fixed computers?

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.920
 Oh my God, my computer's broken.

00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.920
 Like, could you come over and fix my computer?

00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.640
 Like everyone I knew personally was having me fix their shit.

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:36.600
 And like the Geek Squad was like this revered section

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:40.240
 of the Best Buy where like all the amazing computer nerds are.

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.520
 And over the last 15 years, that's totally switched.

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:43.640
 Like now everybody hates us.

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:44.480
 It's so interesting.

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.240
 - I also blame Mark Zuckerberg for this.

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.080
 - Oh yeah.

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.040
 - Because I'm living for everything.

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:54.040
 But it's like, Jay brings up all the time.

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:58.240
 His whole thing is like, I found a Facebook

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.120
 'cause I want people to connect.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.240
 But like he doesn't understand people at all.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.560
 And the thing he founded where he claims a mission

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.760
 was to help people connect is the thing

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:09.120
 that has made people more disconnected than ever

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.680
 to like a hyper degree is like that level of irony is insane.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.880
 And I think that's now people's experience with technology.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.720
 It's like ruining their life.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:19.560
 And it's like--

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.400
 - Oh interesting.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.240
 - It's like cigarettes.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.000
 It's like a, he's like the cigarette maker, you know?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.040
 - It tracks, like the whole timeline just tracks

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.600
 with like actually all this technology is terrible for us.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.440
 And people realize that even if they don't think about it,

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.640
 they've at a deep level understand

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.320
 that the phone is ruining their life or whatever.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.880
 And then everyone who made those things

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.720
 brought that technology.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.000
 - It was rich from it, yeah.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.160
 - Yeah.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.320
 Oh, interesting.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.800
 - And it's a value criticism.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.440
 Do you see the thing I posted yesterday

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.200
 about the guy that died?

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.040
 - No, what?

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.600
 - This is a really fucked up thing.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.960
 So again, Mark Zuckerberg just does not understand people.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.520
 So you know their whole approach to AI.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.680
 Oh, we're gonna make, oh, so yeah.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.520
 I saw him talk about this.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.800
 He was like, oh yeah.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.680
 People are feeling really disconnected

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.840
 and like they don't have them to talk to.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.840
 So we're gonna make AI friends for everyone.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.960
 The guy that caused everyone to be disconnected

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.480
 is now trying to again solve the problem.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.760
 - Make AI friends for people.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.600
 - Yeah.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.160
 So they have all these like crazy like human like bots

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.880
 with like names and personalities and whatever

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.160
 that they shove them into every single one of their products.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.720
 There was a 70 something real guy.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.760
 He had previously had a stroke

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.040
 so he was accordingly impaired.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.600
 He started talking to one of these bots.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.440
 It's like a bot based off of Kendall Jenner.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.240
 Kind of like fell in love with her

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.960
 and she invited him to a specific address in New York

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.600
 to come visit and was like flirting with him.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.560
 And he like packed his bags.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.920
 His wife is like, where are you going?

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.200
 And he's like, oh, I'm going to New York.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.320
 And he's like, you haven't, you know,

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.160
 know anyone in New York?

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.040
 Like I haven't even lived there in years.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.840
 And she's like, no, I'm gonna go meet a friend.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.160
 And he's like, you know, not really supposed to be doing stuff

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.760
 on his own because he's like not in a good state.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.520
 He trips, like while rushing,

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.880
 he trips and falls in a parking lot

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.400
 and like hurts himself and dies from this

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.000
 trying to meet this face AI person.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:18.480
 And like I get that when you're making this product,

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.200
 you know, and I'm not saying they're there at fault

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:25.640
 for the death literally, but from like a low level

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.200
 like soul perspective, this is not the right thing.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.080
 This is not the right thing.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.880
 Making AI friends where people is not the right thing.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.720
 You can't predict this kind of thing happening,

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.760
 but you from like a first principle thing,

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.720
 you know, if you know it's wrong,

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.520
 you imagine stuff like this would happen.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.360
 Yeah.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:43.360
 And Elizabeth brought up, she was like, man, imagine

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.720
 that guy's parents, like this, you know,

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.040
 born 70 years ago, they have the baby.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.520
 And they're like, oh, I wonder how he's gonna die.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.680
 Would have never expected this child is gonna die

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:57.600
 'cause it got tricked by an AI, you know,

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.560
 and he fell in a parking lot and died.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.560
 He probably would have never predicted

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.200
 that that's how his life was gonna end.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.240
 And it got me thinking like, man,

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.040
 I am just lucky that I'm not 70 right now

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.600
 'cause I'm smart enough.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.040
 And like, I understand how things are going

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.240
 in my brain function enough to like,

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.080
 just know what AI is like and totally avoid it.

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.600
 But if I had just happened to be a certain age,

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.240
 this thing would have just completely--

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.600
 Possibly, like, where are you?

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.600
 Yeah.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.280
 And when I'm that age, who knows

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.520
 what's gonna be the thing that I'm like affected by.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.680
 So yeah, this stuff is really bad.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.240
 And I think Mark Zuckerberg needs to like,

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.160
 he's never gonna do this,

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.560
 but he needs to look back and be like--

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.080
 He'd be honest with himself.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:38.920
 Yeah.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.400
 I am causing these problems.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.520
 Like, I don't know how to solve them.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.160
 Like, I'm not the person that's gonna solve them.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.560
 Yeah, like, does he go to bed at night

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.640
 and like think like Facebook is good for the world?

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.120
 He surely doesn't, right?

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:50.960
 He does?

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:51.800
 No, he does.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:52.880
 You think he's convinced that like--

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.720
 Smart people are rationalizing everything.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.960
 He's a smart person.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.480
 Like, I'm sure he has a way of looking at it

01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.960
 where he said this makes sense.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.720
 But yeah, anyway, I think this is why people hate tech.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.360
 Every story now is pretty pessimistic.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.680
 Yeah.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.400
 Well, that sucks.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.280
 And on that note, let's probably get off here.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.760
 (laughs)

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.840
 Leave the listeners with that one.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.560
 Yeah, so think about that, everyone.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.400
 Yeah.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.440
 With your coochie programming jobs.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.200
 Killing old people.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.040
 Oh my god.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.480
 Okay.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.400
 Well, it's been fun.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.240
 It's been fun, Dax.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.240
 Okay.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.080
 All right.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:30.920
 See you.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:31.760
 All right, see you.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.600
 Bye.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.180
 (upbeat music)

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.980
 (upbeat music)
