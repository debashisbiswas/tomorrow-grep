WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360
 We're probably going to do a million dollars of ARR for the Postgres product by the end of next week and we haven't even opened it to anybody.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.680
 -How's it going? -Oh, I've never been so busy in my entire life.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:59.760
 -You were just traveling, right? You took a little break? -That was just stupidity just going and doing, like, you know, my wife's from India, her parents are doing their 40th anniversary, so, like, we don't love going to Delhi every time, just, like, smart and, you know, just stuck inside or whatever, and so we met in Italy, but her dad, like, booked like three different locations in Italy and we haven't ate. We haven't ate, do you have a baby now?

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:18.760
 -Now, one more month. -Oh, congratulations. It's going to ruin your life, but eventually, eventually, it's like, whatever that weird illness cats give you, like, you eventually kind of like them in the end, but if you need any, like, help or advice with that stuff, ping me, by the way, I've, like, been fully through this journey.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:43.760
 -Anyway, so, like, with a 10-month-old, a heatwave in Italy, and then British, we had eight flights for the whole trip, British show is cancelled three, three, delayed three, baby ended up hospitalized, we pulled the launch of Postgres forward in a week, everything just went fucking crazy and basically, like, got back super late on Monday, and I just have slept, like, five hours since Monday, and it's all been good.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:55.760
 I mean, it's just all mean, like, everything's, I'm happier than I've ever been. It's been, like, unreal. We're probably going to do a million dollars of air for the Postgres product by the end of next week, and we haven't even opened it to anybody.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:12.760
 -Wow, that's really crazy. Yeah, I mean, eight flights is crazy. I mean, with that, without flying, is these days, we had a bunch of travel we did, and then we hit, like, six months into the pregnancy, and I'm like, this is awesome, because now, we can just say no to everything, and no one expects it to happen.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.760
 And no one expects it to travel, probably for like, at least a couple years. Yeah, it's like, terrifying.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.760
 -She mastered the poking the belly out to get through lines and just get perfect, because that's, like, a really good one.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.760
 -Yeah, I mean, she's, like, doing one month, so it's pretty obvious at this point, baby.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.760
 People will treat her real nice, which is kind of me by proxy, too.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.760
 So you launched the Postgres, I think the Postgres launch was, I remember you were literally talking about traveling.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.760
 I think we were flying that day or something, right?

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:53.760
 -Yeah, yeah, I was like, I landed, Heathrow got into the lounge, like, three minutes before the call internally to launch happened.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.760
 And so then, like, we launched it. I was just dying from it. Like, I just, I was out of it completely.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.760
 And then, like, I just got drunk in the lounge, because, like, the immediate reaction was just incredible.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.760
 My phone was just, like, lighting up. Twitter was going crazy, and just knew immediately that people were really stoked.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.760
 And so I was just necking pims cups.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.760
 -Yeah. Yeah, launch days are crazy, because you just get so overstimulated.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.760
 You're getting hit from, like, Irish at an angle, from Twitter, Deann, and she's texting you, so it's always a lot of fun.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.760
 But, like, by the end of the day, I'm, like, so overstimulated that I just need to, like, cool it and, like, enforce myself to go to sleep.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.760
 -Yes. You're doping me. You're doping me, and the receptors get, like, all jacked up. It's kind of crazy.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.760
 -Yeah. So, I guess, yeah, tell me a little bit about the history for this, because I think a lot of people were pretty surprised,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.760
 because they know PlanScale as the MySQL company, and just dropped out of nowhere, and surprised everyone.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.760
 -Yeah. I mean, never say never, I guess, right? I mean, it's the thing.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.760
 Ever since I met a launch, we've had, like, just some crazy, really crazy things happen.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:19.760
 It's a mix of just tons of demands. So, like, on the day of the launch, we just, you know, loads of people came in.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:27.760
 I mean, it's accelerated the kind of protest business even more doing metal, which is great, and we've moved some, like, giant,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.760
 the largest Aurora limitless workload in the world now runs on for tests, on PlanScale, and they migrated to us.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:44.760
 That was really cool. But alongside some of that demand, in fact, like, by about 10x, we got loads of Postgres people coming in.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.760
 Like, the CEO of a very well-known company with, like, way over 100 million ARR, like, came to the office the next day

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.760
 and just sat down and was like, you know, you have to do that. Like, here's how much we spend on Postgres.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.760
 You're the only people. We would migrate self-hosted Postgres, too.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.760
 And I was just like, okay, this is nuts. But basically, on the day, we had the metal party.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.760
 The office was, like, full of hundreds of people. People were really excited.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.760
 And after all that demand, and just seeing the whole day of, like, smaller AI companies just, like,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:20.760
 aping onto the platform as fast as possible. I kind of remembered what it was like to be in, like, an early start-up where things are just,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.760
 everything's going. Like, we did this at GitHub. Like, we moved to Fastly. Like, in no time, just moved to migrate.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.760
 We would just do, like, insane shit, because it just didn't matter.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.760
 And I just watched that happen. And so at the party, I went over to Nick, our CTO, and I just said, you know,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.760
 we have to do Postgres. He went, and he'd seen it all day, too. And he just was like, yeah, I mean, it can't be harder than anything else we've done.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.760
 And so we knew that night that it was happening. And then pretty much the day after we told the whole company, like,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.760
 you have two weeks to wrap up any of the, like, overhanging stuff we needed for the metal launch to do a couple of, like,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.760
 just some extra import stuff that we had been finishing off anyway. And then, like, we're going to have a hack week

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.760
 where we're just going to kind of try and see how far we get. And, because, like, when you just, like, look at these problems,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.760
 they look really insurmountable and difficult to do thing. You're just like, oh, this could, it's just completely unknown

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.760
 how long it would take to actually go and get this done. And so we had this very short or hands at the beginning of the week,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:25.760
 which was just suspend belief. We may never do this, like, who knows. But let's see if we can get Postgres into production

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.760
 in our production and be able to connect to it. That was done by Tuesday afternoon. And we were like, oh, okay, well,

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:40.760
 that was good. And by Friday, we had high availability and failover was done. And the demos lasted three hours.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.760
 Like, we asked everyone, like, to demo what they'd been up to. The marketing team made fun videos. And, like, all of these things,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.760
 like, even, like, Holly just showed people how many inbound we've had over the years asking for Postgres.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.760
 It's just, like, little things that everything like Postgres related, basically. And everyone just did, like,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.760
 we got insights working really nicely by the end of the week. And the main feedback was everyone was like,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.760
 I can't believe how fast we got all of this done. We can do this. And we just said, right, we're shipping.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.760
 We're going to be in production with real customers live on this by July 1st. And we were ahead of schedule leave from then

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:18.760
 and got it done. And so now there's real, actual revenue generating companies with high workloads running on the platform

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.760
 and are just really happy. So it was very fun.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.760
 Yeah. So, okay, I don't realize it was that quick. So because Metal launched, was that, like, within the past six months?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.760
 Like, when was, when was that launched?

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.760
 I think it was May, wasn't it? Okay. Wow. I'm so, like, dyslexic for days. It's in the past, like,

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.760
 it could have been any time. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, especially when you're working at startups, like,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.760
 time is just like a weird concept. You both can't believe how long it's been and how recent certain things were.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.760
 Mm-hmm. We actually have a good amount of Postgres experience in house. Actually, we have, like,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.760
 ex-century people, ex-go-cardless people who all have run really big Postgres workloads.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.760
 So it's felt, like, pretty natural to go and do this. And it's been really fun, you know, to work with Postgres more.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.760
 It's just been great. Yeah. So I guess talk to me a little bit about,

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.760
 so there's obviously stuff that was probably unique about Postgres, but I'm curious about what was shared.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.760
 Because I'm assuming you guys have some kind of operator that's just good at managing database nodes,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.760
 generally. So how much of that was able to be reused? Like, what could be reused? What was, what couldn't?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:25.760
 A lot. And then all of the infrastructure that surrounds that operator, right? So the Post we released about extreme resilience,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.760
 did you see that? Yeah, I didn't read it yet, but a little bit.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:36.760
 Of course, it's basically just a list of rules that we follow for how we do that. All of that stuff underpins the Postgres product, too.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:44.760
 So the operator is incredibly mature. The way we run many, many different Kubernetes clusters that don't share any backplane.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:52.760
 Like all of these kind of layers of very resilient infrastructure are kind of done and work really well.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:58.760
 You remember those, there's those benchmarks out there that essentially just like a latency test for getting to the database

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:04.760
 that compares us to like neon, to base and everyone. And we were just like so much faster than everyone else.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:10.760
 Because our edge infrastructure is exceptionally good because we have people that have managed the edge networks of top 100 websites, right?

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:17.760
 So like it's all of these like things that affect the database that we've done really, really well.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.760
 All of those things get pulled in. Our backup system that can backup databases at line rate, restore backups at line rate.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.760
 Like all of these things that we've done for the hosted Vatess product were there.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:34.760
 And then of course, like the operator being incredibly mature, having done hundreds and hundreds of millions of failovers.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:45.760
 And you know, it's all that. And so we, the other big design decision we made was to not do what we did previously,

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:53.760
 which was do like my SQL hosting using Vatess. And then you could like scale up massively on Vatess like our very large customers have done.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:00.760
 We've done two products this time. We've done what we internally called Horizon. It was called Horizon so that we could ship JavaScript in the UI without people knowing.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:06.760
 It was Postgres, so we could walk around San Francisco without talking about things without people knowing.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.760
 Postgres.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760
 That's funny.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:18.760
 Yeah, right. Like it was a very secretive product. We, we NDA'd. So there's about 50 people, including you under NDA before this announced,

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:26.760
 just so that we could talk to people about it. And we did genuinely talk to so many customers of other platforms to kind of figure out their pain points and their problems.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:37.760
 And yeah, so there's that. There's the uncharted, extremely fast, vanilla Postgres that runs on metal. And that means that pretty much if you use Postgres anywhere else,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:44.760
 you can just drop it in and it works. We're still finishing up kind of getting some extensions installed in a way that won't get people hacked,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:53.760
 you know, like the kind of approved list that Amazon has and whatever. And yeah, and then we've got rapid development on the sharded solution,

00:10:53.760 --> 00:11:00.760
 which you will be able to pull in when you need to shard and you will have the trade offs that sharding brings.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:06.760
 We made people live with the test is trade offs when they didn't need sharding. And that was a mistake. And we're undoing that mistake for this product.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.760
 So it's actually two products that we've been building.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:15.760
 Oh, I see. Interesting. And then if you do need to go from one to the other, it's like, it's the same as coming in from like an external database,

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.760
 I'm assuming.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:26.760
 We'll make it a very seamless online process. The same way, like in our UI right now, with a test, you can re-shard, you can migrate to different separate key spaces,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:36.760
 you can do all sorts of those things. We will make it extremely easy. So like right now, there's a bunch of folks migrating over that have self sharded Postgres inside their app layer.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:48.760
 Interesting. And they're swapping us in as those shards, right, to replace Aurora. And then we will then work with them to make sure that nova meets their requirements.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:55.760
 And we'll work with them to ramp that up in production. So really, like if anyone's interested in sharded Postgres,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:02.760
 the fastest way to get to that is to migrate to the current platform. That means our insights product can see your queries, do all that stuff.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.760
 And then we can manage migrating you to a sharded solution very, very quickly after that.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:12.760
 Yeah, that makes sense. So in terms of the sharding stuff, this is like a from scratch new project.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:25.760
 Yeah, yeah, it had to be. It's like all of we are the beta for test maintainers. We run the tests at significantly higher scale than anybody else among with the most amount of customers.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:34.760
 And so the test's improvements and learnings are what will feed the Postgres version, but it doesn't need to be the test.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:41.760
 That would be like a bad architectural decision to go into. And it would violate like our fundamental kind of architectural principles that we have.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:48.760
 Yeah, but I guess conceptually is the approach that the test takes, like architecturally, it's effectively going to be the same.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:55.760
 Instead of the Postgres or the Postgres quirks that make it different. No, there's some ways that will be better.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:07.760
 Some ways it will be less optimal. Postgres has some really nice elements to it that make using its parser, using various features, really nice.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:14.760
 It's replication stories nowhere near us because MySQL is those. So we'll have to do some work there to kind of paper over that.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:21.760
 It's just going to be different, but architecturally, yes, pretty much the same and to achieve all those same goals.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.760
 And then it's really going to be that paired with the operator that gives you the overall result.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:31.760
 And all we really care about behind scale is the result, which is extreme scalability at true high availability.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:39.760
 Yeah, it makes sense. So I guess the other piece of this is the Postgres connection pooling, which has always been a massive pain in the US.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:46.760
 I'm assuming you guys already have a connection pooling layer and you just adapted that to Postgres.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:56.760
 Yeah, we actually have now, we have a new proxy called PS Bouncer, which does the, we call it that because everyone's familiar with PG Bouncer.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:02.760
 We just want people to know that's what it's like there to do. It is faster than PG Bouncer.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:14.760
 It's easier to make more highly available and it will do like buffering so that you can do actually like online migrations,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.760
 like switchovers and failovers in the way that we do with Patec.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:25.760
 So like I don't know if people know that we kill nodes underneath our customers traffic constantly.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.760
 Like it's just happening while we chat. Like we have to roll through millions of them throughout a month.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:36.760
 Every single node, a plant scale dies after 29 days. No node ever gets to 29 days of life, either gets hit by a maintenance window.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:42.760
 It either gets replaced due to an underlying failure or we need to do an aversion upgrade or something.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:49.760
 The answer to every single one of those things is a PRS or an ERS, which is just killing the nodes in that cluster and having them reconverge.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:55.760
 Thanks to the operator. To do that, we need to be able to stall queries in flight and redirect them to the right place.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.760
 We have achieved all of that for Postgres already. And so that proxy is very good. It's very low latency.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:13.760
 It's lower latency than any one we saw at any Amazon, Google, any other provider we can get you from your front end to the database server with the least latency of anybody.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:21.760
 And then it can also do all those special things for you. It can route you to the right replicas in the right AC and do all those magic things.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:32.760
 That itself is now undergoing a partial rewrite to make it even faster and have an iterative path towards sharding.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:45.760
 Yeah, cool. That makes sense. I think the connection pooling stuff, even in AWS, one of the most used Postgres services, you can't just spin up Postgres and be done with it.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:52.760
 You've got to also spin up their data proxy thing. And I'm just like, it's been so many years of this.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:16:00.760
 How is this not just integrated and solved on their end? It's not optional, but you need it for sure.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:08.760
 Postgres is going to have a long journey. The neon team actually started this and doing the good work to go and grind this out, which is moving to a thread model for Postgres.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:22.760
 I haven't seen those threads. Shout out to them for doing that. It seems like the third rail. I think a lot of people are very unhappy with that idea, but it does seem to be something that needs to change.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:30.760
 We've had to tune memory management for Postgres as well. It hands a lot off to the operating system in a way that MySQL doesn't.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:39.760
 The operating system isn't aware of it. It's always managing a database server. It's just different in terms of things we have to do.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.760
 Luckily, we have people that have worked on the kernel, so you can figure those things out too.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:53.760
 Yeah, that Postgres thing is such a long-standing issue. I remember there was a thread finally talking about it, but obviously, when you have a code base, that's as old as it is.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:17:00.760
 That was effectively single-threaded. You just have globals and stuff everywhere, so that just seems like a complete nightmare to work through.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.760
 It has to happen, and it will get done, but yeah, painful task.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:15.760
 Yeah, it's manageable. The replication story is worse and harder to deal with, but again, I'm sure that will get better over time.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.760
 We'll try and help there, and we'll compensate in other ways.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.760
 Yeah. I guess let's talk a little bit about the business of Postgres.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.760
 For me, whenever I've used Postgres, it's always been Aurora and nothing else.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.760
 You guys seem positioned. You've been positioned for a while. It's the better alternative to Aurora.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.760
 Is that how you're thinking about the Postgres side as well?

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:48.760
 I looked at everyone other than Aurora. It's very easy. It's like hitting a child, but Aurora is a real product.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.760
 Yeah. Do you have any numbers on how big they are like business-wise?

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.760
 Yeah, I don't know how much you can share, but...

00:17:54.760 --> 00:18:07.760
 Yeah, it's a major part of Amazon's business, and Amazon as a whole company, Aurora stands out as a major contribution to their entire business.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:14.760
 It's a very good product. It truly is very good. We are provably better, and that's been proven through our customers' stories.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:23.760
 If you go and read the case studies, very large Aurora customers have migrated to us, seen cost-saving, seen significant performance improvements,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.760
 and most importantly, reliability improvements, which is always stunning to me.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:34.760
 I spoke to someone very formally from AWS last night, actually.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:41.760
 He was like, "Yeah, they know that." It's very stunning, actually, that that's the case that achieved that.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:47.760
 To me, I kind of pinch myself, and then I, you're a reminder that this is the technology arc through and through.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:56.760
 This is small companies with advantages can eventually win against very large ones, so it's been really interesting.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:05.760
 Actually, the amount of email, we've been doing this ramp up from moving people from the smaller providers over to us,

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.760
 and that's been really easy, and they see an immediate benefit, and we're just going through building our confidence,

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.760
 building everyone else's confidence. I've been surprised at how many Aurora people have reached out,

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.760
 like really wanting to dig in and try it, so it's very cool, really cool.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:27.760
 Yeah, it's weird, given how much attention Postgres has gotten, Aurora has still been the default for so long.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.760
 It's interesting to see that kind of finally start to change.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:36.760
 The other thing I was going to ask was, obviously, in this initial phase, I'm assuming it's smaller companies.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.760
 I'm sure you have bigger companies looking to move to or maybe have already moved.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:48.760
 What do you think about this whole, there's all this talk about how there's some link between Postgres and AI companies?

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:53.760
 There's a lot of framing in that way. Do you have any thoughts on that?

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.760
 The majority of AI companies are getting founded using Postgres.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.760
 But is that unique to AI companies or is that just startups in general?

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:09.760
 I think it's just startups in general. Part of the thing that was very revealing to me was talking to Aurora users

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.760
 or whoever and saying, "Why did you choose Postgres?" It's just like default.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.760
 Everyone else uses it. It's like, "Yeah, I mean, that's it, really."

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:25.760
 No one, most people's initial choice for a database is just ask a friend,

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.760
 use whatever the tutorial framework or thing you're using is, right?

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.760
 When I realized that was the criteria, I was like, "Okay, then, if we have something unique to offer this market,

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.760
 we should, because there's just so many people building there."

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:44.760
 We had to obviously convince ourselves we had something unique, but yeah, I think it's just the default for startups.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:52.760
 The thing is, we've seen from AI companies, and I think we'll probably talk more publicly alongside them soon,

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.760
 that one of the largest AI companies has migrated to the test now on planet scale,

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:06.760
 with a massive workload, because the AI companies that are taking off doesn't matter to them.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.760
 There's a religion that goes out the window. They're in a...

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.760
 They're death wrestling with Ogres to use this succession.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:19.760
 But they're all fighting each other on models and GPUs and trying to get GPU capacity and trying to do all of these things.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:25.760
 Why solve database problems alongside that when it's an undifferentiated problem that another company has fixed?

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:32.760
 So at the bottom end, yes, lots of AI companies are migrating and wanting to move to our Postgres product,

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.760
 because they just use it anyway.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:42.760
 And then at the upper end, because we're this database that's been powering very large consumer products for a long time,

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.760
 they now are consumer products, right? They have to just be online, up.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:54.760
 And one of the AI companies that's migrated to us is powering just a ton of real consumer usage

00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:00.760
 that's nothing really to do with the model or whatever, but it's just like we have a ton of users now

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.760
 and we create a lot of rights.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.760
 The thing that's very different about the AI companies is their right volume is significantly higher

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.760
 and of different proportions than traditional OLTP workloads, because they're doing chats.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.760
 Yeah, they're storing what the user asks for, what the model talks about, what comes back.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.760
 You just want to keep everything and in a relational database where it can take a lot of rights,

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.760
 which is a really good place to store to do that.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.760
 So yeah.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.760
 Yeah, that's right. I never thought about it. I guess it's inverted.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:34.760
 I'm assuming people don't read. It's like each user's generating a ton of data and they're probably not reading it all the time.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.760
 Invert of the normal workload.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:42.760
 Yeah, which if you compare that to big consumer OLTP workloads like Twitter, for example, one tweet,

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.760
 it's like a single insert that fans out to millions of reads potentially.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:55.760
 GitHub's the same. You read or generate a read on GitHub way more than you do actually write something.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.760
 And so most OLTP workloads are a hundred to one, maybe even a thousand to one.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.760
 That's complete opposite for certain AI companies.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.760
 Yeah. I mean, this reminds you another thing I think about a lot,

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:12.760
 which is if I kind of just step back and look at how easy this stuff has gotten as a good end developer,

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:18.760
 I remember back in the day, you know, we had to like, we like ran up our own Cassandra clusters and maintain that ourselves.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:24.760
 And it's hilarious how like that's not something I would even ever probably in the rest of my life,

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:30.760
 even come close to thinking like forget, even there's a side of maintaining my own self hosting this stuff.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.760
 There's also like even going to those technologies.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:43.760
 Like even that has has gone away where, you know, stuff like plans to kind of handle a pretty wide range of workloads without needing like specialized tools.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:50.760
 So yeah, it's crazy how the database part of applications has just gotten really, really boring and visible.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.760
 Which is good. Yeah.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.760
 Like you said, you're right. Like database problems can just interrupt anything your company's doing.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.760
 Like you have outages, but even then if you wake up in the morning and last night's backup didn't complete,

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.760
 you can't do anything else that day.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.760
 Like no matter what you had planned, if you have an issue now, you could ruin your business.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:15.760
 And so like those things not happening is, you know, I wish more people that had to actually do it.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.760
 And they would understand that was actually a lot of the debates I would have for people on Postgres.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:31.760
 Arguing with me, I realized they've never hosted a Postgres cluster. And I used to ask people like talk to me through an online version upgrade for Postgres and they could never thought about how to do it.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.760
 And you kind of realize that these are just problems like one of our issues now.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.760
 And it's a nice issue to have so many people asking to migrate.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.760
 And then I'm not quite sure how they would do it online. They have to like plan a multi step process.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.760
 So we're doing a lot of kind of education to help people understand how to do that.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.760
 That's going well, but it's still not easy. It's not just any of this database stuff. It's not easy and people find it very scary.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.760
 And so they should, you know, you can do some real damage.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.760
 Yeah.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:04.760
 So what's your guys goal? Like you kind of become like an IPL. That's the path that you're headed down.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.760
 No, I really don't. You know, I don't think that far ahead.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.760
 I always feel like you just have to earn thinking about these things, right?

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:19.760
 So I just don't success and what my definition of success is far off.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.760
 And it's a daily grind of working really hard to get there.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:29.760
 There's a lot of people that fantasize about that, that end and that exit.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.760
 And I can tell you that it's more of a side effect of everything else.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.760
 Yeah.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.760
 Yeah, it truly is. Like it's the people that don't focus on that, that just focus with what they love.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.760
 End up accidentally building the best companies.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.760
 Yeah, I just don't think about the end. The end is going to be always bittersweet.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.760
 Yeah.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.760
 No matter what happens, whether you get bought with the IPO and we're far off the goals I have for the company.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:26:01.760
 So I don't think about it, but I just, you know, being a profitable company that is now exceeding all of our financial targets

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.760
 is a very powerful position.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.760
 I mean, we have competition all around now in the Postgres world.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.760
 We just have to wait.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.760
 I mean, every customer they get shortens their runway.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:18.760
 If we never sold another dollar of software, we would still not run out of money.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.760
 And so that's extremely strategic.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:30.760
 Like it's just very, people have to now just, you see companies like throwing away tons of brand equity to just chase vibe coding.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:36.760
 Now there's nothing wrong with Minecraft. There's truly nothing wrong, but there's catching these tailwinds and it feels extremely exciting.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:45.760
 But at the end of the day, you've got to truly capitalize on that and inverting a heavily negative gross margin business in that world is an almost impossible feat.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:53.760
 If we are positive gross, some positive gross margin business that builds for really large customers that stay stick around and are happy,

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.760
 strategically, that's something that's really powerful and will build a great company.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.760
 So we just keep doing that over and over again and see what options come up basically.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.760
 Yeah, I guess to phrase my question another way.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:10.760
 Like is when you think about your goals or your dreams or the company, is it that like every single database workload is running on plan scale?

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.760
 Like that's the hope you have.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:25.760
 I find all of the things that make me the happiest when it comes to things that happen at the company is when products I like or that lots of people like run on the platform.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.760
 Yeah, that's really fun.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.760
 It's extremely fun.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.760
 I mean, every day I pay for coffee, I know that it's hitting a plan scale database.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.760
 You know, every message I send, you know, it's just, it's really fun.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.760
 I mean, it's just really cool.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.760
 And there's like companies like WAP, right?

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.760
 Have you seen WAP?

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.760
 This is New York company.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:53.760
 They're doing a kind of, I guess it's like a Shopify for the world of creators and they're just absolutely crushing it and they've paid out billions of dollars.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760
 Yeah.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.760
 Yeah, they're just a phenomenal company.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:01.760
 And I feel so inspired when I like work with them and go and see them and work at their office.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.760
 And it's just like so cool to be seeing their journey and seeing them grow.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.760
 And like little moments, like, you know, kick.com runs on plan scale.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:19.760
 And I remember them signing up at the beginning of them developing their app and had a small, like, small, tiny database and now are like a good size.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.760
 And then they have a Formula One car and you're looking at it.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.760
 And you're like, yeah, you just, you just like, these are really satisfied.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.760
 It's a really good feeling.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.760
 You know, I want to keep going and going and going.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.760
 And to me, it's also the trust, right?

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:36.760
 Someone looks at you and says, yeah, this is a real, we have a real company, we're a public company that's running on your platform and they trust you to do it.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.760
 To me, that's like the best.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.760
 And it fast exceeds any kind of money, monetary goals.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:48.760
 Sometimes when I look through our, like, customer list and I kind of like visit their website and see what, what they're about.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.760
 The other feeling I get is you get a sense of how big the world is.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:59.760
 Like you just see all these companies doing all these things that you'd never even heard of or would think of.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.760
 And there's like, you imagine how there's like a team of like the people in office and they think about this stuff every day.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.760
 And yeah, you just feel really connected with how large the world really is.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.760
 Really good feeling.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:17.760
 Yes, we have a few companies that, yeah, like, I just can't believe how much generate like how much database workloads they generate for the things they do.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.760
 And they might be in other countries and markets and products that I've never thought about for myself.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.760
 And it's just really fun to kind of see that.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.760
 Because otherwise you're kind of like in a bubble.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.760
 But like when you see that, you realize how big the world actually is.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.760
 I know the service at Blizzard that uses Vitez.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.760
 So when you load Call of Duty, I see that service load and I know it's loading.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.760
 Yeah, that's fun.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:47.760
 It's just very, like, that's just very cool. I'll never not be cool to me.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.760
 And like going and visiting their headquarters and seeing, yeah, I was a wow player for forever.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:58.760
 And you're just like, okay, well, now I'm visiting Blizzard, a actual customer of the company that I'm running.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.760
 It's just you get these pinch me moments.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.760
 So amazing.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.760
 So I wasn't going to go back a little bit.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.760
 You were talking about the vibe coding thing.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:11.760
 So obviously there is a trend, I'll call it right now, where there is a bunch of companies.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:17.760
 A bunch of companies building platforms help people build apps from zero to one and you know, deploy them.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.760
 And that obviously includes a database.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.760
 And it's kind of a rush to like, try to be the company that powers these things.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.760
 Yeah, I'd love to hear a little bit more about how you think about that.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:31.760
 So I'll say, I'll tell you my perspective first, which is, I don't know whether this trend is valuable or not.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.760
 So I'm not going to ignore that part of it.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.760
 It's a take for granted that, you know, this problem needs to be solved and it's worth solving.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:52.760
 The approach right now has been, at least that it seems like, has been a spin up like real instances of infrastructure for each one of these services.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:31:00.760
 To me, that feels like fundamentally the wrong approach because this is more like a millions of apps that get like very little traffic each.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.760
 And that model just doesn't seem to make sense.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.760
 But yeah, I am because of your thoughts.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.760
 Before I answer, I also do the same caveat, which is I love AI.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:14.760
 We're very large users of AI and very serious users of AI tools and we have very serious AI customers.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.760
 And I code using AI.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.760
 Yeah, it's fine.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.760
 Constantly.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.760
 It's amazing.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.760
 I mean, I love, I love being in the eras.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.760
 I saw someone use the term of like plastic software.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.760
 I think it's really cool.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.760
 Like an app that you only need for a month, right?

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.760
 So you just like make it really quickly.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:39.760
 And like, you know, I've got a few of them on the go right now, like a dashboard that I wanted to build, right?

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.760
 That just connects into our metrics cluster, pulls a load of things.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.760
 You get like something interactive and fun, right?

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.760
 You're just like vibe coding that stuff up.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.760
 And it's really good.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.760
 The stuff with cursor is incredible in Slack where you can just go fix this, please.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.760
 And it does it.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.760
 It's just like mind blowing to me.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:32:00.760
 It's like real actual like magical bicycle of the mind level kind of like these computer moments that you remember the rest of your life.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:07.760
 So I think it that sort of cool convex has a vibe cutting product with chef and that is doing incredible things.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:17.760
 And the primitive they built into our product make that stuff really easy and making those situated plastic apps really easy to use.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:23.760
 I do that, but I do have an answering your question about like whether these, the infrastructure is right.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.760
 I do think there's like a lot of usage that's just going to go away eventually, right?

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:37.760
 Like there's a max, like we've had things like square space, retool, all of these kind of tools that have allowed you to simplify automation or just simplify website building and all those things.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.760
 And then you just realize that people don't have that many problems or ideas.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.760
 Like automation has in no way been deployed at the level it could have been.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.760
 Most people don't want to, most of the people aren't creative.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.760
 Like you put people in front of chat GBT and they don't know what to ask.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.760
 It's the same with Google.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:58.760
 You ask someone to Google, like who's been an internet user for years, they're just very naive kind of, we've had our fingertips on this stuff.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:04.760
 So I just, you know, these companies that are growing very quickly, they're also churning through customers very quickly, right?

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:11.760
 They go through people trying it out for a month and the next cohort comes in and, you know, people just like fuck around and whatever.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.760
 They are using databases to do this, which obviously you would do.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:23.760
 The thing I don't understand and I was in this position when I saw a lot of like dedicated vector databases or, you know, other technologies.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:27.760
 It doesn't quite gel for me why it wouldn't just be SQLite that you would use, right?

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:33.760
 And people don't understand the difference between a database server and a database engine and what they do.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:43.760
 Database services servers contain an engine, but they do a significant more things with the assumption of like a multi-tenancy case, so more than one client, right?

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:57.760
 And the work for those that don't understand how these things work, I will tell you that it's probably often two to three times more code problems bugs are associated with the server part than the engine part, right?

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.760
 In fact, the engine part can be much, much simpler.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:14.760
 And it's because of things like MVCC, multi-version concurrency control, like making sure that when you're writing to the database, it doesn't clash with me writing to the database, making sure that both connections are terminated to that database that authentication happens and all of those things.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.760
 It's all just to assume more than one user.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.760
 These AI apps don't need that.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:27.760
 So all of the things that come with a server, even if that server can scale to zero, it is still a useless overhead.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.760
 And I don't understand why you couldn't just embed SQLite databases everywhere for doing this.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.760
 Like, we already have.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.760
 And I think a lot of people are probably coming to that conclusion too.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.760
 It seems to be the common take.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.760
 But who knows, I've been wrong about loads of things.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.760
 You know, I also have biases.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.760
 So, I mean, I can't just be completely wrong.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.760
 It's also funny because people have been bringing up SQLite forever.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:56.760
 And this is like the one time where, hey, like, it actually is a good thing to bring up, but nobody seems to be.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.760
 Seems to be really exploring that path.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:07.760
 Yeah, there's two things that are obfuscate anything in tech, which is, if you're giving things away for free, that's just impossible to even judge then.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.760
 You know, I still get picked up even more on Postgres, but I still get 10 plus emails a day.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.760
 Why don't you have a free tail or these sorts of things?

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.760
 It really shows you.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:23.760
 If you could imagine every single one of them would be on your product and would still would never pay you money, it would change a lot of the metrics that you could share.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.760
 Right?

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:35.760
 When you're offering free computers or basically giving $3 away for $1 on the internet, you're going to just attract a ton of usage, which is fine.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:41.760
 So that's one thing I think maybe that because there's people giving away those hosted databases for free.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.760
 Essentially, they're using that instead of SQLite or whatever.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.760
 And because it's already built into the product.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.760
 Yeah.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.760
 And then just the hype cycle of their marketing budgets is paired with that.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.760
 You just can't really tell.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.760
 Yeah.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.760
 Yeah, I mean, SQLite on the server, I think, is a bad idea.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.760
 But embedded, it's a phenomenal database.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.760
 I've used it.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.760
 I've got so many SQLite databases because of that usage at all.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.760
 I'm not trying to build a server for it.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.760
 And then everything else is really simple.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.760
 I think it will win out in that way.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:14.760
 But it will not change that SQLite winning in that world will not change the balance sheet of any particular company.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:21.760
 SQLite is an incredible open source project that is good as it is and is perfect for these use case now.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.760
 Yeah.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:30.760
 The giving away money is a funny thing because the way I see it is there are cases where it works really well, right?

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.760
 Like subsidizing something.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.760
 In all of those cases, there's some kind of network effect involved.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:38.760
 So if you take the classic example of Uber, yeah, they subsidize the hell out of that stuff.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:44.760
 But the end result that they get to walk away with is a gigantic network of drivers and all of that stuff.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.760
 Yeah.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:51.760
 So once that's bootstrapped, it's impossible to really compete with them.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:59.760
 I think people take see that and they kind of apply it to everything where subsidizing a large user base for a dev tool product.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.760
 Once you stop doing that, they can just leave because there's no like there's nothing tangible.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.760
 There's no network thing that you've built up.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:13.760
 And to me, there's like so really obvious and basic, but it just keeps happening.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:27.760
 And it's happening now with the AI stuff as well because you're starting to see is a very old lesson, which is if you're a business and you have a cost, and you pay a certain way, and you're charging your customers in a way that doesn't match that.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.760
 That's just not going to work.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.760
 Like eventually it's going to be something that's not sustainable.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:41.760
 And you're seeing that with the companies now where they give some kind of like fixed price monthly thing, but then their costs are user based.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.760
 And they're going to have to have to deal with that.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:52.760
 And again, these are like productivity products or not like network social networks or like marketplace type businesses.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.760
 But yeah, like we've seen so many iterate or I've seen so many iterations of this now.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.760
 Keeps happening.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:06.760
 That was the thing that was very surprising when we were looking at other database companies that I was learning from their customers that their bill wasn't based on usage.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:11.760
 It was built based on how many projects they'd set up or whatever.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:21.760
 And I was like, that's a very, that's the very unusual profile for database companies to have in terms of revenue, ours is purely, purely usage based.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:28.760
 Like there's, there's people paying us north of a million dollars a year and they have three, three accounts.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.760
 Like they just have three administrators for that database that just access it.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:40.760
 So it's completely inverse to other database companies that are kind of caught up in this AI hype, which is like extreme user growth.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.760
 And then no monetization of any particular growth.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:50.760
 And that, that, I mean, the whole world could shift, but there's a really good, it's got a sub stack post.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.760
 I think it's like enterprise businesses are fat tailed.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:58.760
 People don't understand that like this is in extreme power law to everything in tech, especially revenue.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:06.760
 And if you're trying to get to $500 million of revenue, you need some huge building blocks to do that.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.760
 You can't just sell $29 projects that have a database as part of it.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.760
 That doesn't work.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:19.760
 You need, you need certain people paying you a lot of money for a lot of consumption that they cannot move from.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:25.760
 Like they, like it would have, you know, the reason people migrate when people change free tiers and stuff is because they don't have problems.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:31.760
 They don't, if they're not like, if it's not going to interrupt or paying customer of theirs, it doesn't matter.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.760
 You know, this is really interesting.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.760
 That's not kind of another interesting thing we've seen from this post gets launched.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:43.760
 So I've got so many people and I've been giving them access to their on other providers and haven't launched their product yet.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.760
 So they're like, please let us in before we launch next week so we can move.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.760
 I'm doing that because it's, it's the second someone, like someone depends on your service.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:56.760
 That move is that orders of magnitude harder. It's like just letting those people have access so they can not have that problem in the future.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:01.760
 This has been very interesting to understand a bit more closely how certain companies are being built.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.760
 It's very interesting.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.760
 Yeah. I mean, the rules are actually really simple.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.760
 It's just build a product where no one has to eject from.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.760
 Your customers shouldn't have to eject from it.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.760
 And then charge them in a way that matches your costs.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.760
 And if you do both of those things, you're fine, but weirdly it's rare.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.760
 Yeah. I mean, the retention numbers of databases that don't let you down are very high.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.760
 It turns out, you know, like very, very high.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.760
 You people just don't take the risk after that.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.760
 That's happening, which is really nice.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.760
 I mean, that was another thing that I was reflecting on when you guys launched a Postgres stuff.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:38.760
 Just the response is so funny. It's just like, oh, yeah, like, of course I'm going to use this.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.760
 Or like finally, or like everyone's really excited and you don't really have to.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.760
 It's not like you have to go out there and be like, use us.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.760
 It's very reliable.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.760
 You don't have to really say any of that.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.760
 It's already understood that, you know, if you guys do something,

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.760
 there's going to be certain characteristics that are going to come with that.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.760
 And that's kind of assumed and everyone trusts that's going to happen.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.760
 And it's such a good position to be in brand wise.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.760
 You guys have an actual brand.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.760
 So having a brand means like people see your name on it and they know certain things about your product.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.760
 That was the craziest thing to me.

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.760
 I said a huge thank you to our marketing team for achieving this,

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.760
 which is people really got it.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.760
 Like they heard the two words next to each other and they knew what it meant.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.760
 And I was really surprised.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.760
 I truly was like, wow, people like really we are synonymous with these qualities

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.760
 and are the only qualities I care about for a database.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.760
 And I was like really proud of that.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.760
 Like, it was just awesome actually.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.760
 Yeah, that was real weird actually to see that.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.760
 And I also thought, I would have spent the week with people going,

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:50.760
 you said you don't like Postgres like you're a hater.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.760
 One, that's just not true.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.760
 And two, no one's really saying it.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.760
 They're like, oh cool, like you're going to come and do this thing in the Postgres world.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.760
 There's a space for that.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.760
 So we're really happy to see it.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:01.760
 So that was nice.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.760
 And yeah, we've done a lot of hiring since that launch.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.760
 There's people from Postgres companies that are like notable people in the Postgres world

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.760
 are joining the company, which is nice to see too.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.760
 It's really cool.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.760
 Yeah.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.760
 Yeah, I think that's a good lesson that people just take away.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.760
 Because it's not like you guys built that brand overnight.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:23.760
 It's not like you did a few things or spent money in a few places that achieved that.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.760
 Like, that's a goal of every company.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.760
 Like, not every company has a brand.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.760
 But if you do have a brand, it's like a ridiculous advantage.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.760
 And it's built slowly every single day over years.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.760
 And it doesn't really look like anything until all of a sudden,

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.760
 it does in moments like these.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:45.760
 And I think companies feel like it seemed to think it's like if I spend the right amount

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.760
 of money with the right design agency and I have the right name.

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:54.760
 And there's short-term things that you can do that look like you're building a brand.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.760
 But it's all just sugar.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.760
 It's just this slow, long-term thing.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.760
 Like everything else with startups.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.760
 But this one, especially so.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.760
 Yeah.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.760
 And it takes a very long time in databases.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.760
 We just have to grind through winning trust with people over and over again.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.760
 Like, they're already on Amazon even if they're unhappy.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.760
 Like, we don't get fired for trust in Amazon.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.760
 I mean, you know, that's done.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.760
 And yeah, so yeah, it just takes forever.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.760
 And I think people really try and get quick hits and ruin really good brands.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.760
 Like a lot of the companies are getting trolled right now for their lack of reliability.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:32.760
 Like, they could have avoided that by just not saying they were highly scalable

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.760
 or infinite or bottom.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:40.760
 You know, all these words that like don't really, like if you say them and someone finds out

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.760
 very quickly, they're not true.

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.760
 And then shares that that's not true.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.760
 It's really negative for your brand, like really negative.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.760
 And so you have to not do that.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.760
 And the reason we share so much about our customers is because it's like,

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.760
 it gives you that shine of, you know, their brand trusts your brand.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.760
 So that is additive to everyone, which is really nice.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.760
 Yeah, a lot of this stuff always ends up feeling to me like,

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.760
 it's this slow process of continuously not doing the wrong thing.

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.760
 Every single day versus like explicitly doing stuff, right?

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.760
 It's more just like, there's all these wrong things that are easy to do.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.760
 And if you don't do them long enough, then it works out.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:21.760
 Yeah.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.760
 Yeah, I just feel like there's like traps everywhere.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.760
 And you kind of over time understand how to avoid them.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.760
 Yeah, yeah, you're right.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.760
 And I was thinking actually, could we have done Postgres sooner?

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.760
 And I'm certain the answer still no.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.760
 Like I'm truly certain the answer still no, because it would have been a distraction.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.760
 We hadn't earned the right to go and do that yet.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.760
 All of those things, like it just infrastructure tech companies take way longer

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.760
 than people realize, like way, way, way longer than people realize.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:53.760
 In fact, the ones that grow rapidly at the beginning are really like often

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.760
 selling infrastructure, you know?

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.760
 And so, yeah, you built like a snowflake.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.760
 I mean, if you look at, it took forever to build that.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.760
 And then it goes off like a rocket, right?

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:09.760
 But until that day, it's really, I mean, even look at Figma, right?

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.760
 They had lots of small flat rounds at the beginning of their company

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:16.760
 because they were just figuring out how to do like efficient CRDTs in the browser, right?

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:20.760
 Like that's just until that was, that technical hurdle was cleared.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.760
 The downstream product was not going to be anywhere.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.760
 And then it goes off until you've done that really hard, deliberate work,

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.760
 then it's just not going to, it's a technical operation.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:34.760
 That's why why venture capital can be extremely positive for deeply technical businesses.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.760
 Like I was like, you know, it couldn't be profitable at the gate when you're trying

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.760
 to build something that's deeply technical.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.760
 But then when you get to that point, it's very, very beneficial.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.760
 I think I try to tell people is like when I see people starting new companies and stuff,

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:51.760
 I always ask them like, are you really, does something you want to do for like at least 10 years?

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.760
 Because it's not going to be fast.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.760
 There's stories of things happening fast.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.760
 But for you, it's probably going to be 10 years minimum.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:03.760
 And is this really, are you excited to give up that amount of your life focus on this thing?

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.760
 Because that is what it takes.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:12.760
 I have reoccurring nightmare, but like I do investing, you know, now and then just like

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:16.760
 cut people a check now and then, and you know, some of them have paid off.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:20.760
 I have this nightmare that one pays off extremely well.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.760
 And then I like don't want to do stuff in the future.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.760
 Like it makes me somehow lazy.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:29.760
 I'll tell you this, which is I worked at GitHub.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.760
 We sold to Microsoft.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.760
 That was financially lucrative for a lot of people.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.760
 And it came with like extreme sadness for me.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.760
 I think it was one of the greatest companies of all time.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:45.760
 And, you know, a lot of my friends I made there and like, you know, some of the people

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:49.760
 I'm closest to in the world that I see every single week and go for drinks and be hanging

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.760
 out, you know.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:55.760
 And you look back and it's like, every thing we winged about, every problem we complained

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.760
 about was just ridiculous.

00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.760
 We were 27 years old at one of the greatest companies of all time, the world of software

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.760
 development.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.760
 And I regret every second.

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.760
 I didn't just breathe all of that in and just enjoy it.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760
 Because that's your life.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.760
 It's what you get to do.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.760
 I fear it ending.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.760
 When people like joke about an exit or whatever, I get really snappy about it.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.760
 I get really snappy because I'm like, yeah, okay, you'll be like rich or whatever.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.760
 And for us everyone is already rich.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.760
 And so you're just like, but then it's over.

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.760
 And then it's like, what do you do next?

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.760
 You just, you know, buy watches or whatever.

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:30.760
 You know, seriously.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.760
 You guys start over.

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:32.760
 Yeah.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.760
 Everyone who knows me truly knows I will be at work when I die.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.760
 Like that is just, do you know what I mean?

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.760
 Like, I want, I love working.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.760
 I work every day of my life.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.760
 And I just, it's the best.

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.760
 I like, I like doing that stuff.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.760
 It happens to be symbiotic with making money.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:57.760
 But, you know, I know so many rich people that have done nothing in their lives.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.760
 I don't respect them.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.760
 I don't want their opinions.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.760
 I don't care about them.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.760
 And they'll, they have tons of money.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.760
 And they'll realize long ago that there's no correlation between wealth, skill or intelligence.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:10.760
 And so now I get to work with people whose skill and intelligence I respect.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:13.760
 I want to do that for as long as possible, basically.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.760
 Yeah.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.760
 I really resonate with how you describe it as like bittersweet or sad.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.760
 Because I remember early in my career, obviously like, you know, an acquisition.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:22.760
 That's like the dream.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.760
 Like, oh my God, I hope one day I get acquired.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:29.760
 And then as you start to get more successful and those options start to show up, you realize

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:35.080
 that the day you say yes to that is a day where every dream you had of the future of what

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.760
 this thing could be is over.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.760
 Yep.

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.760
 And that's such a sad feeling.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:44.760
 It's like so negative that it overwhelms whatever, you know, financial portion of it is.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.760
 And I never, like this, this seems crazy to me.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.760
 It's supposed to be crazy to me.

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:55.200
 But like when I was first starting, I remember I would see like companies that blew up and

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.760
 got crazy acquisition offers and they said no to like several billion dollars.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.760
 But they thought guys so stupid, like, what is he thinking?

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.040
 But now I get it.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:06.120
 It's like, yeah, and then what like everything you wanted that you were hoping for, things

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.840
 that you wanted to do, you don't get to anymore.

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.840
 Yeah.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.360
 That's kind of what overrides everything.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.360
 Absolutely.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.360
 Yeah.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.000
 And I mean, and like if you're going to take it to the logical extreme, like why aren't

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.040
 you working on things that make even more money?

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.040
 Like go for it.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.040
 You know what I mean?

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.040
 Just like work on it.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.040
 Yeah.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.040
 But seriously, like why are you?

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.040
 What?

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.040
 What dumb midpoint?

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.040
 Like you're okay.

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:31.080
 You don't know me, like the middle of the, like if you're not making, if you just care

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:35.680
 about money, go and make extreme amounts of money doing something insanely boring.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.600
 If you want to do something that's purely creative, then why even kind of intertwine

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:40.600
 money with those two things?

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.600
 I like both.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:45.400
 I like the sport of building a business in a market that's highly technical.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:50.600
 I mean, I've, before I came to Planet scale, before I've been doing this, I would get offers

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:55.120
 all the time to like be the VP engineering or CTO a sure thing come, but like a, like a,

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:59.440
 just a sure thing with like, with an equity offer, it's like, yeah, I'll make a hundred

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:03.480
 million dollars or something from that company if they IPO at like the last valuation or

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.480
 whatever.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.480
 Yeah.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.320
 And you're just, basically the product just does nothing for me.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.640
 It was just so boring.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:12.040
 I just wouldn't go to sleep excited for the next day.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:17.120
 You just be grinding through it, you know, and that's not what being alive is about.

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.880
 I'm sure people are seeing this or like probably think we sound crazy, but it's just one of

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:26.080
 these things where when you get a taste of everything probably aligning in this way,

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.360
 it just, there's no going back and you kind of get addicted to it.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.360
 Yes.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.360
 Yeah.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.360
 I mean, and of course, like you realize that when you do have money, right?

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:38.280
 So it's like, okay, well, you know, it does, there's a, there's a level of like earning

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:43.160
 that you do that kind of makes you feel very safe and that's a completely different feeling.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:47.640
 And then you get those, you get the option to go and want to work on things that you love.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.760
 And that's, that's really nice.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.720
 But there's this kind of person that gets a lot of money and was never that passionate.

00:50:54.720 --> 00:51:00.160
 And now they just have time and money and they just do all of the standard boring, rich

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.160
 people things.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.160
 Right.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:05.560
 And it just looks so boring to me, you know, it just doesn't look fun.

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.560
 Yeah.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.280
 I like do the things I did when I was young.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:12.200
 That was it, you know, like a good friend of mine is very successful.

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:16.080
 You still just code and does video games because I was like, well, he always like, you know,

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:20.680
 why, why do people suddenly like make a ton of money and start getting into just very

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.240
 generic rich people that I just don't understand that.

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.400
 Yeah, it is funny.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.640
 I always, I mean, on the same way as you, like, I know I'm going to like diet work as well.

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:32.640
 But, you know, I actually think, I think that was all the time because I've seen so many

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:38.480
 personal situations where people retire and their health just like the tear rates and their

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:39.480
 brain deteriorates.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:43.900
 And then, yeah, I've seen it in such crazy ways where I feel like they've, I think they

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.440
 literally died because they were tired, you know?

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.440
 Yeah.

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.800
 So yeah, it's kind of like a, it's kind of like a sickness in a way.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:50.800
 Yeah.

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:51.800
 People's like brains go to mush.

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:52.800
 They've seen this.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.800
 One of the blue zones, I think the, there's a blue zone in like, is it Okinawa, somewhere

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:57.800
 in Japan?

00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:58.800
 Mm hmm.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:03.560
 And I believe like one of the accepted reasons that people live so long is that it's traditional

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.560
 for the grandparents that they take care of their grandchildren.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:07.560
 Mm hmm.

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.560
 I see.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:14.120
 I see a connection and purpose and a reason to live that they're just like happy and have

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:18.040
 purpose and then it helps them stick around.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.040
 It's kind of wild.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.040
 Yeah.

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.640
 And I just like, I was, the thing that I find really nice now is helping younger people

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.080
 that are building companies.

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.440
 I always tell them not to listen to me and don't really try and get anything that I've

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.720
 done because I don't feel like I've ever been successful yet, right?

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:37.120
 Like until you build something really incredible that meets what I want to build and I don't

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.520
 feel that successful, but helping people kind of short-circuit some of the standard

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.400
 issues that you run into and the mistakes that you make.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.600
 And I've made tons of mistakes.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:49.240
 Like if you could just, you ask everyone five years, if you, if you listen to this, you know,

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:52.680
 anyone that's running a company five years in what they would do differently, it would

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:53.680
 be nearly everything.

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.680
 Right.

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:55.680
 Yeah.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.680
 Right.

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:57.680
 You just make mistakes.

00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:58.680
 Like there's no playbook for what you do.

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.560
 People like to think they're, they really think there's templates, but when you study the

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:05.800
 great companies, they're all off of, they don't run on a standard template.

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:09.800
 That's a weird, widening path to get to where they are, but like, yeah, just like helping

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:14.440
 people through the undifferentiated things is like very, very satisfying.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:19.120
 And it's also why people should always back second time founders because it's truly, truly.

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.160
 You just learn so much the first time.

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.160
 Yeah.

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:25.320
 I mean, I feel like I've had to make every mistake like three times before I really,

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:30.200
 I really understood one of the hardest of all is just constant temptation.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.200
 Yeah, it's crazy.

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.400
 So many different opportunities have come in in the last week.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:38.640
 And it's just like, okay, we have to stick to the fundamentals of the things we do very

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:44.200
 well, not get, you know, and just, it's like that truly, like a marathon run of just like

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.160
 a constant pace.

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:49.840
 And I actually think that's the most unfair things we can do to our competitors is that

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.280
 you haven't really seen a lull in shipping from Planet Skate.

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:57.080
 Like we have just, just like a, like a marching drumbeat of pace.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:02.280
 Like everyone can pull off a sprint to rush some shit out in a quarter and then like everyone's

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.400
 like exhausted and dying.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:09.080
 If you can just constantly march at a pace that just no one else can keep up with, it's

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.680
 really unfair to folks.

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.280
 And so it's like long game playing.

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.280
 Yeah.

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.280
 Yeah.

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.280
 The, the temptation thing is funny because it kind of goes back to what I was saying about

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:19.160
 there's just traps everywhere and it's just about like avoiding them.

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:24.720
 I, you know, when I was younger, I imagined building a business was like, uh, like your

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:29.000
 desk we're looking for some opportunity and like you just can't find it and you're hoping

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.200
 the opportunity shows up one day.

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.120
 As you get a little bit more successful, it's actually the inverse problem.

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:39.220
 There's just a million awesome looking opportunities all the time, but they're hiding the better

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:40.220
 opportunity.

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:42.600
 That's like a little, a little harder to see.

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:47.920
 So yeah, it just feels like every day it's just about saying no to pretty great options

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.680
 really, um, having to focus on that.

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:53.640
 And yeah, it just takes so much experience to even recognize what, what those things

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.640
 look like.

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:55.640
 Yep.

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:56.640
 Absolutely.

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.160
 I can remember in the early days of GitHub, a very, very large company, open, had an

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.760
 open tech book to do, like do a certain type of GitHub deployment.

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:05.000
 There would have been a one on one for them and it would have been a nightmare.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.640
 And it was just so much money.

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.640
 Yeah.

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:08.640
 Yeah.

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.640
 Exactly.

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.680
 And, and at the time it's just like, wow, that seems a bit, but if you'd have done that,

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.680
 it throws you off course.

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.680
 Same with us right there.

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.680
 We get asked continually to just do a purely on-prem version of Planet scale.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.480
 We've been asked so many times with people that would pay extreme, like at certain time,

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.480
 like it would never have happened now, but like at that time would have like potentially

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:28.960
 doubled our revenue at the time that we were being asked to do it and it gets really tempting.

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:33.920
 And I remember all of the experience I had from other companies that showed me not to

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:38.000
 do that, but it's that quick temptation, especially if you're not profitable.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.640
 This is the, this is where those kind of like, that kind of knowing your cash out date, right?

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:49.040
 And, you know, for those that don't know what that means, like if you, any of your vendors,

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:54.640
 anyone is not profitable, that means the CEO and executive team and the board know the

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:57.380
 exact date where the business is finished.

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:02.120
 Like there is a date in the future that's calculicable where it, there's no more money

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.120
 in the bank.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:05.600
 Just the costs will overlap what's left.

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:11.160
 That is a feeling that is very difficult and very hard and it makes you act weird.

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:16.080
 And so when we, when we released the first version of metal, the must, the test version,

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:22.320
 we were going to try and get it out in beta before reinvent because reinvent is a big conference,

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.880
 a massive conference actually.

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:29.840
 If you've not been to reinvent, you should just to sort of confront how large the commercial

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:30.840
 side of it.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:31.840
 It's crazy.

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:32.840
 Yeah.

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:33.840
 Yeah.

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:34.840
 Yeah.

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:35.840
 Yeah.

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.840
 Yeah.

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:37.840
 Software engineers don't understand.

00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:38.840
 I don't think how large the commercial part of the industry is.

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.240
 It's a conference that could only happen in Vegas and it's across five hotels and.

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.240
 Yeah.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.240
 It's insane.

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.240
 Probably a billion dollars a marketing spend across the whole thing and that's been just

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.240
 ridiculous.

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.040
 Also, so anyway, so we were trying to rush it out for that.

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.880
 Instead, I've told that story, our customers were having problems with EBS, so we said

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.760
 to them, "Well, my great, you first actually."

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.480
 And that took an extra quarter to do that.

00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:02.680
 But that meant the announcement was so much better because it was like, "Real people use

00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.680
 this.

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.680
 It's real.

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:05.680
 It's GA today.

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.680
 It works."

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:11.600
 You know, if you were unprofitable and had 18 months of runway, you wouldn't do that.

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:12.600
 You couldn't.

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:17.080
 You'd have to get whatever crap out there to try and spend a load of marketing money to

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:22.440
 build pipeline to desperately try and get leads and have something to show the next

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:26.960
 investors to try and get your next hit to keep alive and keep going.

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:27.960
 That's rough.

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:33.460
 A lot of these AI valuations and raises that you're seeing are based on the fact that the

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.440
 growth they've seen is costing them so much money.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.600
 They have to raise to stay alive.

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.080
 It eats their runway.

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.080
 That's not great.

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.080
 Yeah.

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.680
 It's another aspect of this that I didn't understand early on.

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:49.040
 There's being smart and making good decisions.

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:52.720
 But so much of it is about protecting your own ability to even think clearly.

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:58.200
 So many things can just take a smart person and just have and start making horrible decisions.

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.960
 Just give it a situation they're in.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:06.400
 We talked constantly about, "Are we thinking clearly what's biasing us?"

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:13.960
 We avoid situations that have upsides but would impact our ability to assess the situation

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:14.960
 properly.

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:15.960
 Yeah.

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.640
 So I'm really paranoid about that.

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:22.240
 Am I getting involved with something that clouds my judgment?

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:24.560
 Because it doesn't matter how smart you are.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.560
 Nope.

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:26.560
 Anyone can.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:32.960
 There's times when you're very vulnerable to three bad things happening in a row.

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.280
 Just the temptation, you're sat there alone at two in the morning.

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:41.160
 You're thinking about the seriousness of what you've done and what you do.

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:49.080
 That's why you need people around you that will speak the truth, keep the Empress clothes

00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.080
 on.

00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:54.280
 This last thing before we hop off, I just remembered that you tweeted reminiscing about

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.560
 React the other day.

00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.560
 Yeah.

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:01.960
 So I spent a bunch of time with Erlang and Elixir and React was obviously like the God

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:02.960
 in that world.

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:07.480
 But yeah, we had a deployment where we were able to embed React inside all of our application

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:11.360
 nodes and pay clustered and all of data querying was effectively local.

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.400
 I was like, this is really awesome.

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.400
 But they died out, right?

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:15.880
 They kind of disappeared.

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.880
 Yeah.

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.480
 I mean, that's the way of most database companies, right?

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.760
 There's a lot of really niche things.

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:29.080
 But I have like, again, I have like a lot of nostalgia for some of the...

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:33.080
 There was an era where there was so much database experimentation, that was fun.

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.920
 Every new startup I would pick something different.

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.920
 Yeah, I agree.

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:39.960
 And there's like really cool stuff built by really, really talented people.

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:45.120
 It's like, if you like cars, right, you can appreciate the ones that are just incredible

00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:49.560
 powerhouses that everyone loves and they work and then whatever.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.320
 And then there's the weird niche ones that have tried something completely crazy.

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:54.240
 And you're like, that's fun and cool too.

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.240
 Like, you can...

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.240
 I love that about tech.

00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:02.240
 This is why I love convex because it's actually the most kind of modern and dynamic database

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:10.520
 I've seen that is actually extremely real and practical, has really serious users.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.640
 And they've kept everything else normal and it's being built by a team of people that...

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.480
 So it's the X Dropbox MySQL team.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.960
 They ran for like 15,000 MySQL nodes.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.040
 So they know that like these are people that I truly like respect.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.880
 Some of the folks that work with them actually work at plant scale, like we kind of everyone

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.880
 knows each other.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:33.220
 They've taken that underlying infrastructure knowledge and then built something incredibly

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.480
 dynamic and forward facing on top.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.240
 That to me is just, I love it.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:45.080
 Like I absolutely love that as a way of approaching the problem versus people who show up and

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:50.760
 go like we're the end of SQL or whatever and then like don't really do anything revolutionary

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:51.760
 in exchange.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.000
 convex is actually doing really revolutionary things while kind of sticking to the rules

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.060
 that physics is leaving us with for databases.

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.060
 So like stuff like that's really cool.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.060
 But yeah, like React.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:05.160
 It came from we were, we all went for like a dinner at one of my favorite restaurants

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.600
 the other night to kind of celebrate a bit and we were all sat around around table and

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.400
 then, you know, it was an extra chair.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.680
 So we moved the chair and we had to shuffle around the clock and so I was like, ah, and

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.480
 yeah, I just, I remembered it.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.760
 But yeah, there's like so many, so many fun.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:23.520
 There's still some that are going, you know, like that, like they were like the hot database

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:28.440
 of the day, but still like gained a user base and a ticking along really nicely.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.440
 Yeah.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.400
 Yeah, I just remember, I think me and Adam were talking about this where there was just

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.560
 a time where everything just felt a little bit more wild and things are still down now

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.880
 and there's like tried and true ways that make sense for most people.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.120
 But yeah, I do remember when like I was using like a different graph database every month

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.840
 and graph databases like blew up for a while.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.760
 But yeah, it was a good time and I'm glad I was able to kind of live through that.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.840
 Yeah, now all that kind of frenetic wildness seems to just be marketing budgets, which is

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.840
 kind of not.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:55.840
 Right.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:56.840
 That's fine.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.840
 I tweeted this.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.200
 I felt bad doing it, but I kind of, I've more gained more conviction, which is there was

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.920
 this era of tech where basically if you were an engineer, people engineers were very hostile

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.560
 to anyone that like wasn't an engineer who couldn't code and it was too extreme back

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.560
 then.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.000
 I actually think we've gone too far the other way now.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.480
 Yeah, I thought I'd say agree.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.480
 Yeah.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.560
 There's just people that are yapping 24/7 on Twitter that just don't know how computers

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.200
 work and have massive audiences.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.920
 And it's just like, you know what I mean?

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:22.920
 Yeah.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.920
 I mean, I'm fat.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.320
 Like I wouldn't just sit there as someone who can't run, go in.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.320
 Here's running tips.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.680
 Here's how you think about running and then get offended when someone is like, do you

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.680
 actually run?

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.680
 Yeah.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:36.680
 Right.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.680
 Exactly.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.680
 You can't say that.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:39.680
 I mean, that's really not.

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:43.680
 It's not really nice to say, you know, it's like, well, we're here to do software engineering.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.680
 You know what I mean?

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:48.120
 It's like, yeah, if you applied this to other industries, it would be.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120
 Absolutely nuts.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120
 You know?

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:53.280
 I mean, I do wonder though, like I wonder, cause I'm like, I'm so in our industry, but

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.320
 my people should be the same everywhere.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.000
 Like are there, are these same dynamics that exist in all industries?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.100
 And we just don't, don't see it.

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.600
 Like are there medical people that are just like talking shit?

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.600
 Yeah.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:05.600
 Like I have really hoped not.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.600
 No, I don't think they are.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.760
 I really don't think there's like doctors that are just like there for the vibes, you

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.120
 know, and just like, I hope so.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:17.560
 I truly hope we, I don't know, we will, we will, we will see, but yeah, like, I mean,

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.560
 maybe that will change.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.560
 I don't know.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.600
 It's definitely been a weird one to watch the industries in a very strange place right

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.600
 now.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.160
 Well, thanks for joining me today.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.680
 This was a good conversation.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.840
 Thank you for having me.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.080
 Excited for you and your team and landscape Postgres.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.600
 I always see pictures of your office.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.600
 It looks really nice.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.360
 I'll swing by at some point when some traveling.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.360
 Yeah.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.000
 Come through, come and work from the office while you're here.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
 Like people do that.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.840
 It's really, you know, it's nice to have people stop in.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:46.200
 It's nice to have a physical location that people come to.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.760
 We had this like really fun party the other night that we would just invite people to

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:54.080
 come and migrate and just like being here at midnight watching people just migrating

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.680
 their databases to plan scale while we were like hanging out drinking and listening to

01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:58.680
 music.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.680
 It was just really fun.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.680
 Like really enjoyable.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.240
 That's good for that, you know.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.040
 Yeah, that's the stuff I miss.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.040
 I miss.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.160
 I wish that I, that's what I'm jealous of.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.800
 Like, it's fun to have those things just happening randomly on a weekly basis.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.800
 Yes.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.240
 People can actually, you know, like pretty much every day of the week in this town there's

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:22.640
 three events you could, you could go to and there's interesting people everywhere.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:26.280
 There's then, then there's the other balance of this, like certain people or certain companies

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:30.800
 that go to every single one and you just think you can't be doing any work.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.800
 You know what I mean?

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.720
 Like I try and limit myself to going and doing something like that.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:38.600
 Maybe once a week or whatever, but there's people just like, how have you, why does your

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:43.200
 party full say 600 events attend this?

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:49.440
 Yeah, I think this is a case everywhere where there's like an industry and like some large

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.440
 percentage of it.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:53.800
 It's just people acting out like they're doing stuff and like a small percentage of it is

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.280
 actually doing stuff.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:59.120
 And that stuff is like, no, like doesn't escape that either and maybe it's even more concentrated

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.120
 in some ways.

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.120
 Oh, for sure.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.120
 For sure.

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.760
 And there's like an inverse correlation with like people's pop.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:08.040
 You meet people that are popular on Twitter and then you like talk to them about tech and

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.880
 this is like, wow, you don't actually know how computers work.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.880
 It's really interesting.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.880
 Yeah.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:13.880
 That makes sense.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:16.880
 Why would one lead to another, you know, I don't know.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:17.880
 Yeah.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:18.880
 All right.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.880
 Well, I'll let you go.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.880
 Thanks for joining again.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:21.440
 Thank you for having me as always.
