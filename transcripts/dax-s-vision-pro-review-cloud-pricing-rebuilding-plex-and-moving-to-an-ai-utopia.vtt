WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 Look at us talking about things. I guess Chris can always cut stuff out. That's what

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.360
 having an editor is all about. Leave it up to you, Chris. Save these people from us.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.680
 Whenever we talk about, Chris will probably cut this out. I feel like he leaves it in.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.920
 And I can't tell it's a prank.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.480
 There's something deeper going on. No, no, no, no. I don't care what I look like. No,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.880
 the my current mental, emotional, psychological, physical, all of them, all the states, we had

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.600
 some like production issues. And do you know like when everything in your week is like planned out

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.840
 and then like suddenly you're doing none of it. Yeah, you know, those type. Yeah, it's like that.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.280
 I'm also I'm very hungry. I've done like 36 hour fast. I've done I've done 48 hour fasts.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.320
 Like I've done a lot of fasting in my life. Well, not in my life in the last year,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.280
 because of Jiu Jitsu for like cutting weight and stuff. For some reason, I am like shaking.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.440
 And I've only just not had breakfast, I skipped breakfast and I'm like jittery. It's actually kind

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.880
 of wild. My hand is shaking. Man, there's always something. What's that mean? I feel like every

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.360
 time you get on, there's just like something. Oh, sorry. Can you just be normal? Why can't you

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.920
 just be normal? I just kidding. The production issue thing is funny because I feel like there's

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.840
 been a few moments in my life where like something goes wrong. And it always tends to like stack

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.840
 up on other stuff that's like kind of already going wrong. And I always have this like 60 second

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.040
 period where I just feel all the stress. Mm hmm. And I'm like, it almost feels like

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.040
 my vision is tunneling. I can just like, I just like let it all in and I feel it. And then it fades

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.720
 and then just kind of go and get the work done. Every time this has happened, it's like something

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.320
 like that has happened. It's funny how like dramatic it ends up turning out like it's, in a way, it

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.080
 feels not serious because we're like, you know, pushing some buttons on a computer. But it's like

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.320
 we haven't experienced like we're in combat or something. It's just so like over the top. Yeah,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.440
 it really is. Yeah, the amount of like fight or flight they go into over people not being able

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.840
 to see your website or not being able to do certain things on your website in our case.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.680
 Is it all fixed? Yeah, no, it was all fixed yesterday, two days ago. It's been two days ago.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.200
 It's just there's been a lot of fallout of like making changes to prevent it from happening again,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.320
 that kind of thing. So just all the stuff I was working on that I was thinking I was working on,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.440
 not working on, and then you just feel like everything feels so scattered, like when you have a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.040
 disruption like that, like my, I don't know, just the things open on my computer, I'm like closing

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:25.360
 stuff. I'm like, well, there's just a lot. Yeah, it's a do you ever think about how that stuff only

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.800
 happens when you're making changes? And if you've never made any changes, it would never happen.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.880
 And then you imagine there are some companies out there where their product just never changes

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.080
 and they never do anything with it because they're like past the point of doing that.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.480
 And it must be so nice. It is software rot a thing though. If you just like wrote some code

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.520
 and then leave it running for a long time, not in rest, let's say in JavaScript.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:57.600
 At some point, will it just stop working? Yeah, I think so because it's memory leaks are extremely

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.640
 common. And prior to moving to serverless stuff, like a lot of my time was spent like a lot,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.760
 but you know, figuring out a memory leak was not uncommon. And I think we've all had the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.040
 people that have, you know, pre-serverless days, if you ship stuff, you've all had that

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.360
 experience of like that chart where like the memory just like goes up over the course of eight

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.600
 hours and then it reboots and it like drops and you finally fix it and it's flat and it feels amazing.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.520
 But like with serverless, it's just like, it's rebooting your system like every every couple

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.000
 minutes. So yeah, you can kind of ignore all those problems. I will say, I built a serverless app.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.760
 One of the first apps that I built just kind of like using all these different new,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:49.360
 what are very common paradigms for us now, it was three, four years ago for like a local company.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.320
 And they use it every day. It's like, I'll just say it's like a health care thing. And they use it

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.800
 in their office to manage like their patient experience. They use it every day. There have been

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.600
 no issues. I mean, like, this is not a thing that I experienced early in my career. If I built

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.080
 something for somebody, I had to constantly fix that. Yeah, babysit it. And maybe part of it,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.280
 I was still young. I was a newer engineer. But I don't think I've gotten that much better and

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.720
 this app has just been rock solid. Like, I don't have to think about it. There's just like once

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.760
 a year, it's the daylight saving time. There apparently some the library I was using has like a,

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.760
 like a one hour gap where there's like a bug during daylight. And that's it. That's the only

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.200
 issue. And I still haven't fixed it. I should probably fix that. I'm so sorry if you're listening.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.440
 Yeah, I've had a similar experience. The first thing I ever built in this extreme way,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.240
 it's so crazy. I can just like go to it at any time and it still all works. And that's such a

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.080
 novel experience if you're coming from the way things were done before. I think the other kind

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.800
 of rot that exists though is this is annoying and I'll just ignore it is eventually every single

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.160
 one of your dependencies has like some critical security thing in it. And so you do have to like

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.080
 upgrade those. And I think with that comes some risk of something breaking.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.760
 But yeah, like the fewer dependencies you use, like, you know, the better. Yeah, I guess like

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.000
 software rot is a term that was coined long ago, I'm sure. And even back when like,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.640
 well, was it I don't know, was it when there was box software when you were like buying

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:35.760
 DVDs with software on them? Or is it in the way like physical rot where like the medium would

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.280
 agree? No, not not physical. No, I just I think like the term, I wasn't even talking about like

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.960
 necessarily applications that you deploy serverlessly. You've been the literal code.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.040
 Just like, yeah, code like over time stuff doesn't work as well.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.000
 That's just a general software. Yeah, what is software? Maybe I should just know what I'm talking

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.440
 about first slow iteration of software quality over time. That's a little bit different.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.440
 Not a physical phenomenon. So I'm going to actually decay suffer some a lack of being

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.040
 responsive and updated with respect to the changing environment in which it resides. Yeah.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.760
 Okay, that makes sense. Like if the environment changes and the software is not updated,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.480
 then it feels like it's rotting. So is this like, oh, the environment being like the operating

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.000
 system? Like if it's native software, like the operating systems evolving, so your software has

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.440
 to continue evolving with it. It's why you have to keep paying Apple $99 a year. So if you want to

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.240
 pay it open, just like things like, like touch screens came out. And now some people are trying

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.680
 to use your software on touch screens and it like just doesn't work. Okay, expectations change or

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.480
 all that. So yeah, I think we all dream both as someone making software, you can just like

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.880
 finish it and put it out there. And as someone like consuming software that you can just like

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.480
 implement it once and ever changes. But yeah, just the world is way too dynamic.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.760
 So is that why everybody does subscriptions? Is that why it's not one time payments anymore?

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.800
 Because it is an ongoing effort and there's no such thing as just being done with the software

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.000
 product. There's a few things to this, right? So everyone's like, oh, things used to not be

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.440
 subscriptions. No, it didn't. There's no one remember how we all paid for Photoshop. I mean,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:25.040
 we all we all stole it. We all pirated it. But if you if you did pay for it,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.800
 Photoshop seven would come out, you pay 700 bucks for it. And he would use it for a year and

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.640
 a half. And then they're like, Oh, Photoshop is out. Give me another 700 bucks. That's just a

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.200
 subscription with like a yearly contract. It's it's the exact same thing. The reality is is like,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.640
 how are you the only way to really do this is you look at the fundamental model.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:52.000
 You're saying every single customer you acquire will only ever have one transaction event with

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.520
 you. So your only way of growing is continually finding brand new customers, which companies are

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.880
 already trying to do. And on top of like subscribe, like existing customers, we subscribing. So that

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.720
 model just doesn't make any sense. You're just like, companies already struggle to do both,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.720
 even by doing both, they still struggle. You're gonna like cut off half the strategy and expect

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.480
 to tour. I don't know. I do I do know that tailwind people talk. I was gonna bring a tailwind. Yeah,

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:28.160
 because they do go down with that model. But again, it's a three or four person team. I think

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.720
 that makes a lot of sense for them. And there is to be fair, there is the reality of

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:40.160
 there's the world is less static than we imagine. Like it feels like there's like a pool of 2

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.240
 million people and you need to like try to get to all of them. But really what it actually looks

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.520
 like is there's a pool of 2 million people. Some of them are aging out and a bunch of people

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.080
 are aging in. So it's like, yeah, you do have a shot at continuously finding customers. But

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.920
 yeah, I think for products that require ongoing maintenance, but also like stuff that's hosted,

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.040
 this is another thing that I always think about. I don't know if you ever thought about this, but

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:12.400
 you know how like you have to most SaaS software like stores your data forever? That's it. Well,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.680
 like sort of like if you build like say you build a B2B SaaS product, most of them aren't like,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.760
 oh yeah, after like two years, we're going to expire your data out and we archive it.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:29.040
 It's like pretty much there. And like if I paid them, you see how like over time that data could

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.720
 get so large that it like exceeds what I'm paying them per month. Oh yeah. Yeah, and I do wonder if

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.320
 there are some like more mature bigger B2B companies that have like had to institute a policy of like,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.800
 we're going to purge your stuff. Yeah, like any inactive records we're going to like archive.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.400
 If you think about something like Slack, just pure, it's a small company that's using it,

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:57.440
 it's a 10 people and they're messaging in there every single day. Slack's bill to store those

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:03.520
 messages increases every single month. Yeah, but my bill for how much I'm paying a Slack is fixed.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:10.160
 So their margins like get worse over time. The ratios are insane. Like I'm sure like the cost

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:16.160
 for them is like a quarter of a percent or something, but it's still like a weird something that like

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:22.080
 doesn't line up there. Yeah, is it like, are they baking on storage costs just get cheaper over time

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.280
 too? Like that's true. Source shows have gotten a lot cheaper over time as well. Google workspace

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:34.560
 has just increased the pricing. I got like 15 emails. Yeah. So like my I have a Google workspace

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.080
 just for mine. I don't know why even but for one of my email addresses. Yeah, and they just they

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.240
 just bumped the price. I don't remember how much I didn't even like email or any of the emails.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.640
 But it wasn't probably a lot. Just that's notable. So I think that model of like the pay one thing,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.720
 it works if you're just shipping a delivered product. I think that makes sense for tailwind

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.280
 because they're like, yeah, tailwind UI is it makes sense. It's not like there's not like this

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.400
 ongoing infrastructure requirement. I guess like there's a website and you download the stuff,

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.560
 but you know, basically free. It seems less complicated. Yeah, basically free in terms of

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.320
 infrastructure. Yeah. And then for the one like the DHH stuff where he's trying to sell it once,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:23.120
 really, that's just a marketing scheme. But to take it seriously, if his company was actually

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.280
 growing, like you they would have to release like a new version that you have to pay for again.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:34.080
 The lifetime subscription thing by this for life, it just doesn't work. I did this with Plex like

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.280
 years ago, like 10 years ago, Plex offered like a bite for life thing. And I did.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:43.360
 Yeah, I bought it for life this year. Oh, they still do it. Yeah, they still do it.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.120
 Okay, cool. Yeah. So I guess it does kind of work, but it's just extra challenging.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:56.320
 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think we've covered all my thoughts on it. I don't know. The once thing,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:02.320
 I didn't really read the big page that DHH published. Like, what was the idea that they're

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.080
 going to make a bunch of things that are you buy at once or once it's a product?

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.840
 And you self-host it. So I think self-hosting is kind of a requirement for this because then

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:15.920
 then there's no ongoing infrastructure costs for the creator. The thing though is like they don't,

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.800
 I'm super into the self-hosting thing. Like SST is all about self-hosting stuff that other people

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:26.800
 are paying a service for. Make it like really easy to self-host, you know, like I don't want

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.800
 to self-host like a Rails app that again is going to have a memory elite that needed to have

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:36.720
 monitoring on like, I don't, that's not easy to help hosting for me. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you guys

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.160
 have gone down that route, right? With the SST console making, you're trying to make that

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.840
 self-hostable. Yeah. I mean, we're going to have to, like every P2B company like this,

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.040
 especially the lower level you are, like the closer you are to infrastructure,

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.240
 big enterprise companies will not use a hosted version. It just doesn't. Yeah. It doesn't work.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:00.880
 But I think what's nice is your incentive should be, if I'm running a hosted version,

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.920
 I want it to be really easy for me to host it. I don't want a lot of operational overhead.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.320
 I want to be able to like create copies of my environment easily. If you do all those for yourself,

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.200
 it like also aligns with making it easy for other people to self-host.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.080
 Cause then they'll also have low operations and you'll be able to like spend a copy in their

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:25.680
 environment. So yeah. Yeah. I'm seeing a few more projects in this space. I don't know if we

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.840
 talked about, it's already the Cloudflare Analytics one. I don't think so. I think you've mentioned

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.240
 it to me, but I don't think we really talked about it much. Yeah. I forgot the name. I keep

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.840
 forgetting the name of it, but it's from someone that we're just centering. I think the name is Ben.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:46.240
 And he just built a very bare bones analytics product like bare bones today. Like it's, it's new.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.160
 But it does like what Google Analytics, the basics for Google Analytics, page view tracking,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:56.160
 et cetera, but it just built on top of Cloudflare's analytics engine. So you just deploy it into your

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.840
 Cloudflare account. It's basically free because the Cloudflare free tier and it's no operational

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.520
 overhead because analytics engine serverless. Yeah, that's pretty awesome. That's great. Like,

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:11.040
 I think we're actually considering using that for our own tracking. I'm seeing a few more things

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:18.480
 like that. How much is, yeah, how much is I on going to make SSD like a Cloudflare? I mean,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.600
 like, how much are you guys going to kind of start defaulting to Cloudflare in some of your

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.920
 constructs? Or is that going to be a thing? Is it still going to be largely AWS focused or now?

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.600
 Yeah. So we, we like went back and forth on like the right model for this. So there's

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.200
 a few different ways we could do this, right? So if you take one of our contracts, like

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:41.360
 AstroSight construct, right, to smooth and AstroSight, we could update that thing to

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:48.480
 give you like options inside the component to be like, oh, I want the CDN in Cloudflare and I want

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:54.880
 like the server functions to run in Lambda. You can like give you some complex configuration

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.240
 there. We realized that that was like a bad route that was just going to like create like a really

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.440
 leaky abstraction. And like, it was going to be hard to really customize that correctly. So we

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:09.280
 just have completely separate namespaces now. There's like an AWS namespace with all of our AWS

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:15.120
 constructs. There's a Cloudflare namespace, which today we just have like a worker construct, but

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.280
 we'll bring like the AWS, the AstroSight over to it. We'll bring actually has over it, we'll bring

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:25.360
 everything to it. And that lets us just say like, okay, we looked at Cloudflare and here's like our

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.440
 best possible take on deploying Astro there. And they're like completely separate. And the

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:35.040
 communities that know AWS and using Astro can like own theirs and communities that, you know,

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.040
 know Cloudflare and using Astro, they can they can own theirs too. So we're keeping it completely

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:46.320
 separate. The first release is like really still AWS focused, but yeah, we want to grow our library

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:54.400
 of Cloudflare components as well. Cool. I have a completely new topic to jump into.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:01.920
 I want to know what you think about like framework devs versus app devs.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:08.880
 So this is like a topic that comes up every once in a while, like, oh, well, you're just a

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.000
 library author, you don't actually build things. So what do you know about what's best for me? We

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.040
 ever heard that like, I mean, that that comes up. I'm not saying you like you do both. I mean,

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:25.840
 you guys like building the console is a great way to like dog food your own technology. But do you

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:32.720
 think like the creators of react the creators of whatever UI library, like do you think that they

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:40.560
 lack context? Like are all the people debating the internals of the latest react? Are they all just

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.600
 like too detached from the real world? I guess is my question. Yeah, I would say I think this is a

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.440
 real dynamic that I think I've been seeing my whole career. There's like this concept of a

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:57.120
 hands off architect that a lot of companies, I don't know if that's as common anymore, but at

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.960
 least when I was first starting, that was very common to have like this architectural role.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.880
 It often didn't work out well for the exact same dynamics. Like they theorize these things and then

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.640
 on the ground, it just doesn't really feel right. Yeah, you see this in the AWS space a lot like

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:18.880
 the like de facto way to do AWS, the correct way to quote unquote correct way to do AWS things

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.760
 doesn't really like feel good for the day they develop or doing it. They're like,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.880
 they make sense in theory. So I think I've seen this dynamic a lot.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:34.960
 On the flip side though, I've also seen individuals that are very like when you talk to them and

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.720
 like there are people that are framework authors, you can talk to them about anything and they know

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.160
 exactly like what the experience of it is like. So I think it just comes down to the individual.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:51.280
 So a few people that I personally have had this experience with Ryan Carniotto.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.560
 It's funny because you would think he's like the godfather of like front end framework stuff.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.560
 Yeah, you would think that he's the most attached to me of a library author.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.440
 Yeah, exactly. In the sense that he knows all of the libraries.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:09.440
 Yeah, he knows like all of these doesn't all work. Yeah, yeah, but he is an excellent back

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:15.360
 and engineer. We all know him for like the front end world stuff. I've talked to him about so

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.520
 many specific practical real world things and he's very good at understanding like

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:25.680
 here's like the thing we're pitching with this framework, but here's how it'll actually get

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:31.280
 used. He knows that it's not going to be as slick as what the way people talk about it.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.480
 He talks a lot about he actually coined the term for me. He calls it

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.960
 DOA projects down arrival projects because there's a whole class of projects in the real world

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.600
 where you just build it once and then you ever touch it again. And he's one of the few people

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:53.120
 in the framework space that I've heard like directly say that sometimes frameworks target those

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:58.880
 and it doesn't make sense for non DOA projects. Whereas I've seen other framework authors like

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:04.560
 show these really simple slick things and be like it works for everything. Another person is Ryan

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:10.080
 Florence. I think he also is very, very good about understanding practically what happens

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:16.160
 on the ground. And I mean, now that he's at Shopify, a big part of his role is to literally talk to

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:21.200
 actual companies that are using this stuff and like figuring out what they commonly do wrong

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.120
 with the problems, et cetera. So I think he tends to also be very, very good at

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.720
 balancing both. So yeah, I think with like everything, it just comes down to like

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.440
 the individual and how talented they are at all the stuff.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:41.440
 Do you think like just talking with people who build with your stuff is good enough? Like,

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.560
 does that give enough context? No, I think that's like the bare minimum that you can do.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:52.640
 I think that best people are people that like are actively trying to build something and they

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:58.160
 realize there's an opportunity for tooling that helps them build it. But the opportunity for tooling

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:06.800
 is like a detour for like the actual thing they want to do. That's obviously I think people that

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:12.880
 did in that they build the best stuff. I think that another issue is like, this is a scale issue.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:20.400
 If you're directly working on React, like React is so big that the reality is, is you could have

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:27.600
 a very nice, very great career just being someone that focuses on like the meta react stuff,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.960
 as opposed to like down the ground using React stuff. So I think when something gets so big,

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:38.400
 like you inevitably have people that are incentivized to kind of stay in a certain zone.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.200
 Yeah, could you explain? I don't know if I really understood. You mean like there's enough react

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:50.160
 such a huge ecosystem that there's room for there to be people whose whole career is just

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:57.040
 like in the minutiae? Is that what you're saying? Yeah, so I guess the counter I can provide is

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.880
 if I just wanted to spend all day working on solid JS and solid JS internals and like

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.640
 thinking about high level abstracted stuff, no one on the planet is going to pay me to do that.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.280
 There's no way I can do that full time. Yeah, but that's not the case of React.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:19.600
 There's you know, like Vercel hires people to do exactly that. There's opportunity for people to do

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:28.480
 exactly that. And I think what I think the big shift in React was previously every feature that

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:35.680
 was released to the public was already in production in Facebook. It was being used by teams to build

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:42.160
 stuff and hardened and then it got, you know, shown to the world. I'm sure there's maybe

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.440
 exceptions to that. I don't know. I might not know the details, but generally that was the case.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:53.680
 And with RSCs, Facebook's not using that. Nobody's using it. Nobody. It's like it's an inverse.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.800
 Like we're being pitched it to try it out as opposed to being told, hey, we're already using this.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.800
 If it's helpful for you, you can use it too. So that's like the shift, I think. And I think

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.560
 we can kind of feel that. Yep. Do you ever just get a random taste in your mouth?

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:11.200
 Like I just I just taste pumpkin pie right now. I haven't pumped a pie in like a year,

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.360
 but I taste it. Is that like I'm having a stroke? What does that mean? I don't really know. I feel

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:22.960
 like your hands are shaking. You're having weird taste in your mouth. Your emotions are impacted.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.040
 Yeah. I don't know. Like I said earlier, just try to be normal. Okay.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.480
 I'll try. You know what I'll try. I've been a little extra. I feel like I'm the high maintenance

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:38.080
 one of us between the two of us by a lot. 100%. That's not debatable. Oh, yeah, 100%. Speaking of

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:46.080
 herself. So there was this runaway bill in the news and by in the news, I mean on Twitter. And

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:52.480
 this is the thing that it drives me crazy about like cloud providers. Like why can't I I've said

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:58.640
 this a lot on AWS? Why can't I just say here is a dollar amount? And if you hit that dollar amount,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.800
 or I just want a free account, like you give me the free tier. Well, if I use anything, it costs

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.000
 anything, shut it down. Yeah. I know it's a hard problem, but it seems like that should just be

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.760
 baked in to all of these platforms. And I know Vercel being a middleman and just reselling AWS,

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:19.920
 they kind of have the same problem AWS has. And it's like this case by case, bureaucratic decision

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.480
 about whether we refund customers, if it was their fault, if it was an exploit, if it was a

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.920
 vulnerability on our side, like all those things. Sorry. Go ahead. Yeah. So just like broadly,

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:35.600
 I find it annoying because I'm sure people expected me when this came up to go dunk on Vercel,

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:41.120
 but I actually find this these situations really annoying. I think that one they all they're always

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:46.720
 resolved. They never actually end up being a problem, but just provide so much opportunity for

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.520
 like a ton of misinformation about all this stuff to get out. And it's just like bad for the whole

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.960
 ecosystem that people see these like shock situations, and they see the $23,000 or whatever,

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:01.760
 and they like never see the resolution. And it just continues to spread like all this confusion

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:07.280
 around this stuff. So I just hate it when this happens. Yeah. I mean, to your point, like AWS,

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.280
 there's so many people who won't use AWS because they're afraid of a runaway bill that they've

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.520
 read on Reddit. And if you if you look at the last couple, I mean, all the last ones that I can

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.640
 remember one because this happens every couple of months, right? Someone posted me like this.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:24.000
 I don't remember an AWS one in a while. It's like, yeah, pretty much have been Vercel ones.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.800
 So my thoughts on this are, I think it's a hard problem, not technically, but it's like a product

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.960
 issue. So the question is like, what headline are you trying to avoid? If you're trying to avoid,

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:42.800
 Oh, no, I just got a $23,000 bill. You're you make it so when you sign up, there's like a limit

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.240
 that you have to turn off, right? Yeah. And most people won't even know about that. Like,

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.680
 they won't look into the right setting page. They don't even know the limits there. But when this

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:55.680
 happens, they, you know, they don't get this runaway bill issue. Yeah. But then you have this other

00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.240
 headline, which is I spent two years working on my product. It finally went viral and Vercel shut

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.520
 it down. Yeah. That's worse. And you see these with like payment providers and stuff all the time,

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.000
 like because some like spike in payment activity looks like fraud and they shut it down. They like

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.520
 lose a bunch of sales. So you have both these headlines that are possible. And whatever default

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:23.200
 you pick default cap on default, cap off determines which one you want to deal with. Yeah. So I understand

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:29.840
 why they opt for the third option, which is we'll just refund people when this stuff happens.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:35.920
 But I guess like that's default. In this case, there is no ability to say it. I want hard spin

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.320
 limit. And that's what bothers me. It's like, why on AWS, why on Vercel, why on all these platforms?

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.600
 I know why on Vercel, because they can't, I mean, AWS, you can't do it. So well, it's like,

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.760
 they're upstream. I guess they still could. Yes. They can, because they have the ability to like

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.200
 freeze a project. So because remember, they have their own routing layer before it hits the lambda

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:59.680
 function so they can always. Right. They can not capture it. But but remember what AWS is

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:05.840
 doing now. They, when you create a new account, your function concurrency is like capped at 10.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.160
 Is that every new account? Is that a thing? It's been happening way more frequently. Like it happened

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:16.000
 to us. And then I've been seeing it a lot more. So like, that's now they're switching to

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.040
 opting for the default where like you go to production, you're like, what is happening?

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:26.640
 Everything's. But the limit is so low that you'll probably see it very quickly. Yeah, as opposed to

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:31.760
 like, you know, seeing it like six months later. Yeah, I guess that just spun off a whole new set

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:38.720
 of thoughts. Like you guys use SES in the console, don't you? For email? Yeah. What's the process

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.360
 of getting actual production usage of SES? Because I've never, it's been too much of a hurdle. I've

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:48.320
 never tried. Do you know what I do? I've done this so many times. Do you DM a buddy? And just like,

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:54.080
 they know, okay, no, I do something even funnier. Okay. So people that aren't aware, when you are

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:59.760
 using AWS SES, which is a service to send emails, by default, you can only send the emails that

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.000
 you've like registered just for like dev views. Yeah. If you want to send emails generally,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.960
 there's a process you have to open up a support ticket. I've done this a few times where I've

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:15.280
 realized I'm very certain the other end is a bot. So I will always provide what they ask.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:21.040
 And they always respond with the same information to respond the same message being like,

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.440
 thank you. And they ask for more information, but it's like already information I put in the first

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:30.720
 message. Yeah. So I can just copy paste the first message back and then they unlock it. And I've

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:36.880
 seen this message now. And I just repaste it every time. And okay, I need it. I need the message,

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:43.200
 or is it have like, no, no, no, yeah, I probably just give it to you. The part of me wanted to be

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:52.720
 like, we should just have a component in SST. It just does this. It just turns on. It's also

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.960
 funny because the initial limits are so hardcore. They're like, you can only send out emails per

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.720
 day just to like whatever. And then you go through this and they're like, okay, you can send like

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:07.840
 4 billion emails every hour. Okay, I didn't need that much of a jump. That's funny.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.640
 Wow. I want this message yet or just build the construct. That's so funny. That's the power of

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.360
 what you guys could do with SST. Like you really can cover a lot of rough edges on these cloud

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.600
 providers by just doing weird stuff like that. Yeah. So yeah, I mean, I think yes, Versella should

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.320
 add. I mean, they already have something that triggers a webhook and is on you to like handle it

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.720
 and and freeze the project. They could make that one click. I don't know why they haven't.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:39.680
 But like, it's tricky. It's not going to be. I think everyone thinks it's so straight. I think

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.360
 to a lot of people externally, it seems so straightforward. The fact they're not doing it seems

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:49.280
 suspicious or intentional. Nobody enjoyed the last couple of days, you know, when their team

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:54.400
 enjoyed having to deal with this. And they almost always have to refund. I think their bigger problem

00:29:54.400 --> 00:30:00.240
 is, you know, who's not refunding AWS is not refunding that. So yeah, so Versella is just out

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:06.560
 that money. Like they just refunded their customer, but they paid the bill to AWS. Well,

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.680
 yeah, I mean, a fifth of it or whatever whatever it is. But still whatever their market was probably

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.800
 like, I think I did the math. I think it was like $2,000 or something. Okay. So plus the time of all

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.720
 the people investigating and all that. Yeah, I guess Versella can't then go data best and say,

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.440
 this was an accident from our downstream users. Yeah, they can't. Could you please refund?

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:31.520
 Yeah. The more I think about this, they can or they can't. No, they cannot. I cannot.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.680
 Yeah, I don't think that would work because they look bad or just because they don't have a case.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.080
 They're like a big customer. They pay their bill every month. It's different than like a hobby person

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.120
 coming in and being like, I did not mean it's been $30,000. Yeah, that that AWS works with you.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.840
 But this is a case where probably not like again, everyone has a shared responsibility model.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.920
 AWS is a shared responsibility with Versella, not with Versellas customers. So I can see why

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.680
 that makes sense. Yeah, I couldn't do that. The thing I keep thinking about is

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:05.040
 what is AWS and what are these cloud providers? What they did was they built like a crazy multi-tenant

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:11.280
 system. You can get resources. Your resources are scoped to you. The configuration is scoped to you.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.840
 The billing is scoped to you. Everything is just your stuff. And they put it in order to create

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.800
 all this separation so that even though it's one data center, you feel like it's your own private

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:26.560
 data center that nobody else is in. Then you have companies like the middleman companies that go

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:33.520
 and act like they're one tenant, but they're actually representing thousands of companies

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:38.800
 that are using them. So they're stuck rebuilding all the same stuff that AWS did. They're stuck

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:44.560
 like rebuilding a multi-tenant system on top of this. And there's such a weird problems, right?

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:49.280
 If you look at, so I was thinking like, oh, why does because AWS has WAF, right? The web

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.760
 allocation firewall to prevent. I don't know how effective it is like, but I'm sure it's very

00:31:53.760 --> 00:32:00.560
 pretty effective for preventing like DDOS and like malicious traffic. I was like, oh, why can't

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:08.080
 they just turn that on? But then I was like, oh, but if Burssel turned it on, that would turn it on

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.560
 for all of their customers, the savory was for all of their customers. And if like, what customers

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:17.360
 targeted with like, you just don't have to lose that granularity. So they're stuck rebuilding that

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:23.360
 in their layer. Yep. And a lot of their development time goes into these types of problems. And like

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:28.400
 you as an end user, you don't care about those. Those are like the internal issues that they have,

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.800
 internal architecture that they need to solve. You wouldn't need to solve those if you were

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:38.880
 just using AWS directly. So yeah, I can't just, I just keep discovering new ways to understand

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:45.120
 like what a tough business it is. Yeah, what like, how do quotas work for Burssel? If they're just

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:50.880
 like, if all their customers are really just in like, Burssel accounts, AWS accounts, I'm sure they

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:56.560
 have more than one account. But like, they have to deal with these quotas that potentially as

00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.080
 their business grows, that they have more customers using more of their cloud services.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:05.200
 They're going to butt up against more and more AWS quotas, where you can only have so many

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:10.640
 resources deployed. And they've got to just continually, I guess, keep that provisioned higher

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.120
 than what they need. Well, AJ was telling me that when he were just serverless framework,

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:20.000
 they had a similar problem because they had like a hosted thing similar. They actually would just

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.960
 load balance across multiple AWS accounts, not like literally a balance, but they would like

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.760
 shard their customers across many AWS accounts. So I wonder if they do something similar.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:35.600
 Yeah, that makes sense. Again, just like weird problems that like you imagine that when you

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.080
 pay a company like this, it's because they're doing the work that you would have to do.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:44.160
 Yeah, but they spend a lot of time doing work that you would never have to do because you're not

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:49.600
 trying to manage a million deployments. Yep. Yeah, the WAF thing is interesting. And just

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:56.480
 being like DDoSed on Vercel, as someone who is very involved with a consumer facing website that

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:02.800
 gets a lot of eyeballs on it, like we deal with DDoS attempts or just constantly. I mean,

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:07.440
 we're constantly getting hit with these like bots that are trying to either scrape all our data or

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:12.880
 whatever, like just big bursts of activity that's not really stuff that's desirable. We don't want

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.360
 that activity. Like we have to deal with that stuff, but we have the full suite of AWS tools

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:23.760
 at our disposal. If you're a Vercel customer, I've seen the example where a very notable

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:31.520
 tech influencer got DDoSed and he just like DMs Leerob and they take care of it. But what do you

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:37.520
 do if your Joe doesn't have a relationship with Leerob on Vercel, you're a customer,

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.040
 and you get DDoS, you're just what? Like what happens?

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:46.000
 It's funny because you just drop down into a system that has proper multi-tenant support.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.280
 So everyone goes and signs up for CloudFlare, which again is a fully complete multi-tenant

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.680
 system. They give you a firewall that's scoped to you and they put it in front of their site,

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:58.080
 and now they can control the rules that they need.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.080
 So if I'm a customer of Vercel and I'm actually concerned about these things,

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.080
 I just put CloudFlare in front of my Vercel site.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.920
 That's what everyone is told to do, and that's what everyone does, and it effectively fixes the

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:13.040
 problem. But it's so awkward.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.600
 Like now you're routing through CloudFlare to get into the AWS,

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:23.760
 to Vercel's AWS network, to go into their Kubernetes layer, to then go back out to CloudFlare worker.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:29.520
 Yeah, I hate the idea of extra hops, stuff like that just drives me crazy.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:34.640
 And I don't know, maybe it's just DNS and it's not like a big deal, or it's not just DNS, is it?

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.000
 No, it's not just DNS. It's 100%.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.760
 It's your CDN in front of another CDN. I don't love it.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:48.080
 Yeah, I wonder if they will end up moving off of Lambda, because...

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:54.240
 Okay, so if you look at some of the things they've done, they have their own bubble environment

00:35:54.240 --> 00:36:00.080
 thing. When you deploy a Vercel serverless function, it kind of lives in this bubble.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:05.520
 There's certain stuff that's injected into the Globals, or certain APIs for even receiving the

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:12.000
 request. They had a post yesterday, and now you just standard web request response stuff.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.960
 Do you not expose to any of the Lambda specifics at all?

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.040
 Yeah, you're saying like there's a Lambda function wrapper, sort of.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:19.680
 Yeah, exactly.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.480
 There's a bunch of Vercel code that lives in Lambda, and it shields you and kind of like

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.680
 abstracts away Lambda from your function.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.320
 Yeah, so what's nice about that is they could just take your stuff and move it somewhere else,

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:39.040
 to their own compute, wherever, and now it's not running on Lambda anymore, and you probably

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:43.520
 wouldn't even notice. And they could probably improve a bunch of these issues, like some

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.320
 performance issues they have more control. But it's a weird place to be, because I don't really

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:55.520
 believe that you can offer a serverless offering unless you're at AWS scale.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:03.040
 I think you literally make negative money until you tip over to being like AWS scale,

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.400
 because it's hard to keep your machines busy otherwise.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.840
 Yeah, what are you saying? You're saying it wouldn't work for Vercel?

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.160
 I want to see why it makes sense to move the different forms of compute that they directly

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:19.040
 manage more, if they have their own servers, physical servers and physical data centers.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.400
 Oh, I thought you were saying like Cloudflare workers or something instead of Lambda.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.880
 No, I meant like just going lower.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:30.640
 Going lower, yeah, which is not something they generally do, but I can see why that kind of

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:38.480
 has to happen, because their margins don't like, they're just so expensive, and it has to be,

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:45.760
 because they're building on top of another product. If you look at JPoint is out to me,

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:52.640
 if you look at the companies that invest in, that's why the VCs that invest in like Vercel,

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:58.080
 and some other companies that are similar to them, you'll see a bunch of common VC names,

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:03.280
 but you'll never see Sequoia, and that's because Sequoia specifically believes that

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.720
 you cannot build a profitable business on top of someone else's cloud.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.120
 That's why they're never in any of these deals. So that is like a real question mark and a real

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:20.480
 problem. So you kind of have to move to your own stuff to make it sustainable, but I don't know,

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.760
 you have to be at a crazy scale before you can do that. So yeah, I don't really know. I can see

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.600
 them doing it, but I also see the challenges. Are they not already at that crazy scale decks?

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:32.160
 You don't think they're already there? I'm just kidding. I mean, I don't think Cloudflare is there.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:38.480
 I think Cloudflare has a crazy profitable other business that lets them bet on this direction.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:44.880
 Yeah, but that's something sometimes I'd love for you to give me like the history of Cloudflare,

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:50.160
 because I don't know if I understand like it started just as a CDN, and then they've moved

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:55.120
 into all this other stuff. But you don't have to right now really start as a CDN. They actually,

00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:02.320
 I need to look up more on this myself. I'm not that educated on it, but they started as the

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:09.200
 problem we want to solve is security, like a DDoS issue. How do we solve it? And the way to solve it

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:14.640
 for them was to like integrate into all these crazy places in the world, like all these crazy

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:19.280
 places where internet traffic flows through, and they did that work. And nobody else in the world,

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.800
 not even AWS, is as tightly integrated as they are. Like at the ISP level, they have like deals

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.360
 with every single ISP that's like crazy, crazy embedded. And they realize now that we're here,

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.720
 we can do all kinds of other stuff. But I think it's just all float from that. I'm not super aware

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:40.480
 of the details, but yeah, it's a cool. I figured that that's one of those like 100 year businesses,

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:47.440
 like you'll never really see their what they're going to become for like 100 years or so. It's a

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:53.280
 long term play. I have another dumb question. I just saw you tweet something about Superbase.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.960
 And I realized I see people tweet stuff about Superbase. And I don't know what Superbase is.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:01.840
 What is Superbase? It's like not Firebase. It's like open source Firebase. But what's Firebase?

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:07.840
 Okay. So is that even right? Did I even get that? Yeah, I think yes. Superbase and Firebase

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:16.880
 are very similar. I think what Superbase initially set out to and still is a tackle that back ends

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:21.840
 the service market where you really just want to build a front end. You want to write data to

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.760
 a generic back end. It has stuff like auth permissions, like all that stuff built in.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:31.200
 And they were like, we were going to do like the best possible version of that. And I think they

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:35.840
 did achieve that they built the best possible version of that concept. Did it really well,

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:41.440
 built a lot of really cool technology as a side effect of that. And when I saw them, you know,

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.840
 first come out and sort of get popular, I was like, oh, they're going to win this like market.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:51.440
 It's not the biggest market in the world. Again, like those DOA projects or like agencies that do

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:56.080
 like eight projects a year. Perfect for them. I was like, okay, they're just going to dominate

00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:01.680
 that or like, you know, win the large percentage of it. And my tweet was I found it fascinating that

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:07.360
 they brought they like went so specific and so deep with this very specific market.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:13.360
 But people just use them for generic Postgres hosting now. Like they don't even care about the

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:17.760
 full background of service thing. Like as a side effect of them building that they also built a

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:23.760
 great Postgres experience. Because it's a full background of service offering, it has like great

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.920
 tools to like go look into your database and see what's going on. And it's all nice. Even if you're

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:33.760
 just using it just for the Postgres functionality. Yeah. And yeah, I think that was like a very

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.160
 unique trajectory. I didn't really see that. I didn't predict that happening at all.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:44.080
 Yeah. That's just making me think of all the things I use. No, I can't think of a single

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:48.640
 example right now because I haven't eaten. But there's so many things where it's like you use

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:53.040
 one sliver of it and you kind of feel bad. You just have this nagging feeling that like,

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.840
 you should be taking advantage of more of this stuff that it offers. But you just need this one

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.520
 part and you just use that part and there's nothing stopping you from just using that part.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.720
 That's great when it doesn't feel the rest of product is getting in your way.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:11.280
 Yeah. Sometimes it's very much in the way. Yeah. They're trying to get you to use all of it.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.000
 Yeah. And I want to. And then that's very annoying. I think Superbase is a good job not doing that.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.120
 Plex is a good example that like I use Plex to direct play media that I have stored on a server.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:25.840
 But they want to shove all this other Plex stuff on me. I'm like, no, thank you. I signed up for

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.600
 Plex Pass. Can I get rid of all that something? It's so hard to get rid of it. And they're always

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.200
 adding these stuff that you then you have to let go and turn off in the settings too. Yeah.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:38.000
 Do you see my tweet about that? That's one of my dream projects. Oh, yeah. You want to build Plex?

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.680
 Yeah. Plex is written in Python. Oh, really? I think so. I think a large amount of it.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.960
 Which part? Like the server? Yeah. I think it is. Maybe I might be wrong on this,

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.880
 but I think I remember seeing Python files in the folders digging through.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:58.240
 It's so slow. Is it a source? Wait. Oh, no, you dug through the.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:03.120
 Just like the config folder files. And so there's like some Python files end up there. Yeah. It's so

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:08.800
 slow. Like what? I don't know if you've you experienced this, but like, why is there any

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:16.240
 lag going between any screens in Plex? Like it's storing, you know, even big libraries,

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.320
 2000 records, 2000 records, 2000 movies that you have, whatever it is.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.960
 That's like you can just fit all that in memory, literally, like the whole database.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:30.000
 Yeah. And every time I open, like every time I start up my theater, it's slow again. Like,

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.600
 why didn't it at least get fast after the first load? Yeah. Why didn't it store all that stuff

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:41.920
 for the next time? Yeah. So there's that, which, yeah, if someone just built like a local first

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.520
 architecture on this, it would just blow it out of the water. It would feel really great to use.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:50.080
 It would feel like a native app, which it should, because it's running on like dedicated devices.

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:57.920
 Installed like a native app. Yeah. Yeah. So that's one, two. This is like maybe over the top, but

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:03.920
 I always thought the transcoder of Plex should be decoupled so it can run on several servers

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.840
 if you want it to. So you can have like a cluster. Yeah. Let's just have like a dedicated transcoding

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.920
 machine. Yeah, exactly. That's like separate or something. So just kind of decoupling those.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:18.320
 I think the whole thing should be written and go single binary. You install like, just keep it

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:24.400
 really stupid, simple, instead of like this complex application. But yeah, like ultimately,

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:30.000
 all it is is like, it's in a way, it's just just like OBS. OBS is a big complicated thing, but all

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:37.040
 it's doing is running FFmpeg commands at the end of the day. It's a UI for FFmpeg. And Plex is kind of

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:43.360
 also that I love to just like build a true open source version of it that doesn't have all this

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:48.000
 bloat is not trying to become a Netflix. It's not trying to like shovel this stuff in your face. It'd be

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.080
 fantastic. That would be great. I'll use it. I'll be your first customer. That reminds me too. I saw

00:44:54.080 --> 00:45:00.400
 somebody tweet about Fabrice Belard. Did I say his name right? I have no idea what you just

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:08.640
 create or FFmpeg. Okay. Well, it's someone from France. Yes. It's a French name. I knew that.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:18.080
 I'm cultured from the Ozarks. Fabrice Belard created FFmpeg. Have you read his Wikipedia? Because

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:25.600
 I don't know how I never heard the name. His body of work is kind of insane.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:29.760
 I think I've heard and still going. I think I've seen this pop up before. I don't remember the

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:38.080
 details, but like, what is it? So, well, I'm on his Wikipedia now. Obviously, FFmpeg is nuts. And

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:43.200
 I didn't know there was like, I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of contributors to FFmpeg.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:52.880
 But that's impressive. In 2014, he proposed BPG images as replacement for JPEG. I guess I don't

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:58.480
 know if that actually took off. July 19, 2019 released QuickJS, which is a small,

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:03.840
 embeddable JavaScript. Wait, he works on QuickJS? What the hell? He created it. And QuickJS,

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:09.840
 that's how this came up because what is it? The new LLRT run time is based on LRT.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:18.560
 And it's funny. I met a guy last week here in Miami, and he built this really cool serverless type

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.400
 thing as a very cool product. And he's trying to start a company around it. And he also uses

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:27.280
 QuickJS. And like randomly came up twice in one way. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. So we're kind of

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:34.480
 spanning all these weird different things, right? Like the he built a JavaScript engine, but also

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:41.600
 FFmpeg and also an image format. But then in 2021, this artificial neural network based data

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.240
 compressor in NCP, I'm just reading this straight up to Wikipedia, but took place first place out

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:51.920
 of hundreds in the large text compression benchmark. It uses his own artificial neural network library

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:58.400
 Lib and C, which is publicly available. So a large text compression benchmark competition,

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:06.400
 he won it with this neural network based text compressor, which blows my mind. And then in 23,

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:11.280
 last year, he released TS zip, which sounds like a derivative of that work.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:20.480
 That's a lossless text compressor using LLMs. Yeah. Just like AI, media, and then a JavaScript

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.320
 runtime. It's just such a spread of things. He's done. Like this guy's got to be brilliant.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:28.800
 You see the commonality with all of these? No, he's very good at making things small.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.320
 Oh, interesting.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.320
 All compression stuff. It's all like, yeah, we make this small, which is very difficult,

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.640
 obviously. But like, I think that's like the common thread, like, and it's spinning all these

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:43.600
 different places, which is impressive. I mean, cute. Did he invent Q and Q EMU also? Because that's

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:50.800
 used a ton. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, I didn't read the little opening. I could have summed this up a

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:55.920
 lot better. And that's like a really fast, uh, emulator. Yeah. Don't know how I never heard his

00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:01.360
 name. I never thought like who made FFM pig? FFM pig is one of the most impressive pieces of software

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:06.400
 that's ever been written. Like you can do literally anything with media with FFM pig.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:11.040
 I know. It's amazing. You could like build a whole career on just using and being good at FFM

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:17.200
 pig. You know what I mean? You know what? One of the first unlocks for me with chat GPT was like

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:23.040
 chat GPT plus FFM pig. And I was like, yeah, I can do everything. Like it can create FFM pig commands.

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:27.920
 Yeah. Yeah. It's like it's own programming language. Yeah, exactly. Super impressive. Yeah.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:33.760
 There are just some people like that that are just everywhere and prolific. Yeah. So you just

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.520
 said there's people like that. Now I got to pull up this. Somebody sent me this yesterday.

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:43.280
 Well, not just somebody, a friend, Roger, who listens to the podcast. I know that because

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:49.760
 he said something yesterday from our podcast. Uh, he sent me this, uh, individual Johnny Kim,

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:57.520
 his Wikipedia article. Uh, this is just crazy. Uh, so he was an American or he is an American

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:03.440
 US Navy lieutenant commander. He was a seal. Oh, he said this is an astronaut doctor. Yeah. Also

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:09.760
 an astronaut and a doctor while in, was it basic training? What was it while he's like going through

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:16.720
 his Navy seal training or something, he gets his doctorate, his medical, what is it? I got to read

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:22.000
 this. Yeah. Gets his medical doctorate and gets accepted into the astronaut program. And then

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.200
 becomes an astronaut. Like what in the world was wrong with us? He's, he's Korean, right? Everyone,

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.600
 I remember when, when I first heard about this, the juggernaut was making was like, oh, great.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:38.240
 Like every Asian parent has like someone to compare the one impossible to compare you to.

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:42.560
 Yeah. Oh, I'm comparing myself. It's like, what have I done in life? I can't hardly have a podcast

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.680
 and get programming done at the same time. It's got an astronaut and a Navy seal. What?

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:53.200
 That's, has he killed people in space? I mean, and resuscitated them because he's a doctor.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:59.920
 He served in the Iraq war. It looks like you got a silver star. Wow. There's just like,

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.480
 there's people like that. That's what Roger said. There's people like that.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:08.160
 I was saying I bet he doesn't know rust. Someone also asked about jelly fin. So jelly fin is the

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:12.800
 open source version of Plex, but it sucks. I think it sucks. I don't think it'll look really good.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:17.120
 There's also in be, in be sucks too, right? He's been around for a long time. Yeah.

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:21.680
 I love that like, there's all the hundreds of thousands of hours of work that probably

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.720
 hundreds of people have put into jelly fin and in be and we're like, yeah, it sucks.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:32.400
 I barely used it. I installed it on my Synology NAS and I'm like, yeah, in be sucks.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:37.520
 Yeah, but I mean, you know, you got to get people to that aha moment quicker. You suck.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:42.000
 Yeah, that's right. It's a marketing thing as much as anything. I mean, it's a packaging,

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.320
 a packaging thing. Yep. The other thing I forgot to bring up, we never talked about,

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:51.360
 is I tried the Apple Vision Pro. Oh, Apple Vision Pro. I would ask you this first thing.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:55.760
 Yeah. This was the first thing I wanted to talk to you about. Tell me, do I need to buy it?

00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:02.560
 Is it amazing? So backstory, I have a friend here in Miami and I went over to his apartment

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.800
 for the first time. Is this your rich friend? You know, I said, everybody has to have a rich

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:10.720
 friend to go to all the rich parties. No, it's not. It's not that category of rich.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:14.400
 But I did, after hanging out with him, I was talking to Liz and I was like, oh,

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:22.240
 this is the urban version of Adam. Okay. And I was playing Y. So he like sold a company a couple

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:26.560
 years ago and he's like working on a new one now. He's doing pretty well.

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:32.480
 Apartment is amazing. Super nice, really well done. We go into his room and he just has

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:41.200
 every single gadget, like every single thing. And he has a, he has a gaming PC. Okay.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:47.120
 You've seen the size of like a typical desktop. This is the biggest PC I've seen in my life.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.200
 It was literally like this tall. It was like, it was on the ground. It was getting mounted

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:55.600
 yet. It was like, I got my ribs. It was super tall. I was like, oh, I was like, oh,

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:59.760
 just have like four GPUs. And then he was like, it was just a normal PC has one GPU in it,

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:04.800
 one CPU in it. But for some reason, it is giant and like wild and stuff. And he's going to like

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:10.800
 mount it in the wall with like this crazy like wall stuff. I like this guy. He's got his massive

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:15.680
 painting button. Oh, another thing that I loved. He had a bunch of art in his house. And for me,

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.720
 my whole life, I realized if the bigger the painting is the more I like it and every single

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:25.600
 thing he has, giant, giant paintings. And it sometimes looks better when it's big, you know?

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:30.960
 Yeah. No, I am big on the train of the bigger the thing, the better it is. Kasey's always like,

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:36.400
 just because the Apple is bigger, does it make it better? Like, it's better in a fruit, any,

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:41.280
 yeah, if it's bigger, it's probably better. Yeah, exactly. So again, so he,

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:44.400
 he reminds me a lot of you, because he's like has all this stuff, but

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:49.040
 yeah, can I just interrupt and say an apartment? Because he's not from the Ozarks. Yeah.

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.400
 So if I moved to the city, could I be the urban version of Adam? When you said he's the urban

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:59.440
 version of Adam, I was imagining, you know, tall, rugged, handsome, well spoken, those kind of

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:04.560
 things. But no, it's the consumerism. That also kind of looks like you too, like similar,

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:11.200
 definitely similar category of person physically. But most of the thing that reminds you of me is

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:16.320
 that he has a lot of stuff. Yeah, he's has a lot of stuff. He seems like very particular in like,

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:22.080
 you know, there's lots of similarities. So he has like every single headset ever,

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:27.840
 like the Quest 2, the Quest 3, he's got like those be real glasses. He got, he has, he's the ones

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:32.960
 that like a 3D print them to your face so that the light doesn't leak in. Oh, yeah. And he obviously

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:40.480
 got the Vision Pro. And I tried it. And I will say I was, it was as someone that has like, I have

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:44.960
 the valve index or I'm not new to VR or anything. Yeah, it was like a pretty crazy experience.

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:52.400
 In hindsight, though, I think it was crazy because I had never, the thing I was new to was the mixed

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:58.560
 reality, like AR stuff. I'd only ever had like full VR experiences. Yeah. So the immediate,

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:02.400
 what's funny was the thing that blew my mind the most is when I put it on and I looked at my hands.

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:07.040
 And I was like moving my hands around. I was like touching my hands. There was like,

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:11.440
 it just looked like real life. And it was so hard for me to remember that I'm looking through a

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:16.640
 screen. But the past, who is it? That's that good. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, but like technically,

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:21.760
 it's not perfect. Like it's a little grainy and like the light, the color is like a little bit dull

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.480
 and it like changes depending if it's highlight or low light. Yeah. So of course, it's not like

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:31.120
 the equal to reality. But as someone that never experienced that, I was like, this is very good.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:36.320
 Like I really don't feel like I'm inside something. I feel like I'm just out, like looking at people

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:41.680
 and I can see them. And then obviously, if you have a believable base version of reality,

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:46.640
 when you start to like put fake stuff in there, it's like a really crazy experience. Like,

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:51.840
 he showed me this thing from Dinosaur demo where like this portal opens up in front of you

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:56.640
 and a dinosaur comes out and you can interact with it. And it's like in the room with you.

00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:01.840
 It's really, really convincing. It's really impressive. It was really definitely a magical

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:07.920
 experience. It felt like. Was it a meat eating dinosaur? Yes, it was. Well, it was funny because

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.120
 I was like touching. I was like trying to touch it and it snapped in my hand. And I like it seemed

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:16.000
 to be like pull my hand back and then everyone laughed at me. But that was so on the pure entertainment

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.360
 side, that was really impressive. When I dialed the thing to make it, you know, how you can make it

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.120
 fully immersed. You can't see the real world. Yeah, like be on the moon or whatever. So none

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:29.200
 of that was impressive to me because I've seen that a lot of times in VR. I don't think that

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:35.920
 experience is particularly different. The other thing is the controls are insane.

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:40.240
 I thought it would take me a little bit of time to get used to that. Like the pinching the fingers

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:44.880
 and stuff. And like looking where you want to click. It is so fast. Like I got the hang of it in 30

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:49.920
 seconds and there is no interface fast than looking where you want to do and click. There's

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.760
 so that there's a little bit of precision issues, but I think I would just get used to it. Yeah.

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:58.800
 But compared to like all the stuff I set up on my keyboard for like navigating my computer

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:04.720
 quickly, it's just not going to be like looking somewhere. And no, the computer like knowing that

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:10.160
 that's what you're focused on. Yeah, super fast. So I was like, this tech would be great in my

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:15.120
 normal desktop where if I just look somewhere and they actually do make stuff that that does that

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:21.680
 for like accessibility issues. But controls are amazing. And the last thing that I wanted to try

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:26.320
 was, okay, can this replace my monitor? Like is this something that I can work on? Yeah,

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:32.080
 there's some like novel things with it where so you can mirror your Mac. So you have one

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:37.200
 floating window that is your Mac. And it's really cool because you can like pull it up really close

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.840
 to your face. And you can like it just is different experience in using a monitor. So I think it's

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:46.240
 hard to compare it one to one where you just have something that's replacing the rectangle that is

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:50.400
 your monitor. Because you can do all kinds of stuff with it that you can like angle it really

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:53.680
 easily. You can like put it below you and kind of look like this while you're typing.

00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:01.200
 So that's very interesting. The other interesting part of it is any like like auxiliary apps that

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:07.760
 you have like Slack or Discord or like you're watching TV in the background, you can pull those

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:12.080
 out in separate windows because you can just have those iPad apps. You have your main app that's

00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:18.320
 your Mac mirror thing and you can just have like your email up here and your slack over here and

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.840
 whatever else you need. You can just look at it. So you kind of that infinite space thing and

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:27.600
 think that does work out. I don't think you can work in it all day. Like too heavy or

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:33.440
 eye strain or both. I think it's the eye strain. At the end of the day, every single headset has

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:39.440
 this problem where you are looking at an image that's right in front of your eyes and your eyes

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:44.400
 aren't changing focus as much as they would. Even looking at a flat screen, like looking at

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:48.960
 different parts of it, like your muscles or your eye muscles that are moving. How does it work?

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:55.200
 Like I know the thing is just like an inch from your your eyeball, but you're seeing the camera

00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:00.960
 pass through at objects that are far away. Does your eyes still not have to change focus to see

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:05.120
 those things? It does. And I feel my eyes doing that, but there's something that's not the same.

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:09.280
 You could feel your iris dilating. Are you kidding me? No, not that. It's like

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:13.840
 like when I was trying to like get some superpower. When I was trying to like look at the right

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:19.680
 things where I can click on it, I could feel my eyes like focusing differently on the thing. Yeah,

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:25.920
 but something just different when you're looking at like a static object. Everyone says the

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:30.880
 eye strain is an issue. It doesn't matter who you are. It just kind of affects you.

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:38.240
 And the comfort on the head, like it's still like kind of front heavy. So I think hypothetically,

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:42.960
 if it wasn't heavy, I think it would actually be better for your posture.

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:48.720
 If you can like lean back and like look up here, and this is like pretty good posture, you know,

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:52.400
 I was supposed to like hunting down like as opposed to kind of like slumping down on your laptop.

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:59.120
 Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, this is so hard for me because like I've bought every Apple product

00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:04.880
 ever. I've never had a headset like I've never done VR. So I am new to that. And this is the first

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:10.560
 time I feel like I'm just kind of like being cautious. Because I just know I've bought so

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:15.680
 many stupid devices that I've used for a week and then they set. And I just know this is going to

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.840
 be one of them for some reason, not that it's a stupid device. I think it's actually this cool

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:25.280
 moment where I think we're we're maybe heading toward better and better versions of this. And I

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:30.400
 think this is the beginning of it. But I just I do I know I'm not going to use it. Like I know I'm

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:34.640
 going to use it a little and then I'm not going to use it again. And that yeah, that's caused me

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:41.440
 to pause. Am I am I shaking my consumerism? Just a little bit. Yeah, it seems like it.

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:45.520
 So have you ever tried anything like this? I've the only VR experience I've ever had

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:52.400
 was it the the jump mania place or whatever it's called. It's like a trampoline place. We take

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:56.480
 our kids and they have a VR thing. We throw a snowball to each other. That's it. I've done it

00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.040
 with my son. This is like a very cool experience. If you've never tried any of this stuff, really.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:08.560
 Yeah, the downside is it's not like a gaming device. So you can't really have like the craziest VR

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:15.040
 experiences are games. Yeah. And the Mac world just doesn't do that. So for gaming is not going to be

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:20.240
 this device. But it is like, like I said, it is like really magical. It's impractical because

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:25.440
 you're not going to buy for them for your whole family. Right. If you're not considering buying one.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.760
 So like, when are you going to use it? Really? Like, it's just going to be kind of a solo device,

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.520
 but you can kind of like pull up cool stuff and like you can like share it and that each person

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:39.440
 tries it and whatever. But it's like a pure entertainment device. I don't think you're really

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.120
 going to, it's going to be part of your daily workflow. Not going to be like a replaced by

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:48.000
 monitor and just work on this thing. Yeah. Yeah. I'd love to like, like you said dinosaurs. My son,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.520
 my eight year old loves dinosaurs. Yeah, he would love it. Well, we watched Jurassic Park.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:59.120
 It was probably too soon. So I just forever I've wanted him to get to watch Jurassic Park,

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:04.720
 just like experience real dinosaurs. Forgot it's like a horror movie. And it's very dark and rainy.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:09.920
 And there's a giant T-Rex about to eat some kids. And it was, it was too much. We didn't make it

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:15.840
 all the way through it. And he has a hardly slept sense. I mean, he has, but like every night before

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.840
 bed, it's like there's, there's this new instilled fear in him. And when I thought about it, it's the

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.040
 first movie he's really seen. Like his, his poor little soul was completely untarnished from the

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.520
 outside world. He doesn't go to public school. Like he has not experienced any negative or like

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:36.640
 evil things in this world. And then I set him down and we watched Jurassic Park on my giant screen

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:43.840
 with the crazy audio and the rumbling like subs and all that. It was, it was too much. So if, if the

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:48.960
 VR experience were like a, you know, triceratops or like a plant eating. No. Okay, the VR experience

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:54.160
 is not scary. Not at all. Okay. Well, if it's a T-Rex in the room, it might be a bit much for him.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:00.080
 Yeah. I mean, okay. Yeah. I'm sure they have a an herbivore. Is that what they're called? Yeah.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.160
 The herbivore. Yeah. Yeah. That's what we're looking for. The ones that the meat eaters eat.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.480
 Yeah. Exactly. The big meat suit dinosaurs that just walk around and get eaten.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:16.000
 Yeah. So I think, I think your kids would find it like really fascinating. And I think there's like,

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:22.000
 again, the library is stuff. That's another weird thing. You can tell all the people that

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.200
 have apps for already didn't have a Vision Pro when they made the app. You can tell Apple didn't

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:33.760
 give them one. It was all in the simulator because it's compared to the native Apple ones. Like,

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:37.600
 they are really like janky and not worth it. Yeah. Oh, another cool thing that I didn't

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.640
 realize was, okay. So you know how the controls are, you look at stuff and you click and you can like,

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:49.200
 you've seen in all the demos. Yeah. But you can also pull any window close to you and run in front

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.080
 of you and you can touch it and like use it like an iPad. Okay. So you can like scroll through

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.400
 stuff like it's a normal iPad app. Yeah. So you allow those little details like really polished

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.920
 and like the Apple apps are very well done. But again, like it's a pure entertainment device

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:11.040
 that you kind of have to share with the people around you. So I have a couple more takes on this

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:18.720
 whole situation or just thoughts that one, I saw Alex response video and that was the first time

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:26.800
 I had seen what is it the quest? Yeah. Let's be real here. I don't care how much it costs.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:34.960
 Okay. It's $500. It looks ridiculous. Like, if everybody is like trying to compete with Apple on

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:40.720
 hardware, just like, don't be so bad at it. Like, what are those three little ovals on the front?

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:47.200
 It just looks hideous. Like, I can actually imagine a smaller version of this division pro,

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:52.640
 people wearing it around unironically and people getting used to people wearing them around

01:03:52.640 --> 01:04:00.640
 unironically. I can imagine a future like where we wear these things and it's not super weird.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:04.880
 Maybe that's the dystopian future people don't want. I don't know. Time will tell. But I can

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:09.200
 remember it being weird when people had AirPods in and it was kind of like, and then it's just normal

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:14.480
 and like, yeah, I think I could imagine it with what Apple has built, like the aesthetics of it.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:20.000
 It looks like a thing that it's not a huge leap to imagine. But like that quest, like,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.440
 I guess it's a different thing. It's a gaming device. Like you're saying, you never, you would

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.880
 always do that at home. Yeah, at home alone and good thing. And they also have the meta

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.600
 Rayman stuff, right? Oh, right. Yeah, I have those.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:38.320
 Again, devices I buy that I don't use. I wore them on the podcast once. I think it's last time I

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:43.280
 wore them. Yeah, to me, it is exciting to think this is the first generation and it could be the

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:49.200
 iPhone moment where this totally changes computing for the next 10 years. I know it's a long ways

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:54.720
 from that right now. Like it's not there, but that part of it makes me want to get it, even if I

01:04:54.720 --> 01:05:01.040
 don't use it just to like experience it in these early days. I had the first iPhone kind of like

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:07.040
 same, same reasons that I would want to have it. But yeah, I just, I don't think I'll use it and

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:12.720
 that is a problem. Yeah, I think the thing that was interesting about Zuckerberg's thing was

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:21.440
 the price gap is so massive, right? It's like the $500 device and the $3,600 device. Yeah. And I

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:28.720
 honestly can see someone getting something in the middle that's kind of compromises on everything

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:35.040
 a little bit better. Because the the $500 device is missing some of the stuff that Apple that the

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:39.680
 vision pro, some stuff that makes a vision pro feel magical, like the eye tracking and the hand

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:44.400
 tracking and all of that. If you double the price of the quest, I'm sure you could get those stuff

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:50.240
 in and the quality of that it just is software. So if you put in the effort, yeah, you can probably

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:55.600
 get close to that. And that really like all that tracking stuff is a big part of what makes this

01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:00.960
 feel seamless. So if you can get that at like $1,000 price point, definitely more reasonable. But again,

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:06.000
 still the solo entertainment device is just a hard sell. Like we don't really have anything

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000
 else in that category. Like what entertainment device do you have that's like a one person

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.160
 experience today? Yeah, I don't have one person entertainment experiences, Dax. Yeah, I have kids.

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:22.080
 But like, even if you don't have kids, like you, it's like, I don't think it's the widest market.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:27.360
 Oh, you're saying like, it's not a great category. Oh, I got you. Yeah, it's okay. You have anything

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:31.680
 that's in that shape of like it's an entertainment device that can only be used one time. Trust for

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:39.280
 me. No, yeah, I guess not. That's very expensive. The idea that like anybody's going to compete with

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:44.560
 Apple on this, it's like there's just people like me who will always I'll just always buy the Apple

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.280
 thing because I know it makes me feel a certain way, not because like I have it and it's a status

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.520
 thing. It makes me feel a certain way when I hold it and when I look at it and when I touch it,

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:59.040
 and like looking at the Quest is just the epitome of like they don't care about the details

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:02.800
 and I care about the details. I'm not buying the experience. I don't care what the software

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:08.720
 experience is like. I don't care if I don't use it. It's how it makes me feel the actual product.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:13.120
 And that's why I'll always buy Apple products. And I don't care. I'm not a fan boy. I don't like

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:18.800
 have some allegiance to Apple. Like, I just I like the way they care about every single detail

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:22.880
 because I care about every single detail. And I know some people don't care, but I care. Yeah,

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:26.800
 I think that but the thing to remember though is there's some categories that Apple just is not

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:33.520
 hidden. And one of those is gaming and a big use case for this is gaming. Do people people

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:38.240
 game on iPhone, right? I guess that's all third party. I think a big use case for these headsets

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:46.000
 is like really high and gaming experiences. And that's just not a space that Apple is in. So yeah,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.360
 I'm also not interested in that space. I'm interested in us like having this. Maybe it's

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.400
 contacts. Maybe that's what it's going to have to eventually be. I don't know how they're ever

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:59.920
 going to get tech into contacts, but just like an augmented experience in everyday life.

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:04.960
 Like having digital stuff available. I don't know. Maybe that's just maybe we don't need it.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:10.160
 I don't know. I'm talking myself out of it. Like maybe that's too much looking for I think

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.400
 for me, the incremental step is something that replaces my monitor. I think that's like the first

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:18.320
 thing something that is like a no brainer. This is better than having a monitor on your desk.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.520
 Like we're going to look around the world and there's not going to be monitors on people's desk

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.880
 anymore. They're just going to be a little device that's sitting there for them to pick up to work

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:30.480
 on. Yeah, but that's the the eye strain question. Like is that is that human biology that we just

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:34.400
 can't change? And there's no way there's ever going to be a device right in front of our face

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:40.800
 that doesn't cause eye problems. That's the question, I guess. Yeah, I mean, the other angle is that

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:46.320
 there's no work to do anymore because AI does it. Oh, that's true. Yeah, we're heading toward an AI.

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:52.400
 What's the word? Not dystopia? An AI? What's the good version of dystopia?

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:59.520
 Utopia. Utopia. That's the one. We're just headed toward this like world where nobody does anything

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.720
 because the AI just makes all our food and does all our work. I laugh really hard the other day

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.040
 because you see Ken Wheeler replying to the Sam Altman being like, you're going to turn

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:15.040
 into fucking batteries, aren't you? That's awesome. What was the I didn't see that tweet?

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.960
 What was the Sam Altman seven trillion thing? I don't see the news. I just see the reaction to

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:23.120
 the news on Twitter. And sometimes I miss the context. I found this thing so annoying. I like,

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:27.040
 I even tweeted about and like deleted it right away because I'm like, I'm just not going to

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.600
 engage in this topic. So there is this figure going around that Sam Altman is trying to raise

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:36.240
 seven trillion dollars. And everyone just ran with it. Every like media outlet, every like whatever

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:41.760
 just talking about. Oh, he didn't say it. It's like a rumor. It's floating around from some talks,

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.920
 some presentation he gave like some private presentation that was related to fundraising.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:50.560
 Yeah. He's obviously not raising seven trillion dollars. Like, what is seven trillion dollars?

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.120
 Can you even comprehend seven? If you if he was raising seven trillion dollars today,

01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:02.400
 that's valuing his company today at like, let's say like 50 trillion dollars or so modestly.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:08.160
 I guess we do have trillion dollar in the public company scale now. Like Apple is a trillion

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:13.440
 dollar company. Yeah. So if you're investing in that today, that means you're hoping that they

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:19.360
 become a quadrillion dollar company one day. Yeah. Right. Obviously, this makes no sense.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:24.000
 There's like, this is not what was going on. I think what's going on was he was talking about

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.800
 the impact that AI stuff will have and the whole industry that will spawn and like all the stuff

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:36.160
 that needs to be in place as a society for that. And all those collectively over like 10 years

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.480
 will require like trillions of dollars in investment. That's my guess to like put that

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.760
 seven trillion dollar thing in context. But I was kept imagining like imagine you're Sam Alman.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:51.440
 And you're giving these for this presentation to whatever. And some information leaks. And the

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.040
 next day you just see everyone being like, he is raising seven trillion dollars. Like we can use

01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:00.000
 that to solve world hunger. Like this is so fucked up. You must think that the whole world is stupid.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.480
 Like you are already building this. You're building this thing. That's like, the whole world is stupid

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:10.240
 decks. That's the thing. But like it's not great that someone that's building something that's

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:15.280
 better than humans potentially is having this experience where the whole world is so clearly

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:20.400
 stupid and people are so so dumb. Yeah. Is it a journalism problem? I just like,

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:24.800
 I know some people were just joking about it, but did the public run with it? Like,

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:29.040
 did you just spread on Twitter or did some journalist report that you know what I'm saying? Like,

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:34.000
 no, there was plenty of very serious sub stack articles being like, we could do better things

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:41.360
 with this money. Just have like any common sense. I don't understand how anyone jumps there. I

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:45.520
 thought he said he wanted to raise seven trillion dollars. Like, why would he say that? That's dumb.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.760
 Clearly, he doesn't want to raise seven trillion dollars. But no, it's just this thing where people

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:55.520
 are dumb. People are dumb. It's just it's a sad reality. Yeah. But like, the problem is I'm okay

01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:02.000
 with a dumb person being dumb. What's annoying is someone being dumb, but then taking the role of

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.640
 like an intellectual that's going to like write an article about. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:12.560
 Like, they're they're like dumb, but they're in positions of like, they should know better.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:19.280
 Like, if you're going to have a sub stack and write your newsletter, you should know better.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.960
 Like, just know anything. It's like when I watch a movie, we just watch something there tonight

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:30.160
 where like, do they have anybody consulting on like facts about technology? I know it's hard

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.840
 for like being a developer and watching a movie that has a software developer in it or whatever.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:38.080
 And like, I'm sure doctors feel same when they watch doctor stuff. But like, why can't they just

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:43.120
 have one person in the room that's like, actually, if you put that in the movie, you look like an

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:47.920
 idiot. Yeah. Just like, just so you know. Yeah. And maybe they do and maybe they just do it anyway,

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:51.680
 because they're like, whatever, nobody knows the difference. Well, there's the reverse examples

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.880
 of this have been really great. So Mr. Robot is a TV show, and it's all about like a hacker.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:04.080
 And it's really surrealist, very good show. And all this stuff in there is almost like overly

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:10.320
 accurate. Like, they really had people like, you know, that knew what they were talking about.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.680
 And it's of course, it's dramatized and like, he's able to do this stuff and practice you

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:19.200
 wouldn't be able to. But technically, it's not totally out of the question. Like, it's stuff that

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:25.200
 like, you know, makes sense, like, it could make sense. Silicon Valley also, I think captures a lot

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:30.320
 of the specific details. And I always wonder, like, who are these people that were able to describe

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:36.160
 still like deep Silicon Valley type things that can also like turn that into like a great joke?

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:40.320
 I always wonder what that process is like. Like, I don't think it's the same person that like,

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.680
 deeply understands what these companies are like. That's also like turning it into a joke.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:48.720
 It's more of a relationship between the creative mind and the person who has the information.

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:52.320
 Yeah. Yeah. So Mike, Joe, you still working so far. Yeah. So I do know the creator will

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:58.640
 have some background in it. But yeah, it's a it's impressive when when media does that.

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:04.560
 Get it right. Go back for a second to people being dumb and AI, try out Google Gemini,

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:10.560
 the advanced one. No. So it's a it's like a it's chat GPT. It's a competitor to chat GPT.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:13.520
 Didn't they do bard? They renamed bard to Gemini. And that's like,

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:19.520
 I hate Google so much. They're just so dumb. I know Google. They just got rid of Google podcasts,

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.440
 by the way. So if you used to listen, just on Google podcast, sorry, Google sucks.

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:29.440
 You have to listen somewhere else. Sorry, continue. Gemini. So it's good.

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.960
 So they they've had a few different versions of it and they've released their advanced version.

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:37.840
 Okay. And it's just like chat GPT. I tried it casually. Frank has been using it a little bit

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:44.240
 more directly. And it's good. It's as good as chat GPT in a lot of ways. They did some things

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.320
 better. Like some of the UI is a little bit more rich. It's not just like raw text. Like there's

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.720
 more interesting stuff that's in there. I don't know if in net, that's like objectively good or bad.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:15:01.040
 But worst case, I think it's a reasonable equivalent. Like you could reasonably use

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:05.440
 either and have like GPT for it's like, yeah, right. The best experience on chat GPT

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:11.840
 is very similar to this. Okay. You go and try to use it and they charge you 20 bucks a month

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.400
 to sign up. Okay. And this seems like it makes sense.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:18.320
 Gemini.com. I'm going right now. Is that I don't know where I know that's turn your money

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:25.360
 into crypto assets. Yeah. It's funny. You want to turn your money into a Google.com.

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:32.000
 So it costs $20 a month, which they clearly just copied GPT's pricing model. Yeah.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.680
 Right. Yeah. Actually, we just made that number up as well. Yeah. You are a company the size

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:43.600
 of Google that has billions and billions and billions of dollars in profit. You have this

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.720
 competing company that's an existential threat to you. You built a product that's as good.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:54.000
 Why are you charging for it? Literally, if you've made it free. Oh, by the way,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.400
 it can also it also has access to your emails and all Google workspace stuff. So like, that's

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:03.680
 a good nice integration. That's awesome. Yeah. If they made it free, literally overnight,

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:10.160
 why would anyone use chat GPT? They could just put a huge like obstacle in front of OpenAI.

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:13.680
 Yeah. That's a great point. And for some reason, they're like, they charge $20. So we should charge

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:19.600
 $20. It just makes no sense to me. That doesn't make sense. Or at least like, why not do it cheaper?

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:25.040
 Like, yeah. Why? Why not compete on? Oh, it's two months free. I didn't know that. Okay.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.760
 That's two months free, but still it is. I mean, it's a huge threat, right? Like, yeah.

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:38.240
 I do feel like it has to affect internet search over time, right? LLMs and their ability to surface

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:44.400
 information. Yep. And like, that's like an exit threat to your company. Why are you charging this

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:48.560
 made up number for it? Which I, here's another funny thing. I was talking about this other day.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.280
 Someone making fun of themselves was like, I thought I was super smart and I wasn't going to pay

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:57.920
 chat GPT 20 bucks a month. I was just going to like use their API and just pay for exactly what I

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:03.120
 use. But they like canceled their chat GPT subscription and switched to using it to record the API.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:09.120
 And they were like, oh, my bill ended up being hired. What that means, the point of number is

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:13.360
 entirely made up and doesn't make sense. And like, for a lot of people, open AI is probably losing

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:17.680
 money on anyway. So like copying that number, it makes no sense. You might as well make it zero.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:22.320
 Well, now I want to play with it. I think I remember the announcement, the Gemini announcement,

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:28.880
 when it's like the multimodal thing. It's like the first LLM that's been, it's like,

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:32.960
 trained on all these different types of, not just text, but images. Well, that video was

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:38.320
 fake. It was completely fake. I don't know if you saw it. Oh, was it? Yeah, it was totally fake.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.920
 And it was, I'm like so embarrassed for them. They did that. Why? Yeah, why would they make a

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:47.120
 fake video if it's a real product? Or maybe it wasn't really it. It's not as good as it is in the

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:53.200
 video. It's actually just like tag GPT. Oh, okay. So the video was like, vaporware, what it's going

01:17:53.200 --> 01:18:03.600
 to be like someday maybe. Yeah, exactly. The much like ion. The thing that I'm annoying though is,

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:09.600
 you know how back in the day there was just Netflix and you wanted to watch something,

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.600
 you would just open up Netflix. That was a one streaming service. If you wanted to have an

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:18.480
 internet video experience, that's what you opened up. Now there's like 500 and you're like, where

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:24.160
 is this thing on? And it's like a mess. Yeah, I really don't want that to happen with

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:28.800
 these LMS. Like, I don't want to be like, okay, I'm going to go talk to chat GPT.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:32.080
 Oh, chat GPT didn't give me a good answer. So after a minute of trying, I'm going to go

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:36.560
 to Google Gemini. And I just don't want that. It's like, yeah, I don't want the fragmentation

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.000
 again. Like Gemini is better for this, but then chat GPT is better for this. And I use this and I

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.560
 just, yeah, I don't want to watch this football game. I got to sign up for Paramount Plus. What?

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:52.000
 I guess that didn't the chat GPT didn't Sam Allen. Didn't he say there was like this future of

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:58.000
 multiple like specific GPTs? I mean, they you can create custom GPTs now. Isn't the idea that

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.040
 there will be didn't he even say there won't be one to rule them off? Yeah, but like, you don't

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:09.520
 want to have to tag them. So currently, in chat GPT, there are there are like specialized GPTs,

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.000
 but you have to tag them. So you have to like know that I'm doing this thing. And I know that

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.600
 there's this GPT that is like the SST GPT exists and it can write SST code. I'm going to tag that.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:23.120
 That's not a good experience. You need to automatically select it. And you don't want it

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:28.560
 to be for me. Can we just have a GPT that selects our GPTs for us? Just GPTs all the way down.

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.920
 What is a GPT? It's like an AWS account. What is this layer of abstraction?

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:32.720
 Nobody knows.

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:40.080
 Try to ask me how much you weigh complete change of topic. I saw that. Yeah.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:45.120
 Do we just say that on the podcast? My weight is a fluctuating it's it's not a static number.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:53.440
 A couple months ago, I was 188 pounds. And then around Christmas, I think I was 208.

01:19:53.440 --> 01:20:00.640
 And that's 20 pounds increase. Now I'm right now at 198. So I'm 10 pounds down from then.

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:05.280
 I'm I'm all over the place. And it depends on what I'm competing at, which Saturday I'm competing

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:11.040
 in the 195 division. So I will be exactly 195 pounds in two days. I got to lose three pounds in

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:15.680
 two days. No big deal. Is that hard? I have no context for it. You would think so, but it's

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:20.160
 actually not. It's really not. You just don't wonder. I just don't know. Well, there's just so much

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:25.920
 food in your body in a given day. So if like you can basically lose two, three pounds, I mean,

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.800
 depending on how big you are, I'm a 200 pound man. Like for my wife who's a hundred and not in their

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:36.000
 mind. My wife is smaller. I don't know why I think a thing you don't do is like say other

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.600
 people's weight. But for somebody who's half my size, you know, maybe it's different. But for me,

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.640
 I can lose two, three pounds pretty fast. Water weight. And yeah, just eating less. That's more

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:52.400
 than you asked for trash. I'm sorry. Is anyone is this funny thought for my party at React Miami?

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:58.560
 It'd be funny if anyone else also did you did too? And then you can do a little like fight in my

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:05.120
 backyard roll. Well, Melky does. Oh, it's true. He's trash coming. No, a trash refuses to go to Miami

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:10.960
 trash. Oh, that sucks. Every time I ask him about it, he's just like, it would be bad for me. And I

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:16.080
 did like don't really know what he's talking about. This is a wholesome place, sir. Okay, so me and

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:21.840
 Melky, let's do like a pay-per-view. Let's like, let's have a featured jiu-jitsu fight night thing.

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:26.560
 I don't know. In Miami, that'd be fun. I've put on two pounds of lean mass, by the way,

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:33.040
 in a month, in a month of training with my personal trainer, Sam, they scanned me at the beginning,

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:38.000
 and they just scanned me a couple days ago, two pounds lean mass. So this is probably the last

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.400
 time I get to compete in the 1.5 division, because I'm just going to be huge. That's where I'm headed.

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:48.880
 I'm headed towards, you know, months from now. Who knows? 210 pounds? What's the weight class

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:52.640
 called again? Like the highest one? Is it like super heavyweight or something?

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:56.800
 Super heavyweight, yeah, something. It's like 225 plus. So my friend who also does a jiu-jitsu,

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:01.680
 he's like, he doesn't weigh a lot. And what's in that super light one? It's called like

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:07.680
 featherweight or something featherweight or something. It's just so like demeaning or masculine.

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:13.120
 It really is. Yeah, I debated, like, do I just want to be thin and wiry and compete in the

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:18.400
 195 forever? But it's like, there's the absolute division. So you can compete with people in all

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:22.640
 weights. And it's like in the real world scenario, I want to be able to compete with anybody, no matter

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:27.440
 how big they are, and the smaller you are, the less chance you could really compete with the big,

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:32.480
 big people. So I don't want to be 225, but I do want to kind of be like, we've spent way too

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:35.760
 long talking about my weight. What are we doing? I need to go eat. It's like we're an hour and a

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.960
 half into this podcast. Yeah, you need to not eat because you're trying to lose two pounds.

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.920
 Yeah, no, I still have to eat because I'm shaking. I'm going to have a couple nuts. It's probably

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:48.320
 yeah, probably what I'll eat. Yeah, if you guys have low blood sugar right now, it's why you're shaking.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:51.120
 Yeah, I think so. I have blood sugar issues. I'm pretty sure.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:57.120
 To the adrenaline. Not like diabetic. But anyway, let's stop talking about whatever we're talking

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:02.400
 about. Because this is a long one. Do I say a lot? I feel like that's an hour and 42. This is the

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:10.080
 longest one. Maybe we've ever done maybe. Wait, 22? Not 42 42. An hour and 42? No, that's what

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:17.360
 I mentioned. My Twitch stream is on for. Yeah, I was late. Yeah, it's less hour and 25. Anyway,

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:22.000
 now we're talking about that too much. Goodbye, I guess. What do we, we're 80 episodes in. I still

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.920
 don't know what to say to you when we're done. Just like, see you. See you. See you next time. Bye

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:44.240
 Bye.
