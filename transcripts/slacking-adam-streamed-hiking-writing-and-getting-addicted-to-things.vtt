WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
 Are you going to tell me about how you have fiber right into your closet again, it's in my closet like I can see where the fiber

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:13.340
 Yeah, like probably twice a month I would say

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:43.280
 How'd you're how'd your stream end up going good my throat hurts apparently streaming is

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.820
 Taxing on your voice. I didn't remember this. Do you feel like riding a bike or was it you feel off?

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.480
 Oh, yeah, no, I mean all the streaming part was fine, but I

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.940
 Just forgot they're like talking for four hours straight

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.720
 actually hurt you

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.620
 Did you you finish so for some context? I'm building a little app for Jason Langsorf

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.440
 I've learned with Jason

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.720
 He's making a video. We've got four devs making the same app or the same premise

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.440
 Like we're all building a slack app to make our lives easier

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.060
 He's just kind of comparing and contrasting how different developers solve problems

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.680
 So I'm building a slack app using their new next generation app platform. I think they called it something like that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.800
 And the idea is that it will summarize using

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.780
 LLM's it'll summarize like a thread and your slack or whatever a bunch of messages from your team that you don't want to read

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.300
 It gives you a little summary. So at the end of the stream. I had it

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.200
 It was the communication was happening. So slack was able to hit the API on the API side and get back the response

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.480
 Now I'm just I'm triggering it differently. So I was it was kind of manual on the slack side

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.720
 Now I'm gonna have it trigger off of like an emoji

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.580
 Like if you put an emoji on the thread like a robot emoji or something. It'll send you a summary

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.160
 That's the idea. So I'll go a little bit left and I'm making an icon because I'm a nerd

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:15.200
 Situation a lot where you're like I'm looking at a giant thread of slack messages, and I need to know what's going on

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.200
 I don't use slack

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:25.160
 So now do not bonus for yourself at all so when I was in a slack workspace last

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.840
 It was the biggest company I've ever worked for there's like a hundred and fifty devs something like that and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.120
 yeah, lots of channels that I did not keep up on and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.640
 It'd be nice. I think to be like hey, what's going on over there? What are they talking about?

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.880
 I'm in a weird situation with slack where it was

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.140
 So central to everything I did for so long that I

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.260
 Put other stuff into slack as well like me and Liz

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.160
 We only communicate through slack. We do everything through slack

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:07.000
 Even me and my friends like my like the closest circle of friends like we primarily communicate through a shared slack group as all friends do

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.880
 Yeah, well, it's just convenient because most I think about it this way, right?

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.880
 There are certain apps on people's computers that are always gonna be there and always gonna be up

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.180
 And for all my friends that was slack cuz like they had their work stuff on there

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.920
 Alcoholics

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.360
 All my friends I met you work too, so like yeah, so yeah, everyone just had it up

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.060
 So I'm like I might as well put the social stuff in there too because then it's like not competing with the solar

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.720
 Yeah, that makes sense, but but now my work is no longer in

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.240
 Fragmented again where SST is on discord

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.120
 Yes, and this is a huge pink is now it's have two

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.700
 Chat apps up so kind of defeats the purpose of what I everything I just said. Yeah, you need texts.com. Sorry. Thanks

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.760
 Yeah, okay, I don't know I don't I don't believe in that idea

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.680
 I could talk about it some more, but you go ahead. Yeah, so now I have both slag and discord up

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.060
 And now I'm like can I get everyone to like make one more move and just everyone's on this for now until like

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.060
 The other issue that slack is just kind of getting

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.560
 Good here. I'm actually very upset with slack to be honest. I'm upset that they let I mean they sold right

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.080
 Yeah, it's a sales force and like it's obviously I'm like is there a dumber company in the world in Salesforce?

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.480
 What does Salesforce even do like what do they do?

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.880
 Does anyone know it's what they do it literally everything. Oh, really? Okay. Well, their app is again everything app

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.920
 Is it when I was like they do everything so they do nothing kind of things? Yeah, exactly everything at all

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.000
 Terribly, but the benefit is it does everything. Okay, sounds awful

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.040
 I've never used it never had to I guess yeah, I'm upset with slack for

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.440
 They just like lost gas. I feel like they did so well so fast and I think everyone

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.960
 understandably was very satisfied with

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.800
 The outcome their success like where they got to and it just never went anywhere after it

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.880
 Like disc how do they let discord scoop up the whole open source world that makes no sense to me at all

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:19.120
 It's actually the reason yeah, it's because of it. It's expensive right slack is just kind of prohibitively expensive for like an open source community

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.280
 Yeah, we were paying a thousand dollars a month at one point for SST

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.600
 And here's why it's actually a bad thing right because most of our customers use slack at work if

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.560
 We were still on slack. It's a very convenient thing for them to also be in our SEC slack or for people like and I know

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.560
 other open source companies do this where they have

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.720
 For customers paying for like prior to support they get a dedicated slack shared

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.840
 Black connect channel thing, which I think it was like a fantastic

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.720
 Like experience and they just didn't care like we tried so much to be like hey

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.640
 Like can you help us and clearly discord was like scooping up that whole?

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.200
 Face and they just didn't fight back and they let it happen. They're like no, we're not gonna offer some kind of like

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:05.640
 Cheaper tier for big communities. The community is not just open source. Are they a public company? They were they were a public company for a little bit

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.720
 Or bought them like is it working out for them? Are they like are they not do that care about discord?

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:19.840
 They're just competing with like Microsoft. Well, they're getting crushed there too because the Microsoft Teams, which is a genuinely terrible product

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.560
 Their numbers are like insane, which is understandable because it's just like they just have this audience

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.760
 That's huge. Yeah pays money and we'll just do the incremental thing that works with all the other other stuff

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.920
 Which is just gonna be teams I saw when I was in New York

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.160
 I actually saw the slack IPO like they could always decorate the stock market. Oh, yeah

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.320
 The big flag outside and I remember seeing this like thing when they went public just interesting fact

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.280
 Yeah, I might be making all that up, but that doesn't seem familiar like a real memory that I had. Yeah

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.120
 I just that whole world like a

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.840
 enterprise software just think about people who use Microsoft Teams like whoa

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.000
 It's it's all just gonna come down right like

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.800
 So all that stuff fake or no, I think it's the most real thing ever. Oh really? Okay. Yeah, I think it's the opposite

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:19.440
 I think it's it's like all the medium small to medium-sized businesses that like you'd never hear about but that employees like most of the world

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.080
 Yeah, they just are always gonna be on Microsoft because why would they ever do any kind of dramatic change?

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.880
 Hmm, I guess so they're either gonna die or they're just never gonna change, you know

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.720
 I've just been I've been so disconnected from that world my entire career and life

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.880
 I've never worked in a place where it's like

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:42.480
 I have an IT department and they dish out Microsoft licenses. Yeah, I don't know

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.160
 Kind of bizarre so Liz is uncle's business. So he has this

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:52.240
 fairly large health care business in Miami and I visited their like HQ and

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.440
 I visited their IT team and it's just like it's all these people wearing

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.880
 Like they're like they dressed up for work

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:05.440
 They had like you know colored shirts and ties and all that and they're crammed in this tiny room just like

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.960
 They like put desks all around the perimeter and everyone's like facing outward and like they're so crammed in there

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.800
 and they have this like one giant screen monitoring like

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:19.200
 they're like tiny little like co-located data center with like their servers and like all this stuff and

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:25.880
 Yeah, I mean, they're you know, so running is all this stuff on premise. It's all Microsoft stuff

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:32.760
 That just blows my mind and yeah, they'd like serve like hundreds of employees and like all their locations and and all the various software

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:39.160
 They run they also they self-host everything. It's that's just nuts, right? Like that shouldn't exist. Am I

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:45.000
 Am I wrong? Well, the tricky thing is so the reason I was there was her uncle was like, okay

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.320
 Should we be moving to cloud like he just knew that he knew something was all about that

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.680
 But he has wanted me to go look to see mm-hmm. Are they doing it right?

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:58.560
 Like he just can't tell whether the whoever's running it is like scamming him with the stuff. They're saying you're not

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.000
 Yeah, so I went and like I I audited everything and I was like

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.320
 Yeah, if I was building this company from scratch today would look very different

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:14.760
 but there's absolutely no reason why you should go and try to innovate here like you can maybe if you did it all right and you

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.600
 Like moved everything which impossible you're not gonna do that

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.000
 It's like in a fail and things are gonna go wrong like you would maybe save like 50 or 60%

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.640
 Plus, it's like the avoid a distraction of like managing all those people

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.560
 But I'm just like there's just probably a place for you to place those risks

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:37.480
 Yeah, so they're gonna be on that forever saving 50 to 60% and not having to manage an entire IT department sounds like

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.760
 Not insignificant

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.120
 Yeah quality of life improvements, but just a business at that size

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:49.440
 It's just like that's there's like another things that could be more impactful that are more like related to the business

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.440
 It's just like a random like efficiency thing which yeah

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:58.000
 Yeah, I just saw it like I look at it and it bothers me how yeah much better it could be but there's just

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.560
 Rationality there's nothing to do

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.240
 interesting

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.840
 Feels like if I mean I guess like companies won't just move to cloud

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:12.080
 They'll just eventually die because companies die like not exactly that reason. It's just like companies don't live forever

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.080
 So I guess new companies are being built and those new companies are likely being built on cloud

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.800
 But not really yeah, it's a lot. I'm just being built on it's so dumb

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.400
 Why I don't understand it's not even the cloud versus I know some of the Microsoft thing like yeah

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.080
 There are new companies being built, but they're just on like Microsoft cloud like it's not

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:37.640
 Running office locally. It's like the hosted version of office and the hosted outlook and the hosted everything

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.720
 they just have

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.240
 Just destroyed that space and like nobody can

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:50.800
 Wedge it away from that these people use like Google talks and Gmail. Yeah, I mean here's not a decision tree goes

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.520
 Right. It's like I need all my employees need laptops. I'm not buying them all Mac with pros

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:02.480
 Now you're then then after that part of this entry. You're now with Microsoft for everything. I gotcha

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.080
 Yeah, I think like such a startup bro

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.400
 Yeah, it's just like yeah, ultimately, there's cheap windows laptops. I'm just telling you on the stream

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.560
 This is totally off job. Yeah at the end after I'd already left like I'd already rated teach

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.160
 Yeah, somebody posted a first-time message and chat and they said

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.240
 You're the guy who's stuck between PHP and JavaScript

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.800
 Just like on a delay

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:39.920
 When you were so convinced that you're gonna build something in Laravel and you just never did like I predicted oh man

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.240
 I never did I sewed it like you predicted. I was just so distracted. I've got so much going on

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:51.520
 Yeah, I know I totally would have built something player. Oh, you're gonna. So you're gonna keep claiming that. Okay. I guess technically

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.440
 I'm not yeah, no, I'm so I'm not right until you die. I guess it's exactly

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.280
 I'm gonna be like a hundred and

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.600
 And you know, you still won't have built anything

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:13.720
 Did you get the new iPhone? I think you said you're getting it for your wife Casey? Yeah, I got one for Casey

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.120
 Have you tried like did you I feel like you did or something? I did I did yeah? Oh, no

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.120
 I think I saw Theo mentioned something about log recording tell me more

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:28.840
 Like just like a camera like a DSLR does log yeah that there's like a log mode now you get like this

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.360
 Well, it's funny because people look at it and they're like wait, I thought it was supposed to look good

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.960
 But you know you get that like completely flat like no saturation really washed out

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.600
 Yeah, so it's kind of cool because now I'm like

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.200
 Especially if we want to make more content as a team for SSD

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.760
 I don't have to be like hey everyone go get these like expensive cameras that you're only gonna use for this one purpose

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.560
 I think we can just be like okay. I want to upgrade your phone and

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.040
 That's basically good enough

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:02.780
 That we do so yeah, it's like it really feels like a pro ish type of device now

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:09.560
 Which is pretty awesome like workflow. Yeah. Yeah, so yeah shoot the Nexus ST video on iPhones

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.960
 Maybe you can make it on an Apple commercial or something

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:18.080
 Well, I saw that people like famous directors have done that now where they shoot the whole thing on on iPhones Apple

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.240
 Always has all those like images and videos during the launch events that are like shot from iPhone

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:30.720
 Yeah, incredible. Yeah, I mean there's that but like the guy that made oceans 13 and all the ocean movies

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.920
 Yeah, I love the ocean movies. Yeah. Yeah, so I think he he's like really committed to only shooting on iPhones now really

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.320
 Like he shoots movies on iPhones. Yeah

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.680
 Did they pay him to do this? I mean, he's a really successful director

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.800
 So he can probably just do whatever he wants, but yeah high-flying bird

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.640
 I never saw it, but child an iPhone 8. It's a movie like in the theaters

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.600
 I don't know if it was as widely distributed as other stuff

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.600
 But so how was your return to twitch? Did you enjoy streaming again? Are you gonna do it a lot more now?

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.000
 Was it nice, but you're not really gonna do it again. It's about opportunities

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.400
 I don't I don't know how many opportunities right now. I'll have to stream

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.640
 Today I really needed to because I well

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.840
 I just needed to make this thing

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.680
 I needed to take a block of time and do this for Jason because I said I would do it

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.200
 So that was kind of a forcing actually agreed at things. Why do you agree to do things?

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.840
 I don't know Jason. I always regret it. I do every single time I ever say I'll do something

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:30.600
 So I almost I have a local friend who's a teacher at a local school who asked me to do a presentation on

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.240
 Computer science at a career day thing at his school

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.240
 And I didn't text him back for like two weeks

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:40.040
 Because it was just like painful cuz he's a good friend like we were like really close in college

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:44.560
 I just I wanted to say yes because I also have this thing where like I really wish

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.880
 Students especially in rural areas like this were learning about computer science more

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.320
 Than they are like I it saved me from like a very

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.400
 impoverished area anyway

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.760
 So I have this like value and he's like a friend and it's like I feel like I should do it

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.060
 It's like I'll have to make a slide presentation and all this stuff. So I text it back after two weeks. I'm like

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.800
 Okay, yeah, I'll do it if you still need some basic

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.680
 Yeah, I'll give you a call tomorrow and he called and someone had already taken the spot

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.000
 Someone's already doing CS from the local college. Were you relieved?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 So yeah, so relieved because it's like more now like I don't feel bad that I'm not doing it

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.760
 I didn't say no just I couldn't do it. So this is kind of same thing. We're like

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:27.200
 Well, they're very different, but Jason's just somebody I really look up to like he was one of the first dev content creators

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.500
 I ever saw any of this stuff. So him asking me to do this was just kind of like wow

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.160
 That's that's so cool

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.240
 I want to do it because I don't want to say no and then they'll never think of me again. I don't know

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:44.840
 So I said yes, but immediately you just start regretting and dreading the like action item

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.680
 I have a deadline and like a date. I have to do a thing. Bye. Oh

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.240
 Hey do on Monday. Yeah

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.340
 Well, that's a whole week. Is it Monday today? No, it's Thursday. Oh my god

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:07.120
 Have you been yeah, I have not been able to keep track of the weeks of the days at all. I have no kid went

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:14.500
 Is it October? It's October. Yeah, I do I hate whenever like I got to go in person for something like a

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.840
 Insurance form or something. I have to write the date or like on a check and it's like what the hey, it's it

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.720
 Yeah, like 13th, and I'm thinking like I don't know

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:30.720
 Know what I struggle with I struggle with the physical act of writing

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:36.800
 I haven't like really written 10 years and it's just like my usual 10 years range my default number

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.360
 Yeah, everything you did. Yeah, go ahead. I wasn't saying like my hands like shake and like hurts to write yes

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.320
 And like my handwriting is non-existent anymore

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:50.880
 Because it's like every other month that I have to write a physical check or something somebody does some work or something here

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.080
 and it's like

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.360
 There's just very few instances in the year that I have to write and I realize like that's yeah

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:03.960
 It's been 10 15 years of that like I've just not really had to write much and our kid our oldest Asa

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.160
 He hates writing like of all the subjects in school

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:15.800
 He loves he enjoys doing some of us like math. He enjoys it. He just hates having to write out stuff

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:21.440
 Like he would just sit there and do it with you like telling you the answers or if you could write for him

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:27.680
 But he just hates physically writing and it's hard to be like you got to learn to write because I just don't write

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.760
 And I wonder if I just be teaching him to type and like forget this stupid

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.760
 I don't know writing with your dumb hands

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.880
 There's something about the act of writing that helps with the learning of the thing

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.480
 I don't know is there could typing did the same thing? I think maybe but I'm gonna think about math

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:50.760
 I'm like I I see how that's like a tool to like understand what's happening kind of

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:56.160
 Like even something like more complex math in my head. I like sometimes visualize what I would have written

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.080
 I mean he ends up writing it like we he does have to just write yeah

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.200
 It's the thing. It's the thing. He likes the least out of all of school

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:09.120
 Like especially having to write out words lots of them like he reads like a book a day

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.640
 The kid has read

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.920
 Hundreds maybe thousands of books at this point way more books that I've ever read

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.960
 He's just constantly reading but hate writing and I don't know how much I can fall from for it

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.720
 Just feels like a useless skill. Maybe it just doesn't matter because to be honest if I couldn't write

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.920
 I mean at this point I like can't write and it just doesn't really affect my life besides filling out

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:36.640
 Random DMV or yeah, right we had to learn that cursive. That was totally yeah

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.440
 I mean I was just thinking about that how we had to like trace the thing and I still kind of know the paper that like

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.680
 How like divide into three horizontal lines and all that

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.520
 Completely a waste of time. We spent so much time doing that

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:55.040
 I mean you realize most of school once you get older like there's mostly just daycare like you were just being

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.600
 Kept somewhere so your parents could enjoy their lives. Well, not really

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.520
 The european mind cannot comprehend

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:16.240
 Yeah, it's uh, yeah, this is dake. I mean it's yeah, it sucks

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.760
 I try to think about it because it like it could actually make me angry because I'm like

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.640
 That was my whole childhood. It was like yeah

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.200
 How much of our childhood was fit in my childhood was busy work and I knew at the time too

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.960
 I knew at the time it didn't make any sense and I was annoyed and frustrated by it

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.920
 But yeah too late for us too late for us, but maybe not for the next generation

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.480
 Well, I mean your kids don't probably don't waste that much time. No, I mean homeschool is awesome

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.800
 But you'd like to think that it could get that way

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.720
 No for public schools. Sorry. That was a weird noise to make out a podcast

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:52.560
 Do kids know what they're gonna do when they grow up? No, well, I mean ace

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:58.640
 I take that back ace that says he wants to be a lego master builder a lego master builder. What does that mean like uh

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:05.840
 Builds legos all day. I guess is that a career is that a job? Uh, there are I mean there are people who if you ask them what their job is

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.040
 They're a lego master builder like they work for lego and they build

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.120
 Things like there's a lego land in kids a city and there's lego

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:18.560
 Master builders that work there and they just build stuff in the shop for like the exhibits and all that

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.480
 Yeah, that's even more structured than I was imagining

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.680
 I thought this was like the content creator route where you like make youtube videos and have a twitch channel. Oh, no

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:31.360
 No, it's mostly people who I think they all work for lego. It's the people who design the sets like they come up with

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.360
 Actual new sets and stuff like that. Those are master builders. Oh, it's literally like what's in the movie there could they call the master builder?

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:44.080
 Yeah, yeah, uh-huh. That's right. Yeah, are there lego influencers? Like are they like, uh, there's youtube channels

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.240
 Like there's someone making like a million dollars a year just being a lego influencer. There must be right

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.320
 I'm probably yeah. I mean, there's a lot of people in the lego. So

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.640
 Yeah, I feel like the audience is big enough. I mean, I feel like he's almost old enough to

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.720
 I mean, he's been consistent. He's yeah, he's always said that's what he wants to do. I mean, that's the only thing he's ever said

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.760
 And then archer he didn't I mean, he's not the age where

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.600
 He would think about it would be funny if he would read it to something already

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.080
 What would he I'm trying to think what he would say

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.720
 Archer he could cut if he could grasp. Yeah, he could grasp the idea of like working

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.120
 I mean, he knows that I come down here and work

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.400
 So

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.160
 Yeah, what would he say he wants to do for work? It would be something so goofy

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.640
 He'd probably be bathroom humor

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:38.560
 Yeah, when I was little uh, it's funny when you're little you just don't think about things until someone asks you so I

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.640
 Remember my parents my parents asked me like

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.600
 I was saying something about my dad being on his laptop or something and they were like

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.080
 Oh, like he's working and

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.320
 I said something like oh, yeah, like he goes in his laptop and he plays games

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.960
 Every day. Like that's

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.040
 A laptop before that was what he meant was doing when he was working

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.200
 But the nuance here is

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.840
 I wasn't going around life thinking. That's what my dad did

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.600
 I just had literally never thought about it till they asked me in that moment

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.680
 And I was forced to come up with an answer and I was like this makes sense. Yeah, he put it together

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.680
 But from my parents point of view they they like still think that that's like what I was thinking this whole time

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.920
 But it's like no, I just wasn't thinking anything at all

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.080
 Yeah

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.440
 Yeah, you don't why would you again? That's that's what they say about kids

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.720
 like they're basically like on hallucinogenics like what that like if an adult

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.480
 human

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.480
 Does like psilocybin like mushrooms

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.360
 They're like it turns off your default brain or whatever they call it the default center

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:46.000
 That like thinks about the future in the past and like worries about the future and has anxiety about the past all this stuff regret

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.520
 But like kids only live in the current moment. They don't have I don't remember what age they can start

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.120
 Living outside the current moment, but that's what happens to us on like these crazy psychedelics

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.680
 And for kids who just always always walk around on mushrooms. Yeah, that's what we always say

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:08.720
 That's nice. They're just on mushrooms all the time. Yeah, I think about it as my dog where he has no idea what each day

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.720
 He's gonna be because I plan it

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.280
 And more specifically I'm like, okay

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:19.120
 Sometimes we take him on a hike and he's like exerting himself because he's like I'm gonna run this way

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:24.320
 I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do that. He has no idea. This is like a three-day hike. He has no idea how long this is

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.800
 He's not like conserving energy. He's not like

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.040
 He's like there's no sense of that at all and I keep thinking about that

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:36.480
 I'm like it's so insane to live in that way where you just have absolutely no idea what's gonna happen like five minutes

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.320
 In five minutes. It's so true. Wow. Yeah, it might be kind of fun

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:46.000
 But not really because he just he just gets too tired and if the time is too long and he's just like kind of miserable for the last

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.440
 30 percent of it, but there's absolutely no way for him to know

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.200
 There's also no way for me to communicate being like hey chill like this is gonna take

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.680
 You know a while. Yeah, yeah

00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.560
 Yourself. Yeah pace yourself. Exactly. I really want to the hiking thing

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.640
 like I love hiking clothes and hiking shoes and

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.000
 I love pictures of places where you would go hiking

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 I really want our family to like go on vacations. Wait, hang on

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.840
 You didn't you described everything except for the actual hiking. Do you not like the actual hiking?

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.600
 I'm not done it. I mean, I'm not really hiked

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:23.760
 I just like all the things about hiking, but I don't think with kids. I just don't know if they're old enough

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.560
 I think I would just be carrying one of them the entire way

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.520
 I don't think they could walk for like 20 minutes without getting bored

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.720
 Hiking is like I wouldn't say I'm like a big hiker

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.880
 But I've done a lot because in in New York

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.840
 If you live in Manhattan one of the nicest easiest things to do if you want to do like an outdoorsy thing

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:46.880
 City is to go like take a train like an hour north and it drops you off at like this very classic

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:52.320
 Pretty nice hiking spot. It's like we usually did like a three-hour hike and the peak of it

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:57.440
 Like if this crate you get super high gets like crazy nice view of like the huts in and the rolling mountains

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.200
 All that it's super beautiful. Yeah, we would see all kinds of people on that hike

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:06.640
 We would see like that was like working out every day where they would just literally sprint up the mountain

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.240
 insane like the most insane shape people you'll ever see. Oh, yeah, then sometimes like families with kids and

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.560
 I think it's just I think it's the habit thing

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.960
 I think you will end up carrying them till they like understand how long it is and like know what to expect

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.800
 but but there's also like almost every hiking trail has

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:29.520
 Different versions of it so you can do like a really conservative one or you can do one that takes longer or more challenging

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.400
 Um, so I'm sure they're especially by you like I'm surprised you haven't really done it because there's no

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.600
 They're I mean, there's like a nature center that we go for walks on

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.720
 I guess you could call them hikes there's through the woods, but it's it's not like mountainous or I mean

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.880
 There's like rolling hills, but it's not like I wouldn't call it like a hike

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:52.000
 We should go for a walk. Let's have the same thing because she grew up in florida and she was like oh, yeah

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.680
 Like I've done hikes before then she he came to like the northeast and she was like did not know

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:03.280
 Oh, that's different. It's actually a thing where you exert yourself. She's like oh, I'm kind of like walking around in nature

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:08.560
 This is like a hike much much different. I guess I've recently like like Tahoe

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.000
 I went for some hikes up the mountain and

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.480
 That that was really enjoyable. I couldn't imagine. Yeah, I couldn't imagine the kids though doing those

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.560
 I don't think we did any yeah, there's like but like there's that app

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:29.600
 What's the app? I like trails some kind of trails all trails or something like that. Yeah, and they're all rated

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.160
 Like very and like there's like reviews and there's like pictures and it's like family friendly ones

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.320
 Yeah, I know what to expect

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:41.120
 Uh, the the one that I did that I liked the most actually actually did it twice

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.920
 uh was in portland

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.920
 there is uh

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.160
 An area called canon beach and there's this hike and at the top of the hike

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:56.160
 You get this insane view of just like the ocean but even in the pacific northeast. It's like

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:02.480
 It's like uh, it's like a moody ocean. It's like really flat lots of fog like

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.640
 There's these like dark forest trees like coming down right up to it

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:12.160
 Uh, and it looks amazing. You know, it's super nice. Uh, that's a really great one too

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.320
 I think I would love the pacific northwest. I've been to like I think I've been to Seattle

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.800
 Maybe that's it. Uh, I just I love that kind of weather like

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.960
 Damp coat kind of cool. Like I prefer you think you'd like it all the time. I think so

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.280
 That just the other day. It was like it's like 45 in the morning here right now

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:36.640
 And just going out in it like going for a walk. I was telling kasey like I think I'd like it to be like this all the time

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:41.600
 Like I could do without the summer like it's not rainy though. It's quite different. No, yeah, it's true

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.720
 Yeah, I guess if it's raining and cold that's that's not so great when I went to Seattle

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:53.360
 Everyone that we were when we were there everyone that we ran into was like, oh, you're here for like the one good week of weather

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.360
 Per year and it was amazing. It was like kind of what you're describing

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.280
 But like not annoying and you know, this one was shining and everything

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:07.200
 Um, and the outdoor stuff they have there is like so crazy like Mount Rainier and all that all that stuff

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:12.320
 Uh, but the issue is it really I really do not like it

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:18.480
 Most of the year from what I've seen it's like really dark and gloomy. Oh, yeah, I guess I wouldn't like that

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.440
 Well

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:24.400
 The the thing I like about dark gloomy rainy days is I don't feel guilty that I didn't go outside

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.040
 Like I take my vitamin D gummies

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:32.880
 And I just enjoy the indoors with no guilt, but when it's really sunny and nice like a beautiful day. It's like, okay

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.880
 I guess we can go outside whatever. Wow

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.920
 Okay, but would you still feel that if that was every day?

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.080
 I think so. I like my rainy days too. Like I love rainy days being inside. Like that just feels so cozy and like feels so nice

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.800
 Um, yeah, but only in contrast with the other days to me. I don't know I

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.120
 I could probably just be indoors all the time and be fine with it. That's probably awful

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.200
 And it's bad for you and all that but

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.640
 I don't know. I really like it inside. Have you tried inside? It's nice

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.840
 Yeah, I was at that New York too. Like I wouldn't leave my apartment for like a week straight and I never thought I was insane

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.120
 But yeah, well if I lived in New York, I would yeah, I would never leave

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.680
 I've never got

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:15.200
 Well, I don't know. I mean a lot of people live in Seattle a lot if you live in the Pacific Northwest and they love it

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.720
 I mean poreland's not

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.480
 That bern's a lot like Seattle like it's not as rainy. Yeah, no

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.440
 Yeah, those places are like crazy beautiful like it's insane. The west coast just has

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.040
 Just has that dominated like beautiful

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:34.480
 Nature northern california. Yeah, uh, we should probably like I don't know

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.680
 Is there something going on on like the tech front? Do you want to talk about something?

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.160
 It seems so passionate about tech lately

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:47.120
 Actually, I'm loving like programming again. So there's that I just I kind of saw you today

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.000
 Oh, ouch

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.960
 Listen

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.840
 Everyone makes fun of me. I love it so much fun. I was gonna say that did you miss that?

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.200
 No, I'd be I've been programmed pretty hard for like months

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.080
 I just don't do it in front of people anymore

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.160
 Program I love programming. I don't I just have fallen out of love with the

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:14.400
 The community aspect. I mean, it's not the people. It's just like the like wanting to talk about it ever

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:20.880
 I think I'm just born out from like talking about tech. Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm definitely I'm making a like a non tech

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:27.600
 Instagram and I'm so excited about this because I'm not dev I heard about it. Yeah. Yeah, adam not dev. Yeah, yeah, it's instagram

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.400
 That's good. You can come follow me. There's no post yet. That's good

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:36.320
 So the thing is I was talking to kc about like what kind of stuff I'll do on this adam not dev because it's just gonna be like

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.800
 Lifestyle like I don't know everything that's not my work. Yeah, and

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.480
 I learned from her that it's not like tech

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:51.440
 And you don't have to like convince people of anything like posting stuff on instagram is just gonna be like it's not like

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:55.200
 Here's why you should understand this and believe me. It's just like

00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.480
 Sharing stuff sounds so nice because I feel like tech everything with tech is like you have to convince people

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.880
 of a thing

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.600
 And this is just like I don't know here's what I did today

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:11.200
 I'm awesome. You're very naive. Oh, really, but it's worse. It's a get worse

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:17.680
 No, it just look every every platform has its thing and instagram's thing is it's like a visual medium

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:25.280
 Yeah, and some people's life just looks really visually amazing. And that's kind of like what you maximize

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.960
 Yeah, that's that's kind of what I'm going for. I feel like I've got a kind of aesthetic life

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.440
 You know, I feel like I've got a lot in life. Do you have one? Listen?

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:37.760
 I'm not saying I'm a static. I'm saying like with that black shirt you wear every day

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.840
 Okay, so not fashion. I didn't say fashion

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:45.280
 That's a good part of it. That's like 50 percent. Oh, really?

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:50.400
 You're gonna have yourself in there. I guess sometimes yeah, but it's more like

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.320
 I don't know the vibe of my home and

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.640
 My lifestyle. We'll see. I don't know talking about it. It just feels dumb

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.720
 I should probably post it. What is a visual medium? So you you just got a show

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.600
 Yeah, just show just wait on a show

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:11.120
 The one tech related thing that I was refreshing myself on was the concept of a hackintosh

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:15.360
 Did you ever do this a hackintosh is like a Mac that you've actually like

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:20.480
 Made changes too close. It's when you install Mac OS on not oh

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.800
 Wait

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.960
 Oh, I'm thinking of installing windows on Mac. There's a lot of combinations of this. Yeah, okay

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.640
 So I used to do this when I was younger because I

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:38.880
 Still wanted to have a windows pc for gaming, but I like like using Mac OS. Yeah, I was younger and a fool

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.840
 a fool didn't just get

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.080
 And I haven't done in a while another day

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:50.480
 I was like, you know what like I think some of like the content creation stuff is like better on Mac like yeah

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.640
 I want to try some of that stuff

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.360
 So I was considering doing that again to my computer

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.960
 And it's it's like so mature like the whole community like there

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:06.240
 It like is very easy to do there's like tons of guides and like they've kind of solved all all little problems and all little details

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.920
 Uh, so it is fairly simple to install at least today

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:15.440
 the latest Mac OS on your pc and use like reboot into it when you want to use it

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.760
 uh, but

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.200
 There's like a big thing that's gonna end this all which is

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.400
 the fact that uh apple doesn't

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.240
 Is they sold their last mac pro that uses intel

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.600
 Here we go. Yeah

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:36.240
 Yeah, so there's like very little reason for them long-term to continue maintaining a

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.440
 Works on like x86

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:44.240
 Uh-huh fault arm now. Yeah, so I'm like, oh, what's the point of getting like?

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:49.200
 I'm sure they're gonna support that mac pro for like another five years or so. So it's not like it's dying tomorrow. Yeah

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.520
 right, I'm like

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.520
 In my head as soon as I know that something isn't like

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.360
 Gonna be around them just like there's no point in here. Yeah doing it. So kind of disappointing

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.760
 It's kind of like the last sucks. Yeah, it's gonna end up in era

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.760
 It's been around for like end of an era long

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.880
 People have been doing this but what so the benefits are

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:12.640
 You can do the thing you like to do which is like upgrade individual pieces of hardware and all that

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:18.160
 It's not really that as much as it is like I just uh, I like working in linux

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:21.760
 I don't think I can see myself maybe accepting working in mac

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.400
 There's like a lot that would get worse for me though

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:30.400
 Um, but then it's also the like I do game a decent amount. So I'm still need like

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:34.640
 Oh, yeah game. Yeah, what's that like to game?

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:40.000
 These days, I mean less and less as time goes on, but it is like a nice nice thing

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.280
 It's a very social thing for me, right? It's always yeah me with my friends

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.280
 Um, so it's like the way that I keep keeping touch if I wasn't such an addictive

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:53.440
 Person I would still do game. I think you need to learn to you need to learn how to trust yourself again

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.280
 I don't it's not it's not me. It's my case. He's got to learn to trust me

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:04.720
 But do you trust you that's where i'm obsessed? Uh, no, I don't see there. You know, that's just so obsessive

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.880
 It's really interesting like

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:13.440
 Had I think in the early 2000s had like e sports and gaming as a profession

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:19.920
 Been more of a thing. I probably would have ended up going down that route because it was just the thing I was addicted to

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.400
 I think I just I got addicted to a more socially acceptable thing, which is my work

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.280
 Shortly thereafter because no one around me wanted me to play games because I was addicted

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.840
 But like it's no different. I'm just addicted to my work now. It's like everyone's like that's okay

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.520
 You can do that one. It's not not the game thing. It's interesting

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:43.840
 Could have been addicted to a lot of things this kind of thing exists everywhere where like reading a book

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.520
 Isn't matter if it's like a pure fantasy fiction book seems more acceptable than like spending an equivalent amount of time watching

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:54.240
 Movies. Yeah, just the exact same thing. Yeah, it's the same thing

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:59.440
 The same thing your brain, right? You know, yeah, so how the act of reading is more accessible

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.000
 But yeah, no, I mean the video game thing

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.240
 I just I

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:09.280
 I obviously your wife knows you better, but I just have a hard time imagining how you would fit a new addiction into your life

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.800
 like it just

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.240
 It's just hard for me to see that happening, you know, especially bidet

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:20.240
 Jiu Jitsu, no, I know but the thing with you jitsu is there's like natural things that make it difficult like you

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:26.240
 That's true. Do it my body. Yeah, exactly and you have to go to a place and meet with other people to do it

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:31.520
 Also true. Yeah, that's the big thing with video games of like the reason I'm not playing them all day is there's a very rare

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:38.240
 alignment of all my friends having like a one or two hour slot open. Yeah, I hear you but like

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.240
 also

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.800
 the problem like when I was addicted to video games in college was

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.560
 It's not that I made time for it. It's that it took over

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.360
 all of my time and I

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.920
 Everything sacrificed because of it relationships

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.000
 School

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.120
 Just everything so it just kind of like fills the container, you know, like no no. Yeah, so liquid. I get it

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:06.400
 Yeah, but I do think like it was specific games. I don't think like if I were playing call of duty with you

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.000
 I don't think I would get addicted to although I did have some call of duty for addiction

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:17.280
 Okay, nevermind. This is all is it. Oh, it was also it was also like the MMOs. I guess you were saying those were the ones that I really

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:22.880
 Yeah, I mean those are like fine tuned for that type of thing. Yeah, right. Yeah. Also, we're just like me

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.240
 My friends just aren't very good. So like there's no reason to be addicted. So it's like

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.640
 Then we just spend more time losing. It just doesn't

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.520
 Doesn't really make sense

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:38.240
 Yeah, I will say among us but Casey was good with me trying among us and that was a good time

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.640
 I was ready to be addicted, but I couldn't get it made to play with me

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.440
 so

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.440
 but that's what I'm talking about right like

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:50.160
 Even if you're even if you just were trying to get into that addiction zone like the practicality of it just made it's true

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.840
 Not happened. So yeah, yeah, there are like guardrails in a way

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.920
 So what about your kids like are they ever gonna try video games? Are they interested? I don't know

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:02.560
 Yeah, I think about this case and I remember us talking about it like I used to have an Xbox one

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:08.080
 I think that's the one it was and then we had a said it was like are we gonna have a game console in the house?

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:12.320
 Is this a thing that the kids are gonna be aware of that they're gonna know dad goes in the

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.880
 theater and plays Xbox and

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:20.640
 We sold it. We got I mean we gave it away. I don't know what we did but it was kind of that conversation of like

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:26.560
 I I know how it what it did for me or just how much time I spent doing it

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.480
 and

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:32.480
 It's back to the whole it's the whole thing with the socially acceptable. What's acceptable use of your time?

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.320
 And for some reason there's still like taboo in my mind around that but

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.960
 I think a normal amount of doing it or anything is fine. It's just

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.680
 Uh, I do not do normal amounts of things

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:48.640
 Only throw myself into things, but it's kind of unfair to think that they would be like that

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.640
 I I guess they should have a shot at like

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.760
 Anything mistakes. There's already. Yeah, there's already things that

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.960
 They have a hard time stopping once they start

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:04.000
 And it just brings out behaviors that aren't ideal. So yeah, I guess should be treated like any of those things interesting

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.320
 Yeah, I think I think for me

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:11.280
 It's always like a very social thing like how to people will be coming over my house and we play together or like

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.960
 Like I said for me and my friends like we all live in different cities and it's

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.520
 We like catch up over

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.080
 Playing like we're playing but the playing is like kind of in the background to our conversations a lot of times

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.400
 Yeah, it's a social. Yeah, I hope it does never just fully goes away. I see like it's

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.800
 It's dropped a lot like we used to play a lot more and it's kind of sad because like

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.840
 We're like less connected because of that. Is it is it like one person is like the ball neck

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.160
 Yeah, that just like can't get on and so

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.960
 Okay. Well, the way it happened is so there was like consistently four or five of us

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.960
 Uh, and then one of them had kids and that like made it more difficult

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.520
 and then now

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.760
 The rest of us I don't even know what's going on everyone like just kind of just moved

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.240
 So they're like lives are in flux

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.640
 uh, I actually think what it is is uh

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:02.240
 It's the summer and i'm like the moment it gets cold

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.240
 All these people are going to be stuck inside and they're going to be like, please can we play?

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.680
 Please can we play on so board?

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:13.440
 Which right now they're like, oh, i'm doing this thing or i'm doing this other thing and i'm the one that's trying to like rally everyone together but

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.200
 Uh

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:19.680
 Yeah, it just hasn't happened as much. Mm. But yeah, I mean as people get older and like they get more

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:24.320
 More stuff in their life like i'm sure this will diminish but it's kind of happening now. So

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.880
 You're growing up your friends

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:32.160
 Growing apart. I know not that you're growing not that you have to grow up to not play games. I'm sorry

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.680
 I'm stuck in the like early 2000s tablet or boomer

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.320
 I am. That's what it is

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.280
 Yeah, so i gotta make new friends replace them and also

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:46.240
 That they ever existed. Can you just play can you just like go on and play with anybody random people?

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.840
 Is that not good but like that that doesn't have much appeal to me really?

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:55.120
 Because it's not social. Yeah, sometimes i play by myself. I guess I never played the games for social reasons

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.800
 I played games for my own mastery of the game

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:07.120
 I have a problem feed your demon. Uh-huh. Have you noticed that i'm like looking at my other screen this whole episode?

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:16.480
 I'm trying to try to design a logo. I'm trying to design a slack icon. Oh, is this is this for your yeah for the slack thing

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.560
 For the thing that you didn't want to do

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.360
 The reason I don't want to do things and the reason I regret saying yes to things is I always throw myself into something

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.040
 Like I can't just like do an okay job. I have to like

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:36.640
 Like obsess over every little detail and it's just stupid. Is it gonna hurt when someone else's slack app is better than yours?

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:43.840
 I'm sure I mean i'm sure there's our good. I've seen it. Is it good? It hurts? I'm saying. Yeah, it already hurts. I'm just thinking about it

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:51.200
 It's not a competition. It's just showing people is it different ways i'm thinking. I mean, I want to be the best

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.360
 But yeah, there you go. It's competition. It's not it's not that everyone has agreed to competition

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:59.520
 Is it a competition in your head and the answer is always yes, everything is always a competition in my head

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:05.840
 But not in like the competitive. I want you to lose way just in the like I want to do the best possible job

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.160
 You don't want them to lose you just want to win

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.800
 Well, no, that sounds no

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.600
 I just want to do a really good job. Excellent. It's very important to me

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:22.480
 That's what this yeah, it's funny. I this I went back and forth with uh lee rob from vercell

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:26.640
 on this on twitter and it kind of frustrated me because I was like

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.760
 the point I was making was

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.080
 that

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:38.800
 The I call it like pr talk where like a lot of these companies speak in a way where like everything's positive and they're doing is like

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.480
 Can only be good and like you know, it's all spun as positive way

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:48.000
 But we all work at companies that are competing and it is like there's a whole other dimension to it where

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.960
 Yes, overall, it's not a zero sum situation

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:56.400
 But in the short term there are winners and losers and people that have the default and people that don't have the fault they're struggling

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.840
 um

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.680
 And that I was like it's totally okay to recognize that and not pretend that doesn't exist

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.840
 And I kept going back and forth lee rob and him just finding different ways to like

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.760
 Say that no, it's not that or like know that I don't view it that way or I don't see it that way and to me

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.520
 it just like a denial of

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.920
 Reality which makes it sound kind of fake to me

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.520
 um

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.840
 like we all work at companies like we're all in our

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:26.480
 Private chats like talking shit about be like like why are we pretending like this isn't a thing like we all do it

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:32.160
 But then it public it's like we only want what's best for everyone and it's a matter who wins as long as the end user

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:36.480
 Wends like furthering the whole space. Yeah, it's like well. No, you were trying to be

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:43.360
 We're all trying to further the space but with our vision being that yeah, it wouldn't be happy if someone else is

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:48.480
 Someone else furthered it with their thing and we're not the default. Yeah, I think it's okay to acknowledge

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.760
 It's okay to say that yeah, say it out loud. It's an ancient thing

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.000
 I I like that about you and it's refreshing that you do just sort of like

00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:04.240
 Acknowledge the bad things to the parts of us. I think what I'm saying is it's arbitrary that we view it as as bad

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:10.560
 It's just kind of is a thing like it's the idea of competition existed since we were like single-cell

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.480
 Organisms like it's just a thing and it's like a fun exciting thing with that

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.120
 I think a lot of us like and it's okay to say that we want to win

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.880
 You know yep, I want to win. There you go kind of

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.680
 I don't know. I don't know. I see the face you're making looking at that logo. I'm like, I don't know if you want to win

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:34.560
 Okay, I need to see the logo and also are you just talking to mid-journey? Like what are you doing?

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.440
 Oh, I'm I'm in figma. I'm just playing with concepts

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.360
 Then why aren't you talking to mid-journey?

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.480
 Because it's 23. I could just make this a mid-journey

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.480
 Wait, what would you how would you prompt mid-journey to make in a while?

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.960
 But like you can actually google this you can like people put up like

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.960
 Ways to get certain things and like obviously icons

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.280
 Are like a classic thing. Yeah, I'm working on it here

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:02.320
 Man, I'm so bad at this. I have not really a billion app that uses AI. How'd you not think about this?

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:07.600
 Mid-journey prompt for making a slack icon. Well, I don't have a slack icon

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.680
 But what do you guys like? I just like an app icon, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah app icon. If you're cool

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.160
 uh, wow

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.320
 20 plus mid-journey prompts to create eye-catching ui icons. Oh, man humanity's done

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.960
 We don't have any chance

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:26.880
 These look so good because you didn't think about this. That's true. Yeah, I'm just not keeping up at all

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.320
 How do you use mid-journey again? Do I have to like get on discord?

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:35.040
 Yeah, I have a paid mid-journey thing. I just don't think I gotta unsubscribe because I've been used it for a while

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:40.400
 Yeah, I never use it. I need to unsubscribe too. I have to pay to read this article. Are you kidding me?

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.800
 Is it medium? It's medium. Why do people keep posting on medium? I don't understand like

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.200
 Stuff just doesn't get seen because it gets paid well

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:51.200
 I don't even understand that whole model like you publish for medium and then medium makes money

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.480
 I guess. I don't know. Do they share it with you? I mean get an essay month

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:59.120
 Higher people still use a medium. It just is so frustrating. So much stuff gets paid well

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.240
 So

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.440
 Okay, well if you could find me a free a free article

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.560
 That'd be cool. I mean, I'm sure you can just tell it

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:12.240
 Icon black background. Oh, man. Uh, here we go. Here we go

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.000
 Uh, okay. Now I just gotta get on discord. I tell you I can't open my discord app

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.960
 I've had so much friction lately just like do basic things

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.640
 The discord app on my Mac just doesn't open. I've got to read download it

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:26.480
 I got everything on matt matt just works stop it. I see what you're doing

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.640
 I see what you're doing. I'm just ask this is a genuine question that I just asked

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:36.080
 Uh-huh. It's not a Linux uh propaganda piece. No, I didn't mention anything about Linux

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:40.880
 I'm not saying everything just works on the next if you could see the number of

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.920
 Unread messages in my discord

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.880
 It's intense you try to tell me that you're popular

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.600
 No, I'm trying to tell you that I don't want to read messages people sent me for some reason

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:54.080
 And that like a lot of people are sending you messages because you're popular

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.040
 No, it's over the course of months and months and months

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:00.640
 Okay, general one. Is that the channel I should do this in?

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:05.280
 That's in general. You're so busy. You don't have time to respond and people for months and months and months

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.360
 No, I'm not so busy. I just get excited or in person over messages

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.920
 And if I read it then I have to respond. Yeah, okay. You know what I am. I'm flexing

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.120
 I'm just so popular. I have so many messages

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.640
 Don't forget that you're so busy. They don't have time to answer them

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:27.200
 I've so I'm so busy no time to answer them slackbot app icon minimal pastel colors bright

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.960
 Hmm. How would you name this? Uh, let's just try that

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:38.640
 I don't like the discord bot thing like I just don't like this as a model. I don't why didn't a journey do this

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.000
 I guess it's good because everybody can see

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:47.600
 What why do you know? I think it was like I think it's smart in terms of an mvp thing. They have to build like a whole

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:52.160
 Thing and discord is like such a good social growth thing

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:56.560
 So I get why it made sense, but I do wish at this point now they're huge. They have like

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:00.160
 Another way to do it. It's just a it's a tough experience

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:05.920
 Like I just hit enter and now I can't find my message because there's tons of messages. You can DM the bot

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.680
 Oh, you can DM the bot. Yeah, are you kidding me?

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:13.680
 You this whole time. That's that's the only way I've ever used it. I've only ever

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.640
 I'm posting and it only settings you can change. It's all it's all public

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:23.040
 It's so gets posted publicly. So don't generate any any weird. Yeah, I wasn't going to

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.760
 I don't know. I'm just wanting you

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:30.480
 But their site is actually very good. How do you delete? How do you delete? Is there a way to delete?

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:37.920
 You can't DM the bot. I just tried I I've I've only ever used it by DMing the bot

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:43.920
 What bot mid journey bot mid journey bot? Yes. No, you can't do that. So you do that

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:48.800
 He tells you you do slash imagine and you do the blah blah blah

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:54.720
 Uh, oh you sure can do their site is very good where it's like a pretty nicely designed site

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:59.680
 That just shows you like the most popular images. It's kind of like an image sharing like reddit type of situation

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.960
 And you can see like a website too. Yeah. Yeah, if you log in

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.120
 Uh on their website

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.880
 You can see kind of what prompts anything that you see that looks cool. You can like see the prompt that

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.400
 was gen that generated it. That's a good way to learn

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.760
 Mm

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.960
 Yeah

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.200
 Okay, can can mid journey do text

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.240
 No

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.400
 But the new dolly can

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.360
 Oh really?

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.440
 Can I can I use that or is it

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.880
 You don't have access. I don't have access either

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.320
 Well, oh man, I forgot to tell you so

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:45.920
 Yesterday I did that thing where I uploaded my picture myself to chat gbt and I was like this is a fictional character

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.640
 right their personality traits based off of the image

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.200
 And

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.040
 It generated 10 personality traits

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:59.600
 And I showed it to liz and liz like with like i'm having a panic attack because I think we're in a video game because it's like way too accurate

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.360
 Oh no

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:06.080
 I'm so accurate. Can you sit it doing? Yeah, I will. I want to see the picture too. I will send it all

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:12.560
 Uh, so yeah, it can really infer who you are just from looking at you. This is uh, this is pretty incredible the mid journey saying

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:18.800
 Like these are really cool looking. Are they better than whatever you were messing with? Oh by uh

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.680
 zillion

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.360
 Is that a number by infinity as my little one says

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:31.920
 He really he really last time's the word infinity real quick. I love infinity. I didn't they love it. I can't even

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:35.520
 Wrap my head around it and they're just like throwing it around and you're like well

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.800
 I

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.840
 Yeah, they're like you suck in there like you suck infinity and you're like you suck infinity plus one

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:45.760
 And you're like you're a fool you suck infinity plus two got him got him

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.880
 plus two

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.720
 Try and try that exact same thing if you haven't

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.520
 They're they'll go crazy. Okay. Yeah, the plus one. I think they already do that, but i'll try it again

00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:04.080
 Uh, slap act a slack app icon minimal pastel colors bright with speech bubble. Are you gonna fill in the text?

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:10.240
 I would like to that's the goal. What are you gonna put in the text tldr? It's the name of the bot

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:15.040
 Yeah, it's called tldr. I don't know. Is that copyright? Does anyone have copyright on tldr?

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.600
 I'm thinking copyright that okay. That's good

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.800
 So you're saying I could make an app called tvh

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:25.360
 And they couldn't hear me about yeah, that was actually an app right. Yeah, but yeah, but he does

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:30.880
 Yes, so if I do that, nobody can stop me. I don't know because you can't copyright tvh

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.440
 It's what dax just I didn't say you can't copyright tvh

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:39.520
 Well, you basically said that you can copyright it in its kind in a context in a context you can say for like

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:44.320
 A social media app that does as well as we have the copyright on it. Okay

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:48.800
 It's making it's making little robots and all the icons and I don't love that

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.840
 Tilton say say no robots and all caps, you know, you know, sometimes that I do which had gbt

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.400
 Uh, this might come back to bite me, but

00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:02.240
 Sometimes it doesn't do what I wanted to do that just keeps refusing and then I threaten it and then it works

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.800
 What oftentimes it works?

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.280
 Sometimes I'm like I will freaking kill you if you

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.880
 If you don't do this

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:15.120
 It works other times that I like trick it like this thing I did with the

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:20.480
 They like detected that people were doing this thing where I upload in their images and generating and like they don't like it

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.480
 They don't want people doing that so they yeah

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:26.240
 Uh, they added blocks and I tried to do it yesterday at first. It didn't work

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.160
 I tried threatening it. It didn't work

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:32.000
 But then you know what got around it. I uploaded the picture and I was like

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:38.800
 Give me five things that you're able to do based off this picture and then number three was I can generate a bunch of personality traits

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:42.000
 And I was like, oh, that's a great idea. Why don't you why don't you run with that idea?

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.920
 Number three and then it did it. It did it. It was completely fine. It got around

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:51.680
 Humans have no hope of like I love training this thing. You know, that's what I'm saying. I love how

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:57.520
 It's this non-deterministic black box things you can't like put these deterministic rules on it

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.360
 So they much just had like these

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.440
 Really fancy system prompts somewhere that's like trying to block all these situations, but

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.840
 Yeah, you can't deterministically block it and I just love it. It's so funny

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:14.720
 It's so hilarious. I think blocking it is stupid on the first place. Yeah, it's fine. That's also ineffective

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:21.440
 This stuff's really it's wild. What a time to be alive, but we're yeah, we're here

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.440
 I mean we got to see the internet

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.480
 Come of age now. We're getting to see this stuff

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:30.720
 Really feels like we got to see you stream. We got to see my

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.680
 appearance on twitch

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.680
 I mean it really does kind of feel like

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:42.720
 You struck like the humanity gold mine. Just imagine I've said this before but imagine if you're born like 200 years ago

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.720
 What would you be doing tax?

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:49.200
 Maybe everyone feels that way trying to stay alive 200 years ago if I mean if I was born

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:54.000
 Literally like if I was my ancestor, I would be farming. I told you this. I would just be farming

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.280
 Yeah, so like what was that like compared to this life?

00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:04.160
 Maybe not as good. Not as good. Okay. I would have way less decisions to make which can be nice in some ways. Yeah

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.960
 Yeah, we just fill the time so easily now

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:11.280
 I've always got something going on some project around the house something we're doing

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:16.640
 We should probably get off here. Uh, it's this point. I'm just reading out my my mid journey problems

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.560
 Use one of them as like the cover for this this episode. Oh, that's a good idea

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:29.120
 One of these little robot pastel robots for this thing that I agreed to and didn't

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.480
 And ended up regretting but and I hope Jason doesn't hear that

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:37.600
 I'm so glad i'm doing it because it just pushed me out of my comfort zone like in the end i'll be happy

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.360
 I did it. It says you say i'm so glad i'm doing it. What the that was just a complete lie

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:45.840
 No, it's i'm almost done. I've been dreading it for like two weeks

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:51.680
 Oh, you're glad that now. Okay. Now. Yeah, it's like this morning when I got in the 39 degree cold plunge

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.240
 Do you understand how cold?

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.240
 Circulating 39 degree water is

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.520
 Well, you like start making noises. I started making lots of noises

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:05.440
 And I got to pull up the camera feed because now I got to watch it from a third perspective third person view

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.400
 Then I heard you even say and he might have been joking

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.800
 But i heard him say something about like

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.080
 Jumping in 30 degree water, which would be below freezing, which would be really cold

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.400
 I can stop your heart

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:20.320
 And now i'm terrified i'm like 30 not well that's not very many more degrees

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:23.520
 Uh, like at what point does your heart have like a memory?

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.800
 Do you need to be pushing it like I don't know maybe I need to slow

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:31.920
 I need to like go in a little like slower like transition like why do you need to get that cold?

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:35.120
 It's it's like there's all kinds of benefits to the cold therapy

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:40.080
 Have you have you seen the studies? I know you don't believe in studies. You don't believe in science. You don't look too healthy right now

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.480
 Well, the sun it's the sun washing me out right

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.760
 Plus like the black guys. Oh, yeah, that didn't

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:52.320
 Uh, no cold therapy is good for it. It's like anything that makes your body you have to work harder

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:56.160
 I don't know. That's good. My goal is to outlive you and then laugh and then laugh

00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:02.160
 Yeah, it's your one goal that you're funeral you get that one laugh in general and we're like he was wrong about everything

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:11.600
 Oh my heart will stop. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. Well, the thing the reason I asked you were making a bunch of noises is uh

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.120
 Like when I would play sports, I remember there was one time where

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:20.960
 Like I got hit almost elbow went full force like into that perfect spot. Oh

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.600
 Like this whole reflexes or whatever

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:30.400
 And it winded me so hard like doubled over and my there's stuff. The noises were coming out of my mouth

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:34.400
 And again, it's like after a couple minutes like or even it's like one minute. I was fine

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:38.720
 But in that moment you're just in this like weird involuntary state where you're just like

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:44.560
 Yeah, it's probably similar. Yeah, I because I tonight or this morning

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:50.560
 I actually dip my whole head under because there's some kind of like mammalian diving reflex that it's good for your face

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.200
 if you stick your face in the cold water first it like

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.280
 activate your parasympathetic system and makes you calm down or whatever anyway

00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:02.000
 Uh the first time I did not put my head under this time I went completely under and came up

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.600
 And the just like the gasping it was a little scary

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.640
 Like I started thinking about the heart rate thing or the heart stopping thing

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.640
 It's it's a it's an incredible. It's not like the pins and needles pain. It's like

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:17.520
 It's some kind of you're outside your brain. It's not your normal conscious mind like

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:21.520
 I just felt like a dying animal and I had to get out of that tank

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.040
 Is that bad?

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.600
 So I gotta zoom me out and like imagining

00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:30.960
 You doing this in just like the middle of the Ozarks randomly just out there like

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:34.400
 That's like really hilarious to me. Yeah

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:41.040
 You're like it's inflicting this on yourself and just like I know nowhere. Yeah, it's true

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:45.280
 Did like people 200 years ago if they could see us

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:49.440
 Like one of these people they're so bored. They're just jumping in ice water

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:52.240
 What's going on?

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:57.520
 Yeah, I'm not doing that for the record. It's it's just you. I don't think I'm shaming my ancestors the way you are

00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:00.240
 No, yeah. Yeah, definitely not shaming them in the way that I am

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:03.280
 I'm shameful

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:08.800
 Okay, if you want to if you want to send me a good icon, I could move on and get something else done today

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.600
 I agree. Why this idea? I thought you were talking to mid-journey

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.240
 Well, yeah, I'm doing a bad job. And I feel like you have a lot of experience

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.160
 You seem very confident with the mid-journey thing

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.120
 So if you want to just like whip something up, I don't know if I have experience

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:24.000
 I have only ever used mid-journey for humor where I would generate stuff like that was funny and it sounds funny

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.080
 Did it actually do a good job?

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:29.120
 Let me just I have my history here right here. Oh, okay

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:34.480
 Oh, actually the last image I generated was like this pixel art

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.960
 I was trying to do like a bunch of pixel art stuff

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:42.560
 Like those like a you always referenced earth bound. Yep. Yeah, it's like that kind of style

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:47.440
 It does that really really well. Yeah, I have a dream of making a game

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.320
 With AI being the the main artist

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:54.720
 I really want a video game where it's like a very sophisticated social world

00:58:54.800 --> 00:59:00.640
 That's like a lot of characters with a bunch of different lms. We talked about this. It's we're gonna do it someday

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:03.760
 That's when we retire. We're gonna be making some game

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:09.360
 If people still play games. I don't know. Okay. I have some really weird stuff in my mid-journey history

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:17.520
 I was trying to mess with Liz's dad who likes trump, but hates castro

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:21.760
 Obviously because he's Cuban. Mm-hmm. And I try I was like generating pictures of them like hugging

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.360
 Funny

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:31.920
 And you know what they're pretty good pretty convincing image

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:36.400
 I did this one where trump is embracing him and kissing him on the cheek. Wow, which

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:39.520
 It's it's so tender. It's so like

00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.920
 Carrying and tender

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:43.920
 All love and sensitivity there

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:50.240
 Uh, it's funny. I have a picture I generate some pictures of zuko

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:56.400
 Wielding two guns. I don't know why I was doing that. I feel like I've seen a picture of zuko with guns

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:59.520
 I think you've published on Twitter. That was a different one. Yeah, okay

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.160
 This one is

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.000
 I've done this a lot. I did a humanoid Doberman shooting guns in the air

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.600
 I don't know why I don't know why I did that but it is there you go

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:14.960
 That's a lot it's a lot to take in hyper realistic photograph of a comically fat sheep

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.360
 I don't know why

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.040
 Did it work

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.160
 Is it good? Yeah, wow. Yeah, it looks pretty good

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:27.280
 Morgan Freeman as a Sith Lord being defeated by hobby or bardam as a jedi

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.840
 I don't know. I don't know who that second person is. I think it's a new movie. Yeah, no kidding

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.640
 You're a pretty famous Latin actor

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.240
 All right. I got some like pastel backgrounds. I can work with these

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.880
 I'm gonna like I want to put these

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.040
 On my figma and I'm gonna drop the word tldr on it and see how it goes

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.800
 Thank you for the tip

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.640
 Hopefully it works out because I just I saw your face trying to make whatever you were doing

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.360
 It's in my

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.760
 This is multitasking right here

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.160
 I'm just like scrolling these I did so at some point

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:04.880
 I'm trying to generate images of people that look like me and it randomly threw in like a crazy neck to like head tattoo

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.160
 Which looks so good that anytime I see it. I'm just like

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.600
 Oh man, should I like do that?

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.080
 It looks like really badass like it. Oh, it looks good

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.840
 I don't know. I don't even know how I would describe this or like replicate it, but

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.160
 I gave if you asked me like oh, would you get like a neck tattoo? I'd be like hell no

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:27.600
 But then this picture but now seeing this doing it for you

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:33.200
 Have you run it by uh liz before you actually she saw it and she's like she's like oh man

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.920
 That does look really cool. Okay

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:42.880
 I think you're you're in the clear. Let's let's see it. I think it happened. Oh man. I don't think I'm brave enough, but

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:51.600
 Man's shoving lasagna into a toaster made for bread HD 4k. What are you doing? What what are you doing with mid-journey?

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.160
 I feel like someone needs to explain this to me

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.440
 I think I think

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.480
 I think it goes having conversations with someone where some of these topics came up and I would like try to make a funny image out of it

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:08.720
 I have no idea. I think you need uh to play more games or something. You need to find something else as a hobby

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.720
 I was doing a Balenciaga thing for a while

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.440
 Oh, yeah

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:16.000
 The Balenciaga versions of oh, I did one of you. Yeah, you're in here. Oh, is it good?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.240
 I did one of Frank

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.800
 Uh, it's okay. Hmm. Are you seeing it? I've sent it to you. Oh, okay. It does sound familiar

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:28.240
 Is this a still podcast? Are we doing a podcast? What is this? What is happening? I don't know. I have no idea

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.240
 This is a weird episode. It really is. I'm sorry for our listeners. I don't know

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:37.600
 What happens if I record a podcast ever talking for four hours? It's true. Yeah, it's yeah

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.160
 Okay, let's actually go let's let's end this misery. See you next

01:02:42.160 --> 01:03:04.400
