WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 That's what if you say nice things about computers they will immediately let you down.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.000
 Yeah they will, exactly.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.480
 I really enjoy the podcast by the way. I just want to tell you that. I really don't listen to

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.520
 tech podcasts but I listen to you guys and I actually fell asleep with my AirPods in

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.080
 which I do all the time and I woke up at like 4 in the morning to just you two talking into my ear

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:53.440
 about how I'm still driving cars. The answer is Lidar by the way it's the big difference.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.040
 Cameras. Yeah come to ourself and ride them they're amazing. I put people, I was like

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.520
 me and a few plants get people in like the early early beta of the Waymos and I was just sending

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.760
 people in them and they were just losing their mind so absolutely. So the Waymos use Lidars what

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.600
 you're saying? Yeah it's so much more predictable and the tests are doing camera models we still

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.360
 achieve one day but it's not good enough now. Yeah and I wonder like I still have this open

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.040
 question with why they are so restrictive like why they have the thing turned on so aggressively

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.200
 to make sure you're paying attention like Waymo if they've had driverless. Are you the answer to

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.800
 that by the way the levels of self-driving are not just a comment on the tech they're a comment on

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.280
 the indemnity. Okay so when you hit level 4 you're actually telling the authorities that you take

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.760
 responsibility for the crashes as the manufacturer. Oh interesting. And the only person who's got

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.120
 the only people for good enough tech that have done that are obviously Waymo but Mercedes is the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.080
 only ones that have level 4. If Mercedes like auto driving shit if that crashes you they're

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.680
 happy to be on the hook for it and you know what Tesla's like. Interesting. If they say. Oh yeah

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.160
 so yeah well they ever. Correct they were like if they say it's safe and say you're allowed

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.760
 to take your hands off and smash like yawn. You've said you're not going without saying your level 4

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.920
 and then you're in trouble so that's why that works. Well what other questions can you answer

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.080
 for us that we've raised over the years. This is awesome. Now I kind of want to talk about unify

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.320
 because I use unify stuff and I generally like it. I love it. I've been a bit too ridiculous with

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.440
 it and like I'll send you a picture I built like a whole server I can got everything in it. I love

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.200
 it. Yeah yeah no it's the best talking about it. He loves going the fiber terminates right in

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:46.160
 that closet. Unify have nailed prosumer. They've crushed prosumer. It's just like yeah exactly.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.600
 It's perfect. They run Mongo on it though so and not everyone's perfect. Oh really. Yeah it runs

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.840
 locally on like on the server. Yeah I mean I mean sort of the 2010s era is pretty weird for tech

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.400
 honestly. That's what I entered. That's what everyone had that Mongo DB shirt that brown one with the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.960
 leaf on it. That was like all over New York everyone had that. That was my first intro to like tech.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.960
 I found a Mongo DB mugging up in the GitHub kitchen just threw it in the trash immediately.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.440
 I couldn't even look at that swag. They drove me so fucking insane. It drove me crazy.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.480
 I think like the very early days of my startup stat news because it was like 10 years ago.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.640
 I think we built on the mean stack just like right after the prototype we did like mean

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.800
 stack and then we're like nevermind. Nevermind. Like one iteration of it was Mongo.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:46.080
 Learn the mern stack. Yeah. That's all I hear is the mern. It's terrible.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.480
 Hey they fixed it now. Mongo is good now. Yeah it is. They started writing the data to disk

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.440
 and everything went better from that. Yeah it is. It is so much critical.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.760
 Are you in SF? Yes and you know like the painted ladies the kind of famous view the Apple TV

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.600
 view. I'm like a block behind that basically. Yeah it's pretty nice. Very simple. Hayes Valley

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.840
 you see people talk about cerebral valley on Twitter or whatever because it's now there.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:27.040
 Yeah the reason I ask is like the I that you guys talk about the unify routers.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.560
 I have lived in New York where no one has a place big enough to justify that at all.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.240
 And then you get one router and you have like 100% coverage in like every corner of your space.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.800
 And then now I'm in a place that is right on the cusp like my I do have like one of those is

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.960
 generic like Google Home cluster the mesh yeah the mesh things and it's good but if I go into

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.720
 my hammock which is in the back corner of my backyard it starts to not be so good and I'm like

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.440
 do I need to go up one level now. Yeah it's really not funny. Yeah when you can't get

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.280
 Wi-Fi in your hammock that you can use your round it's it's basically what's a point. Someone

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.560
 apparently there if you the no brainer like it just fucking works is the net get hero stuff is

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.080
 apparently just yeah yeah it just does really good like buy that one for your parents you know like

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.680
 pretty pretty. Yeah my friend just got that and it works pretty well. So what is like what is this

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.400
 the deal of unify. I see a bunch of people I saw like Nikita Beer just did a bunch of upgrades and

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.560
 I think that's what he went with too. Why is everyone so into it. They are not quite like a

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:50.160
 maraki or Zisco who are doing the really big stuff but they're kind of moving there actually

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.760
 and they started off just by having really good access points a really good controller.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.120
 And just some like simple stuff and they've just kept and the kind of the platform is essentially

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.400
 a very good controller operating system and then just it's really nice it's very like I constantly

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.240
 am surprised by how nice it is. Exactly and so then you then they use that platform to

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.280
 incrementally add even better things so now they do all my cameras for the outside of the house.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.440
 Same because it's Po and they also and they've also mega embraced PoE they now do office lighting

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.880
 that's what PoE controlled. Oh that's crazy. So like I've got PoE controlled cameras I've got

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:35.280
 doorbell everything just goes PoE and you can just rip it down you can do all this kind of stuff and

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.360
 then good outdoor like access points indoor plug based ones it's just like every accessory every

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.440
 type of camera every type of thing is you can run it in a mode where you don't change anything and

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.960
 it gets to about plug and play if you're like don't want to fuck around but if you really want to do

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.080
 traffic shaping and like all of the complex stuff you can do that too. Yeah it's one of my favorite

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.560
 things to do is like well two things one I actually read when they send emails I like open them because

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.200
 it's like some new device and I want to read about it but two like it's like a weekend past time for

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.360
 me is to like open up the controller and just play around with like what can we do on the network

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.960
 that would be fun like there's the stupid game that my kids school hasn't played they just get so

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.840
 addicted to it and so we can shape when they can use it when they can't I just love playing around

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.240
 with it and the software is so good it's amazing you can bridge stuff I've got a different other

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:33.520
 house and now I'm using their multi-site capabilities because I put you in a file oh damn so I can

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.280
 yeah VPN and do everything it's like very cool you can and how they do a consolidated camera view

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.600
 where I can get both houses in one they've done a full like multi-camera dashboard some whatever

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.000
 that shit yeah so Dax can't get Wi-Fi in his hammock but you've got the same network in two

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.360
 different locations to your house my hammock 100 miles away has great Wi-Fi actually yeah

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.120
 yeah they just do that shit it's really fun really good just pros and I think there's some

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.440
 example people I think that's why it's actually yeah the hardware is good too like the design all

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.520
 of it is done really well I didn't know there was example that makes sense though I actually found

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.840
 out that manga was on the box because I had one time where it actually like shipped the bed and

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.000
 I was running the older we probably versions I have all the controllers now and manga have done

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.480
 something that was all I could tell interesting but yeah like other than that if you just buy

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.480
 the hardware which I do do know how it's really good so there you go Dax you've got an upgrade

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:35.760
 path do it one of us one of us one of us come on join me so the power of either that thing is

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.160
 super cool because I feel like finally there's like some amount of synergization happening where

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:46.640
 you like I'm kind of rely on just one thing that's at my house is 100 years old so yeah mine is

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:53.040
 too yeah the wiring situation yeah like victorian they're built like crap like wood is a big

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:59.120
 bad building material Sam did you like have it retroactively wired a lot of it not into some

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:06.320
 places but most of it it's annoying like I didn't do enough planning I could have got it all done

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.240
 if you don't know yeah I wish I had way more yeah exactly and I built my home like in the last

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.480
 few years and I wish I would have thought about the camera situation thought about like there's a

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.160
 lot of things I just didn't pre-plan enough yeah you just do 10 gig this is normal it's annoying

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.520
 that normal houses don't come with risers and cable tracks it's really annoying

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:30.000
 yeah my experience is uh so I swapped out one of my switches in this office with the like a

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:37.280
 because like a smart one and I opened it and there's just two wires going into the switch there's no

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.120
 ground there's no like I think modern there's like four wires coming out of it for all the

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:46.000
 different things so it's literally like if you touch if something like gets a loose and touches

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.600
 the wrong thing it's electricating me and the whole house is that way yeah but I will say

00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.480
 my house is built pretty well like it's it's been through several hurricanes like uh and it's like

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.520
 for how old it is it's in pretty good condition but uh the modern houses that are built around here

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.480
 are not built quite well so yeah it's very surprising I was talking to one of my closest

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.280
 friends who's German and he was like I called the plumber he was like did you ever call plumbers

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:23.600
 when you lived in England and I was like no I never have and I've called like turned right here I swear

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.320
 they know that they I swear there's some collusion going on they just build some of this terribly

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:34.480
 so that you were quite rely on people constant alternate theory maybe the food here results in

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:41.040
 more wear and tear on the plumbing yeah yeah there's no connection food in England

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.600
 my my one of my favorite tweets is it's a it's the biggest shame is that they don't have

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.560
 toto toilets and I was saying you know it's the biggest shame is they don't have

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.680
 Mexican food in Japan why own a Ferrari if you're not going to take it to the racetrack

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:14.720
 yeah and you live in you know southern California it's like er yeah yeah it's a

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.440
 it's a thing Adam I'm going to change your life if you don't know about the thing I'm about to

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:26.560
 tell you about and I've used them everywhere you can buy like 12-fold 18-fold power adapters

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:33.600
 that take a PoE input have you seen these and they know they take and they output another ethernet

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.960
 connection and a power so you can take any of your ethernet powered like small kind of

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:46.080
 I don't know like Phillips Hue or whatever yeah PoE that shit and reboot it from anywhere oh that's

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.520
 so cool Dax is on the unified website right now buy it

00:11:49.520 --> 00:12:00.400
 really good so I because I bought I can ask I bought a non-unified doorbell and I can just like

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:06.480
 reboot it from here it's really cool that's so cool so speaking of uh of food and Mexican food

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.080
 Adam have you seen all the pictures I've been posting oh yeah the meat you do post a lot of

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.280
 pictures of meat I've noticed yes yeah I forgot to tag you I usually tag you whenever I post a

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:23.360
 picture of meat but I forgot the last couple of days so I'm I'm um yeah one of my first messages

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:29.680
 the Sam ever was it because Sam you cook a lot of meat like you post a lot of pictures of yeah

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:35.920
 yeah I do I'm trying to cook less meat now but I do cook a lot of food yeah basically yeah so Sam

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.720
 used to post a bunch of pictures of like these crazy steaks he'd make and I asked him about his

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.560
 searing technique because I think he you use a torch right it highly depends I've tried everywhere

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:53.200
 I've got one that I like the most but I have I do have a torch to use it yeah yeah nice yeah so

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.160
 so what I've been doing for this week I basically I'm trying to eat like just meat for a week to

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.840
 see how I feel yeah I saw that to offend Adam as much as possible just a counterbalance

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:12.400
 Adam's feeding this and then all that so I went I bought like a whole tenderloin and I um cut it up

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.560
 vacuum sealed it I could drop his train to the sous vide which is so convenient like after this

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.720
 I'm gonna go just drop it in and then it just what is sous vide I saw that usually I'm very

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.600
 surprised that you don't have one Adam I believe I believe sous vide is French for under vacuum

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.360
 and what it means is you like vacuum pack food you have a water bath and then you have the sous

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.400
 vide circulator that keeps that water bath very consistently precise temperature it can be like

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:47.040
 half a degree precision yeah wow professional ovens are extremely expensive because the airflow

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:53.760
 in a regular even if you buy like a fancy oven in a home yeah the airflow sucks like you people

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:59.040
 test this by like lay bread out on trays and just cook it for the middle will be like black the

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.960
 sides won't be yeah so like in professional kitchens they use steam ovens those those ovens

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.000
 actually dissipate steam I did buy a steam oven yeah it was quite bad so I said I had one that was

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.560
 like a gag and all steam oven that we loved in our last house and we didn't do it in this one

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.160
 and we miss it it was amazing because that is not efficient for transferring heat right like

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.080
 in so the sous vide takes out to a whole other extreme which is you are just submerged in the

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.440
 same temperature water but it had a lot of benefits which is it's kind of impossible to overcook

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.600
 something you could definitely throw it to a mush right like you can just break the fibers down too

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.320
 much it becomes yeah but I've been there for a long time though it's like if it's done an hour

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.560
 and you wait like four hours yeah then it'll start to mess up yeah yeah but it's kind of like you

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.360
 just can't really fuck it up and you just kind of it's impossible yeah it's it's great it's it's

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.160
 like a crock pot size thing that you have tax like what is the no so the actual device is just

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.760
 this like cylinder and you can clip it onto anything that can contain water so I use just use like a

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:02.480
 big metal pot okay and like I'm the reason I'm surprised they're not more popular is

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.640
 but we have a really crazy one but you can just get a pretty good one for like 70 bucks

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:14.080
 and it guarantees like just way better quality that you can probably like you can achieve it if

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:20.400
 you're like very good at you know cooking a steak on on a pan but this like guarantees that you get

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.360
 like professional chef level quality automatically every single time that you just can't mess it up

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.360
 and there's so many things you can make with it like it's not just for me like people people

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.200
 make all kinds of stuff up with it and yeah it's one of those things where it's like that weird

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:41.360
 sciencey part of food where they like just went at the engineering science angle on it and they just

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.200
 and they actually it was like a crazy achievement like it does work perfectly and there's like almost

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.320
 no trade-offs restaurants use it to like professional restaurants often suedeed a lot of the food that

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:56.000
 you eat is because it's so easy and consistent yeah and it also solves a timing problem you can

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.400
 leave a lot of basically finish food for a long period of time warm yeah and just like take it

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.280
 interesting that whenever you need it yeah so you also have to have like a way to vacuum seal stuff

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.840
 you don't have to vacuum seal that that definitely like makes it better but I only got a vacuum sealer

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.640
 this past week and I've had this to be for like three years oh okay yeah so you can just put it in

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.640
 a bag and like there's like a method to get most there rather than you you drop it in I am a sucker

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.440
 for kitchen contraptions like kitchen stores are one of my favorite places it's so I will admit

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:36.720
 toning three subedes it's the worst one I have on number two you know again this is a space thing

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.240
 so like my parents house which is like a very suburban house they just have infinite space for

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.000
 every single kitchen gadget and I feel like it's like all my friends when you go their parents house

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.960
 they just have like everything like every little thing that they'll use like once a year they just

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.320
 have it whereas for me it's like a big you know every like committing to this or not like you

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.400
 know vacuum sealer I'm committing to it we're getting it but I can't just get every little thing

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:06.080
 because my space is limited single use kitchen items are the worst thing ever though like someone

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:13.520
 gifted us like an avocado slicer and I okay okay it's funny because that is the one single use

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.880
 kitchen item thing that I have and I actually love it because how does it work what does it do

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:26.480
 that special it's so stupid it's totally unnecessary I just cut avocados in half and then I like get

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:34.000
 the pit out yeah exactly it's all it's done my wife like my wife wanted him to get she was like

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.760
 we got an avocado slicer I was like it's called a knife and just put it in the pile

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:47.760
 we just donated it just like that's not saying it there has to be like a giant group of people

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.120
 that are churning out these kitchen innovations though because there's so many news that every

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.960
 time you go to the kitchen store they've come up with some new thing I've never met somebody that

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.360
 like designs kitchen appliances you guys know like all shark tank products if you go watch

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:05.920
 pictures on shark tank like 70% of it is just plastic shaped into like a shape that no one's done

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.640
 before yeah just that over and over and over and yeah people keep coming up with new stuff and that

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:21.680
 pass is gonna end up in your balls because like you're just doing this over time yeah I keep seeing

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.560
 microplastics like every article every time I open my phone I see an article about microplaques

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.720
 and me because I clicked on one and now like they just keep coming up but it's like is this

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.720
 is this a new phenomenon or is it's like they're just discovering it I feel like every article is

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.480
 like microplastics we figured out they're literally everywhere does it mean anything we don't know

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.600
 at all yeah that's yeah I haven't seen like the conclusive like what have we gleaned from this

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:52.080
 I've just seen a lot of it it's like endocrine like disrupting and there's like often they've

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.080
 now start like I believe like I would have to check but I think they've started to actually

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.400
 found it you know like when people get plaque built up in their heart and oh yeah we've actually

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.600
 seen it contributed to that now it's very bad like it's extremely bad well I was just gonna say they

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.160
 need to come up with like something that goes in and eats all the plastic and then like we use it

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:15.600
 in the oceans we use it in our bodies yeah what we do that feels like a ridiculous and impossible

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.120
 problem it's like I think it's like a crazy microscopic level and it's literally everywhere

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:27.440
 already right it's mmm yeah like the solutions that's gonna look like it is a big concern it like

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:33.520
 genuinely is my my wife um she's a scientist she does drug development uh and she so she works on

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.080
 cures and she obviously can read scientific papers and whatever and like this is this is one thing

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.600
 she's definitely like worried about like ever since we've got a kid everything's glass or silicone

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.880
 on and it's just yeah mmm toys you can't avoid like we bought all the wood and like Montessori

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:53.680
 one of the toys they hate them like they're just they're they're not always as good are they

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:58.560
 like yeah the Melissa and Doug and whatever yeah yeah we went to like a Diwali party and all the

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.680
 kids were playing and they'd all brought their own toys and I just saw his like eyes like up

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:09.680
 when he saw like a fire-end toy I literally went to the left where I went to Target and I was like

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:16.080
 give up I gave him like a police car and whatever because he'd never had these yeah and he just

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.840
 because he only had wooden toys and he just lost his mind and like so I just gave up on the plastics

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:25.040
 for the toy stuff and obviously Lego and stuff you can't avoid it yeah oh my boys love like yeah

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.520
 I guess that that is a one place where plastic is good but I feel like in most of the world like

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.840
 way too much is made of plastic and I feel like it's just like bad vibes I feel like everything

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.400
 just kind of looks crappier than it would have 50 years ago there's a lot of high-end plastics

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.800
 now though Porsche have put plastics all over their cars now because you can because if you buy if

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:49.760
 you build high-end plastics you can have amazing weight to like weight to strength ratio and flexibility

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:56.640
 like they do tons of high-end plastics now they're really very useful so is the like timeline such

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.520
 that we don't like the jury's not out on what plastic might be doing does because it's not been

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.480
 around long enough like I feel like plastic's been around a long time but is it just to the

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:10.080
 quantities that we see today like do we not know yet the impact on humans over some amount of time

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:16.320
 we know it's bad we know it's we know it's very okay and it's also volume it's literally

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.760
 everywhere like you microwave a takeout container you're blasting micro plastics into your food

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:29.120
 you know manufacturing right like they like any any meant fermented foods that put in giant

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.400
 industrial plastic barrels right like geez other fermented foods another thing to know is a lot of

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.240
 chemicals in a lot of American products abandoned Europe there's a lot more allowed here than it's

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.800
 out of place because they've already proven it so we're gonna learn that like our generation in

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:48.240
 America is gonna all like diet 55 or something what's what's the what should I be nervous about

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.240
 what am I worried about right now or just like diseases that we would have other i would say

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.480
 you're definitely gonna die just worry about enjoying every minute till you have it it's a good

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:04.240
 call it turns out cold plunges neutralized plastics entirely nice okay then now this new

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.880
 data on cold plunges that shows that it does too much aggravation of your nervous system and might

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:15.760
 actually no i'm getting killed in every possible way that is why it's extremely annoying to be

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.560
 married to a scientist because you get no hope you like you find something you're like you text

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:25.440
 it turn like this is awesome she's like i read the paper it's complete ball like they like they

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.320
 don't know like the amount of studies she like the the press do a terrible job with this and

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.520
 is this twitter account all it does is reply to articles and say in mice because all of them

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:43.120
 then use pick up on those of things and it's always the last thing in mice it's always

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.960
 always improved or cured in months and so it's it's relevant but nowhere near done in terms of

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.680
 reality i wish i was a mouse because i feel like they we've made mouse mice immortal at this point

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.600
 if it was solid every possible in mice problem do you know something really weird related to this

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:04.080
 at work she has catalogs where she can order diseases and people's uh DNA and people's blood

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.440
 cells and there's like specific people that there's one woman like donated blood i believe and

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:15.120
 or donated some like some cell that has been grown yeah it's a cancer one right i heard about this

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:21.360
 yeah and so she can literally say like i would like the blood of a HIV positive Hispanic male and

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:28.080
 she can get it mailed like what's so crazy i want to buy the like tissue of from a cancer cell that

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.880
 was growing in this animal straight through the mouth it's wild so so the one with the woman

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:38.800
 this woman's been dead for a long time but they can keep reproducing her cancer cells yep so she

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:45.840
 like still exists in this weird way whoa yeah just use for research legacy it's really wild did you say

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:52.800
 it was a catalog like a physical like jc penny holiday catalog like a physical book like literally

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:59.600
 she's got like a paper copy and go on the website just crazy crazy that's wild i never thought

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.440
 about that though like if you're a scientist and there's lots of them out there they need access to

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.160
 the things that they need to do experiments so i guess it makes sense that there'd be what yeah

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.680
 i gotta know like the public can't get a hold of this i guess you have to have like your science

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:18.320
 card or something science card i think if i wouldn't order this i don't know actually i'm an

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.880
 asker i'll see what i'll see what you know i'll see what we can do okay but it's a funny well like

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.840
 science is so funny because it's the literal opposite of tech like just in every way all the

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.000
 pressures and dynamics and they should be just going to work every day because they have a lab

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 and because we're like this i don't know these exist but like we're the center of biotech in

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 you know california and so there's office space in like south san francisco that we worked for

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.080
 laboratories so they can rent an office and lab space oh just like we can work and there's like

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.080
 hundreds of these things they can just go and buy lab facilities like rent them put even a day

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:57.440
 at a time if you need certain equipment it's far and the equipment they get insane it's insane the

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:04.000
 partner jersey that i'm from has a bunch of uh pharma companies there i don't really know why maybe

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.520
 it just proximity to some of the universities and we had this crazy case where this woman who was

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:20.480
 this like crazy like high-paid pharmaceutical researcher like snuck in and stole something i

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:27.200
 forgot what it was sold some chemical and she poisoned her husband with it and he didn't die

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:33.040
 but in the hospital they didn't really believe him that he was like trying to communicate that he

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:38.320
 thinks his wife poisoned him but like i don't know it didn't get across and she continued to poison

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:44.080
 him in the hospital and then he eventually died what yeah and then they caught her at the end of

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:52.000
 all of it but uh yeah they have access to some crazy stuff nice one that's some nerve she must

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.120
 have really wanted him dead to be a dude in the hospital you might have seen some hiv for you

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:05.040
 with your name on it yeah right i did see they've like completely cured hiv now i saw they like

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:10.480
 completely rid it on on someone it's pretty crazy i think i got back to incoming and it's also been

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:16.240
 like they've got they've got biologics that i think it's a biologic that um that's that's another

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.920
 interesting science kind of recentish thing is biologics but i think it's a biologic that basically

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.600
 i think it's prep um if you have any risk of exposure you take in it's you just have no chance of

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:33.280
 catching it basically wow it's so wild how far it's come compared to where it was like it was an

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:39.520
 immediate death sentence before yes true but cancer but cancer is the cancer is still just the

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:45.200
 plague and it's getting worse um it's just so hard you it's a lottery for some people you can be the

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.720
 healthiest person alive and certain cancers will just get you we like lung cancer is a fascinating one

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:55.840
 like i think it i'm sorry to anyone listening thinking my facts are wrong or whatever but i

00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:00.320
 believe it's some only like 50 to 60 percent of lung cancers are caused by smoking really didn't

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:06.080
 really know what the rest was and i we've only started to kind of figure out its cars probably

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:12.080
 plus you know just it might just happen anyway any cell division risk scans like this just we're

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:17.440
 just really learning about all these environmental factors um but it's not just like it's just not

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.040
 as obvious there's so many people that have never touched a cigarette in their life can get it like

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:28.240
 it's it's uh horrible horrible illness yeah i think i saw someone from some not exactly in our circle

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.720
 but i did i did come across on twitter like someone randomly developed like stage four

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.920
 like lung cancer like out of nowhere they they caught they when he by the time he went in it was

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.720
 like already too late it's like in his thirties i think and our cancer rate's actually increasing

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.040
 i just sounds like an obvious fact that i should just know they are maybe i don't know if they're

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:52.160
 fully increasing but the they are increasing lower down the population tree so like for certain

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.120
 cancers they just didn't ever bother testing people pre-40 or whatever you just haven't right

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:03.120
 being along to develop it um and now they are seeing a whole category of those cancers coming

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.840
 way way down in younger people which is probably things like the microplastics and things like

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:14.640
 that i wonder yeah environmental state that we're in we may cure it one day but we still don't know

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.800
 enough about it like the country she was explaining to me the other day there's still some division

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:23.040
 in belief of whether there's a cancer stem cell or not like whether they can actually like they

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.240
 don't fully know why people get cancer back and then it could just be very it's like very hard to

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.480
 find a cell and that's why even some of these treatments like a kind of risky there's a lot of

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:38.160
 treatments now that people take for you know like um you injure yourself and they like kind of take

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.640
 out stem cells you're you're glad i'm injected back in yeah well the real risk to those by the way

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:49.440
 because mismodifying a cell cells don't die every drug has a half-life a drug if they can keep

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.320
 your life at the wrong drug gets you it will just flush out of your system cells can technically

00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:00.560
 live forever inside your body so if a cell was doing the wrong thing um it could be in real trouble

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.760
 and so that one of the theories and not fully proven that cancer comes back because of stem cells

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.640
 i again could be wrong but like i know there's still just real divisions as to why some of these

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.600
 things happen yeah it's wild that it can those be a single cell and you have so many of them

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:22.080
 like it's crazy i mean think about that way it's crazy that like it goes right in most cases you

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:27.280
 know it's a lot of number of cell divisions that are happening and most of them go correctly it's

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.560
 pretty insane but it is why some kids get cancer right because they are just a constant cell division

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:37.680
 machine until they've fully got it interesting you're just high rates of interesting yeah

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.080
 you just risk a copying error or whatever well now i'm depressed i don't know uh we're gonna talk

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:47.440
 about anything else what's that you are alive at the right time that if you live healthy you can

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:52.960
 probably get quite a long life extension based on the the kind of medicine and drugs that we have

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:59.440
 like even despite all of this yeah i mean it's despite cancer rates because cold plunging increases

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:09.760
 your cancer rates but by 10x. And then yeah correct they literally say that actually in March so I think

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.680
 the other thing with mass that the other issue is like a lot of this is on mass population studies

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:19.600
 right and us and everyone who's probably listening to this podcast lives significantly better than

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:26.160
 99% of the population in terms of pretty much everything um and we have hammocks i mean hammocks

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:34.720
 right like first for my controllers you know a 15th century peasant a unified controller and

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:41.360
 they would lose they would absolutely lose their mind you know what actually buzzed me out i always

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.960
 picture like imagine your george washington and you like did this crazy thing where you fought

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.840
 revolution and then you like started a country and at that point it's like basically nothing

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:57.360
 it's like nothing and then you die yeah it sucks that he didn't get to see that it worked out right

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:03.040
 it's like yeah it's so wild that he's gotten he had no idea how well it worked out

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:08.800
 which is a sad thought i had never considered that founded the greatest country ever and doesn't

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:15.360
 even know it huh i just heard a lot of people didn't know it like it wasn't good until like

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:20.560
 maybe in the last 100 years so all the people involved just had no idea yeah the the founding

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:27.120
 fathers didn't know dinosaurs existed right we've discovered them since wait what yeah like they

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.400
 didn't know no no they didn't know well like chinese mythology like i didn't all that come

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:38.320
 from finding dinosaur bones yeah throughout history there there's been lots of reference

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.320
 they like some people believe that's like kind of maybe where people thought dragons came from or

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.080
 whether you know you know that also they've been fairly easy to find in a lot of places you know

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.560
 well yeah what i heard but i don't remember where i heard this but that like people had

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.480
 been discovering dinosaur bones for a long time but nobody had put together like what they were

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:01.680
 until like the last i don't know 150 years or something like there was no name for a dinosaur

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:07.840
 until sometime in recent modern history open a textbook in kentucky and it's the same situation

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:21.120
 i think the explanation is the devil put them in the ground to trick everyone yeah yeah i never

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:25.200
 thought about the dragon thing like dragons do seem so much like dinosaurs and it makes sense that

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:31.680
 the people long long ago that were dreaming up dragons had probably seen dinosaur bones yeah it's

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.880
 interesting yeah have you guys seen the artist renditions where they try to where they give artists

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:42.160
 skulls of things like rhinos and elephants oh yeah artists try to draw what it is and it just comes

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:49.360
 out so crazy because the animals look nothing like like you never like an elephant skull looks

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:54.800
 hilarious it like looks really funny and weird you never know they were just giant trunk thing coming

00:32:54.800 --> 00:33:00.720
 out of its head yeah it's up with the bones yeah yeah it's wow they really think trex looked like

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:07.280
 stupid animal like i know did you see the newest like you know i was like human planet blue planet

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.200
 like all that series the david amber ones they did one for dinosaur prehistoric planet

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:16.400
 and it's like our latest conception of a of a t-rex and it looks so lame yeah it's like the

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:22.400
 latest thing every got these tiny tiny arms and like it's just it's not like aerodynamic or anything

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:30.240
 like it wasn't Jurassic Park it's yeah it's not a great no such that yeah i guess if you drew a human

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.760
 from a skull you wouldn't draw the nose that's true you wouldn't have it right it's like no yeah

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.560
 it's not easy there's nothing yeah there's nothing there to go off of one of uh one of my colleagues

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:47.520
 who i've worked with for a decade now um actually no 11 years now from the github days all the way

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:53.280
 through planet scale his wife has my like dream job because i love history she's like an archaeologist

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:59.520
 she's very famous in her field she's got loads to it felt like it just really digs up bodies to study

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:05.280
 like their bones like the chemical and everything to just discover how they lived and she they can

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:10.640
 find out an unbelievable amount of stuff and it's incredible what they can learn and she went to pom

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:16.240
 pay and and like dug up one of like the really famous villas there and found loads of stuff and

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.880
 it's just so interesting it's like amazing what you can learn from these stuff and it's it's phenomenal

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:25.280
 when you like read like kind of what we're learning about history just by looking at bones like it

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.000
 it's it's amazing it's truly amazing yeah it's crazy how they like find these little hints and

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.240
 they can kind of connect the dots and draw like a pretty big conclusion because they're so little

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.920
 left you think it'd be hard to know some of this stuff but yeah because if you like stare at it long

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:42.480
 enough you can figure it out I mean even with the dinosaur stuff a lot of it is just looking at

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.160
 animals now and like understanding that okay some of these properties could have existed and

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.600
 some of these behavior could have existed the other thing was have you seen i don't know how

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:58.000
 recent this is but i came across this more recently all the theories about like south america and

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:06.320
 like the ancient civilizations that were there so i think we think of um south american history as like

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.480
 kind of what you imagine in movies and tv's like the Mayans and the Aztecs and whatever and like

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:17.040
 that level of society they had they believe that there's now there was maybe a more advanced society

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:22.960
 prior to that like on the level of like Rome that collapsed and then everything we know about was

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:28.960
 like people living in like a post-apocalyptic type of whoa environment because they found like

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:36.560
 like streets like line streets they found like all this stuff that is more advanced than what the

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:44.160
 civilizations that we know of how they operated crazy yeah it is it's wild like that like totally

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:50.720
 changes your perception of like what the world was like there's an amazing fact that Oxford University

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.200
 started teaching lessons before the Aztec Empire started like the Aztec Empire has been

00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:00.400
 and gone it was like 10.08 they started teaching at Oxford it's insane it's wild and the another

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:05.360
 thing i always find fascinating is the Romans were obsessed with the Egyptians like we are

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.600
 the Romans because they were 2000 years apart they look back at that and be like

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:18.640
 oh they just civilized they were fascinated and obviously for us it's kind of wild so now i can't

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:24.240
 stop thinking about what like a thousand years from now they're gonna think we did we like have our

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:30.480
 whatever's left of like our Sony cameras and our Elgato key lights at our desks like they're gonna

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:40.320
 run NPM once and just be like forget it put it all back it's like the oh i guess you're a

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:48.880
 github that github uh what was that thing you guys did the code the code thing the code yeah yeah what

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:55.920
 was that i don't really i never really learned to it they took a snapshot of the all of the open

00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:02.240
 swords repositories that met a certain criteria and then spooled it onto this tape that can last

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.840
 like a thousand years and buried it in a like a mine type vault near the seed vault in in the

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.480
 arctic seed vault yeah yeah it was very you know obviously i think it was like a very cool

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:18.560
 interesting fun thing to do um as like humans but now there's like old versions of bundler sounds

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:26.880
 from tapes well i i feel like when they because i like like a lot of code got in there like i i

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:33.760
 like i have that badge in github and i'm like i don't think i had anything public that i really

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.720
 wanted until that's all the time at that point i think i was good enough at that point like maybe

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:44.240
 now i'd be a little more okay with it but i guess it's there forever yeah i don't know people will

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:49.280
 look back because like what's different is we don't have a hundred percent clarity on information

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:55.920
 and that's like a lot of the mystery of it like i always think about how my kids will have

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:03.120
 crazy detailed documentation of what i look like at every single point of my life pretty much and

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.440
 like what my life was like and records of my conversations and all of it whereas i know like

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:13.280
 basically nothing about about my parents and and going backwards so yeah it definitely changes

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.400
 things a bunch well we'll know about us that they'll know about ourselves as well because we take

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.800
 pictures of them with our iPhones all the time yeah yeah like within this first month i was probably

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:26.880
 more pictures taken of our kid than ever was taken of me as a child yeah exactly i feel like sam you

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.120
 do database stuff i feel like you're gonna have an informed uh answer to this question i've never

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.920
 thought about this before but like we talk about the doomsday clock and like the chances of a

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:41.120
 civilization is destroying itself is there like some chance that like all the data that exists

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:45.200
 out there right now just gets wiped out for some reason at some point in history like is there a

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:52.240
 similar risk where we're all fine but we lose like all of this it would not be like a i don't have

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:56.400
 to be like a massive electromagnetic pulse that's what i was thinking i guess yeah like i know of

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.080
 those but i don't know if there's other risks that i just don't know about depends depends how many

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.920
 availability zones you're running in yeah right yeah yeah i guess it just seems crazy to think like

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:12.800
 500 years from now that there's not some chance that all this data has gone somewhere um disappeared

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:17.360
 i mean i think that people have already lost a load of data from archiving that they wish they

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:22.480
 had back in the age of ai right like people just used to like a lot of people like you know we

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.360
 sometimes get customers that we'll talk to and then they're trade off for them like if they're not

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.960
 very large the trade off for them is like hmm can't maybe we'll make a product decision to delete

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:40.560
 some data maybe um to like stave off having to go scale but we have a big emphasis on like consumer

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.040
 products basically because consumer experiences are ruined without data like if like Strava can't

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:49.200
 archive your best run you know just because it was five years ago you're going to remember that

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:55.360
 like consumer experiences you remember a lot more but for some people and because of technical

00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:00.720
 limitations especially in the kind of data center age um the early data center age you just got

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:05.280
 rid of data and i probably lost a load of really cool things because of that a sad thing a really

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:10.160
 sad thing is that we've lost great internet sites yeah the the data thing is crazy because i have

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:15.840
 this like visceral image i get where sometimes i think about it i'm like i'm hitting the camera

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.680
 button on my phone i'm taking a picture is getting uploaded to the cloud that's like ending up on

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:24.800
 some hard drive it's someone's job it's some team's job just to keep like manufacturing and

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.600
 installing these hard drives over and over and over and i'm like can this really go on infinitely

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:35.680
 like is my data really going to be there forever or at some point does it need to get reclaimed because

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.480
 like the whole world is constantly uploading a crazy amount of data every single day and

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:45.520
 we're able to keep up with it but it feels weird you know i can actually answer this quite well

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:50.880
 because i worked at facebook and i can tell you that old data at facebook eventually goes to tape

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:59.680
 it goes that far and facebook was like another tier of cold storage that is so cold that if it's

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:04.800
 not being accessed the disk literally spins down and when it gets when it gets access it will wake

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:12.000
 itself back up so it goes on hyperscript like very large spinning bladders and gets spun down to

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.080
 store all this stuff the hilarious thing is like the highest load peak and from from kind of like

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:23.280
 or october onwards everyone's preparing for new year's eve so that the entire world can send us a

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:30.800
 blurry shitty picture a video of a pilot like and but the scale the scale is absolutely insane

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:36.560
 um a fact i and i i you know i had two teams i had the traffic the edge the edge like the traffic

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:42.560
 team basically that did all of the 12% of the planets internet was mount is is facebook alone

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:48.160
 and then the other team i had was the video infrastructure team which is our infrastructure

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:54.320
 was what received and everything's custom at facebook like what uh inside what's happened facebook

00:41:54.320 --> 00:42:02.080
 the video um was it out codec whatever however whatever your format is custom to facebook

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:06.480
 they have their own networking um like it's not moving too quick but it's like an own networking

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:11.120
 stack that's in every client because you have things like we have like services like cartographer

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:16.000
 because when you go on vacation we now need to start serving you stuff more locally to you

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.600
 but not forever we don't want to move your database so like the app can ask where to go and that's

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.240
 all done and managed automatically through like apis inside the apps it's all custom but

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:35.280
 there is more it is an insane fact there are more servers at facebook that receive process and put

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:43.680
 images on blob storage than the entire of azure wow that is really one there's one node class and

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:51.600
 it's more machines than at all of azure globally that's insane it's a whole well you said 12%

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:57.120
 of internet traffic is facebook mm-hmm wow this is what this is why this is so crazy to me because

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:02.560
 your point is yeah most of that stuff is garbage and never gonna be needed like it's never really

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:07.200
 gonna be needed again like 99.9% of it is never really gonna be needed again we have to store it all

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:12.480
 just in case it is and this feels like is a whole world it's gonna be like a giant hard drive at

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.880
 one point like this is how i always thought about dead people like how do we not run out of space

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:22.400
 to bury people yeah i've always wondered that decompose yeah so then we just we just reuse the

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:29.120
 space we just oh well that's like a weird thing right like let's say you buy a funeral plots yeah

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.520
 like what is it like what's your right on that you're buying it like but then

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:40.400
 who's there to defend it if someone claims it you know you always see these like big construction

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.760
 projects getting delayed because it's very hard to dig deep into the ground in the uk and like

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:52.800
 there's a lot of not undead people and so there was a mystery of like i think king which disappeared

00:43:52.800 --> 00:44:01.040
 they found him on a parking lot like but the other one there like there was like a tube station

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.680
 being built in london and they accidentally dug into like a grave site of a monastery that'd be

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:10.480
 in there for like a thousand years so it was like they had to move respectfully move hundreds of

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.560
 dead monks somewhere else so they could build this train because you have to just like eventually

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.760
 you want to be respectful but you kind of got to be like there's other shit to do now guys you're

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:22.800
 a long dead like and shift you up it's weird so when i lived in uh when i was in new york my apartment

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:28.000
 there so right next to trinity church and if you if you've seen national treasure the finest

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.760
 international treasure is in trinity church when they go under it into that gritty tunnel

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:37.440
 but what's wild is it's literally like next to the world trade center like if you're buried there

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:42.800
 your grave is facing like the world trade center and some of those graves are there from like the

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.520
 1600s like i think as in our hamilton's also buried there whoa and i'm like these people were

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:52.240
 buried so long ago and they have this they have no again the same thing they have no idea they have

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:59.920
 this like insane insane plot of land like they're buried in this crazy spot i'm like at some place

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:05.200
 can't be there forever maybe i was in our hamilton you know he's famous and relevant but it's just

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:09.440
 like these random people that have like almost unmarked graves that are that are right next to it and

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.760
 it's in this wild location you know yep you could just know it over and build a barry's boot camp

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:19.360
 it would just be really useful just so much money as well

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:26.640
 now i don't understand i have to look into it because i do i do wonder what's like the legal

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:31.040
 stuff is when you buy a plot like is it a lease for some out of time

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:36.160
 must be right basically all land lease holds technically like aren't we really isn't it

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:43.280
 because government can always take it from you yeah yeah the sad thing about history is the

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.520
 recycling that happened though right because it ain't older civilizations that didn't care about

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:52.080
 preserving anything and some still don't right like the you i think the really interesting thing

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:56.800
 about the uk is even for like a thousand years we've actually still been interested in our

00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.040
 own history and history like some of the earliest historians were like bead in britain's and so

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.920
 we've always preserved stuff like the oldest house i have we're talking about old houses the oldest

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:11.280
 house i lived in was 550 years old whoa my mom used to live in america yeah she used to convert

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:16.480
 houses right she was her job she bought like old houses and she converted them and she converted

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:21.760
 chapel as well as i lived in a chapel that was a good reuse of like old stuff but like this this

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.480
 550-year-old house had up the chimney they were doing they put a flu up yeah i had to put an artificial

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:32.240
 one up because the bricks were so old and they were going up and um my stepfather found a

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.320
 eight by eight secret room inside the chimney stack that was from the reformation where priests

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:44.160
 used to go and hide up the chimney to not get uh found by the protestants and so we've we've

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:51.040
 served history so fantastically well but the roe like the roe sort of the catholics like destroyed

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:55.600
 all of the roman palaces to build um simpius bersilica and stuff like that so we just we've

00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:00.960
 lost we've lost the majority of the amazing artifacts that we've known existed in history

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.120
 unfortunately because of that level of recycling we're just now getting better and not destroying

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:09.600
 things and appreciating them yeah it's wild because you would think that's so innate but it's not so

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:14.560
 in miami uh there's a bunch of art deco stuff here from i don't know why maybe like the

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:20.480
 50s or 60s i don't know exactly when it's one is from preserved really well like and it's really

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:27.680
 cool but this was not a miami thing miami was planning on just demolishing all of it and building

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:33.600
 like new stuff a bunch of people from new york came here and they were like no this is actually

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:38.320
 cool and they like fought to put up all this stuff to like preserve the art deco thing so

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:42.960
 yeah weirdly like it's you can be blind to that stuff i guess as as obviously as it

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:47.120
 as it might seem you have to care why preserving it we still lose our effects we lost one of it

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:51.440
 wasn't it one of the seven ones of the world we lost recently what oh really of the ancient world

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:55.360
 i think there's these in afghanistan these these giant carved butters they're huge and they're

00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:02.160
 beautiful the taliban just like to piss everyone off um they just like fired um mortar shells at

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:08.720
 them and just just destroyed them i was really sad i had heard this like revolutions and all

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:13.680
 of these things like you know people take big digs at the british museum but they probably should

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:19.440
 send the stuff back now but it's extremely revisionist because most things like the algan marbles would

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:25.840
 be gone and and they were they were bought a like a british explorer went to greece during some sort

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:32.640
 of socialist thing and said can i buy those and they were like sure oh good shit just literally

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:39.680
 bought them like and you know and then no one knew like like the rosetta stone was like the french

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:43.120
 like they stole it but i think proton was just like needing some bread on it there's some ridiculous

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:49.280
 stories about this stuff people were using just like crazy things from history that they just found

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.440
 and yeah like most of it was just like sold and some a lot was a lot was

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:58.560
 blended but it existed a because people take care of and look after this stuff yeah the the monument

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:05.280
 thing is funny because i recently learned that the french sold the ark to try off to saudi arabia

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:10.240
 so which sounds like what does that even mean but that's a point right like it's just free money

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:16.400
 you can just sell it to saudi arabia it's still in france it's not gonna move and technically saudi

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.680
 arabia i'm saying you know you just like got free money i'm sure you can sell to like throw

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:26.720
 their people too if you want yeah you can buy insane things you can buy futures on parking

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:32.160
 meters in san francisco you can buy just you can just like buy all of that like you give basically three

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:36.080
 four five years of forward revenue and then as price is increased you can get you can hear the

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:41.120
 differences yeah i think securitizes is great uh yeah that's the thing in new york too i mean

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:45.360
 even just parking spaces in new york go for like a million dollars there's like some like private

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:52.160
 parking spaces it's uh that's crazy the same story like you can buy yeah that's wow really well

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:56.640
 this this thing with all i mean you're from you're from the uk so you have like when you say like

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:01.200
 you said you lived in a house is fine or 50 years old like that's impossible here like for us and

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:06.880
 like florida is even like it's so new like nothing years over 100 years old like it just was nothing

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:13.120
 before then so yeah old for us like doesn't really exist compared to you guys it's very relative

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.960
 yeah i was trying to think if there's if i've encountered a man-made object that's older than 100

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:22.240
 years old probably not i can't think of what it be wait so where you live there's not houses older

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:28.000
 than 100 years old i mean 100 around 100 years old i guess i think for me the oldest in america

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.840
 there's parts of new york there's some streets in new york that are from like the dutch

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:37.040
 the original dutch settlement and those are like 1500 something like that i think

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:42.560
 maybe 1600 i don't know exactly what but that's probably in america at least i don't know if it gets

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:50.320
 older than that that's like well you've got like a dobo kind of houses in where's that new mexico is

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:57.680
 it like you've got the kind of more native buildings that here that they are pretty old um but for

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.680
 yeah for like kind of the modern era of america i don't know how much there would be there may be

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.680
 some artifacts there's obviously artifacts and stuff that we have here but yeah yeah it's kind of

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:10.880
 strange it's it's it's funny how different cultures based on the length of their time i think it

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:16.880
 genuinely i think really affect like we're just babies in america we're just little

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:22.880
 little baby civilization yeah we're like a kind of growth stage startup of countries now i guess

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:31.440
 yeah it's in the bureaucracy comes in mm-hmm i went to europe for the first time a couple months

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:35.360
 ago and yeah that was the main thing like i would just we were just we're in lesbian and we just

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:40.480
 like everything was just like shockingly shockingly old and it it's all like

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.240
 oh it works really well it looks looks pretty good i think it was really small i will say that

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:49.280
 like for most of the parts of was when we were in all the apartments were like just small and i'm

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:55.280
 not like a big person and i'm like this feels kind of cramped like were humans just smaller back then

00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:02.000
 or like what was what was going on i i love like in this five hundred fifty four like i was you know

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:08.880
 a teenager and i was i probably like five eight at that time right like just i would smash my head

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:14.960
 off the top of the doors it's amazing to think back at history and think of all these great

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:19.440
 epic battles and tales i think it's just like five-foot people running around with shorts

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:26.640
 it would just be hilarious to watch now like the battle passion core would just look

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:32.400
 i'm so funny to us and i like more people smacking each other it's really amazing

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:39.360
 yeah in new york we have them the met and uh they have like this armor yeah detection and you see

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:45.840
 like the badass like spartan armor it like it looks like it's made for a child it wouldn't even fit me

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:51.920
 at all yeah i'm sure they wouldn't still kick my ass but it's just it just doesn't fit in your brain

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:56.560
 and it's weird because it's not like i'm sure Vikings were still big back then i'm sure there

00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:00.880
 were some people that were large but uh so like when these groups ran to each other it just must have

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:07.520
 been hilarious yeah yeah so fun this this tales of big people right like so 1066 there was a Viking

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:13.200
 berserker he was like they talked to it biomass if he was seven-foot tall he like stood on a bridge

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:17.600
 and like held like 20 people i've killed 20 men before finally someone snuck under the bridge

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:22.240
 and got him but like spared him but like there's this tour of these berserkers i also lived in

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:28.400
 india and i grew up there um for a period of my life and i love going back i go back every year and

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:34.080
 you know you can go to jai pore and go to the fort and they look back at this kind of there's

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:40.560
 like Rajasthani kings and and they were huge they were giant they they're like one of the princes

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:46.800
 was just massive and they had his sword and it was like you just look at it and you're like i

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:52.320
 couldn't pick this up they don't have to like properly like this is like the fact someone wielded

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:56.480
 that he was like seven-foot tall it was just unbelievable because they just had these like random

00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:03.360
 giant people um that's the funny thing about india is because uh there's just like i think

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:07.200
 there's like a wide range of genetics i feel like in some ways like i'm from the south so

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:13.040
 yeah everyone's like pretty small but like on the north side like uh like pun job like those

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:20.560
 people can get huge but we're all the same race yeah but then if you go look at who's in the army

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:26.240
 it's like just one one subsection of the country because they're all just just way bigger than the

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:31.520
 rest of us yeah a lot of it like cars car the car car system did a lot of that that was true yeah

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:37.520
 who's the ones who's the warrior class what's the one just below brandon i just i don't have this

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:42.720
 memorized i don't know that will that will be there will be an executive selection like you just

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:49.840
 eventually like like societal roles will select for these traits over time you know it works

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:56.000
 yeah so it's shifting gears a little bit so planet scale stuff what's going on there

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.480
 all right this was like we this week has been amazing i'm actually a little tired right now

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:05.760
 i was up to working last night 11 the night 4 and 2 again on monday with colleagues like the like

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:10.400
 we've just we've unlocked a few things that we are insanely excited like we've had a shift i won't

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:16.240
 and tell you now i will tell you both after this we've had a quite a shift and so we're very excited

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:22.240
 we've just moved some very large databases onto our cloud platform which was very fun i see you

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:28.400
 tweet some of that sometimes the numbers just blow my mind yeah yeah it's it's actually going

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:32.640
 back to like scale facebook scale stuff like that is one of my biggest learnings personal growth

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:38.880
 learnings is there is zero point talking about like your trade-offs that you've made for scalability

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:43.360
 to people that don't give a shit about like they just don't care they don't understand what it means

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:49.680
 to scale i get it it's fine they haven't seen it but like once you see that stuff and the size like

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:53.280
 people used to complain about us like the the minimum cost of a database right well

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:58.640
 the way our architecture looks it's all in service of we actually have some databases that

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:03.760
 have 10 000 nodes just in that one cluster right and so we've made all the trade-offs for making

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.720
 that work and the bottom like i don't care about the like 29 buck one yeah yeah and so

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:12.320
 you're going to see a lot more from us in terms of um we've got some incredibly cool

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:17.200
 at scale stories and benchmarks and proof points and stuff to show it's just been really fun it's

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:21.520
 been really really good to do those things it's interesting like i hadn't thought about

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:27.200
 the scale situation from a planet scale perspective like you have to scale with all of your customers

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:32.240
 which is interesting like it's not like a vertical situation where you have to worry about this one

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:37.760
 company like facebook crazy scale yeah but planet scale like is the it's the cumulative total of

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:41.760
 all of your customer scale which is kind of nuts like different types of problems i guess absolutely

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:48.240
 and it's very fun though because we know about games launches for major blockbuster games

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:54.320
 because yeah because they tell us right um we know like black friday cyber monday is a hilarious

00:56:54.320 --> 00:57:00.480
 fun at planet scale yeah we have one customer they they they send like the third largest

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:03.600
 amount of text messages in america can you guess the top of the first two

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:13.680
 twillio's number one who's in the middle just been oh jeez i have no idea uber uber certainly

00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:20.560
 oh interesting so their biggest like like so much their business is made up between black friday

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:24.160
 cyber monday like it's just such a big deal for retail basically and we're now we've got like a

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:28.320
 lot of retail customers so for all these kind of retail black like their load graph the first

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:33.680
 day before just goes first doesn't check like it's just like a hundred thousand years and then

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:37.840
 the Tuesday just goes whoop just drops straight off and so fun we didn't see and he learned about

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:44.240
 like customers products and stuff they're doing and it's just real fun it's actually really fun i do

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:48.880
 like we've now got some very big consumer apps that run on planet scale so buying a coffee is a

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:52.160
 little stressful for me now and then if it doesn't go wrong i'd be straight to what i do if it doesn't

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:59.360
 happen i'll go straight to my laptop like there's like there's something like there's some stressful

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:05.440
 things about it i i think like we calculated if we did a if we had a full like global outage which

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:09.280
 never we've actually never caused a customer a full outage which is incredible if we did a full

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:14.880
 global outage we'd take down about 150 billion of market cap instantly if we went down so we take

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:19.120
 that so seriously and it's so that's why yeah and everything is done in scale it's just like

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:24.800
 so refined to do certain operations that are normally scary like we have to do about a hundred

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:29.760
 thousand database failures a week just because we have to roll versions then we have to do whatever

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:34.320
 and so normally like a database failover is like a massive thing for people to deal with

00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:39.760
 just kind of rolls right it just kind of goes through it um yeah it's fun but it's it's no one

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.360
 you don't you can't just like you don't sh that's not a shiny feature right you can't do a laundry

00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:49.680
 about well we can roll you know i mean like we can do these yeah and scare it's not that that's

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:54.400
 to be invisible yeah yeah and that's like that that's a whole marvel how invisible it is yeah exactly

00:58:54.400 --> 00:59:00.720
 and and the people that we focus on now the customers we focus on now they have problems that

00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:05.520
 require that solution and they love it they they pay for you know it just works like they have

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:10.560
 they have businesses that are just ripping in growth and it's not stopping you have to fix it

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:14.960
 you have the database has to happen right and so it's much nicer to focus on the end of the market

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:20.560
 because we also work with customers where we've worked at that company before or like some of our

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:26.000
 employees have worked to that company and i've said to people you know i you know i like you know

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.520
 we've got the guy that i invented long line schema changes he works here would you hire him

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:34.960
 obviously why would you build a thing like 60 of his friends have been building with him

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:39.040
 and just buy that right like it so it's a very when you work with people that truly

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:43.360
 their other choice is doing it themselves they really learn what you're actually doing for them

00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:48.560
 it's impossible to get to do that for a hobby yes like they just don't it's like how cheap is it

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:54.320
 is the only thing they care about or free you know yeah yeah so it brings me a question that i had

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:59.520
 so there's obviously those are two ends of the market right like you know crazy scale and the

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:04.640
 people that are you know they're looking for them it's effectively free i don't i don't fall into

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:09.440
 either end so how do you guys think about like the mid-level people that are never going to have

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:14.240
 scale but you know they're not complaining they're paying a couple hundred bucks a month for a

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:20.000
 database either is that like they do yeah just wondering how you think about that like which

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.320
 camp are they lumped more into in your eyes i guess like do you view them more like the indie

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:29.120
 hacker types or do you view them no no more like yeah because you're clearly running a business on it

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:35.760
 and our intrinsic motivation is to not cause outages for anyone the trust is basically like

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:42.080
 care about that so much but the rising tide raises all boats and you benefit from things that have

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:47.760
 been built for so many other people and we can like hand that down to you you were at the beginning

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:53.920
 of the thing i really obsess about which is the graduation curve from startup to public company

01:00:53.920 --> 01:01:00.240
 with a petabyte of data in your relational database and we want to unlock those so it feels very

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:07.040
 gradual because no database probably has ever done that if your company takes off it is a inevitable

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:14.080
 guarantee you reject your database or you will have to significantly the database at github

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.800
 the database was harder than the get stack and you can't buy an awryly book on scaling get platforms

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:23.280
 like if anyone would have been awry you would have been asked when you wrote a one-off distributed

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.920
 system he works for plant scale as well the guy who built that like this one-off distributed

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:34.560
 system that hosts all of the world's code and that was easier than scaling relational databases

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:40.960
 every every company runs into this may use year like when you have that middle year and we work

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.440
 with a lot of companies in that middle year of like we're a real deal now they at that year's

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:49.360
 lost because only going back to your customers not being mad at you you've shipped nothing

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:57.040
 and so that's a year out of it it's what 10 to 13 years you get limited to build a company

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:03.040
 so soon it's 10 percent gone because of database problems i want to eliminate that in the long run

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:06.880
 like i like hopefully it feels obvious to you that you use plant scale because it makes you

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.720
 more productive you're not scared i hope you're not getting a database stack like that's the

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:15.360
 like if you i hope you know you can like speed the change into production and it's like gonna

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.800
 work you know you know like your first thing and again we do stuff under the hood like we

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.400
 rate limit you if you like try sending high demand traffic during a schema change would turn the

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.560
 schema change down and do all this sort of stuff to make it stable the idea is you should build

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:32.640
 super fast because you're in a lot to do so and you can do schema change you can do whatever you want

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.840
 in your databases and braking and then we want as you start to take off that become very progressive

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:43.840
 and so soon very soon you'll see and all everyone have the ability to shard in the ui that has been

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:49.600
 a very hard thing to do um extremely hard the test is so complicated there is hundreds of flags for

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.640
 single commands to do very complicated things you have to choose what's so that's the long-term

01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:00.480
 vision of plant scale is we have the tech around youtube 70 000 servers 20 data centers some of the

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:06.800
 largest relational databases on earth run in vites um bring that to people in a way that

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:12.000
 they're starting on the eventual state but it feels like they're on the hottest new thing

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.560
 and they will just ride that graduation curve as they go that is the thing that gets me most excited

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:22.720
 about um building database companies i've seen and lived through many companies having database

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.680
 hell yeah yeah i wish i wish there were companies in every category doing that because i do think

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:34.000
 there's a whole lot of div platformy things that they don't have that and people just don't even

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.560
 know that yeah they're kind of like set up for this year of pain that you described yeah for

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:44.400
 whatever their web hosting or whatever else so on the other side uh i guess there's always this

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:49.920
 assumption that oh plant scale exists therefore there's going to be like a postgres equivalent

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:55.920
 and i remember site as being a thing i think they got acquired by azure and then they like just

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:00.560
 didn't work out yeah i do have a sense of why there isn't like something on the other side

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:09.920
 yeah there's multiple multiple reasons um so it starts off with if there's going to be a plant

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.960
 scale for postgres it will be built by a planet scale because you just the intangibles the things

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.920
 we know the experience we have running operations at scale like every single person in the engineering

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:24.560
 team has worked at one of the largest websites on earth basically you know like every single one

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:30.160
 of us um we have the first in like our vp of info he was the first infrastructure higher at instagram

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:35.520
 like we have just been around for a very long time load of us built github like you know we know

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:44.000
 this shit one very hard to assail that um two vatests is so mature it is nearly two million

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.240
 i think always like one million or two million lines of code it's like the oldest go app around

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:55.040
 that's still running it was built to serve for one of the second lives website or third lives on the planet

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.680
 those failovers that failover code being trusted 100% of the time all of that stuff it's very hard to

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:06.240
 build that in and then what people hate to hear when i tell them this is postgres is a great database

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:13.280
 that's true they don't hate that bit that's it's a great database but in around like in the 90s postgres

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:18.320
 and my sequel diverged heavily like the the design goals of early my sequel it's hilarious to look

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:25.280
 back at it now was user experience and operability right what's the main thing like you could you

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:33.040
 could do um like master multiple replicas in my sequel in the year 2000 like easily you know real

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:38.640
 logical like real good replication postgres just ship that right and it's not wrong they're trade

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:44.000
 offs for different um but they literally postgres like my sequel is like we're gonna make it easy

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.960
 to scale and scale was relative to those that era postgres kind of more started as like a correct

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:54.560
 like a prod single server like correctness was very key demonstrate the power of sequel and then

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:59.040
 they've retrofitted good things at scale and that's going great like they've got some fundamental

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:04.880
 issues like every connection makes a process instead of yeah that's a huge one it that's one

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:10.320
 that I like don't get how everyone isn't constantly complaining about because like the one time I

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.560
 tried to use Postgres and we had like a multi-tenant type of or certain we had a single tenant type

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:19.200
 of deployment so every single one of our customers got their own container talking to a single

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:24.880
 database yeah like the connection management there was just impossible and I'm confused how like

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:30.000
 nobody is like there's a couple of maintainers trying to push it through and they just get framed

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.040
 people don't want to hear the postgres of any faults it's crazy yeah yeah I did see I did see

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:38.480
 something with someone was suggesting reworking that whole it's obviously a crazy amount of work

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:46.160
 but yeah again just it's just funny because it so reminds you of that time where it's like oh yeah

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.960
 just if you want to do anything in parallel you submit a new process like yeah yeah that's like

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:54.480
 that's approached everything which doesn't make any sense at all anymore it's just so expensive

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:59.760
 for the server to do that like yeah I see I see guides with like when you get to 2,000 connections

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:07.200
 you need PG bouncer every MySQL node that get help has 70,000 active connections to it

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:12.960
 oh yeah they're 4k each and they sit there doing nothing when they're not being used yeah you have

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:20.400
 to like load a ton of RAM and you're not actually using any of it it's uh yeah well the pricing side

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:26.800
 that always gets really out of whack yeah so MySQL has like in a db which is an exceptionally

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:34.880
 before storage engine um MySQL replication is incredibly robust and is used all over plant scale

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.680
 and is used at other like most companies like very large scale companies rely on MySQL replication

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.840
 to be their cross data center replication right like you replicate to your MySQLs you rebuild

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:49.280
 all the caches on the other side it's like hyper robust and MySQL is extremely operable like no

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:54.720
 matter like just no matter what you want to say the reason it powers most of the top 100 internet

01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:01.840
 websites which it just truly does um is because for a long time it's been robust and at scale that's

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:06.560
 all you really choose is our probability and robustness is automation tooling it's predictable it does

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:11.920
 all that stuff so we have the test counts on a bunch of that stuff Postgres will get there

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:17.600
 eventually and maybe we'll do Postgres one day but like this level of operability has meant that

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:23.920
 the largest graph database on earth has actually sharded MySQL the larger one on earth is actually

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:28.720
 sharded MySQL it kind of just ends up all boiling down through under the hood you need to just your

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:34.240
 data stores just need to be heavily sharded fast and consistent and you just build everything else

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:39.120
 on top and so when you boil it down what it's really good at the job to be done MySQL is exceptionally

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:45.200
 good at doing that like it's very good yeah i think even dynamo is uh it's on top of MySQL too right

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:52.480
 yeah into me yeah i've never understood like enough about the differences in my sequel in

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:57.760
 Postgres i feel like such a dummy but i've never understood why app developers people like me who

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:05.280
 just build like at this very high level stuff like pages and components and whatever like why do

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:08.640
 people have strong preferences there's a lot of people that love Postgres and i don't even know

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:13.760
 what they love about it like why they choose it as it was it has a million features Postgres has

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:19.280
 so many features like i just don't use any features well i just don't know how you build i think

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.840
 some people like to do how the database do everything and then other people like to have

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.880
 the application do everything yep and at scale obviously the application scale is bigger than

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:33.440
 the database so it's dumb to do everything in the database uh but yeah it has like an insane

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:40.000
 amount of features like what i like and i and i like i started with Postgres when i moved to

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:47.040
 MySQL later and initially i was like uh like less features yeah but over time i started like

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:52.880
 that more because i'm like there's it's a smaller surface area and i like that smaller surface area

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:58.160
 i had to go back to Postgres for something and i was like yeah there's more stuff here but you

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:04.080
 know it does like complicate things quite a lot i still feel so dumb but like what features like

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:10.000
 what are they we have we have more types they have more some some correct something they're more

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:17.520
 correct on my super defaults like ridiculously dumb defaults um in terms of like encodings and

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.440
 shit like that it's just by default bad they fix that a lot of that stuff now but like it has way

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.880
 more types they had JSON columns in the early days but again like this is a great and like this

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.960
 is a great perfect analogous between Postgres and MySQL world so they built JSON columns

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:39.200
 um and that they sucked at the beginning of course they did it quite early but the performance was

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:45.280
 terrible like and people would just say don't use these things but Facebook looked at that and

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:50.240
 said that's good i like JSON columns that's a good idea so you built them in too much it took

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:55.520
 them a year to build it in MySQL or whatever and put it into prod on an obscene amount of MySQL

01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:01.680
 servers um and it was working robustly and then Postgres got good and that's the difference right

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:05.200
 like you can ship something early that isn't going to get used by Facebook or you have the

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:09.440
 burden of shipping something that's going to get used by Facebook and you kind of converge maybe

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.920
 round the same time but one is like a lot more operable still and can do all of these types of

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.720
 things and so it might be with a lot slower to do a lot of these chase these features of Postgres

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.840
 implements and they're and they're they're they're architecture is a lot more segmented

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.800
 and they have a plug plug-ins architecture as well yeah i was gonna say the extensions are a big

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.080
 big thing yeah which is actually very good right so people do these extensions they have downsides

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.600
 they don't have like full access to all the APIs that would allow you to like really perform

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:42.720
 things or whatever but the other side of that is Amazon has to only has to verify them because

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.040
 one of the largest ways people were getting hacked on Amazon was because of extensions and

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.280
 somebody and the other thing is like people used to shit on us for having not having foreign keys

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:56.560
 and still not supporting triggers and we never will ever support triggers and no one at scale

01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:02.000
 uses that foreign keys it's because no one needs these things at scale it just doesn't it does not

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.360
 matter to have these things so we just don't like bother supporting that stuff because

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.840
 that scale people don't need it but at not scale there's loads of little features and things you

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:18.320
 can do and build so so this idea dax hinted at it of like doing most stuff in your application

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:22.480
 and not in your database that's actually good because that's i just felt lazy for not learning

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:26.480
 how to do all the stuff in the database but maybe that's just okay and that's even a good

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:31.520
 way to build such saying it's a big it depends on that one unfortunately it's very unsatisfying

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:37.920
 it's all trade-offs but i fully believe you just shouldn't do dumb things inside your database and

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:44.320
 people do really dumb things inside the database yeah and people also don't understand that certain

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:52.160
 types of data can be stored in much more efficient ways on other specialized databases and so

01:12:53.040 --> 01:13:00.960
 it's a yeah it's a big like search isn't very good in the in my sequel not right now anyway and

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:06.880
 so you might have to like archive your data like replicate it over to search to get better

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:11.840
 search and stuff like that sure but for a small amount of data on a simple website the search is

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:16.960
 like just enough and it just depends but people we do when people move to us and they have to move

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:21.360
 to a shaded architecture that's when they do have to do a bit of app changing and a little

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:27.040
 changing around but when you're going to scale everything sucks like there's just no like at any

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:33.360
 scale it's all bespoke you know there's just you're working on it there's a five-person team at

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:38.320
 Facebook that are the world's experts on TCP and they work on network level so so many rewrote all

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:44.080
 of the network drivers to get performed like just everything just whack a mowling cost efficiency

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:49.520
 speed performance uptime and everything sucks and everything breaks yeah i read this book called

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:56.320
 the art of postgres sequel and what was interesting about it is it went to the extreme of being like

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:01.680
 here's like what code you'd normally write but it turns out you can just do that like directly in

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.800
 postgres and it goes like that crazy extreme it was definitely interesting but i feel like it

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.800
 like totally messed up my perspective for like a year till i shook it off because i started feeling

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:16.320
 bad anytime i like was pulling out a little bit more data than i technically needed because i could

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:21.280
 have like massaged it in a certain way in a database but i think it's like recover from reading that

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:26.960
 book to get to a good place but yeah like there are people that argue like any kind of like reshaping

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.280
 your data because like it's in one format and you need it in a different format to serve from your

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.800
 API they say like technically your postgres database can do that if you write your right queries to

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:41.840
 reshape it the way you want and then you just pipe it through your application the downside is

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.040
 that work of transformation is not like your data doesn't have to do that work your application

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:52.080
 can do it and your application like scales easier than your database so you know like maybe you

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:58.320
 shouldn't be doing it there it's it's lots of in that pattern yeah stored procedures are a mistake

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:05.040
 no no one should be putting that amount of logic um yeah we've we've spoken to people coming from

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:10.720
 other databases sort of written giant and had thousands of stored procedures so they've got a whole second

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:16.640
 code base inside their database and it's bad it just doesn't work it doesn't scale um the whole

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:20.880
 like though if you don't understand that stored procedure you could like it makes it really hard

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.880
 because you have to understand the upper level stack like the code uh the language of the upper

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:29.440
 level stack then how a store procedures work and the edge cases that could perform just to get back

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:35.040
 silly it's just it's just bad it's just shouldn't be done yeah i think what people forget about code

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.640
 is everyone's so practiced with it like we're practiced at collaborating on it we're practiced

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.600
 at like like using it with git and like looking at the history and pull requests and workflows and

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:50.000
 all that stuff like goes away when you try to eject out of out of code yeah i did come across but when

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.840
 i was consulting i did come across a team that did everything through store preach procedures like

01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:01.680
 they're all their business logic everything was in there now obviously like it wasn't great but

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:05.200
 it was also one of those things where they've been doing it that way for super long and they like

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:10.480
 kind of gotten decent and doing stuff that way yeah it definitely isn't for me now i think i

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:15.920
 recommend it for anyone but like i can see how you can maybe like get good at like almost anything

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:21.120
 if you do it for long enough yeah some people do some really hard like people talk about monoliths

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:25.120
 most people's real monolith is their database but a lot of people have more than one application

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:30.480
 talking to their database and that's again where maybe it's better to have some stuff in the database

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:35.040
 but probably don't do that so consistency yeah probably shouldn't do that well we're at like an

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:40.720
 hour and a half this was fun yeah it was good it's really fun that i won't listen to because i hate

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:50.480
 my own voice so it's pretty weird if i do wake up before i am in the morning my own voice yeah i know

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:56.000
 if it's even first next episode you guys hear yourself it is weird yeah i used to i think i used to

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.440
 hate the way my i think everyone hates the way their voice sounds i've gotten used to because i like

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:05.440
 hear it by accident so much now um but it is weird when i like sometimes like i'll hear like my like

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:11.600
 it was listening to like me and Adam's voice and i'm like this is it's like kind of a weird experience

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:19.760
 yeah yeah if i do if i do ever do a like like formal this is like purely only like a tech podcast

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:24.160
 that just want you to talk about planet scale i just send it to a couple people my team and just

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:35.760
 please listen to this and jack i didn't say anything stupid that's funny on that note we can send this

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:41.760
 to you if you want to take a call to run it by just to stick in my ever expanding bag of data that i

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:49.280
 want people to discover discover oh there you go yeah i was just gonna say i have to figure out

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:53.840
 my unified controller something is wrong my whole house doesn't have the internet i was gone for a

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:59.360
 little bit and i restarted mine well things are good what a coincidence not a good not a good

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.120
 commercial for you know that's great that's what if you say nice things about competing level

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:08.480
 immediately let you down yeah they will exactly okay exactly yeah it was funny when you got on

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.880
 your like if you don't hate computers you haven't worked in it long enough uh my dad's an engineer

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:19.360
 and it's funny because if you see him operate in his like day-to-day life you would never think

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.600
 he knows anything about tech because at this point he just hates everything and doesn't want to

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:29.520
 learn anything so like he's always like does not use a tv doesn't know how to like do anything

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:34.960
 anything but he's built some wild crazy stuff in his career yeah but you know he's like he's

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:40.080
 he's over all of it at this point yeah i've met in so many people that oh i know people who have

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:45.280
 retired they closed their laptop and i'm never looking at a fucking computer ever again that's

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:52.640
 awesome so it's gone i wanted off into the words it's fantastic yeah okay should we do it we'll take

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:57.600
 a little bite do we say goodbye at the end yeah yeah goodbye we're terrible we're terrible at the

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:04.720
 ending we don't ever know thanks for coming on sam yeah bye

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.860
 (gentle music)
