WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
 Oh, I got to show my screen.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.760
 It's just my face.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.280
 Hang on.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.960
 It is crazy how far we can fall.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.400
 This is the best stream I've ever done.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.040
 This hurts my soul back.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.960
 A title on Twitch is building a slack app with a good video.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.000
 That was so long ago.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.560
 OK, how do I change the title?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.440
 Let's change the title.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Welcome to the podcast.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.480
 I guess we don't really have like a structure to shift into, do we?

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.280
 I have things I want to talk to you about today, fired off.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.520
 So sleep.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.520
 Have we talked about sleep?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.240
 I'm in the middle of like a sleep rut where do you ever, you're in your 30s, right?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.720
 At least I know I'm older than 31.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.560
 OK, I'm not that much older.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.280
 I am that much older trash.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 So I have this.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280
 This has happened a couple of times before.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.000
 And I can't remember how long it lasted, but I'm in like a week.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.960
 It's been about a week of this where I get up in the middle of the night.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.440
 It's like the middle of my sleep, my total sleep window.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.320
 It's like two o'clock right now, two to three.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.840
 I basically cannot sleep from the hours of two to three every night.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.400
 I wake up and I'm just stuck awake for like an hour.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.600
 Sometimes I take some melatonin to fall back and sleep.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.920
 Sometimes I just wait long enough and I eventually fall back and sleep, but it's

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.880
 been a week now of this.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.480
 And I can remember in the past, this happening before.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.920
 And Casey saying it was like cortisol levels, like your stress during the day

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.480
 can lead to this where you can't sleep in the middle of the night.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.240
 It's like a thing.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.840
 I don't remember the name for it, but if you ever had this, OK, so this is really

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.880
 crazy because I was literally talking to Liz an hour ago.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.520
 And she's for the past week has had basically the same thing where she's

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.920
 random or you don't know where has been getting terrible sleep and like is she stressed?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.840
 I don't know.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.840
 I don't think so.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.640
 I think I can't think of anything specifically that changed.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.480
 And yeah, she said she keeps waking up for her.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.600
 It's not that time for her.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.960
 It's like around like four or five, but it's same time every night.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.880
 Yeah.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.360
 And then she'll start.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.160
 She'll feel terrible when she wakes up also, like she does not feel good.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.880
 Yeah.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.680
 OK, so what is going on?

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.000
 Is it?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.600
 I don't know.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.000
 It must be the aliens.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.640
 What's the alien thing in Miami?

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.880
 I did not get filled in.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.720
 Oh, they're really in 30 foot tall aliens.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.840
 And it's just as normal as like those recordings that came out and they're like,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.440
 there's aliens.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.280
 It's it's fine.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.120
 It's it's Miami.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.720
 Everyone knows they're aliens in Miami and it's just a thing now.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.720
 We just all accept that.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.600
 It's so funny.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.480
 I can't believe that blew up as big as it did because it's literally like three

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.160
 frames of a video where it kind of looks like it's from so far away.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.480
 It's like it's someone filming from the top, like in an apartment and like a high

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.040
 rise down to the ground and it's a night and it's like kind of like foggy.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.280
 And like with some light cutting through the fog.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.800
 Yeah.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.880
 And like for like three frames in the clip, it looks like there's like a kind

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.360
 of an alien that like walks like a giant one.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.280
 Yeah.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.520
 And that's what this all came.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.240
 And that was it.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.000
 And that everyone sort of messaging me being like, are there aliens?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.960
 They're like, what's going on?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.360
 Huh.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.440
 There was also like a thousand cop cars.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.960
 It was like an insane number of cop cars on the road.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.680
 But it was just a bunch of kids like fighting.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.400
 Oh, that's what it was.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.040
 The police.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.280
 That's the story is that they were just kids fighting.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.000
 That's the story.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.760
 That's the official story is they were just kids fighting them all.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.120
 And then people were like running away and the cops showed up.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.720
 And somebody got a short video clip that looked like an alien and here we are.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.360
 It's a long video clip and there's you watch the whole thing for the payoff

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.440
 of three frames or it kind of looks like an alien.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.440
 So okay, so it sounds less exciting than maybe I thought it would be.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.840
 Yeah, but anyway, going back to your sleep.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.640
 So I personally am the annoying person that has never had sleep issues.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.960
 Like I fall asleep within 10 minutes and I fall sleep fast.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.440
 I've always done that.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.920
 Doesn't matter what happened that day.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.480
 I didn't have to work out it and have doing it.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.120
 I can lay down and go to sleep when I went.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.640
 Nice.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.000
 Yeah.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.880
 And then I'm just like completely blacked out zero consciousness.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.960
 No dreams until I wait.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.720
 Well, so you wait, you go to sleep and the next thing, you know, you're waking up in

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.680
 the morning with no wakeups in between.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.520
 Yep.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.000
 I mean, I don't remember them.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.400
 I might wake up because because Liz sometimes says like we have interactions

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.080
 at night and I just don't remember them at all.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.280
 But yeah, I have like no recollection of waking up.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.200
 So I I was telling Casey yesterday.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.360
 I don't remember the last time that I went to sleep at night, even before this,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.360
 like this is an extreme issue where I'm literally at for like an hour in the middle of night.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.320
 But even before that, I get up every night.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.040
 It's some point, like I'm conscious, like I don't just kind of come to.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.960
 I like mostly because I have to pee, I'm being honest.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.200
 We really, I got to get my bladder checked out.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.560
 Yeah, there's something going on there.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.680
 You have the world's smallest bladder prostate issue, maybe.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.280
 I don't know.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.440
 I feel like there's something that I would explain it.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.120
 It's going to be really sad when I die of like prostate cancer.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.360
 And you guys all listen to these episodes fondly.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.040
 Oh, no, that one's like easy to manage.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.360
 Like just take your prostate out.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.760
 Oh, yeah, easy and then you get a little, a little penis.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.680
 Just take it, take it out yourself, like just go ahead and just make an incision there

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.760
 and just pop the prostate out real quick.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.160
 I'm just saying of the spectrum of cancers, I think that one is not bad.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.960
 In terms of cancer, it's the least horrible cancer.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.560
 Got it.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.000
 OK, just trying to say positive Adam.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.280
 Yeah, no, OK, so I always at least have to pee.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.560
 But even aside from peeing, I feel like I'm up a couple of times.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.720
 I don't remember literally in my adult life.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.720
 I don't remember the last time I went to bed at night and then woke up and it was morning.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.560
 And it was like, I just slept all night.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.360
 I know I did it as a kid.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.560
 Like I can remember growing up.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.920
 That was just a thing I took for granted.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.440
 And at some point in adulthood, it just went away, never to come back.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.160
 That's really weird.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.960
 I've been like this since I was a baby.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.680
 Like, you know, how everyone is like, they have a newborn and it's like a nightmare

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.800
 for several months, my parents like never had that with me.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.360
 I do would just go to sleep and then they were made down and I would just go to sleep

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.800
 and I wouldn't move your parents or the people that I hate, like the friends that are like,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.920
 "Our baby just sleeps.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.560
 We don't know.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.080
 Oh my God.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.960
 I love you, I hate you."

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.280
 They got, they got karma.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.320
 The, my brother was like a colic baby and that was like a disaster.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.040
 That's how it works.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.200
 If you have more than one, one will be way, way harder than the other.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.800
 That's what I've gathered from like anecdotal survey of like six families mining.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.880
 Well, so what about sleeping?

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.240
 So another place is like when you like travel on planes, like do you are able to sleep

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.160
 on planes or is that not something that you do?

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.480
 I don't sleep well in cars or planes.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.000
 No, I just can't get comfortable.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.880
 Maybe it's my height.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.400
 Like, I've never been able to get my neck to the position.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.720
 Even with like a pillow and a plane, I just can't do it.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.600
 I've tried because I've had some overnight flights and.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.240
 So I have no problem sleeping on a plane.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.520
 Like I've had situations where I've fallen asleep before the plane took off

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.440
 and I woke up because I felt the plane landing.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:08.840
 Are you kidding me?

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.440
 Yeah, and it feels like time traveling or it feels like teleportation, I guess.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.320
 But there was one weird thing with me where.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.960
 I don't know what it is, but you know how like when you fall asleep on a plane

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.520
 or whatever, like your head like like walls around sure it does.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.920
 Yeah, I'm not falling asleep.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.560
 Okay, but like everyone experiences this.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.960
 But for me, it is like 10 times crazy.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.280
 Like my head is like swinging around, like knocking into the people next to me.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.560
 Yeah, and it's people that have followed with me.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.560
 I've probably like smashed my head into them.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.400
 They're sitting next to me and it's like always a stranger, you know.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.360
 Yeah, I have to get one of those like neck pillow things just so it like.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.240
 Yeah, it's strange how much my neck moves because I am like totally not in control.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.440
 I think I've gotten those like I've got like three different ones

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.960
 because I never actually take it with me once I get one.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.960
 Yeah, it's home and then I'm like, yeah, yeah.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.000
 So I've bought like three of them at the airports in cases.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.880
 I was like, we have to let the why do you keep buying?

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.880
 And I don't even fall asleep.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.720
 So it's stupid.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.560
 So do you have an eight sleep?

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.600
 I don't have an eight sleep.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.400
 I have a a I'm going to mess this up a chili pad.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.200
 Yeah, I think the company is chili pad, but it's called an Euler.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.800
 Maybe the app is called Sleep Me.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.520
 Can I just go on a little tiny rant?

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.440
 It's very small about these smart product companies and their naming of things.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.160
 I have blinds.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.520
 They're called I thought they were called tilt blinds, but they're made from a company.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.360
 It used to be my smart roller blinds or something.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.840
 No, tilt shades.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.520
 They're roller shades and they were my smart roller shades and the app.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.200
 There's two apps.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.200
 They didn't get really old one.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.480
 There's still a my smart roller shade app and a tilt app.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.680
 And there's home bridge connectors for both of them.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.520
 But then the company is like a whole different.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520
 It's like smarter home.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.280
 It's like, why can't they just one name for the thing and all the products?

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.480
 It drives me crazy.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.440
 I think we have the same scale too, because I started talking about this

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.840
 and I have the same issue with a scale where it's like a we thing scale,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.640
 but it's like okay now.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.120
 Yes.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.880
 Yeah, and I never remember the name of the app.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.880
 And the app is all totally different.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.160
 I have to open my sleep.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.400
 Me app to change my Euler made by chili pad.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.640
 Just like I cannot remember those things.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.520
 And then the passwords, it's a whole thing.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.600
 Do you use a password manager?

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.560
 That's another conversation.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.840
 Yeah, I use Bitwarden Bitwarden.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.920
 OK, but you're in the app world.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.120
 So I'm assuming you just iCloud everything.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.040
 You would think that would be a good idea.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.120
 But I use the worst possible thing, which is last pass, which I get made

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.160
 in front of every time I would publicly have all your passwords.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.600
 Well, it's had like a big breach.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.280
 I think they did like one thing you can't do as a password manager is like,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.240
 well, you call the passwords.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.720
 But when you and your spouse both use it on all your devices,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.880
 you know how hard it is to change a password manager.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.080
 No, it is hard.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.240
 It is difficult.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.720
 So with your thing, have you tried like cranking down the temperature?

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.280
 So it just like freezes you at night.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.920
 So this is what Casey said to me yesterday.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.160
 She said, is your Euler low enough?

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.080
 I said, let me check the sleep me app.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.640
 No, I didn't really say that.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.240
 I get so cold.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.000
 I don't know.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.560
 Like, I feel like I've been so cold at night and I thought I ran hotter than.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.400
 I mean, I'm a big male and she's a small female.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.200
 I thought I ran hotter, but she I found it.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.040
 Hers is like 10 degrees colder than mine.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.520
 Liz runs hotter than I do.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.400
 Like usually wants everything colder than I do.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:26.680
 Yeah.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.200
 So I maybe I should turn mine down because I have it pretty high compared to hers.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.320
 But I feel like I'm already cold and the fans going.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.400
 And I'm like a little old lady.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.840
 I've got my two blankets.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.840
 Well, try going the other way.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.680
 Just like jacket up, make it hottest, make it really hot.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.480
 I don't know.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.680
 Try stuff at this point.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.920
 Just mix it up.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.800
 I might just need to sleep like on a couch and just see how I do.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.720
 I might do that.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.960
 I might just maybe it's too fancy.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.960
 Maybe.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.760
 Yeah, we've done all kinds of man or bed.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.120
 You're going to make fun of me so much for so many of these things.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.160
 So the layers that our bed is.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
 So we have like a latex mattress,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.520
 which is already like five layers because you buy the individual layers

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.120
 and you build up like a firmness profile for your side of the bed.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.760
 So there's like five layers that make up the mattress.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.560
 And then we have the Euler, I think directly on top of that.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.960
 And then we have a mattress pad and then we have sheets that are like

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.720
 conductive grounding sheets.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.800
 I don't know if they work, but I love the idea that my sheets are plugged into the

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.320
 wall.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.960
 Like it's just awesome.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.360
 Well, like not they're plugged into the wall.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.800
 Yeah, to the ground.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.320
 It's like ground.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.720
 I don't like it's like a socket.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.680
 You're not in. Yeah, not the whole socket, just the ground, little, a little, you know what I'm talking about.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.920
 And Casey and I don't sleep in the same sheets.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.480
 Is that weird or not the same like blanket?

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.680
 She uses different blankets than me.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.760
 Is that weird?

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.280
 Hang on.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.280
 So like we're on the same bed.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.000
 It's a king size bed, California King, actually, and you have separate blankets.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.280
 So you can't physically touch.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:01.000
 I mean, we could, but it's work, you know, like there's there's pillows in the way.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 There's blankets.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.880
 We have like our own little fort on each other bed.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.800
 Oh my God.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.040
 Yeah, we use different blankets.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.040
 I don't know at what point at what point we started, but it almost feels like we sleep

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.480
 in different rooms because like different bedding entirely.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.720
 It's hard to make the bed also.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.000
 Sorry.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.960
 This is getting really weird.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.840
 I should probably stop.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.320
 I'm just going to stop.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.720
 I don't want to comment on your marriage.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.320
 So like I don't know if I go there.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.080
 I don't know why.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.520
 I'm like asking for advice.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.240
 There's already been rumors that Casey hates you.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.800
 So that was a big rumor.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.160
 I think you started that rumor though.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.840
 No, I think you said it.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.400
 What are we talking about sleep?

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.080
 OK, so I'm going to try something different tonight.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.000
 I'm going to try something different.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.360
 Maybe go in the couch and like just go primitive.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.280
 Yeah, just see how I sleep outside.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.640
 Maybe I'll just stay up all night.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.200
 Maybe I'll just like see if I can get so tired that I sleep good the next night.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.040
 And then I'll start a trend of sleeping good or something.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.800
 My body will figure out how to do it.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800
 We'll see.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.840
 Am I going to get one of those videos from you again, where you like record yourself

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.120
 at 3 a.m.?

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.840
 He's lugging insane.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.120
 Isn't that video that you've only seen?

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.880
 No one will ever ever see.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.880
 Man, one day, unless I decide I'm leaving the internet and then everyone will see it.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:19.040
 Once you die from prostate cancer, I'll post that video as a final tribute.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.720
 It's funny.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.520
 OK, so your sleep is messed up.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.040
 It's messed up, yeah, which means nothing in your life can go well.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.040
 Yeah, and I'm trying to sleep more.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.080
 I'm like training with a personal trainer now.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.520
 I do two private lessons with jiu-jitsu every week.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.520
 Like I'm doing so much physical activity.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:41.880
 I'm doing the knees over toes guys workouts because my knees are both swollen.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.360
 I'm doing like cardio stuff.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.040
 Do you do four by fours for VO2 max training?

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.200
 Like I'm doing all this stuff and I'm 37.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.000
 I'm not young anymore, Dax.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.920
 I'm not 31.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.400
 So I need sleep.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.080
 I think like sleep is a big part of being active and recovering, right?

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.280
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.000
 I mean, do you have a whoop or did you have an or an ora?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.840
 Yeah, similar.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.680
 Yeah, similar.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.760
 You know, that recovery stuff is like extremely accurate.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.480
 Even if you're not a pro athlete, like when I was working out more, there were days

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.040
 where I would just have terrible performance in the gym.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.760
 And it always lined up with the recovery score thing.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.120
 Yeah.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.680
 So the whoop does that too.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.840
 I love that.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.240
 I like I wake up and it's like when I feel like garbage, it's like, Oh, 78 on the recovery.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.240
 That makes sense.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.320
 And when I feel really good, it's like I'm ready to do a workout today.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.120
 Something about that's motivating.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.880
 I've just been doing a sandbag workout that I mentioned.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.160
 I got a sandbag.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.200
 I actually got the idea from you because you mentioned that a while ago.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.920
 And then I started looking into it and I was like, all you need is a sandbag

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.440
 and you can do all this stuff in your front yard.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.680
 That's a totally different membership.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.160
 Yeah, it's a totally different kind of workout.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.480
 Like it's it's good.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 It's hard. It's hard to hold a sandbag.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 Yeah, I like that the lack of precision with it.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.200
 Because I feel like it's like the workouts are very good.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.360
 Yeah, exactly.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.080
 We're like lifting over your head in like one side ways, too much.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.200
 And the other side, wait, it's like not balanced perfectly.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:06.880
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.120
 And yeah, you can do so much with it.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.120
 So I just been doing these like daily workouts with them.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.600
 I got my sandbag.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:18.000
 I did some workouts and then I joined this gym where I'm like working with a personal trainer.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.200
 And this entire gym, they've got like everything you can imagine.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200
 No sandbags.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.320
 So I can do any sandbags with my personal trainer.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.600
 He looked at me funny when I asked him if they had sandbags.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.160
 Like, well, we have sandbags.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.440
 I get that because if you have all the like the specific equipment,

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.840
 that's the same.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.280
 A sandbag approximates all that.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.440
 It's like a versatile thing.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.880
 Oh, yeah, I guess so.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.800
 Yeah, it's been great because now I just walk out like guys wait till it's honey

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.360
 and I just walk out and I do my workout and I can go back in.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.000
 It's like super fishing and fit it in anywhere.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.360
 I was already only walking like three minutes to the gym anyway,

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.280
 but now it's now it's down to like 10 seconds.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.280
 I'm just so jealous that you can go outside right now.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.000
 It's been so gross here.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.640
 Like cold, sleet, snow.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.520
 It's going to be like minus 15.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.840
 A low line is 15 over the weekend.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.520
 Yeah, there's going to be a night that the low is minus 15.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.760
 That's not going to go outside.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.360
 I don't know.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.240
 I'm not going to.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.560
 Oh my God, it's too cold.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.880
 I'm going to Kansas City for a tournament and it's even colder up there.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.080
 Like it's three hours north.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.120
 It's going to be, it's going to be brutal.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.360
 It dropped to 60 degrees for a week and I got sick.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.560
 You suck.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.680
 I keep doing sandbag workouts in your front lawn.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.680
 We should talk about something and there's some stuff going on in tech.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.280
 Like I thought there's been so many layoffs.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.480
 These layoffs again, I can't believe they're still going around.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.160
 I thought the rates were going down and life was good again.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.320
 We're going to start seeing all the like TikToks from the project managers again.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.600
 Like I thought all that was coming back and then suddenly Google laid off

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.560
 like a ton of people.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.640
 Wait, so it was like 30,000 or so.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.840
 No, no, that was fake news.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.600
 It sounds like they are doing layoffs, but that 30,000 number was like was fake.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:08.080
 OK, just to recap though, which thing is crazy because I feel like they've had so

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.600
 many rounds of it and it's like every X number of months, you just have like a day

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.840
 where you're stressed out and then maybe you survive.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.280
 But then like a bunch of people, you know, it's just like it's so brutal to have to go

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.160
 with that over and over and over.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.560
 And could they not just tell their employees about the last before they read it on Twitter?

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.880
 Like why can't they get this right?

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.320
 I feel like it's just like, I don't really have big opinions about layoffs and about

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.200
 ethical whatever implications, but just like sending an email and saying, hey,

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.280
 we're going to do whatever the PR thing is going to say, whatever the thing that's

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.760
 going to leak and tell everybody there's layoffs, just say that in an email first

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.520
 so they don't learn about it on Twitter because they just learn about it on Twitter, right?

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.400
 Like, yeah, I mean, yeah, it's so crazy and everyone just stressed for a day.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:00.120
 And then, yeah, it's just like, man, that's like such a motivation killer.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.480
 And I feel like even if you survive all the rounds, you're like, probably want to quit anyway.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.440
 Yeah, I think one of our friends on Twitter, I think, well, I would have met her at Twitch

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.520
 Con. I don't know if you know her works at Twitch.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.840
 Her entire team got let go.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.320
 I saw.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.240
 I saw a tweet.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.440
 Yeah, it's just her, but her whole team is like, then what do you do?

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.960
 You don't know, like, like, where am I going?

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.840
 And the org?

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.040
 Yeah, that's a mess.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.640
 It's tough.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.200
 Yeah. And I did.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:29.240
 And I did see something about the other, like Google and a few other big companies today.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.680
 I saw people talking about people are getting notified.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.640
 They're laid off that 30,000 number was confusing because they're restructuring

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:43.040
 an org that has 30,000 people in it because the last 10 years of them automating stuff

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.680
 with machine learning and has just made that like, yeah, the headline made it like AI

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.680
 takes 30,000.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.440
 Yeah, it's not any of like the new AI stuff.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.280
 It's just stuff that they've been doing for forever.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.840
 I think it's like, they're like recommending tweaks to ads automatically or something.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.760
 So the whole service part of like servicing someone that's running ads on Google, which

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.760
 is less important.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.400
 So they're like restructuring it and I'm sure like they're going to let some people go as

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.640
 a result of that, but it's not like they're letting go 30,000 people.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.640
 Right.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.640
 Okay.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.640
 Yeah.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:20.520
 I think I saw today was there more Google Huts hundreds of jobs.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.520
 Yeah.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.520
 Today.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.520
 So.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:31.600
 So what is your take on like the current technology landscape, like economy, all of it, like, are

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.600
 we on the way down?

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.040
 Are we on the way up?

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.040
 Where are we headed?

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.040
 Yeah.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.160
 I think the thing is like with this type of thing, like there's so many specifics that

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.720
 matter, like one company doing layoffs versus another company doing layoffs.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.720
 The fact that they're doing at the same time is like a trend, but the reasons are like

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.360
 the background line is completely different.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360
 Yeah.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.840
 With Google, I feel like their cuts are like meaningful in that I think the CEO has been

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.680
 a bad CEO and I think they've like missed out on a ton of opportunities and like they're

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.120
 like kind of having to really like reckon with who they are and what their future is.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.120
 Yeah.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.880
 But their cuts, I'm like, I don't know if those jobs are coming back.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.960
 There's other companies like another Amazon that does cuts and I think that's just them

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.400
 like taking the opportunity to like reset and I'm sure they're going to grow back up

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.400
 to that size.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.400
 Yeah.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.920
 At some point, I can't imagine that there's still like a lot of layoffs that are incoming.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.120
 There's also not layoffs, but all the exodus from AWS.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.640
 Have you seen people leaving?

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.640
 Yeah, I did.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.640
 Yeah.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:37.120
 It's been framed that like really the back to office thing was to just is like a way of

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.280
 doing layoffs without the negative publicity.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.720
 Like they knew people would leave because nobody want to come back to the office and

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.720
 it worked.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.960
 And like very high profile people with large social media followings have been leaving and

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.640
 announcing that they left.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.640
 That's a whole nother thing.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.640
 Yeah.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:00.120
 There's some really great people at AWS like people I've loved interacting with that are

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.120
 seem like great people.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.640
 And then there's some weird stuff, there's some weird stuff I've heard stories I've heard

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.760
 about just like weird power dynamics within AWS.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.200
 And then this has kind of been more of those cracks showing publicly like it used to be

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.160
 that it felt like there's this impenetrable wall.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:23.480
 They were all on the same page and I don't know, morale was very high at AWS and that's

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.480
 changed a lot.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.120
 I feel like in the last year, yeah, I can see that like I even just in my time interacting

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:36.520
 using AWS, I feel like it's just gotten more and more as I just become a much more political

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.520
 organization.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.040
 It feels like there's like a lot of complexity behind the scenes that are like not related

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.120
 to the technology of the product, just like corporate complexity.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.120
 Yeah.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.800
 I can see that the return to office thing is interesting.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.800
 I don't know.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.560
 I don't fully understand the strategy there.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:58.240
 Like you want to do layoffs, then return to office is a good way, it's like a convenient

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.560
 way to like cut because people will self select out.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.560
 Yeah.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.680
 But you have no control over who self selects out, right?

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.760
 And they're not stupid enough to like not understand that.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.120
 I'm sure they understand that.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:17.840
 So to me, that means like it they don't care who leaves and maybe they really feel like

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.960
 they just need like a full reset and like, you know, new people will come in better grades

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.960
 probably.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.960
 Yeah.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.960
 I don't fully get it.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.840
 Like everyone tries to explain the return to office thing in such like simplistic ways

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.200
 like, oh, managers want to like feel powerful so they can like be people in the office or

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.200
 something.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.400
 I don't know if it's that simple like I just don't get it.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.960
 I haven't seen an adequate explanation.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.960
 Yeah.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.640
 The article I saw because I just I read something yesterday after I saw a couple of people that

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:48.000
 left that I'm surprised left that like they were trying to specifically cut a lot of the

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.160
 like high earners and that they thought those high earners would be the most put off by like

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.800
 coming into the office, which is interesting, like we're trying to make sense though because

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.840
 the salaries you pay like having been at a company that did a lot of hiring the salaries

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:11.440
 you end up paying people are like so random, like it's completely based off of like they

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.360
 got into the right time and people at the company were stressed in a certain way at the right

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.360
 time.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.360
 Yeah.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.360
 The market looked a certain way.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.760
 And then like you like play if you like do hiring for two years and look back like the

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.240
 pay scales are so random like you have people that suck that are making a lot of people that

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.240
 are good that aren't making as much.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.840
 And I can see how like at a company it's been around for that long that you know pays high

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.840
 salaries.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:38.360
 It probably was like a complete mess in terms of and yeah in terms of that so that Amazon

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.560
 specifically for a long time was kind of like a low salary.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.560
 Yeah.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.080
 It was like high stock compensation.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.080
 Yeah.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.080
 Yeah.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.080
 Yeah.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.080
 But they did.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.560
 I mean even them they up their salary floor during like the crazy COVID times.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.760
 I'm sure a lot of people got in during then that they're like and this isn't really worth

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.080
 paying them that much so.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:03.080
 I saw you you tweeted something the other day about about salaries it was on the other

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:08.320
 side of it like from an individual perspective like there's such a ceiling on what you can

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:13.000
 make from a company on a salary versus like consulting or whatever.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 Yeah.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.760
 It's just like it's just so inappropriate for a company to have two people on the same team

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.080
 and like pay one person like double yeah it's like so like outside the realm of anything

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:28.640
 that anyone would ever consider but it's not a reasonable to say the person is like twice

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:33.120
 is like if you actually analyze it other twice more than even more like sometimes they're

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.640
 like doing 90% of the work.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.640
 Yeah.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.760
 So the asymmetry is always there and if you're capable of being independent you can just capture

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.760
 them.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.480
 I mean you know there's like you did that as well.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:47.440
 So it's just like yeah it's just like the salary thing is it's all against a random like

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.640
 it's it's timing it's all these weird things that are just lucky in a lot of ways.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.640
 Yeah.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.840
 I have a totally unrelated question but just bringing up your Twitter when are you going

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.600
 to run out of things to say when are you going to like not have this like just steady stream

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:07.480
 of you have like four three I don't know four or five tweets a day that are like where

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.360
 does this come from in your brain like how do you have this much in your brain you know

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:17.400
 it's funny it's funny you bring that up because almost every day I'm like oh that's it.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:23.480
 I'm running I'm out of stuff like every day I'm just like I don't like I think I this is

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.860
 all the stuff that I know about these are like all the good stuff and I really can't

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.960
 see myself coming up with like anything else and sometimes it lasts like a couple days

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:35.520
 where I'm just like yeah no good thoughts about anything but eventually like there's

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:40.760
 just more stimulus that like triggers something but yeah I feel the same way too like I'm

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.520
 just like I'm out I'm done I don't think smart to say anymore.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:49.720
 I think I actually did run out like two years ago and that's why I just don't tweet anymore.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:54.780
 I just had a lot less to work with yeah I think I just have a lot of stimulus like I

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:59.040
 just have like a crazy amount of stimulus like yeah what is your stimulus you got on hacker

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.820
 news and stuff don't you well no talking with Jay and Frank all the time and they're both

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:07.320
 like really smart and they have like a lot of thoughts a lot of times like the stuff that

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.960
 I'm posting about is really just stuff that they've said and we like discussed together

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:19.000
 yeah you talk with me a lot I'm really smart yeah I talk with you yeah and that does something

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.960
 for sure but it does something there's that then I get like all of the inbound from like

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.800
 a community saying stuff talking about stuff we talked with other founders a kind of meeting

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.520
 with another founder yesterday we had coffee ton of it's like a YC thing you just like

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:40.960
 get together with YC people no no okay just got it just yeah I don't know just like yeah

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.840
 so I feel like I just come across a lot of people talking about different things like

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:50.440
 the guy I talked to yesterday was really smart guy like you know several exits already starting

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:55.640
 a new company in AI but like not like a stupid AI company like he's really like putting a

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.200
 lot of work to think about what he wants to do so I talked to him for like two like almost

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:05.000
 two hours about I asked like every possible question that I had about the space yeah and

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.520
 he's he's he's spent like so much time just thinking about it oh you know what it is it's

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:18.160
 actually a refall refalls boss he's left his job and he lives in Miami and yeah so like

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:23.240
 that was like two hours it looks interesting somewhere why did I think he was independent

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.760
 or something he was for a while he was that steady for a while then he then he left and

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.880
 was kind of independent and he joined this company called vendor that's an interesting

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:39.040
 name this guy Aaron the CTO of and yeah so you know there's like it just comes on a stimulus

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.960
 like if you're yeah getting that stuff eventually you'll have something interesting to say I

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:49.440
 do have more interesting thoughts when I'm like listening to a good book or something yeah

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.080
 I mean I guess I don't have thoughts I just I'm regurgitating things I read in the book

00:27:53.080 --> 00:28:00.720
 but my brain is like that's stimulus that's stimulus don't tell us oh wow I do I go I can

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.760
 go weeks at a time without any stimulus can't I I mean I have stimulus from like the team

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.720
 I work with like the people you do have a lot of stimulus any more stimulus I think I have

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.560
 above average stimulus you might have like an average amount like people from like work

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:22.720
 and stuff below average stimulus I think I have above average CO2 in my office like flashing

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:28.360
 at me I'm getting into the red it's all this because you're talking I guess that's funny

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.600
 yeah Liz made a joke today because she was talking about how she couldn't sleep well

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.840
 and she was like should we open the windows at the CO2 but I was like didn't CO2 make

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:45.520
 you sleepy I don't it should help minute it does though the window helps like okay my

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:53.160
 question is I'm I am like in the worst room possible for this yeah and I I refuse to get

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:58.320
 that one I refuse to get a CO2 monitor yeah I just refuse to get one just I just think

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:04.320
 it's dumb I think it's dumb I mean to be fair like whatever the number I've never felt

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.800
 effects where I'm like oh my brain is foggy it must be yeah to the other thing is I have

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:15.080
 air conditioning running all year round does that make a difference maybe good my air circulating

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:21.760
 technically so I'm wondering if it's like a non AC in a room situation I'll tell you

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:28.080
 one thing I did learn yesterday that is very helpful to know because we have one of these

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:33.520
 monitors if you put dry ice in the bathtub for your kids to just poke at and see the fog

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:40.480
 and stuff critical levels of see if it's funny like it hit numbers it was like 2500 or something

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:45.000
 we carry around like you know we set it in the bathroom walk because they just whenever

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.560
 we get like we get like food delivery and it'll be like dry ice packed yeah no it's so fun

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.360
 to play with yeah they love it it's like steaming over the bathtub walls you know so we did

00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.520
 that but we put the thing in there just to see because it's like basically co2 right like

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:06.640
 it's what dry ice is I guess yeah I don't know yeah it's like hardened I don't know there's

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.760
 a place by me that we get ice cream from sometimes it's like a liquid nitrogen ice cream place

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.600
 I don't know if you have this it's ice cream that's made with liquid nitrogen it's made

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:23.520
 with it or like made cold the process involves liquid nitrogen okay so like I don't know exactly

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.800
 it works I've done this as like when I was a kid I was like a science experiment before

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:33.600
 but I remember how it works but the result is like the smoothest creamiest ice cream

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:40.120
 it's like it's so good and we get this like like Nutella mixed in there too yeah it is

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:46.000
 uh it is insane I haven't had it in a while because I'm on keto but it's very good so one

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.600
 of our dreams Casey and I is to like retire and to have a little food truck and sell banana

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.600
 ice cream we make banana ice cream you ever have banana ice cream now you told me about

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.840
 and it's how simple it is and how good it is I haven't tried it we make it almost like

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:05.120
 every day uh we just have a constant supply of bananas ripening and going into the freezer

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.480
 and we've gotten it down and it's delicious I mean it really like I don't know if it tastes

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:14.060
 just like ice cream I haven't had dairy ice cream in a long time but it's just like this

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.480
 smooth it's like vanilla ice cream I mean it really you take frozen bananas you blend

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.840
 them up it's amazing how the texture and everything else it's like soft serve ice cream it's

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.760
 really good I have to try it sounds like sell it out of a stand or something and like expose

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:32.240
 people because there's so many people that can't do dairy now or ever yeah and that's

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:37.280
 a lot more common like people are realizing they shouldn't consume dairy they don't do

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.600
 well with it or whatever you have all these alt notes what about all the people that can't

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:47.080
 eat bananas what about them are there people that can't eat bananas yeah it drives them

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:54.860
 bananas oh wow I didn't see that one coming it just doesn't seem wrong brand for that

00:31:54.860 --> 00:32:00.400
 no it's not but I saw the opportunity you know what I want you know I actually really

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:06.160
 want to get banana trees because you know those like smaller bananas that are like freaking

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:11.600
 delicious but like you never get bananas yeah yeah my sort of yeah we order them from

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.280
 your part right exactly but we want to I want to get those those are so there's so much

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.560
 better than normal bananas do you make ice cream out of those or do you use a normal

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.720
 no we just use Cavendish just the normal because we can get them at the store we used

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:29.280
 to buy literal boxes of bananas even before we had kids we ate so many bananas and now

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.000
 I guess we we eat less which is weird but we would buy like we'd go to the grocery store

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.960
 and walk out with an entire box which is like I don't know twenty bunches of bananas it's

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.560
 a lot and people would always be like what are you doing with those bananas we're freezing

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:52.840
 on making ice cream but yeah the small ones we just get those to eat like the mysore and

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.920
 there's like the praying hands bananas there's a lot of good banana varieties wow this episode

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.040
 I mean we never really have a train of thought but this is we're all over the place well

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:08.760
 I'm about to pivot hard oh good let's pivot yeah don't just pivot next pivot hard it's

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:15.040
 only only kind of pivot that's worth it plant that foot yeah let's really pivot rotate 90

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:19.040
 maybe a hundred eighty degrees so I've been doing a bunch of Cloudflare work the past

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:25.800
 well this is good yes and I've been having a really good time with it it is a fun platform

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:31.760
 SST ion right you like it's gonna be deployed from SST so now we can have like the mix of

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:37.880
 Cloud providers yeah so one of the reasons we started doing it is because we're like doing

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.680
 all the binding stuff and we want to make sure like this version of we're actually renaming

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:47.080
 to linking so you can link when you link resources together if we want to we want to make sure

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:51.680
 that our implementation is into a couple of AWS so having Cloudflare worker support means

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:56.520
 like we're kind of forced to support it in a better way but we're gonna have we're gonna

00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:01.160
 be able to do like like our demo we'll be able to do something like create an S3 bucket

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:05.240
 and then link it to a Cloudflare worker and upload a file like you can go across stuff

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:10.080
 easily that way and because I really want to get to a place where people can incrementally

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:16.160
 try workers for stuff okay if you look at like our bills Lambda is the highest part of

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:22.560
 our bill and there's one function that is probably like 80% of that bill and it's just

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:28.000
 something that's like reacting to an event bridge event so we want to have a way to just

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.840
 swap that out with the Cloudflare worker because it's way cheaper and just experiment with

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.480
 that I'm gonna like move everything over it's got that different building model right

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:41.360
 like you only are billed for active compute not like idle yeah yeah it's cheaper to begin

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:47.200
 with and then you're not billed for IO waiting and this functions a lot of IO waiting so

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.120
 that was one of my questions like for a traditional web app like let's say you're building a

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:58.080
 next s app and you're using open next an SSD to deploy it with a future ideal infrastructure

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:03.480
 look like you're using Cloudflare to replace Cloudfront I assume you're not also sitting

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:09.320
 up a Cloudfront distribution right just Cloudflare is your CDN yeah so there's like the reality

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.640
 is when you start to say okay I'm going to use two different Cloud providers even within

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.440
 AWS there's kind of an infinite number of ways you can configure actually a site or

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.720
 an Azure site you add in another cloud provider now there's like you know it's an at times

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:26.680
 infinite number of ways you can configure the combination so that's why I'm asking sort

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:32.960
 of from like the perspective of next year specifically like is there an ideal infrastructure

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.760
 when you blend these different if you have all the providers at your disposal what does

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.360
 it look like I assume it's something similar to whatever cell does it's actually not weirdly

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:47.520
 enough because they're slow compared yeah because they have the extra hop in between and that

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.840
 is my next question to follow up if you want to just go and get into this is like when

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.760
 you start blending different providers what kind of latency issues do you have to think

00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.640
 about like when it's database connections go ahead so we're based I think I think our

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:05.640
 approach is we're going to do two extremes so so today we have the extreme of next year

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:12.160
 on AWS using all AWS stuff we're going to do a version of next year as that is like very

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.640
 very cloud flare oriented okay which is like the kind of pretty much entirely running on

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:22.640
 on cloud flare so the question is like what about the in-between step where you mix to

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:27.520
 we're not 100% sure if people actually want this but it could actually be pretty simple

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.840
 it could just be dropping cloud front and then putting cloud flare as a CDN in front

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:38.200
 now you're using workers or Lambda functions at that point you're still using Lambda functions

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:44.600
 maybe you can do that like you can flag certain routes as as work or whatever and then those

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:50.920
 can get deployed but the class their workers I've never worked with them they're not node

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.880
 right they're no they're not node yeah a lot of dependencies do not work with them you

00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:02.000
 pretty much architect for them yeah yeah yeah like cloud front functions or whatever yeah

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.760
 it's better than I mean it's not as crazy yeah let's limit it than that yeah and it's

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.240
 expanding it's a constantly expanding like they're adding more and more node APIs kind

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.240
 of like a bun is doing the same thing yeah so who's doing that work that's just a cloud

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:19.720
 flare team that's kind of doing what the bun team is doing sort of yep exactly like building

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:25.320
 this other JavaScript runtime that also supports node APIs yeah but it's it's like a narrower

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.800
 focus like they're not trying to be like a hundred percent drop in compatibility with

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:34.080
 node yeah there's more constraints because their goal is just to host it really efficiently

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.920
 on their infrastructure I mean they're working on that and I think at this point it's it

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:44.000
 to be honest it's a lot like moving from not serverless to serverless like you can try

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.360
 and just drop in your old applications until Lambda function but it's gonna be like either

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.040
 not work or it's gonna be inefficient yeah so people got to a place where they were like

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:57.440
 architecting specifically for a Lambda architecture it's kind of like that like you would architect

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:02.300
 specifically for a cloud flare and all the primitives are there and it's kind of interesting

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:08.680
 because I've discovered that there are people building full applications on cloud flare it's

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.680
 happening like people already doing this or proving you can do it they're all extremely

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:17.440
 pro like they're all like they all like really know this stuff because you have to right now

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:22.040
 to like use this stuff well that's what's exciting to me because I feel like they've

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:26.800
 proven it's possible I can see how it's possible and it's really just missing something that

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:32.160
 like brings it into the hands of like the average person yeah that's that's what I wondered

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:36.600
 like what are the existing infrastructure is code options is it just terraform right now

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:41.920
 it's just terraform and they have their own Wrangler thing which is which is their like

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:47.560
 take on helping you build stuff in cloud flare it's not infrastructure as code approach and

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:51.680
 it's kind of like really focused on building like a single worker as opposed to a whole

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:56.720
 application yeah not to say you can't do that everyone doing cloud flare stuff today is using

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:03.520
 Wrangler but I think our approach what we did for AWS and Lambda and like the live debug

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.080
 and having your whole application to find there and things connecting together I think

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:15.120
 if we bring that over it'll be really compelling yeah best experience on cloud flare probably

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.920
 yeah exactly and the team has been super super helpful like they set up a slack channel with

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:24.320
 us and really proactive and like trying to like help us take over yeah more stuff that

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:28.040
 you kind of have similar preliminary experience too right yeah it's so weird when people actually

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:33.000
 want to be helpful what is this like you started with just AWS and it's like man working with

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.040
 companies it's hard yeah I know AWS literally instead of just working with us they like

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:43.600
 spun up a team to copy SST like it just like why it just doesn't make any sense like no

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.400
 one on the team is motivated I mean that's kind of how they operate when you think about

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:52.200
 the open source ecosystem yeah like serverless framework and Sam is kind of the same story

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:58.240
 yeah and then even outside of tooling like you look at runtime stuff at elastic and there's

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.480
 been other stuff right where they just kind of like we'll just build a team that builds

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:07.040
 this stuff too yeah it's and it's fine for stuff like that but it just doesn't work for

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:13.160
 like last mile tools I'd say why would it is not that it's not a good fit so yeah but

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:18.320
 yeah it's nice to have companies at one naturally do that stuff better like Cloudflare's stuff

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:24.440
 is just so simple and nice and on top of that they're like really excited about us building

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:29.120
 stuff for there because so with as one as you would expect one would be when you're like

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.320
 you know oh yeah put something out there and other people but on top that should excite

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:38.920
 you right yep but it uh yeah surprising we not with AWS we need to get like the live

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.200
 debug so like live well we always call it live lambda but I guess this doesn't make

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:49.520
 sense here we need a new name for it yeah live functions or live yeah I don't think once

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.320
 we get that working then yeah people will be able to use workers and I want I need to find

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:58.560
 a way to like subscribe a worker to an SQS queue we're like an event bridge oh wow yeah

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.320
 you're bringing it to people like me who would have probably it would have been a long time

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.480
 before I really broke into Cloudflare yeah because right now it's all or nothing but

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:13.320
 we think we can make it incremental yeah pathway to using Cloudflare stuff hmm all very fascinating

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.520
 stuff I'm trying to I'm teaching this I'm trying to like teach this stuff and it's a

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:24.080
 very moving target like I want to teach the SSC is a big part of I think bridging the gap

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:32.040
 between modern web devs and things that you have to think about for ten seconds like they've

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:37.120
 just never had to think about it and they're like kind of coddled with some of the other

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:42.480
 companies and tools that are out there yeah yeah so I feel like SSTs this linchpin and

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:47.520
 you guys just move so fast it's very hard to make I know I don't need materials but it's

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:52.360
 like yeah I want to teach the old thing do I even consider stacks like those are gonna

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:58.680
 go away now I'm just I'm thinking out loud but yeah no I know it's it's like a weird time

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:03.560
 but I mean AWS is still like our big focus the Cloudflare stuff is more to just make the

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:12.560
 carton or design so we're not like so coupled to one thing yeah yeah but the AWS stuff on

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.760
 ion is also great like we've been deploying stuff through that and yeah if you move past

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.040
 that I know you're working on the open next the next day as construct have you gone into

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.240
 any other constructs yet or yeah so we've got we got our function contract we've got the

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:33.000
 new Aurora v2 stuff we've got the new Aurora v2 stuff with the date API yeah that's all

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 on I on now yeah I mean we haven't we haven't like released or documented this stuff but

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.040
 the thing that I just the thing that yeah I'm like that's getting a new build today I don't

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.920
 care just give it to me and then I eat so the thing that I worked on the last couple

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.960
 days was we have a good new secret system and it's like so much better the all the stuff

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.720
 that you've been waiting for like that prefecture for ashtray like it's just how that works by

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:02.920
 default now in the in in ion and a lot of stuff is like really clean when can I start

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.520
 using on just for playing around yeah so we actually talked about this we're actually

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:12.560
 going to use your project as like let's like help Adam successfully move over and that'll

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.640
 be like a good oh nice what the migration looks like let's let's do that let's help

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:24.560
 Adam move over I like it yeah cuz here's like between between your thing and our console

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.920
 which also some of ever that's like yeah I mean that covers a lot of stuff pretty good

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.640
 amount of things yeah soon I think we're I think by energy anywhere it will have like

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:37.160
 a stable release where I'm not thinking so full of time that's insane to me I remember

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:41.680
 thinking this is going to be like summer when you first talked about ion like like a whole

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:47.840
 new rewrite six months something but it feels like it's moving really fast yeah yeah it's

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.600
 this funny thing where Jay talks about it all the time I actually don't I don't have examples

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:57.360
 that comes in mind right away but this is like a common thing where you'll have a team

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:03.000
 that has built a product and gain expertise in something and they'll like launch a new

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 more focused thing using their expertise and usually comes out really nice cuz like the

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.400
 first x years were basically research to build expertise and they use nail it on that on that

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:21.680
 second try yeah we're hoping that's how it pans out yeah what what is that adage that

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:30.960
 the takes three implementations to get anything right yeah exactly yeah yeah one two and three

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:38.200
 yeah it's exciting never been a better time to be a web developer we really do we really

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:45.200
 do have it made like as much as twitter can get really annoying and sometimes it just feels

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:50.800
 like we spend a lot of time talking about the stupidest stuff it really is there's just

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:55.640
 so many ways to do things today and it's it's exciting I have a it just brings up something

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.440
 for me and if you saw I posted the other day where I'm like everything people talk about

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:04.440
 I'm just so boring like it's just the most boring irrelevant stuff ever yeah yeah talking

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:10.120
 to this guy yesterday that so his he's starting this company and he's not like trying to do

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:16.560
 like oh like just the next iterative AI thing that like generates a lot of buzz he's imagining

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:22.920
 like what could the world look like in five years and yeah given like x things exist in

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:27.360
 five years like what company would need to exist then he's trying to build he's like trying

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:33.320
 to end run it and build that now and was talking about what he's working on and it's like obviously

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:39.800
 it's a massive bet like he's predicting like a lot of really optimistic advancements in

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.560
 the next five years like the most optimistic case he's building for that yeah it's obviously

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:48.760
 seems really crazy and then I go on twitter and people are like arguing about turnaries

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:53.400
 and I'm just like that is a thing in the last couple days what where'd that come from yeah

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:59.640
 yeah I'm just like like this guy is imagining a world where you literally like on board

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:04.200
 an AI agent the same way you on board an employee and give them access to like their octa account

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.640
 their Google drive account you like train them and then you like work with them as like a real

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:12.520
 employee and then people are like debating like turnaries and it's like you guys there's

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:17.400
 like a bulldozer coming like you have no idea what's yeah what's on the way and this is like

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.400
 you know if this is what we're gonna talk about yeah I think we deserve to get squished we need

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:27.960
 to be replaced squished by that yeah obviously he's like extremely he represents like the

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:33.400
 maximal AI maximal scenario and even for that like there's so so much work to be done in the

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:38.680
 world he's envisioning but not by the people arguing about turnaries I guarantee that

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:48.520
 yeah I just feel like stuff just feels like boring like kind of out of touch yeah I just feel a little

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:54.360
 like detached yeah yeah it does feel like there's just a lot of manufacturing stuff to talk about

00:46:54.360 --> 00:47:01.160
 because we're all just kind of in this collective space of Twitter and I don't know you can only

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:08.280
 like I just don't really talk about tech anymore maybe because of these things uh I feel like

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:14.920
 you can only talk about what you ate and how you worked out today so many times and then it's

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:20.760
 just kind of like I'm bored I don't have a reason to be here so that turnaries turnaries yeah well

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.760
 I was even reading my it was like going through like some of my tweets for the past week and I'm like

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:30.520
 yeah I don't really talk about programming that much anymore is it more like I'm trying to think

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:36.920
 what you tweet is it more like uh higher level like thought processes and organizational philosophies

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.240
 and that kind of stuff I don't even know like I don't know if this stuff I talked about has a

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:48.760
 category but I just know I'm not talking about like programming really yeah no yeah it's still

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:54.760
 tech related it's it's like yeah there's daxisms it's just every tweet is like a it's like a dax

00:47:54.760 --> 00:48:02.120
 view of the world it's either that or it's a troll or it's an insult those are my three insulting

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:07.000
 people there's a lot of that too yeah you know people love being insulted they really do I think

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.200
 people like you you come off a certain way at first and then they're like I kind of like being

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:19.320
 talked to like that yeah we just want someone to be a little mean to them that's how I'm convinced

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:23.480
 that people love it every time I'm like aggressively mean those tweets are the ones that go like

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:29.400
 at the most likes I'm like you all know this I know it that's so funny yeah I wonder if it's

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.880
 because everyone reads it and they're like he's not talking about me he's talking about everybody

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:41.400
 else you're doing something yesterday I had the opposite but when I was like he's talking about

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:48.520
 me it was something you said uh oh what was it it was something about like up front pain like

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.360
 work you only want to work with people anytime you say you only want to work with people that do

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:58.120
 x I think oh man I did something that's the opposite of that it's hard working with Adam

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:02.840
 it's what I asked you if I was annoying you because I really thought that tweet was about

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:09.800
 oh no no it's funny because I think you're a good example of that tweet like you take a lot

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:14.440
 of up front pain oh I do do that because I don't know if I do or not I mean I do cold

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:19.240
 plunges that's up front pain I'm definitely not I'm definitely not encouraging your cold

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.080
 plunges don't okay don't mix that's why I was late today by the way I was in the cold

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:28.680
 plunge and you like almost died you like you like yeah it's like 20 degrees outside it really

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:33.320
 sucks when there's no okay you know here's my suggestion for your sleep maybe just like

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:39.560
 reset everything and be like go back to not doing anything just like stop listening to

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:44.600
 Huberman and like you just have like so you have so many variables going on here I do there's a lot

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:50.920
 of extremes a lot yeah so I feel you seem to cut and yeah I have introduced like a ton of new

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:56.360
 supplements a ton of new workout routines it's just a lot of different things in the last few weeks

00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:01.800
 maybe maybe it is it's one of those things and I need to just chill out maybe I just need a little

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:07.000
 like reset just yeah I mean you bring these things back in but maybe they'll give you some clarity on

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:14.200
 what yeah what it is maybe Casey's convinced it's just stress I don't feel extra stressed I feel

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:20.440
 normal stress which is like I always feel stressed I always just don't like we're never gonna make

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:25.560
 another dollar and I have to do you do you have that feeling like oh yeah I feel like it's all

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:30.200
 gonna go away I'm never gonna be able to make money again and it's like every month like a new

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:36.120
 yeah I feel exactly it's funny like the further I get my career like you like of course your fall

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:40.360
 backs and your floor increases but like never actually feels that way it never yeah you never

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:46.520
 feel safe you never feel like things are just set it's always this feeling of like the world

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:53.400
 just keeps changing yeah yeah stuff just keeps changing like if the world froze where it was like

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:59.240
 three or four years ago I probably feel like yeah something but yeah but now I can't help but

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:03.800
 think about the AI agents that somebody's gonna unleash and like knowledge workers are just all

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:12.680
 gonna lose their jobs and mass okay I'm breathing good I'm gonna lower that cortisol maybe you can't

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:21.800
 sleep because of fear of AI maybe AI has scared me sleepless huh well I don't know what to do about

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:28.040
 that the cold plunge isn't I can't cut that out and see any improvement all right this just got

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:33.400
 really dark I feel like we need to end that can we end on some kind of a high note here we're now

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:41.560
 hung out with Ken Wheeler oh yeah Tuesday yeah yeah I was good what was what was the drink what was

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:48.440
 the I saw the tweet with the like okay he shows up tub and he's like he messaged me being like oh I

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:56.920
 have to get drinks with he's got a skip level meeting or whatever yeah and he shows up and he's had

00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:03.240
 six old fashions already and he showed me texts from the guy he met with and the guy just like

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:11.080
 done he's like back at a hotel room like just completely just done and Ken is like like you

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:15.480
 wouldn't ever even think he's drunk he seems like jolly like he doesn't really seem like anything

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:22.520
 and then we sit down and then he gets he talks like we're talking to waiter and then he's like

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:26.600
 oh do you like all fashions again goes I just had six of them and then okay well you want more

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:32.520
 and it's like some fancy old-fashioned they brought it out in a box full of maybe it was dry ice because

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:39.320
 it was a it was that a theme thing the fog thing so yeah he ordered two of those so he had eight total

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:48.120
 and again did you drink did you drink anything I had one drink I had one drink and I was driving

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:54.840
 so I can I don't want to do too much but yeah I was like if I think if I had like two I would

00:52:54.840 --> 00:53:01.240
 definitely be like obviously drunk and three I would be like very drunk gone and he stayed in

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:09.720
 and yeah he's just like he's just a very functioning alcoholic it just it is impressive it's funny

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:16.760
 yeah he made fun of you I brought you up he made fun of you make sure as you would expect I would

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:22.840
 expect yeah I've only had the one can experience in Atlanta but I'm sure he had plenty of material

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:28.520
 to work with a very intense place to meet him yeah right he's got a lot going on in Atlanta

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:35.800
 yeah it was fun he just told me like a million stories he has just like the craziest craziest

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:43.000
 stories oh yeah he does and I was just laughing the whole time yeah that's how my skin is gone

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.560
 and then dropped him off his hotel he actually might move here like seriously not even not even

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:54.040
 as a joke yeah like he belongs in Miami you really yeah he fits in perfectly uh his company's HQ is

00:53:54.040 --> 00:54:00.680
 here yeah they probably want him to be around here to begin with yeah keep tabs yeah and if he

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:04.600
 moves here he's actually going to move I think he would move to a neighborhood like five minutes

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:11.800
 away from me oh for real how weird would it be if the two people that were the two engineers from

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:18.520
 Tech Twitter that from Miami it's just like I ever bought two dudes so there's like there's

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:22.360
 like there's there's some like there's some like history yeah there's something going on here

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:28.280
 he's giving a talk at Rick Miami I was gonna say I'm excited about Rick Miami I guess all the

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.680
 speaker that I've been seeing the people post like I'm speaking or I'm not speaking so I guess that's

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:38.600
 all happened now yeah the official post with the speakers are gonna be in five days or something

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:43.720
 in the next week I've been disappointed in some of the people that won't be speaking and I guess

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:50.600
 like those people just don't come when they're not speaking which is bigger yeah yeah it's like

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:54.040
 someone who's not trying to speak I'm just planning on going to Rick Miami and then I learned like

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.600
 oh these people won't be there because they're talking and get accepted that sucks yeah so I saw

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:06.520
 the full speaker list and I think it was a conservative pick I think it wasn't like there wasn't many

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:13.240
 like weirder choices yeah for talk I think it was like kind of conservative which I get like you know

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:19.480
 it's like yeah so many spots and there's like a lot of eyeballs on it this year so it definitely

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:28.120
 probably feels difficult to make like bets on weird things so it's like very much like anything

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:33.640
 tech related is like pretty much react related yeah there's like not too much like outside the

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:40.120
 bounds of that yeah but it'll still be a good time I hope oh pretty such a good time there's a good

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:46.280
 amount of people that are going regardless of their talking accepted or not my party's gonna be fun

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:51.720
 I'm excited about that oh I'm so excited about your party if I'm invited I'm excited I can come

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:58.840
 right did I tell you about the funny detail about that situation no you know this is so high school

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:04.920
 it was the most high school thing ever but uh if they ever do a documentary party going on yes

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:12.120
 not really not really a rebel party but it's during your most keynote company what your wait

00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:18.280
 your party's gonna be during his keynote yeah cuz like react react Miami's like inside a bigger

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:22.840
 conference oh yeah the yeah they wanted to do like something with three act Miami's arriving

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:29.000
 game I'll give a talk at the main conference yeah I'm pretty sure my thing is during it and I'm like

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.360
 that's awesome this is perfect I thought you were saying there was another party going on I mean

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:39.960
 sort yeah it's like there's a conflict at the same time a conflict yeah yeah some people are

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:45.640
 gonna have to choose pick size between yeah I love the tension between you and the triangle

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:51.240
 company it's one of my favorite things on the internet yeah it is funny I just love a symmetry

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:56.920
 it's great because like you're a person and they're like a venture backed entity so like they could

00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:01.960
 have an ending I guess you could have an ending too but like you eat pretty good you seem like

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:07.480
 you take it so I will outlast them yes yeah I would think so right it's a good bet most companies

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:12.200
 don't make it very long that's not I'm gonna have to put like shame on them that they're just yeah

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:18.440
 generally but those companies don't last that long yeah so yeah it's an interesting yeah so yeah

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:24.120
 Stefan was saying the other day like are you like worried because there's like you know people

00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.320
 invested like hundreds of millions of dollars into this thing oh there's a lot of money involved

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:35.080
 yeah like the antagonist if I yeah like there are like movies with less crazy plots where like

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:40.520
 your character gets killed yeah I know it's the things you've said wow it's pretty fun you're really

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:45.640
 brave thanks you're so brave people bring that one up but nobody everyone forgets Prisma Prisma

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:51.880
 is really the one oh man I'm the most proud of like who's proud of your stance on Prisma and well

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:55.160
 because they were just such an annoyance for me personally every single day of my life because

00:57:55.160 --> 00:58:00.280
 of all the support we had to do trying to get Prisma working inside yeah lambda and just everything

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:10.520
 around that uh and then Germo built his new demo with Drizzle oh so even Vercelle has moved away

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:15.560
 sorry even the triangle company has moved away from Prisma yeah does it I feel like everyone just

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:20.120
 kind of collectively and you were a big part of the the wave here like everyone just sort of collectively

00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:26.520
 did away with Prisma like obviously Drizzle's done really well a lot of people just moved to

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:32.440
 Drizzle but even aside from that just like people stopped using Prisma it became known like Prisma

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:39.320
 bad mostly because like it was so tight people everyone that uses Vercel takes up the majority of

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:46.040
 the the discourse on Twitter already so they're the most vocal and they were all like using Prisma

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:51.400
 which was just a terrible combination and yeah it's interesting yeah and that that's like that

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:54.840
 you know that company raised like hundred something million dollars like they're big right they have

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:59.000
 like a lot of people a lot of these two at least I don't know what's going on with them lately

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.480
 but yeah I never see anyone talking about like rarely see people talking about Prisma anymore

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:09.240
 that's interesting yeah there's a lot of venture dollars at stake here Dax you kind of been like

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:14.760
 on a heater should probably look over your shoulder a little bit okay but here's the thing

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:20.840
 I just love money if you want me to stop just pay me just pay just pay you don't have to kill me

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.520
 you don't have to do anything that's you know risking you're going to jail just pay you and

00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:28.440
 you'll be nice you'll start paying positive things about Prisma I won't say positive things but I'll

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:33.560
 shut up you just won't say bad things oh right you don't know you haven't say anything about Prisma

00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:38.840
 in a while if I'm thinking about it because everyone stopped using it you don't feel like you need

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:44.200
 to or because a little I wish they were paying me I wish they were paying me honestly it just takes

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:51.080
 I think it's worth like a hundred K a year to have me shut up and never talk about your company

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:55.960
 I mean just a couple of those companies like for Prisma it really is the economics actually

00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:03.000
 makes sense it really does make sense I'm sure you've caused that much in damages not to just keep

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.800
 beating this drum and don't need to really get somebody after you but yeah so that's I mean

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:16.200
 that's like a reverse dev rel reverse sponsorship or something yeah I say well so I started doing

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:20.360
 the math and then I realized wait just do people pay for Prisma who pays for Prisma how did they

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:25.320
 raise so much money they have a bunch of work that was like my first tweet ever about them I was

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:33.720
 like the year is 2022 and your ORM has just been $75 million yeah do you know anybody that's paying

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:39.080
 like their credit card is entered into the Prisma website well yeah because people that are that

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:45.960
 are using it and had all the like the performance issues and I'm kind of stuck paying for it issues

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:50.600
 they caused yeah there's a solution yeah it's like a it's like a until they figure out how to move

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:57.080
 off of it like it's a easy solution yeah interesting yeah then they have this like new real-time thing

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:04.040
 that like sends you real-time updates from changes in your database and there's a there's a space

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:09.640
 the real-time space is heating up a lot players in the space is that a space that can support

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:14.200
 multiple startups I feel like people have been entering that space for like my entire

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:23.320
 like career I've just been seeing like real-time made easy for like ever yeah um and yeah no one's

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:29.000
 really won it so I guess there's still an opportunity is it is it because like is part of the problem

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.120
 the inherent issue that like not everything needs real-time or there's very is it just very few

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:39.560
 use cases very few apps that really need real-time I was talking to Sunil about this because he's

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:46.920
 working on PartyKit right which is in the space and my point to him was I think the problem with

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:55.080
 the marketing of all these solutions is they focus on the most real-time cool demos which are like

01:01:55.080 --> 01:02:01.160
 whiteboarding or like some like crazy cloud situation yeah which all like looks cool and like shows

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:05.960
 their product is powerful but that just makes people think like oh it's for wanting to build

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.440
 one of like those apps those like yeah I suppose the links thinking in terms of the thing they're

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:16.200
 already working on yeah which every app should sync it could benefit yeah if you have two tabs

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:20.120
 open you guys stuff in one tab the other tab should be updated if someone else edit something it's

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.360
 not like real-time collaborative stuff but like things should get pushed to you like the internet

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:29.960
 should be pushed based yeah you shouldn't have to refresh the page to get the latest yeah exactly so

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:35.800
 I think every app fundamentally needs should have this as a component but yeah it doesn't feel

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.200
 that way with these solutions with your local first stuff with like replica and that architecture

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.840
 are you doing is there's like a push component to that where you're pushing changes if it's funny

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:51.960
 because uh it's it's it's it's this exact thing nothing I build this collaborative so my real-time

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:58.200
 architecture is just a poke that comes over web socket that tells the front end to refetch to

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:03.000
 rethink oh I see yeah like no data comes in over the web socket there's no diffs there's no patches

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.280
 it's just hey you're stale yeah like do a do yeah and it's like you know it's not the most real-time

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:13.800
 thing it's gonna be maybe like a second or two delayed but sure it's perfect for what I build yeah

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:20.840
 most apps don't need like seeing the mouse cursor update in real time of something else yeah exactly

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.720
 and that's usually what the demos are focused around yeah that's yeah that's why I think the

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:33.800
 replica company like picked a very good set of constraints um like even them they're like demo

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:39.240
 is this like if you go to reflect.com.net which is like their hosted solution it is that it is

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:46.840
 like this crazy 60 frames per second real-time thing yeah yeah but replica itself it's like not

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:52.600
 it's like the demo there's a boring demo it's of like like a like a ticket tracker like a linear

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:57.720
 type thing where yeah yeah like you know stuff updates so much changes the status you see this

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:02.440
 out of change you're not seeing their cursor or any of that and there's so many solutions in that

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.000
 space like live blocks with such like when they were like going through what I see in first launching

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.640
 like they were everywhere for a while I don't know what yeah I don't know what they're up to I'm

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:16.280
 sure they're doing fine but all those companies have the coolest landing pages because they're like

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:20.600
 do something that you're not seeing in a landing page yeah it's like interactive in some way yeah

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:25.400
 like reflects is like a like a puzzle there's like a puzzle that spells out the future is real

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:31.640
 time or something and you do the puzzle with everyone there um yeah it's interesting it's like that

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:38.440
 reddit there is some like itch that that or yeah itch that that scratches like the reddit uh what

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:46.440
 was that thing the where everybody's painting the picture together oh yeah yeah uh after auto is

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:54.280
 called yeah is oh uh pixels is that right i don't remember it was like the one big canvas and like

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:59.800
 everyone was that was amazing actually yeah that kind of stuff that really makes me like

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:07.640
 like proud of humanity like what we can do like to see people paint like corners of that thing

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:13.240
 in a certain way yeah sounds so hard to me yeah people do it going back to his real-time thing the

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:19.480
 other thing that i've like been acutely understanding is i think everyone in a depth tool space is

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:26.040
 vastly underestimated how big you need to be to survive like these days when i write a depth tool

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:32.280
 i'm just like too small too small too small too small it's just like you need to be so big before

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:39.560
 you can make enough money to like sustain yourself yeah um and a lot of these tools are like they're

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:44.920
 useful and they're good but is every company in the world gonna drop that into their sec no right

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:49.640
 and i literally think the only things that can survive are things that like theoretically every

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:55.800
 company could drop into there yes somebody brought this up maybe you brought it up i remember seeing

01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:00.200
 people on twitter like call out examples of dev tool companies that have made it it was definitely

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:04.600
 in response to a tweet of yours uh and it was like people brought up the mega companies like

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:10.200
 microsoft is a great example of like yeah basically just a giant dev tools company now right i don't

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.720
 know actually i don't know anything about the revenue they probably saw it i mean dev dev is

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.320
 a huge part of it yeah it's a huge part of it right because like they do these huge acquisitions

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:24.200
 github yeah so they've got this like vs code type script all these things that are so prevalent in

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:29.080
 the dev community but they're like this giant mega corp with a ton of history what are some like

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:33.880
 startups that have made it in the dev space so the question i asked was like what dev tool companies

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.320
 are doing well i should have been more clear i meant like startups it like founded in the last

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:41.320
 couple years yeah so some people said stuff like microsoft but that's not exactly what i was looking

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:47.960
 for most answers were just companies that people liked and i was like they're not doing well like

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:55.480
 they haven't made it yet yeah like i don't i there's very few responses i think uh i feel like super

01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:00.600
 base might be doing decently well the only reason i say that is because they're in such an interesting

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:08.520
 situation so they built a product that is theoretically niche it's like people that want to use that

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:13.160
 want like a full back end as a service built on top of postgres kind of like flesh out that

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:18.200
 architecture as much as you can and make the best possible experience of that which is like a narrow

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:25.640
 space but they accidentally also built the best postgres hosting service yeah so a lot of people

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:30.280
 just use them as like a generic postgres host yeah and those other tools are like nice for like

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:35.160
 debugging and things yeah and especially and there's been like new entrance into the space like neon

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:40.520
 and like nyle and there's been like a bunch of them and super base is still like a good like

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:46.520
 the best default postgres host so you like never you i like never see a company where they like

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:51.400
 focus narrow and accidentally get a bigger market and they kind of did yeah i don't know if it's

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.720
 i don't know if they're doing well enough to say that they're okay they're gonna be around for a

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:59.640
 long time but literally outside of that on the path what about like cashy corp what about what

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:04.440
 is that fit your country so cashy corp was is i would say like they are a little bit like the

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:09.320
 previous generation like okay so not least in enough start yeah but even them like they're not

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:14.280
 doing super well oh really i mean they're probably coming in their past yeah the past the point of

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:19.400
 like making it for the founder yeah yeah yeah so definitely yeah David the century

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:25.640
 seo actually quantified it in a good way they were like he was like you should have said who can

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:31.720
 forecast a hundred million dollars in revenue in the next five years okay and i'm like yeah that's

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:36.360
 exactly exactly what i was looking for and i don't i don't know if anything anything that i use

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:42.920
 anything that i yeah i don't know it's like patchy corp did well because some of their tools were

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:48.440
 literally like anyone in the world any code base in the world could use it whether they did that

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:55.000
 terraform i need to drop into anywhere and on all the other products as well like who's building at

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:02.840
 that level yeah it was such a peak at the peak interest rate phenomenon period here where the

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:07.880
 most money was sloshing around where there's just so much of the space like so much of the

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:14.520
 venture dollars flowing into dev tools and it is interesting how few of those dollars will probably

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:22.200
 pan out yeah you really have to be like huge but i think most companies ambition was wasn't high

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:30.520
 enough yeah yeah it's weird the stars yeah exactly exactly i mean but actually that's yeah you really

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:35.720
 have to overshoot that actually made sense i'm gonna tweet it if it did that what i just said

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:42.840
 actually applied to a situation hang on what was what did i say shoot for the stars you just you just

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:48.360
 you just said a quote oh okay i can't tweet that then it's it's not you think you didn't invent that

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:52.840
 did you i mean you can tweet it yeah i guess but i'm like i feel like your excitement level isn't

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:59.240
 matching i'm not honest i just don't have a lot of thoughts dax okay when i have a thought i gotta

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:07.560
 start putting them down maybe you should just start complaining a lot on twitter i do i did that

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.920
 a lot i probably still do that a lot that's kind of the only thing i've ever done on twitter

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:20.760
 uh i can't sleep no yeah yeah exactly i know i'm gonna switch into teaching that's gonna be my new

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:26.200
 oh yeah i'm excited for that i'm excited do you have to be on the internet start to get that going

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:33.960
 like i mean i'm going i am going uh there will be a free free thing first coming it's basically

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.600
 just like all the stuffs people need to know before i can really get into the meat of what i'm

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.520
 trying to teach and it's stuff that people who are just getting started shouldn't have to pay for

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:48.120
 it's just like fundamental getting started on aws a lay of the land sort of a lot of theory around

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:51.800
 the different services that you may not even really have to dive that deep in when you start

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:56.680
 dealing with sst like it's a lot of it's abstracted but having that foundational understanding

01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:01.720
 can be really helpful it's like going to college and learning about like i know stuff about assembly

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:08.040
 i don't write assembly but like i know stuff yeah that's basically like a free kind of half

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:15.240
 practical half very theoretical grounding in aws for web developers uh i'd say in the next couple

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:20.920
 months that's probably on track and then i think the better part of this year it's going to be

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:28.680
 working on the broader effort of teaching this view of the world that i see nice yeah it's uh it's

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:35.080
 funny because uh trash yesterday was in hell trying to sign up for aws because trying to set up uh

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:42.280
 the organizations and the i am identity center and all that uh he didn't do that bad he like

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:47.720
 almost got it right but did he reach out to you on discord or something or was this you saw it on

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:52.360
 twitter or well he he was like yeah he did post on discord like i am as confusing and i was like

01:11:52.360 --> 01:12:02.280
 oh talk to me baby uh yeah and like he got close but not enough so that he didn't have to start over

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:07.800
 then i sent him my that the document i wrote about setting up for organizations and all that and

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:13.480
 it's just like like what it like actually bummed me out because i'm like here's someone that like

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:19.240
 wants to use AWS yeah and we rely on people that are trying to use AWS yeah and this was his first

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:23.160
 experience and he like almost he didn't have the option of actually turning but like he could have

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:29.560
 just like given up at some point right yeah uh yeah it's like damn like this is what we're like

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:36.680
 the only people we ever see are people that make it past that funnel that hurdle yeah yeah i hope

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:42.920
 i hope what i'm doing will help with yeah exactly uh efforts yeah just not even afraid of us

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:49.640
 super hard that's all right it's a hard first step yeah all right this podcast has been like an

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:55.640
 hour and a half long this is new we've gone well the first 20 minutes we're just debugging but yeah
