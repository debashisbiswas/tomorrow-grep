WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 I got off Twitter. I'm not on Twitter as much, and I feel better for it.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.480
 Coward.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.600
 Wait, so you put your stream deck away. Why?

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.680
 I'm sorry. Did you just change the subject? I was in the middle of pondering lots of things.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.520
 I moved my stream. Yeah, I got rid of my stream.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.760
 Yeah, I changed the subject from what I was in your head.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.480
 I was really stuck on like, what has happened the last week?

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.880
 Okay, so I put away my stream deck. Yeah, it was just, it was kind of ugly.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.480
 I was taking some pictures in my office. Like, I'm in this newsletter,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.600
 workspaces. It's like your desk and your office and just like, what does your stuff look like?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.120
 So I had to put it away for that. I didn't want it on that. It just, they look awful.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.840
 They're really, really helpful. They're very practical, but they look like a gamer thing or

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.600
 something. Yeah, I was going to ask, is there an alternative to, because I haven't bought one yet

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.800
 for that reason. I'm like, this is like too much. So I think they may have come out with one Elgato,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.120
 make some, I think they may have come out with one that's white that looks a little better. There's

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.960
 also a thing called a, I have one, loop deck. And it looks really cool. It's got dials on it and

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.480
 stuff. It looks more like it's made more for like video editing and like creative professionals,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.400
 but it's just super buggy. Like software sucks. And it doesn't have as many buttons.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.040
 And so I stopped using it. You think it would be less buggy on Linux?

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.480
 That's a joke. Maybe. Probably more buggy.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.600
 There's a chance. It probably just wouldn't work though. So I still can't believe you use Linux

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.160
 like every day, just like you choose to do that. And I enjoy it and I love it and I have a good

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:03.120
 time and I'm happy. Is it the same as like, I do, I love Neo them. Like I've, I've fully redpilled,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.000
 I'm very into like the tinkering and the playing with it. And I don't know, it's just fun.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.760
 Is Linux the same or is it more annoying? I haven't tinkered with my Linux setup in a very long time,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.680
 probably similar to how you haven't really tinkered with your Neo them in a very long time. Yeah,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.000
 once it's kind of settled. Yeah, it's just one of those things where I'm like, it's hard for me

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.160
 to give perspective on it because I have just been using it for so long and I just know how.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.400
 Right. Right. Right. Ten years. We know. We know. Well, it's 10 years. It's been 10 years.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.800
 Our Linux 10 years, Neo them 10 years. CrossFit 10 years.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.080
 I've been plant-based for 10 years. So I hate that too. Like, I just hate being like,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.480
 no, I've done it for 10 years. Like, I'm not just, I didn't like change my entire lifestyle

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.680
 for a decade just to tell you I'm a vegan. I'm a vegan, by the way.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.120
 Okay. That's the most annoying right thing we listed, the vegan thing.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.280
 I know it is. You see a picture of my, my stakes and my brisket.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.320
 What? No, when you did it when you knew I was offline, didn't you?

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.000
 He felt me tag you in it. And I was like, Oh, really? No, I didn't. Maybe, maybe they didn't.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.600
 But no, this, uh, this Sunday, I'd, he made our first brisket ever. Didn't see it. It was very good.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.240
 And it was not vegan, by the way. I would guess not. Yeah. Vegan brisket sounds like

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.440
 a science experiment. Nobody needs to do that. Just sounds like a bad idea.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.480
 Go Matt's a Linux thing. Yeah. I, uh, I don't know. It definitely is like that. I don't,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.680
 like I'm trying to imagine at this point. So I say, I'm imagining at this point where I'm like,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.760
 really comfortable with my OS, switching to something completely different, like learning

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.600
 everything from ground up. Like I would never do that at this point. It's like, yeah,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.880
 would absolutely not do that. Uh, unless the upside was so high, so maybe you could see it that

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.920
 way. But yeah, like I wouldn't, I can't switch to Mac OS now. Like it would just break so much

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.600
 of my workflows. Be so frustrating. Yeah. I think like I believe you, but it's also very hard for me

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:01.760
 to imagine like at this point, diving into Linux, when I'm just, I'm so used to using my Mac.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.480
 Yeah. Is it just like the older you get, the more you stuck in your ways? Is that same dynamic here?

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.760
 Yeah, I think so, which is the thing I think we should all try to fight against, but it's just hard

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.160
 to like stay productive. The more responsibilities you have, the less you can like experiment, which

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.760
 is kind of what traps people in a lot of ways. Like knowing you, it's just like you do so much

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.640
 with, uh, maybe you don't, or maybe I said about this point, I've made some of yours. I think you

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.520
 just have some equipment that just won't work. Oh, right. Specifically your, your audio interface.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.440
 Like I just spent a lot of time like really like researching and figuring out the right

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.280
 hardware to buy. Yeah. So everything's just like a little bit more work. Everything's like 10,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.160
 like 20% more work for everything you're trying to do. That's like not just using the OS, like

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.640
 doing media stuff. But at this point, everything works. So yeah, I get the, the appeal, like,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.320
 the of them is more work, but it's just fun. It's a nice hobby. I'm enjoying it. Yeah. There's a lot

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.600
 of stuff that actually does just work on Linux that people don't realize like, and I don't know

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.200
 if this happens often, but like, if you need to run a Docker container, it's not this like whole

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.080
 weird VM situation that you need to set up because everything is just native. So anytime you're doing

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:20.000
 work on stuff that typically runs in a server, it just going to like work easier. Yeah, that makes

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.320
 sense. People always run to run everything on Linux. Yeah, exactly. In the cloud. Yeah.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.000
 People always run to this thing where they like try to deploy something from their machine. It has

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.640
 like a binary dependency, but NPM pulled in the Mac OS version, you need the Linux version. But

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.600
 there's like a lot of like little things like that. And that's actually the initial reason why I

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.800
 switched. I was just doing so much work in Linux on the server back when I had to think about servers.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.960
 And I was like, there's just a lack of synergy here where I'm just using a completely different

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.360
 OS from a day to day. And if I just do one thing, I'm just going to be getting better all the time,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.360
 kind of the same mindset behind using TypeScript on the back end and the front end.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.360
 You just kind of start to get better. Yeah, okay, I'm glad you said that. I saw some tweets. Maybe

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.040
 I saw your tweets. Do we really gain a lot from the same language on the back end and the front end?

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.360
 Is it just that we gain knowledge or is there actual like sharing of stuff types, I guess? That's

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.920
 what you just said. Yeah, well, there's, I think there's two layers to it. So for a long time,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.320
 I was skeptical because I didn't get into Node.js for a very long time. Like I used,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.280
 I went through like two whole lifetimes of using, since Node.js came out, I like did two

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.960
 entirely different back end languages like for years before I finally came around the node.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.320
 And people would always argue like same language back in front of it. And I was like,

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.040
 I don't really care about that. Like how hard is it to do to? And it's true. It's not that hard.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.040
 Like everyone, like tons of people do it. So many people do it and there's no problem.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.520
 But now that I switch, I have like something to compare to. And I do, I have gotten so good at

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.120
 TypeScript. Like way better than I was at other languages, because I'm like basically doing it

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.640
 twice as much as any other language I'm doing on both. That makes sense. That's one side,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.600
 like you do genuinely get better in the now and infrastructure as well. And the type sharing is

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.160
 a big thing. Like I use it everywhere. So I did this massive, massive refactor yesterday,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.680
 ripping out Kaisley and swapping it with Drizzle. Like one of the last projects that I had that

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:22.400
 was still that wasn't using Drizzle yet. And it took, there was like a hundred something errors

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.800
 when I deleted Kaisley to see like where I need to update stuff. Yeah, expanding across back

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.800
 end and front end, because the types were shared and things like that. And once I got through all

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.080
 100 errors, I think it took me another 10 minutes of, okay, now let me actually try to run it to

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.240
 get it all working. And that's because like stuff would just share it entirely end to end and any

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.360
 breaking changes I made on the back end was immediately obvious on the front end. I typically

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.360
 don't do breaking changes like that. But for some of this, I was fine with it. But yeah,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.640
 there's situations that I think about what it would have looked like in my previous setup.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:04.640
 And yeah, it would have been a lot more difficult. So yeah, there is a lot of benefit. And I do think

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:12.720
 that it's, it's impossible for another language to like catch up to this part of it. But it is

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.840
 possible for TypeScript to become better and know just to become better. So I'm more betting on,

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:23.760
 yeah, like JavaScript ecosystem sucks. But I think it's easier to make that better than to like

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.040
 catch up how these little languages catch up with these features.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.280
 Yeah, because the browser is always going to run JavaScript. So I guess there's that unless

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.520
 everyone has to learn it. Yeah, like the WASM stuff. That's not JavaScript, right? You can just

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:42.240
 write like, I don't know, C++ or something dumb. What do you do with WASM? Yeah, it's funny. Like,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:49.680
 I use a, I use WASM as like a weird test, what's it called? Not like a red flag because it's,

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.440
 that's a little bit extreme. A Rorschach test? Is that what you're going for?

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.680
 That's a good signal. Because I always hear people say very confidently,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.080
 oh, like the future is looking more and more like it's going to be WASM or like something like that.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.440
 Whenever I hear someone say that, I know that they've never, they don't know what the hell they're

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.920
 talking about. Because this has been, this has been a thing that people have been saying

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.280
 forever. And it just feels like a thing that's going to happen. But it's been years and years

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.040
 and years and years and years. And like, WASM has like great use cases. But like,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.240
 to say that, oh yeah, like all sort of this stuff is going to run in WASM on the back end and

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:30.480
 WASM on my front end. It's like, it's just something that people say. I don't, I think very,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.160
 yeah, yeah. Figma though, is a great example of what WASM enables, like delivering a desktop quality

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.440
 app through the web. Like it would not have been possible without it. But yeah, yeah, I don't think

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:47.040
 people are going to like not write JavaScript and just accept like the complexity of WASM.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.680
 Like there is that like Rust Leptos, which is like slaw.js, but for Rust and then.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.400
 Oh right. Yeah, it was very cool. And I'm sure there's some companies and people that'll build

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.320
 stuff with it. But it's just like a, I don't know, I don't think it's made to like remove

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.760
 JavaScript is I think it's made so they can chip high performance stuff when you need to.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.960
 Yeah, for special use cases. I guess the TypeScript thing, I just whenever everybody is so like,

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:20.240
 like in unison, praising a thing, it's like TypeScript, Type Safety, everything's TypeScript.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.480
 I just, I don't know, I just want to like be like, no, I don't want to use TypeScript.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.920
 Is that your perception of everyone in unison? It's like a month.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.240
 Yeah, I feel it. I mean, I feel like the Twitter, at least on Twitter, I mean, the circles we're in.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.960
 I do not feel that way at all, even in our circle. Oh, really?

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.640
 No, I was thinking about this the other day. I was like, I'm just going to have like a much

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.280
 spicier take on this. Because I was thinking the other day, because I don't feel that way. I feel

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:50.000
 like, I feel this accepted status quo is everyone agrees JavaScript sucks. Everyone's

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.520
 like, TypeScript is a horrible language, or like, it's all a complicated, or like, it sucks.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.720
 I was really thinking about it. I'm like, no, you guys suck, honestly. Like,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:05.760
 if I look at my TypeScript code, like less on like the SST side and more on the actual application

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.680
 I built, it is very good. It is like very good code where, like I said, that this big refactor

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.480
 I did stuff, you know, I've been able to pull off stuff I've never been able to pull off in other

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.440
 languages. Like, if honestly, at this point, you're saying that TypeScript is a shitty language,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.920
 or whatever, like, I just think you maybe suck because I don't feel that way about any of the

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.320
 language. Wait, wait, wait. Didn't you say JavaScript? I thought you were talking about JavaScript sucks.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.120
 But you're saying people also say, Oh, the type system sucks. That's crazy.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.680
 Where have I been on the internet that you are not?

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.400
 There's if you see, look, you can see in the chat TypeScript type system being

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.200
 turned complete is horrible. So there's like this mindset around. Oh, the type stuff. Yeah.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.760
 Okay. I said stuff about how well, they're just like, you can't read it. Like,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.960
 is it readable for you? Have you done enough TypeScript that you can look at these crazy generics

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.960
 and be like, Oh, of course, this one does this. I mean, I'm very comfortable with it. Now it did

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:07.840
 take a lot of writing that stuff to do it. It definitely is. Okay, I someone put it

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:13.600
 well the other day. You can't say it sucks because it is extremely powerful. It is a very

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.760
 extremely powerful type system and maybe too powerful for where people's expectations are.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.920
 You can't really say it sucks because I don't know anyone that can write that stuff that also

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.440
 says it sucks. Right. So for me, yeah, I am down to say that something sucks if I'm talking to someone

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.720
 that has become an expert in it and like and hates it. So for me, like when I complain about go,

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.880
 I wrote I wrote go for five or four or five years. Like, I appreciate a lot of it. I don't like a

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.040
 lot of it. Even same with types of those parts that I don't like. But I think there is this like

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:52.320
 underlying thing because people reflexively say like, types types of some is a mess or like,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.080
 it's great, whatever. And it comes from two sides. One side, it comes from what you're talking

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.320
 about where people with a crazy generics know, like, what the hell is this is alien code, which,

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.720
 you know, I get why people feel that way. The other side are like the functional programming

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:10.640
 people that are like, oh, you know, it's something like, like, oh, camel has a much better type of

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:15.840
 system, which it does. That's true. It does have a much better type system. But TypeScript is just

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.240
 his own thing in terms of his type system. And you can just do so many powerful things with it.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.080
 And it's either that you know how to take advantage of it, or you don't. People just want to like,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.760
 put caveats to it that I think are just, I thought people reflect reflexively add caveats to it without

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.160
 everything about it. And again, I think I was saying all the same stuff. And I was just thinking

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.880
 last week, like, you know what, no, it doesn't actually like suck as bad as we all reflexively say.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:45.280
 Yeah, I guess like, I don't think it sucks. I think it's weird to me how many people are learning

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.240
 these advanced generic, I don't know, maybe it's the bubble we're in. If there's 100 people

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:55.360
 that write TypeScript, how many do you think should know how to write these crazy generics and read

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.920
 them? In my opinion, all of them.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.480
 Really?

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.800
 Because so here's the thing. There's like, the traditional thinking is, it's for library authors.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.880
 And which that's why I really learned how to write this stuff well, because I'm a library author.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:14.960
 And that gives, that lets you deliver these really great libraries with the end users that

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.520
 does not think about typing. But within your own application, you also have layers like that,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:25.760
 right? You have lower level APIs that are low, lower code, and you want to expose higher level

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:33.840
 APIs for your domain, whatever it is. And I do take advantage of a lot of that for modeling

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:39.440
 some more complex things in some of my code bases. If you look at the new SST console,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:46.240
 I do some very interesting things with, we're going to show different types of resources and

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.080
 each resource of different types of properties. And I do like really complex generics to make sure

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.040
 that it's inferred all the way from, not just the back end, it's inferred all the way from the SST

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.880
 contracts code base, through to our back end, through to the front end.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:05.200
 So it does come in handy. And it does allow these like crazy refactors to happen without

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:12.080
 any breakage at all. So I'm not saying you have to learn it, but I also don't feel like-

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.080
 So it's useful for you, but it is useful. I didn't learn it for that purpose,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.240
 but now that I have this skill, I'm just going to use it everywhere.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.600
 Okay. Type challenges it is. I'm going to do them, I guess.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:28.400
 You talk me. So here's the other thing. I know people have taken Matt Pocow's course,

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.040
 and I say it's very good at teaching this stuff. I'm really impressed by that review,

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.400
 because once I got comfortable with this stuff, I was like, I have no idea to teach this.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.480
 I don't even know how I learned it in the first place. I can't really explain what I'm doing,

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:48.160
 really, like, because I might just not know it well enough to like extract patterns and articulate

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.520
 them. But yeah, for me, it's such like a feel thing that I'm like, how do you ever teach this

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.880
 to anyone? It's like you have to try to do so many practical things where you like understand

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:04.240
 what's possible. Ooh, I'll take his course. I don't need type challenges. That's what I'll do.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.480
 I'm so curious. I've heard such good things, like the format, the way it's presented.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.000
 And okay, so I want to talk about this. I want to talk about like developer education

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:21.840
 and courses. And so there's sort of like, I wouldn't call it a debate, but there are like

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:28.800
 vocal parties on both sides of this. Like one group says like, any developers teaching other

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:34.800
 developers, it's just a cash grab and it's a grifters and it's a scam. Or like, that's just a shady

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:40.000
 practice. You shouldn't be teaching or selling teaching materials to other developers. But like,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.400
 that's just a signal that that person's in it for the money or whatever. And then other people that

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.640
 know that's the best way to teach other developers is to learn from a developer.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:55.040
 And I think of like Joel Hooks, who's he's like sort of shepherded the Matt POCOT course. Like he's

00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.320
 part of that production, right? And they do a really good job of marketing the thing. I haven't

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:06.400
 taken the course yet. But I guess it seems to me like some of the best educational resources out

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.200
 there are made by other developers. Do you agree with that? Do you think it's is there like a

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:17.440
 heuristic, a way to know this is a good resource and this is not? I've never taken a course.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:25.440
 And I guess I haven't either. Yeah. So I believe, I mean, I think it's the same as everything else.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.880
 I think in every field in a matter of small, the number of people making these courses is

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.840
 probably small. But even despite that, I imagine 90% of them suck and 10% of them are good.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:39.440
 So that would be my guess. That's a very boring answer, Dax. If I'm being honest,

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.160
 I don't know if you could be a little more spicy. Say something more fun.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.440
 Well, do people, I don't. Okay, I'll attack the other side of it. Why are people complaining

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.760
 about everything? Why is everyone so focused on it? Why are they? I don't know.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.440
 I got off Twitter. I'm not on Twitter as much. And I feel better for it.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:03.840
 Coward. You just complained about it. I'm a coward. No, I'm just protecting my mental health.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.080
 That's what that's what I get to say. But if you leave, then that's just one less person.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:15.280
 What? One less person, what? Then there's just one less person that's not negative on Twitter.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.240
 I am negative on Twitter. What are you talking about? I'm one of the most negative.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.600
 That's true. I mean, yeah. They eat good that you eat.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.320
 Again, my mental health. I didn't know. It's best for everybody that I just stay off of Twitter.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.520
 Yeah. I'm still on there. I just don't read it as much.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.520
 Okay. Well, okay. I was going to say, like, yeah, I know what people are talking about.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.480
 There's like these bullshit courses that just seem like, I don't know, just garbage.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.280
 But one, I can't believe. It's just thing.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:47.600
 No matter how stupid something is, it's just going to always be someone that pays for it.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.440
 Like we all still get junk mail to our mailbox.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.000
 What is the deal with that? How do they get our addresses?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.040
 Is that not like a legal or something?

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.520
 Here's a really stupid circular thing, right?

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:06.720
 The post office is a entity that doesn't make money because it's like a public service, right?

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:14.400
 So it's always losing money. So they're like, okay, to lose less money,

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.760
 let's charge people to send junk mail. It's a good source of their revenue.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:25.040
 But they're providing a subsidized service. So even when they're charging the junk mail

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.760
 sender for the mail, it's at a price that's already subsidized.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.720
 And if it wasn't subsidized, it would just not be profitable for the junk mail senders

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:40.080
 to be sending it. So it's like this weird circular thing where the only reason it's all profitable

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.520
 is because the post office doesn't have to make a profit, but they kind of try to make a profit

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:51.520
 halfway with the whole world. But the only reason this all works is because some amount of people,

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.320
 there's some ROI on that, I imagine, to some junk mail.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.480
 Yeah, it's like I always see some of this stuff. There's always going to be some percentage of

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.360
 people. And it sucks. And I guess people are kind of like getting scammed in a way. But

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.520
 yeah, I don't really know. I don't know that it's weird to me that people let that

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.480
 taint the whole concept, even though I'm not someone that's ever taken a course, I'm like,

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.120
 yeah, I like look at some of the stuff like Matt POCOC looks like really well done. And like

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:23.040
 people seem to have a really great experience with it. And who's that other guy, the CSS guy?

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:29.520
 Josh Komo, Josh. Yeah, yeah, exactly him. I never pronounced the last time out loud and I realized,

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.480
 well, I've always said, like, Komiye or something.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:41.520
 I heard somebody at Rinder saying Komi, he was at Rinder. So was Joel. Yeah, I feel like,

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:48.640
 I don't know, I've definitely danced around the idea of creating educational stuff with this idea

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.520
 that like, maybe I would just really enjoy teaching. I know I enjoy teaching like my boys,

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.320
 young children. I love like explaining difficult things to them. And then like,

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.240
 they don't care and they walk away. But I'm like, oh, I need more of that. I need to do that more.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:09.040
 So I think about that. I think about like, what I just really love making educational stuff. But

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:14.720
 I've never, I've always like avoided doing that first like tutorial or whatever, like I've not made

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.880
 a video that's like, I'm going to teach a concept, which is not done it.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.600
 Do you think you would enjoy it? Because the process of you doing it with your kids is very

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:30.160
 different than putting out a video, which is a lot more like one directional, because I feel the same

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.760
 way. Like when I explain stuff to people in real life and I'm interacting with them, like, I love it.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.160
 But I don't think I get that same feeling just publishing educational stuff.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.840
 No, I think the first step would not be like a YouTube video. The first step would be like,

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.760
 I'd try and do a workshop. And I think that's what Joel talks about. Like you start with a workshop.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.480
 If people buy the tickets, it's worth your time. If they don't, you refund anybody that did.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.480
 Like if you don't get enough people interested, kind of like tells you as their interests in making

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.640
 this thing, like do enough people care to hear what you have to say about that topic. Anyway,

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.160
 that's what I would do. I would do a workshop. I don't know how many people you do a workshop

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.280
 were like 20, but there's some interactive bit involved there. And you kind of learn like what

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.920
 people struggle with and where you can really be helpful. And then that helps you eventually,

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.840
 you just keep doing those and you roll it into a course, I think. I think that's how Matt did it

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.080
 with the TypeScript stuff. Interesting. Oh, he did workshops. I don't know that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they all

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.720
 sold out. They made a ton of money on workshops or before they ever really like put time into the

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.560
 course, I think. I say a ton of money. I don't know. I had no idea. Just like that's the formula.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.960
 You start there and you kind of like learn what people don't know and what they need to understand

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.200
 better. And then you practice teaching the material and then you turn into like a self-paced thing.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:44.720
 Like what percentage, like what percent are you interested in this? Are you like 80% going to do this?

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:50.800
 Are you? I think I'm about one percent interested in 100 different things. I think that's my problem

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.760
 in life. I'm like, there's like 10 different things at any given moment that I'm like,

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.760
 oh, I should do this. What is that? What's wrong with my brain? Is it like,

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.800
 is this the thing that the internet has been to me, Dax? Can I blame someone? I feel like I have

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.480
 no follow through anymore. I don't know if I did early in my career, but I definitely don't now.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.280
 I think it's just a problem of optionality. You just have a ton of options.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.600
 A ton of options. That's the problem. This is kind of what's going to happen.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.560
 So how do you remove some options to make life easier? You just got to commit to something?

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:28.560
 I don't know. I feel like at least for me, I'm like committed to enough stuff that I still get

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:35.600
 ideas for other things, but they're like, don't really pull me. Okay, okay, here's the other thing.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.760
 The stuff that I am committed to has gotten past a certain point where it's like,

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.760
 it's not as I'm not like pushing something. I'm not like making something out of nothing

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.320
 anymore. It's like already something and I'm like building on top of it. So like this podcast.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.680
 Yeah, exactly. 29 episodes. Yeah. I mean, we're in it now. Yeah. I am committed to this.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.560
 There's this is like, there's a few things that I've followed through on. Yeah. And I keep doing,

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:07.680
 not streaming, but this podcast, this podcast, keep doing it. Yeah. So I'd be for me. I don't know.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:12.080
 Maybe do you have like how many things you feel committed to maybe have more kids? I don't know.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:20.240
 Have more kids. Oh, geez. I don't know. A handful. I feel like a handful of things that I'm definitely

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:27.920
 committed to. And then a whole lot of things that I'm in and out of. Is that normal? Is that the kind

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:33.920
 of like range you were expecting? I feel like it's the same for me, but in and out, I feel like you

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:40.640
 go more in than I like. So I also feel like I'm kind of vaguely toying with something always. Yeah.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:47.520
 But I feel like when you do it, you go a little bit further. So then going out feels more extreme.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:55.120
 I am like a I'm a sprinter. Have I told you this? Yeah. Yeah. I like going really hard

00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:01.040
 for short bursts of time. And then and it's so crazy. I've probably told you this like five times.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:08.960
 But it's like even with like physical activity, I can't like run two miles. No chance like never

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:14.320
 going to happen. Okay, I ran a 5k once, but like probably never again. I'm not like somebody who

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.960
 can mentally I think it's all mental. I just can't like sustain anything for very long from like,

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.800
 I hate this. This sucks. I'm done. But like, give me sprints. Sure. Like, I love short bursts of

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:31.360
 intense everything. So I don't know how to maximize like my impact on the world with that skill.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.080
 Because it feels very like the world is very oriented toward consistency and long-term

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:40.480
 and endurance and stamina. And if you have those qualities, you're going to build great things

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.520
 and go very far. And if you're a sprinter, it's just like, you just have a lot of like unfinished

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.440
 work around you at all times, which Leonardo da Vinci. Sorry. Go ahead.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.000
 I don't cut you off right there.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Compare myself with you. Go ahead.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.640
 Well, it's funny because the isn't that I've heard someone talking about this because like

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:06.000
 people didn't talk about the sprint versus the marathon thing. But yeah, the reality is for

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.760
 literally everything it just both, you just have to sprint forever. Like it's kind of, I think,

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.400
 oh, really? That's just what it is. Like, I don't know. It's like, I feel like everything I'm doing

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.720
 always felt like a sprint. But it just feels like I get a little bit of a break every week,

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.200
 but then once a week starts, like this sprint starts again. So yeah, people forgot for someone

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.040
 said it in a funny way. But it's something like, like, yeah, like it's actually just,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:32.160
 you're just sprinting the whole marathon. And if you look at the best, have you seen people like

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:37.360
 run like Olympic runners that like do quote unquote long distance? No. So if you look at someone that

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:46.720
 runs like a 1600 meter race, their pace is the same. It's like better than my 400 meter pace.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.640
 So if I like run as fast as I can for 400 meters, they're doing that for all 1600.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.640
 For the whole mile. Yeah. So like stuff just becomes like those races that you think of as long

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.240
 distance. Like if you zoom in, it's actually just a sprint the whole time.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.840
 Wow. You know, minds are the ultra ultra long distance stuff.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.160
 So I'm not special. I'm not going more intensely. I'm just flaky.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.800
 No, you might you might be going more intensely. But I think I don't like, I think the answer to

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:16.640
 your question, sadly, is that you have to do both. I don't think there's, I don't think you can just

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:25.200
 do that find like, like a way that that makes sense. Okay. I'm sorry if that is that a lot to hear.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:31.680
 It's not a lot. It's just, I still, I don't understand because I feel like if I win as hard as I go,

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:37.360
 there's no way I could sustain it like for the rest of my life. And that's what I feel like you're

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.200
 saying. Yeah. Maybe do to go a little bit less hard. I don't know what the answer is. But yeah,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.760
 I'm saying you might be going hard. I think you do definitely go harder than what most people

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:53.200
 consider a sprint. But the big gaps between probably that I don't think can work out the big gaps.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.200
 What was that? Like, if you like sprint for a long time, if you sprint and then you take, then you

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:02.640
 flip to a period of like not doing that. So like if I stream for three months and then I don't

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:08.160
 stream for four months and then I come back and I stream for a month and then I don't stream ever

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:14.960
 again. Would you say that that was a good strategy? Yeah, I don't know. I just like, I don't know how

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:20.480
 that approach leads. I don't know. I just don't know. I haven't seen it. I feel like you're holding

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.240
 something back. I feel like you got something really juicy to say to me, something that maybe

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.240
 would hurt our friendship. And you just don't want to say I'm not holding anything back. I just don't

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.800
 have a good way to articulate it. I just I don't know. It's just what I said. It's I think your

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:40.640
 approach doesn't work. I guess it's as simple as that. That was it. Because I can't think of like a

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:45.280
 way to like, okay, if you do this approach, but like in this way or in this play part of the world

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.080
 or against this thing, like, I don't know. Yeah, it doesn't work. No, you're right. Because I when

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:54.720
 I said and think about like, how can I take advantage of this skill of just like going really hard for

00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:00.480
 two weeks? It's like, no, plenty people go really hard for a lot more than two weeks. I'm not like

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.920
 special for just like ignoring everything else in life for short periods of time. I just got to figure

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:13.520
 out how to like maintain like a good, healthy interest in things that I take on without like

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.760
 obsessing and neglecting my health and doing all the things I do. Because I just like, when I get

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.680
 really into something, I won't exercise. I won't anything. I just like, I forget to eat. I mean,

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:29.760
 you know what that's like. It's just very unhealthy. Can't do that stuff. But it's so hard to justify

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.280
 when my mind is in that it's like you're going to bed thinking about it, you're waking up thinking

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.960
 about it. It's so hard to justify spending any time doing anything else when it's like, I got

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.400
 stuff to do. Yeah. But you know, you probably don't do that with your kids, right? It's time you spend

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:48.320
 with them. I get impacted. Yeah. Oh, that sounded awful. Oh, no, no, no. I meant like, of course not.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:57.440
 No, I meant that like there is like a base level of stuff that doesn't like fault the wayside.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.480
 Oh, you're saying like, I still spit. Oh, I got you. Yeah. I thought you're saying like,

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:06.560
 I don't focus on my kids like that. And I don't get very intense. I was like, oh, why would I do that?

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:13.760
 No, the great point. Yeah. No, I do still like have my family in a relationship with them.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:20.320
 So yeah, I can't go as hard as I could in my 20s now that we've got kids, but I kind of feel

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:25.840
 the same way. I feel like I like I use this. The thing you're describing, I would like I would work

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:34.320
 in bed and I would fall asleep because it's 3 a.m. with my laptop on my chest. I wake up and just go

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:40.720
 shoot at that door. Just like in the I just would not have left my bed for like hours.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:48.400
 Besides like go answer door to get the food delivery. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm obviously never going to go

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.600
 to that degree again, but I can't say it wasn't. It was productive. I was also a lot stupider back

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.840
 then. So I had to do those things. That's the other thing. Like you just get you just build more

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:04.400
 leverage and you don't have to compensate for like you're going to experience with that like raw

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:09.440
 like time anymore. So I think you might just maybe you're fully adapted to the fact that

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:15.600
 you don't have to really operate the way you did when you were like, you know, younger. Yeah, maybe

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:20.320
 you probably are just as effective without going that hard. I definitely sprinted pretty hard for

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:27.040
 a couple years. Yeah. A few years when we started a startup that was that was a long sprint. But

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.600
 yeah, I was dumber and I just had to throw time at every problem. Now I don't. That's what I'm trying

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.080
 to convince myself. I still don't know if I believe you. I don't know if I actually feel smarter and

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:41.840
 like I can do things faster anymore or now than I did. It's not even about doing things faster. It's

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:46.560
 like you might have resources to like hire someone to do a thing they go done yourself or like, yeah,

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.960
 you're not going to waste time doing a thing you know doesn't work because you've like wasted time

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:57.520
 before. Yeah, why do we? Okay, this is totally jumping off the cliff. But why do we like make more

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.320
 money the older we get? Why is it like just because we get older, we deserve more money?

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:08.800
 I I have a whole rant about this. The way people think about income that I just feel like no one

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:16.960
 understands it correctly. People are always like this this top this comes up a lot, right? People

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.840
 come up with a role, right? They're like, oh, this role. Okay, let's say it's like DevRel

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.600
 writing documentation. Yeah, and we all feel like that's important. DevRel is important

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:32.240
 documentation is important. Everyone's like, that role deserves X dollars or like because we have

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:37.840
 these warm feelings about it. It deserves, you know, it should be someone if you're hiring someone

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.720
 with that role, you should pay the next amount. But I think people have this weird association

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:48.000
 with their salary. Like someone has to like, there's like some kind of objective truth to what the

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.200
 salary is and like, someone has to like gift that to you, someone has to give it to you and agree

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.520
 to that truth and we have to agree that this is worth it. But it's just not how it works. It's like,

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.720
 yeah, if you're on the other side of it and you're building a business and you're trying to like

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.720
 invest your resources, you're like, what is the ROI I'm getting for this? Is this person going to

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.640
 like, if I pay them a dollar, are they going to bring me back five? Like it's always about the

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.400
 amount of demand and opportunity you can create. Yeah. And you can do that with literally any role.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:17.520
 But like, there's like no innate value, like number with the role. I think the reason people

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:23.440
 think about this stuff is if you go work at a big tech company, they give you a packet or just

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.960
 big any company that's like, here is your level, you are level six. If you do XYZ things, you will be

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:33.280
 level seven and level sevens earn about a lot. So you just get this idea that there's like this

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:38.320
 global framework for what people deserve given how many years they have or like,

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:44.880
 I'm doing XYZ things therefore. So yeah, the thing you said reminded me of that because

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:49.840
 it's not that you automatically make more money when you're older. It's that typically people that

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:55.440
 have more experience and just create a way more opportunity for themselves just given the people

00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:01.280
 they know, the stuff that they can do, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah. I knew you were going to go there.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.920
 It's the opportunities. The older you get, the more experience, the more opportunities,

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.440
 the more pay. You don't deserve more because you're older. You don't deserve more because

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.280
 you're like, I've been working for 20 years. You deserve more because you like have created a

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:21.200
 bunch of demand over those 20 years. Yeah. Anyway. So do you worry about like software development

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:27.200
 as a field, like being in a bubble that we've been paid way too much and it's going to come

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.000
 crashing down and we're all going to get paid like, I don't know, flight attendants. I have no idea

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.240
 what people get paid. But there was definitely, I think I've spoken to that before, there was like

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:41.440
 a year, it was like a year or two, maybe two years total where me and Liz collectively made like

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:51.840
 like a stupid amount of money. There's like peak pandemic money everywhere situation. And I'm kind

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:58.000
 of like, I don't know if we're ever going to like make that much money. So like doing literally what

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.040
 we were doing back then. Yeah. Yeah. I think that that opportunity is not there anymore. I'm not

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:09.440
 personally worried really that much. I mean, we're not exactly working like nine to fives like where

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:16.400
 L seven salary ranges matter to us. Yeah, exactly. So I've always like found like weird ways to make

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:22.480
 money. So I don't think that's yeah, if that's impacted, I'm just going to continue to find other

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:28.000
 weird ways to make funny like like Jason is Jason Lancer was saying an interaction on Twitter. But

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.400
 someone posted like, Oh, why isn't there like a software engineering reality show, which is something

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.560
 we've talked about a bunch, right? Like just, yeah, these are so much drama be funny to have like,

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:42.400
 like Netflix style documentaries with like some of these characters. Yeah, yeah. And Jason was like,

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.680
 Oh, I have like, yeah, I always say is I have to go a bunch of shows that I've written and

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:53.280
 are ready for production. I just need a company to sponsor it. And I'm like, that is so weird. And

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.200
 like that no one, no one little kid was like, I want to be that when I grow up, right? Like, no,

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.560
 nobody, there's no like instructions on how to go do that. That's just a weird way to make money.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.800
 And yeah, I don't know if it's going to work out, but if he does do it, like, yeah, he just

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.960
 camp with his like super weird way to make money. So I feel like there's interesting.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.840
 Yeah, I'm gonna steal this from Liz. She said this the other day. And I've been trying to figure

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:23.840
 out how to put into a tweet so I can see that from her. But she was like, the way she's perceiving

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:31.680
 things is it's getting easier and easier for people that are geared towards like finding

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.360
 weird ways to make money. Because like the tools are easier. Like there's more tools,

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:40.000
 there's more opportunities. There's like, there's just doing something weird and finding your own

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.680
 unique way of making money is like more possible than it ever has been. But the other side of that

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.160
 of like not doing any of that is doing something like very traditional, that's getting harder.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.480
 So there's, I think there's a gap that's being created between one type of person,

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.800
 another type of person. And that's where like the pain and conflict kind of is showing up.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.320
 Yeah, I've got, I mean, people close to me, and I live in the Ozarks. It's like,

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:07.520
 not a lot of people doing what I do for a living, definitely close with people that

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:13.600
 are feeling the pain of the current economy. I mean, just like the different paths.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:19.280
 And if you didn't take one 10 years ago, it's a, it's kind of bad right now.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:23.360
 Yeah. And even though there's like traditional paths that have been very reliable or like,

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.160
 at least in the, the paths that people were told to go down the last five to 10 years are now,

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:34.480
 people are like, okay, they're like not as lucrative anymore. And especially in tech,

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:39.520
 at least, yeah, and I will see where it goes. But yeah, I think more than ever,

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:45.440
 it's important to find your own like weird way of making money that nobody else really can do.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:50.080
 Yeah. And if you don't do that, dermatology, I just got back from the dermatologist,

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:54.480
 I bet they had 50 employees in there. There were like four patients and probably like 50 people

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.720
 behind desks. I'm not even kidding you. I have no idea what they're all doing.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.960
 I guess like dealing with insurance, maybe work for an insurance company. They seem to be doing okay.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.800
 Is that that maybe is a place in the Ozarks?

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:13.120
 Yeah. This is huge like floor of this, one of the few tall buildings in the Ozarks.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.080
 And I cannot believe how many people work at this place. It was insane. They can't all be

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.000
 dermatologists. They're all just like moving paper around, I guess. I don't know. I'm not trying to

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.840
 like disparage them. It was just clearly a lot of opportunities in healthcare. We're all sick

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:32.720
 and dying. We'll talk about that money in skin care for a predominantly white area.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:38.960
 Okay. Where did that come from? Why do we have to go into the racial tension?

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:44.560
 I like making fun of white people because I feel like they have like a lot of skin issues.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:49.520
 Oh, yeah. It's like it's like the one area that we get sunburns. I don't know if you know this.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:53.760
 It's where your your skin gets red and burnt from the sun. It hurts.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:58.320
 Okay. Love you. Bye.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.320
 I've been waiting to do that all day. Like as soon as I retweet,

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.720
 I've been just dying to do it. Okay. I'm gonna stop recording now.
