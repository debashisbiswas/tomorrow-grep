00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
 Adam, dev streaming is getting huge.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.360
 You're really excited about it. Tell me more.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.460
 >> Yeah, it's getting so big that we started another side project.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.360
 We started Watch.dev, which I think the mission of Watch.dev is help.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.880
 People who are developers get into streaming,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.960
 but also just make a place for developers who'd like to stream and developers who'd like to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.040
 watch developers stream, hang out.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:47.120
 [MUSIC]

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.360
 Does that make sense? Is that the goal of Watch.dev?

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.880
 We didn't really talk about it too formally.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.640
 >> Yeah, I was pretty excited about it because I think there are a bunch of people getting

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.520
 more into this, and there's a second wave, there was a first wave.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.920
 I don't know what wave we're on, but I know there's a current wave,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.800
 which I kind of think of that as you kind of got into it, that pulled me into it.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.520
 I think there's a chain of people that are getting more into it around the past couple of months.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.720
 >> You have people in our circle, especially like we see that much more closely?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.080
 >> Right, exactly, and we're all kind of doing it together,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.840
 but they're pretty fragmented efforts, right?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.040
 We would ask each other for advice, things like that here and there.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.520
 It's nice to have an official place, obviously for the audience,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.680
 so that they can discover each other in a single community of people that like doing this weird thing.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.760
 But then also for us on the streamer side to learn from each other,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.040
 coordinate stuff together, I'm pretty excited about doing more stuff with each other.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.440
 So yeah, and that's what I'm excited for.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.560
 >> Yeah, so you asked the question and I totally ignored it and just said what I wanted to say at the beginning.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.920
 Let's go back to your question, which was, there's a lot of hype around it, dev streaming, like it's happening.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.240
 Let's talk about what it is.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.680
 So dev streaming, when we say dev streaming, mostly we're talking about Twitch.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.240
 I guess people stream on YouTube and maybe other platforms, but largely,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.880
 it's like programmers who want to turn on a camera and log into Twitch and stream their work day,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.120
 or just stream them doing programming with other people watching.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.880
 That's dev streaming for those who maybe don't know what we're talking about.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.840
 And in terms of like, it's history, I'm going to try, so Theo just made a video about this, right?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.840
 Like about the history of streaming on Twitch with this.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.760
 Twitch is like largely 95% people playing games and people watching people play games.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.160
 And there's just like burgeoning community of creatives, which includes developers,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.040
 that are doing non-gaming things on Twitch.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.360
 We are a small sliver of that, so we're a tiny, tiny sliver of all of Twitch.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.240
 But there are dozens of us now, dozens of us streaming our programming on Twitch,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.000
 and even dozens of people watching it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.840
 That's just some context, just so you know.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.200
 There are some big dev streamers, the private gen comes to mind,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.040
 that you've got more than a thousand people watching at a time,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.600
 which is a huge deal when you're talking about like, we're writing code.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.560
 I don't know.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.440
 Is that all like setting any context stacks?

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.560
 Would you add anything to that?

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.640
 Yeah, I think that makes sense.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.920
 I think the overarching thing is it turns out people like watching other people do stuff live,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.120
 and there's really no limit of what that could be.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.880
 You know, like we're a niche community, I would say.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.800
 But if you look on Twitch, there's all kinds of like really niche things, right?

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.520
 And they all have viewers in the audiences, and it does feel still like at the beginning.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.000
 Like we're all figuring it out, and you start to see people pushing the bar on like how they're doing it.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.480
 Like for you, you like really went crazy with the production quality.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.120
 So it still feels like early.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.760
 I don't know if you feel the same way.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.840
 No, for sure. Yeah, I've been, especially the programming thing.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.120
 And I think like it does seem to be growing.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.840
 So I'm optimistic that there's a lot of room here for lots of people who's trying to join.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.200
 So I'm trying to join our.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.600
 How do they find the link?

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.880
 So I guess it's on your stream.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.800
 So we're actually streaming this podcast episode.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.600
 So yeah, somebody typed in the URL and someone's trying to join the Rivercast.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.320
 So this is funny.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.120
 Yeah, so we're actually streaming this live on Twitch.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.640
 I think like that I do have thoughts on just the like getting into it.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.720
 Whether you think you could get into it, whether you think it's for you at all.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.160
 I would say I never would have thought I'd be on Twitch.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.880
 Like I just, to me, it didn't seem like a thing that was like my speed.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.160
 I don't know. I'm not like I'm not very young anymore.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.960
 And it seemed like a young man's thing.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.000
 I don't know.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.040
 Just getting into Twitch and getting into streaming has just totally changed my career.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.040
 I mean, it's injected so much into my workdays.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.320
 Just like I thoroughly enjoy the process of having other people around while I'm working.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.640
 I don't know that that's everybody.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.280
 But for me, having worked from home for a long time over 10 years, like it was a pretty

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.280
 isolated career.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.840
 You know, you work alone in your office every day, something about opening that up and having

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.200
 other people to hang out with while I'm working.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.120
 I'm getting a lot less done, but I'm enjoying my work a lot more.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.960
 There's something about it that's really enjoyable.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.920
 So I do think like there are probably a lot of devs out there that they would not enjoy

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.920
 it.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.520
 They would try and they would find out really quickly, not for me or other people don't

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.520
 enjoy watching them do it.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.240
 But I think there's a lot of people that probably would and maybe never even try.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.760
 I hope someone, I guess what I'm trying to get at.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.440
 I hope somebody hears this.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.000
 They're a developer and they've maybe thought about it once, but then they just dismissed

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 it.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 But they would try to stream and there's a whole lot you got to do to kind of get into it.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.360
 There's a lot of barriers to that and we can talk about kind of what that looks like.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.360
 But yeah, it could just totally surprise you.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.440
 It totally surprised me.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.640
 I love it so much.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.360
 Yeah, I feel the same way.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.360
 I think there were like years ago, I first heard of this concept of someone even just

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.800
 doing this live to a random audience and I actually thought it was pretty cool.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.680
 And I was like, oh, it would be, you know, cool if I could do that one day.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.200
 But it really felt like something kind of unattainable or I feel it felt impossible.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.320
 How could I ever actually do that?

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.760
 But then seeing a lot of people like yourself start to do it.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.500
 And I would, I just saw someone and people go from never having done it before to then

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.720
 having done it before to like being really comfortable doing it and it becomes a habit.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.600
 And that really convinced me, oh yeah, you know, I can definitely, definitely jump in

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.600
 and do this.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.600
 And yeah, I agree.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.600
 I don't think it's for everyone.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.960
 And I also genuinely love it.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.800
 Like it's just people on the internet are so funny and it's just fun to have all these

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.880
 funny people around, at least for, you know, a couple hours in the day.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.440
 It's definitely less productive.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.200
 So don't expect to be like your maximum productivity while you're on stream.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.120
 But it is a fun, fun environment.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.480
 And I think for me, it also, I kind of view it as one, I genuinely love it.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.420
 And two, it's kind of practice for just being comfortable talking to yourself and without

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.120
 like, you know, in front of audience of people.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.840
 It's not literally like you're on stage, but I definitely find myself getting more comfortable

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.320
 when I started out a little bit more uncomfortable and I like that I developed in that way.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.320
 Yeah.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.960
 It's teaching you stuff that you really wouldn't otherwise, I guess, pick up in this career

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.360
 at least like, yeah, we don't spend time on stages.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.120
 You've said something like it doesn't have to be your whole day.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.680
 Like, I think just doing it for a portion of your work day makes a difference.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.920
 Like I think I streamed early, I kind of started just streaming everything I did that day.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.800
 And that that starts to get hard because you do get a lot less done when you're interacting

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.840
 with all these people, but you learned so much.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.120
 I think I've learned more on Twitch.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.560
 Just from like people watching you do what you're doing, then pointing out things that

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.200
 you could do better or things that you just didn't even know, you didn't have the question

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.200
 to ask.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.720
 Like, you're not even seeking ways to improve something you're doing, but people are seeing

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.840
 it and pointing it out, kind of pushing that information at you.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.760
 I love that part of Twitch or streaming, I guess, more broadly.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.920
 Yeah, it's a, there's kind of like a series of hoops you got to jump through, but if you

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:18.960
 can get through that and just see if you enjoy having people around and if people enjoy

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.800
 watching you, because I think like some people may be streaming a long time.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.240
 And if people aren't showing up, maybe a sign, I don't know, maybe just like, you're not

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.240
 cut out for it.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.240
 It's not a thing that people resonate with you.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.640
 I think it helps like have a thing, a thing that you will kind of like draw people in

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.640
 with.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.600
 And then if you have a personality that resonates with other people, then you'll probably build

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600
 up an audience.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.480
 I think that's like, that's part of it.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.480
 I don't know.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.480
 Am I being gatekeeper?

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.480
 I don't know.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.800
 I feel like this is where someone would be like, you're being a gatekeeper.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.960
 I think, I think there is just, it just comes down to what your goals are, like if it's

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.080
 just the thing you want to try out, like obviously, you know, do whatever who cares.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:04.000
 But it is one of those things where it just gets exponentially more fun and easy after

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.080
 a certain amount of viewers that you can kind of consistently draw.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.520
 And if you have the same people coming back, you know, that's, that's even more fun.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.860
 And I found that it's really hard at the beginning because you're just literally talking to

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.360
 yourself and you have no feedback to go off of because no one's really in your chat.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.560
 And that's very difficult.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.720
 And then you feel really awkward and you feel like, why would anyone ever watch me?

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.200
 But if you can build up a decent size audience, doesn't have to be huge, you know, like 10,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.920
 20 people watching you, then there's a little bit more feedback for you to, for you to react

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.920
 to.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.920
 And it gets way, way easier.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.960
 So it's definitely extremely difficult at the beginning.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.920
 And as long as you're able to grow somewhat, it's, it should be something you enjoy doing

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.440
 and can, and can continue to do.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.160
 I think the whole thing about you can't just stream on Twitch and do nothing else and expect

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.160
 to have an audience.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.080
 I think that is very accurate, especially if you're trying to do this, you know, more

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.320
 professionally or like a bigger part of your life, you do need to be building audiences

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.680
 and like being known, like you said, you need to have a thing that you're known for.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.080
 It can literally be anything, the magic of the internet is no matter what the thing is,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.200
 as long as nobody else is doing it, there's going to be enough people interested in that.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.720
 It could be literally anything.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.640
 Just figure out what is unique about you and what you're into that other people aren't.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.640
 Just keep doing that.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.960
 And over time, you should be able to, when people think of that thing, they should think

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.960
 of you, right?

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.960
 Yeah.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.960
 Yeah.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.960
 Yeah.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.960
 Yeah.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.960
 This whole time you've been saying that I've been trying to think of something like funny

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.960
 to say about your thing.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.960
 Like, what is your thing?

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.960
 But I can't come up with anything.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.960
 It was going to be something insulting.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.960
 It's going to be smart and you say smart things on the internet, and I got nothing.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.960
 I got nothing.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.960
 Oh, man.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.960
 Really wanted something.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.960
 I mean, I think my thing, I think I'm going to, my entry to streaming was a little bit

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:50.320
 easier because I already had somewhat of a presence just from my open source work and

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.040
 SST and doing serverless and AWS and all that stuff.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:59.160
 So, yeah, I was doing it a little bit more casually, like six months ago, and that was

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.880
 pretty much just for the SST audience.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.640
 In the past couple of months, I've been doing it a little bit more seriously and I've been

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:08.160
 able to kind of build off of the initial SST audience and branch out a little bit more.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.160
 It's totally doable.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.880
 You know, it just feels impossible in the beginning when you're literally at zero, but

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.040
 you can figure it out.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.640
 It's not a lottery or anything.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.640
 Yeah.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.880
 If you have like a social media presence outside of Twitch, I had kind of a Twitter following.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.880
 I think that helps a lot.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.680
 You can just kind of like keep shilling your stream to your existing audience.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.680
 I do.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.480
 I want to talk about Twitch chat and like the people who are watching because that's the

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.000
 other side of Watch.dev is like a community for the people who watch a lot of us and it's

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 a lot of overlap.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.320
 A lot of the same people are watching our streams.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.880
 One thing I wonder because I know I get less done like when I'm streaming, but I feel like

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.880
 the people watching also have to be getting less done and I do worry about like the sustainability.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:53.080
 I know like I'll get done streaming for four hours and then I watch you Dax and you'll

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.680
 stream for a few hours and I realize like I've got nothing else done today.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.640
 I got just hung out on Twitch all day.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.640
 So there's that element of it.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.360
 Do you worry about that like in terms of sustainability of this thing long term?

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.360
 Yeah.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.600
 I got to figure out a better balance for myself because the past two week or two, I've been

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.880
 watching you every single day and I actually think you get more done during your streams

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.840
 and I get done because I'm just like trying to think of finding things to say and chat

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.840
 the whole time.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.840
 Not me.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.760
 While I'm watching you, I'm like, I'm very unproductive and you can actually see that

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.960
 in what my schedule has been like.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.480
 I've been working a lot more at night like before I sleep because I just haven't been

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.760
 getting up during the day.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.840
 So yeah, I think what we're currently doing probably isn't fully sustainable.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.480
 I need to like background you a little bit more.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.480
 You are really funny in my Twitch chat.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.480
 You're probably too funny.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.640
 You should probably calm down and just too many witty comments.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.640
 There's too many opportunities.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.120
 Even when I start working, I hear your voice and I hear you say something and I'm like,

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.480
 I can say something snarky back to that and I have to switch over and get the comment

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.480
 out.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.480
 That's funny.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.360
 Yeah, I guess I try to like hop in and out and I hope that people that watch us stream

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.360
 are doing the same.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.360
 I hope they're not just the entire time locked into what we're doing.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.000
 It is easy to make that assumption though as you're streaming to just assume like, oh,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.320
 these people that are all here, they're watching everything I do, right?

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.400
 But I don't think they are.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.960
 I hope not.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.800
 But there is, I think there's a good opportunity for people who maybe like you're new into

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.240
 the career, you still are kind of getting your feet wet, so to speak.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.760
 Watching people stream coding.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.000
 I feel like there's value there like versus Twitter where people are like, here's a JavaScript

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 tip.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 I feel like you watch them on Twitch.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.320
 If they're actually doing real work, I think you're going to pick up some stuff.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.720
 And most of the time you're going to ask questions, we're going to answer them.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.600
 It's not like we're overwhelmed with chat or we can't just like respond to stuff.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.400
 I think there's value on the viewership side too.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.400
 I guess what I'm trying to say.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.680
 And I've gotten really explicit feedback about this that I found pretty interesting.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.480
 So with SST, we're always trying to create educational content to get people to understand

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.640
 certain things.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.920
 And we think about very explicit things that we think people should know.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.080
 But when people watch my stream, they comment on learning all this stuff that we literally

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.040
 would have never thought of or we just wouldn't have, it's just something that wouldn't make

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.400
 sense in any other form.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.920
 People will talk about how it's interesting to see how I use my tools, like how I lay out

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.080
 my windows.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.520
 When I go from my editor to like the SST console, like when I go to Google or when I go to

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.760
 chat to PT, like those little workflow things, there's a lot of information there that you

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.160
 really can't explain that in any other format, aside from consistently streaming every day.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.560
 Yeah, you just take it for granted.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.760
 Like it's not things I would think to tell people that I do, which I'm not cool.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.560
 I'm not using arch and i3 and all that.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.080
 But like when I swipe between my workspaces on Mac, people are like, oh, I never thought

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.080
 to do that.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.080
 And I just assume like everybody does that.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.080
 I don't know.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.980
 Yeah, somebody asked actually and I'm not going to hide the fact that we're streaming

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.980
 this one.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.680
 I think it's on brand, right?

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.920
 We're talking about dev streaming.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.120
 We're doing this on Twitch.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.000
 Someone asked, do you get any anxiety?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 I think they said anxiety.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.640
 Are you afraid of people judging how you code?

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.200
 Do you want to answer that one, Dax?

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.240
 I've never really had that cross my mind.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.440
 I think naturally, I don't care about that.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.040
 But on top of that, all myself has been open source for so long.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.080
 So I'm thinking I'm just being public.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.680
 I've never had a negative interaction, really, like even if I was worried about it, there

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.320
 was actually nothing that's ever manifested that I was like, oh, I feel bad about that

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.640
 or someone made me feel bad.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.920
 It's almost always positive and like useful for me to hear.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.760
 The worst is that sometimes a feedback is not relevant.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.560
 That's like the worst you can possibly really get.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.560
 Yeah, sure.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.720
 But besides that, like, you know, I've never really had anything bad happen.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.000
 Yeah, I can't think of like, I know people have pointed out like you could do this this

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.840
 way or this way is better, but I'm usually looking for that.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.800
 And I think if you go into it just assuming you're going to write bad code, probably whatever

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.840
 bad code is and just not hold it too dearly, then you're going to learn a lot and I think

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.240
 you'll get over it pretty quick if there is any fear there.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.600
 Yeah, it feels like a superpower.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.640
 You just get even in place where you're writing something where you don't think there's any

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.640
 problem.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.720
 Sometimes people point out, oh, you could actually do that.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.960
 And it's like, wow, I would have never even stopped to think.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.960
 Yeah, sorry.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.960
 I was distracted reading Twitch.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.440
 No, because Chris is here.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.440
 Hey, Chris.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.440
 Sorry.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.440
 This is weird.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.440
 This is podcast episode.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.440
 Chris gets trolls a lot though.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.440
 I don't get a lot of trolls.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.440
 I've not had a lot of that.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.600
 Maybe people ban them before I see it.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.600
 I don't.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.600
 Yeah, I haven't gotten any trolls.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.880
 I mean, I'm at a much smaller scale, so I'm sure that shows up once you hit a certain

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.880
 size.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.880
 Yeah, we have another question.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.080
 Would you always prepare or just hit record and go for it?

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.720
 Do you ever prepare anything for your stream?

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.960
 No, I think for me, the way I view Twitch is it's the lowest effort content I can make

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:35.600
 and that I don't have to do a bunch of work outside of literally just doing the thing.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.840
 So for me, that's where it fits in like the spectrum of content that I do.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.760
 It is just the thing I can do every day without having to have a bunch of ceremony around

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.760
 it.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.760
 So now I don't really prepare.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.080
 And obviously at the beginning, you may be a little awkward, but over time, you start

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.080
 to feel really normal.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.960
 Yeah, two things I would say, one, it is so true.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.280
 It's the lowest effort content.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.680
 Like I want to put myself out there in the world, but like, I just can't be bothered

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.080
 anymore to like ride a Twitter thread or like make a polished video.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.000
 It's just so it's so much effort.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.640
 And something about Twitch, even though it's more time and you probably spend more time

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.360
 doing it than anything else.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.360
 It's very low effort.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.480
 You just kind of like get to be yourself.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.040
 The other thing I would say though, in terms of preparing, I did spend like four months

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.280
 building my Twitter overlay, my Twitch overlay.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.240
 So I guess I prepared like in that sense, you can spend a lot of time kind of like making

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.520
 your stream better, but I don't think of it as like preparing for an individual stream.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.840
 Like I don't prepare for day to day what I'm going to do on any given stream.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:37.720
 But I think putting a little time, a little effort into just polishing the stream in terms

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:43.640
 of like your ergonomics, your overlays and that kind of stuff.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.920
 And if you're going to have like any kind of bits that you do or things that you do every

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.040
 day, they're kind of consistent.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.240
 I know people like to feel like they know what to expect.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.000
 And like that kind of stuff, I think is good to prepare for.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 Yeah.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 I mean, speaking of that's another whole angle to this that I find extremely fun, like similar

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.360
 to you, that it's kind of a new thing you can go really deep in and learn a bunch about

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.200
 and with streaming, there's so much, right?

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.480
 There's literally like, like you said, the overlays, like the different ways you can

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.000
 produce your stream and there's all the equipment that goes behind it.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 I'm actually having a blast figuring out how to do all this on Linux.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.160
 I don't actually find it painful.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.840
 It's like, it's fun for me to learn about all this stuff that I haven't had to in a

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.200
 long time.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.480
 So it's just like another hobby that you can just go super deep in.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.360
 And yeah, I think people might be wondering like, how do they even get started?

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.280
 Like where, how deep do they need to go?

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.280
 Yeah.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.280
 I don't know if you have any thoughts on that.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.960
 No, I mean, I'm, I'm an obsessive.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:47.480
 So I love to go very deep on any new hobbies and Twitch and streaming has been that for

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.480
 sure.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.720
 Like I've spent a ton of time and enjoyed just like, how can I make it better?

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.000
 How can I make it like a higher quality stream?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.040
 I really enjoyed that whole process.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.720
 Yeah, it's a lot of hardware, it's a lot of software.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.960
 Once you figure out the Linux thing, I'd love to see if I can make it work on my, like I'd

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.080
 love to like play with that.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.480
 So I'm very curious where that all heads.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.480
 Yeah.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.480
 No, I think it's all, it's all a lot of fun.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:18.760
 I think the development part, the actually coding on stream part is a very small sliver,

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.680
 I guess, of what makes it actually enjoyable.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.240
 And it, because sometimes it's a small sliver of what I actually do on stream, someone else

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.800
 asks, how important are the projects that you work on?

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.480
 Like I'm not interested in some project streamers work on what others seem really interesting.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.920
 I honestly, I've had the feeling, I don't know if you feel the same way.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.800
 It acts, but like sometimes I think I could just stream any random thing.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.800
 It doesn't matter.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.440
 Like I think it's more just the conversations and that kind of stuff is why people are there.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.600
 Do you think that's true?

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.600
 Yeah.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.600
 I feel the same way.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.740
 Like the, the working on a thing is just to provide some framing for the whole stream.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:55.560
 So it's like you said, people know what to expect, but I find that it doesn't really

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.560
 matter.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.400
 I don't know if people are really there for the specific project that you're working

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.400
 on.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.200
 I think it's like, you know, people join where they feel comfortable, where they feel they

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.280
 can engage in, they have a consistent community.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.320
 So yeah, I haven't, I haven't cared too much about what I actually work on.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.320
 Yeah.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.480
 Chris says he only works on the projects that he does on stream on stream.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.040
 So it's like, he never works on that project offline.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.360
 So it motivates him to keep streaming.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.360
 That's a good call.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.360
 Yeah.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.360
 That's a good call.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.360
 Yeah.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.360
 That'll keep you doing it.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.360
 And Chris does it like you do it every day, Chris, I think.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.160
 When now we're having a conversation with someone in Twitch chat on the podcast, I don't

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.160
 know.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.160
 This is interesting.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.400
 It's fun though.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.600
 It's become my life's passion and I feel like I should talk about it more because I just

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.920
 know there are people out there that would really enjoy it.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.320
 And I think that's the hope.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.360
 We've seen some friends starting to get into it.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.360
 Yeah.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.560
 I don't know anything else you would say to people that are new to it that maybe have

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.160
 all kinds of fears or questions.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.160
 Yeah.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.880
 I've just found it's an incredible creative outlet.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.440
 I think if you have creative energy, you might not even think you have creative energy

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.080
 and you might discover that you do.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.720
 I get really excited when I get an idea for my stream, like this whole thing with my little

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:07.240
 dog camera, I was so fun, just being able to build something that's an idea you have.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.360
 It's purely for fun, right?

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.480
 What's the business model behind this, which is what 99% of my life is otherwise?

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.480
 It's so serious.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:18.360
 But here, I can use my same skills, my software engineering skills to do these things, build

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.640
 these overlays, build these automations.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:26.120
 But it's all towards just for having fun and that does feel so different than the rest

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.120
 of my life.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:32.240
 Yeah, I love having that in here and I think I'm going to want something like this forever

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.640
 now that I know what it's like.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.640
 Yeah.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:40.080
 No, I would say like as a developer, if you get into this, you're going to have a phase

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.880
 probably early on where you just want to do all the things you can possibly do with the

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.600
 Twitch API, like you're going to build channel point rewards, you're going to build crazy

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.880
 overlays and just like embrace it, enjoy that little season.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:59.320
 It is like this pure joy phase that I think every developer on Twitch goes through it.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:04.800
 Like you're going to build a lot of stuff to just kind of make it your own and it's fun.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.640
 And then you kind of like get to settle into that and just enjoy it every day.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.640
 Yeah.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.640
 It's just, it's pure fun.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.640
 I love it.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.640
 Yeah.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.640
 Oh, wow.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.640
 This is the first time we've ever not had anything to say.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.640
 Neither one of us are.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.640
 Are we reading Twitch?

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.640
 I think we're reading Twitch.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.640
 I was just looking at the Twitch chat.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.640
 Yeah.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.640
 Yeah.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.640
 Same.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.640
 Do we have anything else we want to say on this?

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.640
 We don't have to.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.640
 We don't have to look at Discord again.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.640
 Watch.dev.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.640
 Yeah.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.360
 You can just go to watch.dev like in your browser and it'll redirect you to the Discord.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.360
 Yeah.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.640
 So it's a community for people that like doing this, both as an audience and as a streamer.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.480
 If you're interested in getting into it and you have questions, you know, I think when

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:42.120
 I was getting into it, I had a lot of questions on what Mike, do I get, what camera do I get?

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.360
 Again, you don't have to go crazy.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.280
 You can get started with something pretty basic.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.680
 I wanted to go crazy.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.760
 So I had a lot of questions about this stuff.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.760
 But it's fun.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.440
 There's just some really knowledgeable people there that will be able to help you out and

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.160
 whatever scale you want to go to, you want to go to intro scale, you want to go to Adam's

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.160
 scale.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.160
 Adam's the top end of the scale.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.640
 You can't go really past Adam.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:09.160
 In terms of investing in your, yeah, yeah, I'm probably invested in my setup more than

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.160
 you should.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160
 Yeah.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.160
 Yeah.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:17.080
 It's a great place to figure out how to do it and yeah, so join if you're interested.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.080
 Cool.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.080
 Hope to see everybody there.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.080
 All right.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.080
 We've been here.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.080
 Thanks.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.080
 We've got to hit record.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.080
 Stop it.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.080
 Stop it.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.080
 No.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.400
 He really got me for a second.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.280
 It's hard to see my monitor.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.280
 It's still recording.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:31.480
 I'm going to stop it now.
