WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
 Anything that they put like gold foil on or something.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.560
 I love it.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.800
 I just want that, whatever it is, unless it's like a steak.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.640
 Just give me that.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.860
 - I was gonna say anything, what about this?

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.440
 Come down to Miami, they'll put gold on whatever you want.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.160
 - I want a sack of gold coins.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.740
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:40.120
 - How's it going?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.960
 - Good, how are you?

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.480
 - I'm good, I feel we have a lot to talk about.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.000
 - Yeah, I feel like it's been forever.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.360
 And that was a pretty nonchalant little greeting I just said.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.200
 Like, good, how are you?

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.040
 Good, how are you?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.760
 - Oh my God, Adam, it's so great to see you again.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.000
 Well, it has been a couple of weeks

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 because we skipped last week and then,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.440
 'cause we were traveling and then we did,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.080
 and then Sam, it had been a week before.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.360
 - Uh huh, uh huh.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.040
 - People haven't heard you in a while.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.000
 - I know, I bet they missed me.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 Do you think they missed me?

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.200
 - This is not my podcast.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.000
 - It basically is, you have a lot of guests

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.880
 on very interesting conversations.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.800
 I pop in.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.640
 - I have stolen it.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.720
 - I have stolen it, yeah.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.560
 - It's fun, it's okay.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.920
 - It's like a public hearing guest.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.740
 (laughing)

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.280
 - Yes, that's funny.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.920
 There's so much to talk about actually,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.440
 like an insane amount of stuff.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.680
 By the way, I'm gonna, this video,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.880
 like people who watch this on YouTube,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.440
 wanna make it like cartoons or something,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.120
 just to fit the current like theme of,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.120
 not the Ghibli style, 'cause that's overdone

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.800
 and I don't wanna like, I don't know,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.400
 people might feel bad about that.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.200
 Just like some kind of like muppets or cartoons

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.080
 or something, we're gonna be like South Park characters

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.960
 or something, I don't know.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.800
 - I'm down.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.120
 Yeah, I saw some examples of that, it was pretty funny.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.680
 Unfortunately, the examples,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.680
 (laughing)

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.960
 I did see it, so Andries and Horowitz put out

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.120
 an example of like a clip from their podcast

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.560
 that was like Ghibli-ified, Ghibli-ified?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.520
 - I have no idea.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.120
 - Yeah, none of us, all of us white people

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.200
 are here trying to say the name this week.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 Ghibli-blies, video, you know,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.880
 that thing I knew all about before this week.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.120
 - Yeah, and in the clip they picked,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.800
 I was like laughing so hard at it

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.600
 because the person was literally saying nothing.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.160
 It was just like, you know, for B2C businesses,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.400
 like it's not, you might think that you have to really

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.400
 do one thing, but you know, in times like this,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.080
 like you should really like, look at the data

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.720
 and see, maybe you need to do other things, you know?

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.320
 So we're not, we're not like really prescriptive

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.720
 about what, it was just like the most nonsense.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.680
 I was like, I can't believe as a species,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.680
 we produce enough to allocate resources

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.240
 for that person to sit there

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.920
 and then just like, day a bunch of crap.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.680
 I think I'm being, I mostly think I'm picking

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.640
 on this person a lot 'cause I'm pretty sure they're the ones

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.800
 that made that MCP market map.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.240
 - Oh geez, yeah, if I see one more like MCP thread,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.320
 I'm gonna lose my mind.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.720
 - Yeah.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.920
 - Well, there is interesting MCP knows the news though,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.600
 like OpenAI did go, so it's gonna be the same.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.840
 MCP is gonna be the thing, if OpenAI accepted it,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.840
 that's probably like the last straw, right?

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.880
 The protocol has been fixed to--

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.720
 - Oh yeah, they made it worse now.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.520
 - Yeah, yeah, it has all the stuff in it.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.080
 So, and everyone's like jumping on the server side.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.680
 It's funny 'cause me, Jay and Frank have had so many

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.600
 conversations about this thing we're building

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.360
 for OpenControl being like, from every angle we analyze it,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.920
 we're like, this is the opposite of anything we'd ever do.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.160
 And we have so many reasons to not do it,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.120
 but we're gonna do it anyway.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.840
 Like it just seems like a bad idea in so many ways

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.680
 just because-- - The client side of it.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.880
 - Yeah, 'cause I'm like, 'cause like,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.320
 why would we compete with TAD GBT or Anthropic

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.520
 or like these flagship AI products

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.240
 are gonna have millions of users?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.800
 - Yeah, I guess that's who you're competing with.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.920
 Yeah, okay, so on the client side, yeah.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.840
 - It doesn't make any sense.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.480
 But at the same time, we're just like,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.360
 people wanna use this like with their team

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.640
 and set it up and like add their team members and just--

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.040
 - Yeah, it fits great into the OpenControl thing

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.560
 fits great into an SST app, like that's fantastic.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.440
 - Yeah, and even outside of it like,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.600
 'cause the thing that we've been debating about

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.240
 and we are building now is a hosted version,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.880
 so you just sign up and then you can connect your AI account,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.840
 connect whatever with having to do all the SST stuff.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.640
 But yeah, we're just like,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.720
 I don't think chat GBT's gonna build like,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.400
 chat GBT for teams where you can like,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.320
 have different environments and like different tools.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.320
 It's just like, it's such a dumb idea.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.000
 We're just like adding the basic SaaS stuff,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.720
 like teams, environments, permissions to a client.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.680
 But it's like so useful and we want it and everyone wants it.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.720
 - And you guys, you have this great distribution channel

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.640
 into a bunch of actual companies that use SST.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.520
 Like, you kind of have this natural,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.160
 like if it's a thing that every startup would probably

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.400
 wanna use or every legitimate company that uses SST,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.320
 then like, it's a product you should probably build

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.840
 because you got all these customers ready for it.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.120
 - Yeah, and that's like the plus side,

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.600
 but like, we generally are pretty extreme

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.360
 when deciding on what to work on.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.960
 We're like, if somebody else should do this,

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.800
 we're not gonna do it.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.800
 Or if somebody else decides to do this

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.440
 and it's obviously gonna be better,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.280
 we're not gonna do it.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.160
 'Cause we're like, yeah, some YC company out there,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.440
 if they just decide, oh, 100% time

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.840
 we're just gonna focus on this thing.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.680
 - Yeah.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.600
 - Yeah, that's gonna be better than what we do

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.800
 'cause it's like a side thing for us.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.360
 So, we like understand that, but at the same time,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.640
 like nobody's doing it for some reason.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.760
 We're just focusing the server side

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.120
 and nobody's on the clients.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.480
 And like, all the clients are still like,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.140
 like we're using it through Cloud Code,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.680
 which is like totally inaccessible for most people.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.640
 Then the next level up is Cloud Desktop.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.820
 And OpenAI also said they're only supporting MCP

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.880
 on OpenAI Desktop.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.800
 And I'm just like, why?

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.600
 Just making a web app, like we're just putting it in the web.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.440
 - Why is there just a host?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.240
 - Yeah, why not just a website?

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.240
 That doesn't make sense.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.320
 - Yeah, well, I think it's 'cause all the MCP servers

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.080
 right now require like a thing to spawn.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.920
 - Local, yeah, why?

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.200
 I still don't understand that either.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.600
 - It's again, just a stupid way

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.880
 that the protocol emerged.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.880
 Like, that's obviously like a temporary thing.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.800
 Eventually, linear is gonna have a slash MCP.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.640
 - Yeah.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.240
 - Linear.com slash MCP, right?

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.600
 - Yeah, the whole thing was so ass backwards.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.000
 Like the fact that the actual thing,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.400
 the MCP server, or I guess the client,

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.600
 what, the thing that had to run,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.240
 like there's this stateful piece,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.200
 it had to run on like a long-lived server

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.560
 'cause I have this long-lived connection.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.120
 That was dumb, which I know you said they fixed.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.800
 But then also that all these things are local

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.800
 and like assumed to be local.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.360
 And then like, oh, this one's a hosted one.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.360
 Why are they all hosted?

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.560
 I don't understand why we were so dumb suddenly.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.200
 It's like we forgot everything about the web

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.160
 and HTTP requests and we were like,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.440
 let's just pull something totally different.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.280
 - Yeah.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.720
 - I get why it makes sense for some things to be local.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.520
 Like obviously like a tool that reads the file

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.360
 of your file system, okay.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.640
 That makes sense protocol and you need to support

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.000
 that kind of thing.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.840
 - Yeah.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.640
 - But like getting someone to be some random person

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.200
 that's not engineered to be like,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.400
 oh yeah, you gotta put in to your settings

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.440
 and cloud, NPX, blah, blah, blah, whatever.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.200
 Oh, by the way, you have to install Node.js.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.680
 Like what the, this is like--

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.960
 - This is not consumer ready.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.880
 - We were coming in from this angle, but yeah.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.520
 I think it'll all end up in the correct place.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.480
 It's just like the ordering is like really random to me.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.320
 - Yeah.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.000
 So I want to pick your brain on this actually.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.120
 Those are some like very crazy convergence

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.040
 that's happening here.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.520
 Like my next task at Samus is I'm trying to automate

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.760
 some of our support stuff 'cause we get a lot of support emails,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.360
 a lot of the same stuff.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.600
 My co-founder has seen open control stuff you've been tweeting.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.720
 Like he follows us on Twitter and he's very excited

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.160
 about doing that stuff with our internal analytics,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.440
 just being able to like ask questions and get answers

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.880
 'cause it's just so much better than like we have

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.880
 like a quick site dashboard that's kind of a pain in the ass.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.720
 - Yeah.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.560
 - So the question I have for you, like my next task is

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.720
 to like do this stuff and I immediately,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.040
 I'm like, great, DAX is doing this.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.960
 I'm just gonna use open control.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.240
 The thing that I don't, like if we want to build agents

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.000
 that aren't just prompted by us, like prompted by events,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.600
 like an incoming email,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.280
 is that a thing that you see open control dipping into

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.080
 or is that a totally different use case?

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.600
 - Yeah, it's funny 'cause it's like, it's even for us,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.200
 it's been so unclear about what is open control

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.360
 'cause initially it was like a way to find tools,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.880
 but that was temporary because you couldn't run this stuff

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.920
 in the Lambda, you know, and we knew that was gonna be temporary.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.360
 You know, MCP fixed it, so eventually, you know,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.160
 tool definition is gonna just be using the MCP SDK.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
 So it turned out, okay, open control is just a client.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.680
 It's just the front end part because for some reason,

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.080
 everyone is like, you have to install desktop app taxes.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.240
 So we have to build client to make it available on web.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.440
 But it's like, what is a client?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.800
 It's just a for loop.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.240
 It's literally just a for loop calling the model

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.080
 and the model has all the magic built in.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.200
 So there's not much for you to do besides to use it correctly

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.920
 and render stuff in an interesting way.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.600
 - I keep her into that 'cause I, you know, it's a for loop

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.040
 but I need to better model that in my head,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.960
 but you can keep going first.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.720
 - Yeah, well, I mean, I think it's worth explaining.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.400
 So I think what was interesting about Cloud Code is

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:20.320
 you give it a task and it like does many, many, many steps.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.560
 Try one thing, if it works, we'll try the next thing,

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.800
 if it doesn't work, it'll like try something else.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.040
 And maybe it's obviously in hindsight,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.720
 but it felt like, oh, Cloud Code is doing,

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.720
 that's like a feature of Cloud Code, you know?

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.440
 That's like, that's a thing of it.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.280
 It's like helping you, it's letting you,

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.280
 it's giving you access to this like multi-step AI capability.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.160
 But it turns out that's not a feature of Cloud Code at all.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.000
 - That's just the model.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.640
 - They do a bunch of like nice UX things.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.400
 Yeah, it's purely just, Cloud Code is just the UX

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.440
 of accessing it in your terminal.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.160
 All it does is take your query, send it to the model remotely.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.880
 The model replies back saying, hey,

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.680
 can you call these tools and give me the result?

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.080
 Cloud Code needs to call the tools,

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.080
 which in this case, you know, read a file,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.040
 run a bash command, whatever.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.040
 Prompt the user to make sure that this is allowed

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.600
 all that like client facing stuff.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.480
 Get the result, send it back to the model,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.840
 then the model replies to the next step.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.400
 Run it, send it back and forth.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.920
 And eventually the model's like, I'm done.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.920
 - Okay, I need to go slower for the people in the back.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.720
 I'm one of the people in the back.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.280
 'Cause I think you have some knowledge

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.320
 that maybe is helping you just like go pretty fast for this.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.680
 So I wanna walk through it from the beginning.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.720
 So, Cloud Code or any of these, I guess,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.160
 Accursor Agent or whatever, it starts with your prompt.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.000
 Like I'm imagining one big like text file

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.360
 or markdown file or something.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.120
 And at the top of it is my prompt.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.280
 It sends that to the model immediately.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.000
 So I'm just saying, starting.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.320
 - Yeah, along with the list of tools that are available.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.640
 - Okay, so it also sends the list of tools.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.800
 Okay, that's interesting.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.880
 'Cause I didn't really understand how MCP works.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.160
 So it sends it to the list of tools,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.320
 which has like some metadata

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.320
 about like the different parameters you can pass in.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.120
 - So they add a tool name, description of what it can do,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.040
 the schema required to call it, yeah.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.920
 - And then the response back on that first call,

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.000
 is it more text or is it like always JSON?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.200
 Is it like how, what is the mechanism

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.040
 that it informs the thing, how to call the tool?

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.600
 - It'll almost always have text.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.600
 So there'll be one part of the response will be the message,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.640
 which is like the text being like,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.440
 "Oh, I'm gonna try this."

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.280
 - Yeah.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.720
 - And then it also contains a list of tool calls

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.360
 it would like to happen.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.560
 - And those are formatted how?

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.720
 - So it conforms the schema you sent up originally.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.600
 So it'll say the name of the tool,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.400
 it'll say, and then it'll give you the exact arguments

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.080
 to pass the tool in the schema that you can train it to.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.520
 - And is this part of the MCP protocol,

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.240
 like that is the definition in terms of those tool calls,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240
 or is that totally different?

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.240
 - No, the MCP spec is just a way to hit a server

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.920
 and be like, "Hey, what tools are available in the server?"

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.680
 And then call those tools.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.200
 - Okay.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.040
 Okay.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.880
 - Okay.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.760
 - So it's actually no different than an open API spec

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.360
 where you hit slash doc

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.680
 and it gives you back everything that's available.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.520
 - Yeah.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.240
 - And then you can call those end points.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.480
 It's no different than that.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.840
 - That's the MCP, okay.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.560
 So, oh no, I'm one of those people.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.640
 I probably tweeted something about MCP during that week

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.240
 and I'm one of those people that doesn't actually know

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.080
 what it is.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.400
 - I think you only made fun of it.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.100
 - Okay, good, perfect.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.600
 I'll just stick to that policy on Twitter.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.440
 Just make fun of that.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.880
 So, okay.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.960
 So after that call, then it's literally like making API calls

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.320
 basically into these tools,

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.400
 whatever that interface is into the tools.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.960
 It's getting the response back, like standard in,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.240
 like what are these tools sitting back in HTTP response?

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.920
 Like what is the response from the tool?

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.200
 - And so now the client's job is to call the tools

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.400
 for the client, the miles that they can call the tools.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.600
 Now the client's job is to call the tools.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.400
 There's a spec in an MCP to be able to call a tool.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.240
 - Okay.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.880
 - So it just hits the MCP server,

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.240
 whether it's through web or whether it's through standard in

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.400
 for like the ones that spawn locally,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.240
 like we talked about,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.080
 it's like kind of stupid that all of them run locally.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.920
 - Yeah.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.160
 - The transport protocol places doesn't matter, right?

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.120
 It's just sending a command to call the tool.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.760
 And the MCP server itself runs a tool.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.000
 So the server's remote, like linear MCP server,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.520
 it might query their database internally

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.880
 and that's in the results back.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.360
 If it's local, it might read a file.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.200
 - Do MCP servers, like when you define an MCP server,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.680
 do you define the response shape as well?

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.520
 - No, no.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.520
 So the MCP server--

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.440
 - Are they always just--

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.400
 - Oh, there's no, nothing in the spec about response shape.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.240
 Because--

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.560
 - It's just text assumed, or could it be binary, like what?

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.400
 - Yeah, it's just text.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.800
 It can literally be JSON, it can be text,

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.560
 it can be like anything and you don't have to define it

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.440
 at all because LMs are super flexible.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.640
 They get a response and then they know what to look at.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.480
 - And that's where I was headed.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.880
 So basically this client makes the tool calls

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.640
 and then just dumps whatever comes back from that tool,

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.880
 whatever it is, into the big file I'm imagining

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.960
 where our problem's at the top.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.920
 So it's just building up this huge file.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.240
 As you go, that's kind of the idea.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.640
 It's what you get the feeling with Cloud Code.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.360
 Like, it's kind of like, it's truncating a lot of stuff.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.240
 It's not maybe formatting it the way it's actually in the file,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.080
 but you kind of get the sense

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.640
 that you're just working through this big, long file.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.920
 And that's where eventually you hit like a context limit,

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.200
 I guess the longer you use one session.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.000
 - Yeah, it's funny 'cause it feels very inefficient.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.920
 Like every single iteration of this,

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.520
 it sends the whole thing back and forth.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.760
 It's not like you create a session

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.160
 and you like append to it.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.120
 I think these APIs probably will evolve to be more like that.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.840
 It's sending the whole context back and forth every time.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.240
 It's just like, it can be pretty large.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.060
 But yeah, that's what it does.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.280
 It sends it, then eventually the model stops.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.120
 At some point it'll respond without any more tool calls.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.560
 And it'll say, there's basically like a stop reason.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.880
 It's like, why do the model stop responding?

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.560
 And for the first few iterations,

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.440
 it'll say stop reason tool call.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.400
 I stopped 'cause I need to call a tool

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.040
 and I need you to call a tool and tell me how to continue.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.920
 And I think there's another status that's like

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.040
 and turn or something, which means like,

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.720
 at this point, I'm done.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.560
 - Yeah.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.280
 - And specifically, anthropics and models,

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.640
 specifically three, seven, it's very per,

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.920
 it has a lot of perseverance.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.200
 That's like the feeling I get, right?

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.600
 So it'll like try back and forth,

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.600
 a loop bunch a bunch of times before giving up,

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.600
 either 'cause it got an answer or like it's like,

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.840
 I'm trying too hard and I'm not getting anywhere.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.960
 It'll give up.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.640
 Other models, most other models rarely do more

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.840
 than one or two steps.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.840
 Like they just give up very quickly.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.720
 I've tested all the, I haven't tested the new Gemini model

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.560
 that came out two days ago,

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.360
 but I've tested all the other ones.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.960
 They give up pretty quickly.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.320
 Almost all of ChatGBT's models give up very quickly.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.320
 Oh, three mini, I think has his capability in it

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.200
 and it's like comparable to Claude, but not as good.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.120
 - Yeah, okay.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.680
 - So yeah, it's just like a capability of the model

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.040
 to know that it can keep trying.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.360
 - Well, they announced three, seven with Claude code,

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.200
 didn't they?

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.040
 I'm realizing now.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.240
 So I, okay, this makes me feel a lot better if,

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.240
 tell me if this, if you think this vibes,

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.960
 if this is true, no cap, for real, for real.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.120
 Just trying to decide if vibes was a way of like saying,

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.920
 it's true and I was like, no, that's no cap,

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.760
 but that's sorry.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.760
 (laughing)

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.320
 So I was feeling like, man, I love Claude code.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.040
 I love being able to use my normal text editor

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.080
 and I love just a CLI interface that interacts

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.920
 with my file system.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.720
 Fantastic.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.560
 My main problem is feeling like the new models come out

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.960
 and you want to try the new model

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.180
 and if you're stuck on the anthropic model.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.640
 But now I kind of feel like maybe,

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.200
 it just doesn't work with other models

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.600
 because like you're saying that they give up too quick

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.480
 and that's why three seven is how you use Claude code.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.320
 Yeah.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.240
 And I had the same feeling

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.440
 because I also want to try different models

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.480
 'cause we're trying to build this thing

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.440
 and we're like, does everyone need to sign up for anthropic?

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.840
 Like can people use super models?

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.920
 So I had to build my own client to even test this

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.760
 to be able to swap out the models.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.960
 Similarly, I think someone should just build

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.240
 a Claude code type interface.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.880
 It should just be an open source thing, right?

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.720
 There should be one.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.560
 Yeah, that's unplugable, right?

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.400
 So these models will get better.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.480
 There will be cheaper models that can,

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.440
 there's some trade off there

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.200
 that will be made that might be a sense for a lot of people.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.320
 The innovation in Claude code is,

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.360
 hey, let's build a terminal UI.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.200
 Yeah.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.280
 That's like, that's innovation, effectively.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.120
 It's not the model.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:30.960
 And it's good.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.960
 They move really fast.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.880
 Like I don't know if you follow the model.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.320
 Yeah, just constant features.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.400
 They did add like a VIM mode

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.520
 'cause one of my big complaints is like,

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.840
 I end up writing the text somewhere else

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.440
 and then coming back in and pasting it

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.240
 because it's just hard without VIM.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.160
 You're just in there in a terminal, you're used to it.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.000
 They added VIM mode.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.680
 It is like missing so many things I use.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.680
 And I'm like, I turned it off too.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.680
 It's totally useless to me.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.680
 Yeah.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.320
 Like, I don't even, I'm not smart enough

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.480
 to know like what's classic VIM versus what's some,

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.960
 like key map I have in Neo VIM that's not normal.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.280
 It's like, I just, I realized it's very hard

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.920
 for anybody to ever add VIM support

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.200
 that I'm gonna actually use.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.320
 You should just open up VIM inside.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.440
 Could they do that?

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.680
 Oh, just inside the tube?

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.120
 By multiplexing, which you know,

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.120
 I'm one of the world's experts in it.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.960
 Oh, you are a multiplexer expert.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.800
 It's true.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.680
 There's room for a tool where it's like half of it,

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.960
 it's like a VIM editor.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.880
 And then, yeah, or like, you know,

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.680
 you can turn off the mode if you're accessible.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.680
 And that would be nice.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.240
 'Cause you write, you're writing a lot.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.960
 And you can imagine if the model just keeps getting better.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.600
 Let's say cloud four comes out and it's like,

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.920
 oh my God, this thing's better than me.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.480
 You can imagine we're gonna spend more and more time

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.320
 just writing prompts like this.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.160
 I know.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.000
 I hate to even say that a lot.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.720
 I feel like a prompt guy or like a prompt engineer truser.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.120
 I just always made fun of those people.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.520
 But you can imagine like, I would be typing more in cloud code

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.720
 than I type in my actual editor.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.040
 And when that happens, I'm gonna need it to be good.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.840
 I'm gonna need to be able to fling some text around.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.760
 - Yeah, it's weird that typing speed

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.280
 is suddenly back.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.160
 Back is a factor that matters, you know?

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.440
 - I'm typing out a lot of sentences lately.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.680
 - Yeah, it's, I mean, that you get better results

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.480
 at least this current version with three seven.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.160
 Like you do get a lot better results

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.080
 when you type out a whole lot of detail.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:07.960
 And it saves time still.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.640
 It's kind of like, well, if I'm gonna write out

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.880
 all this explanation, why not just do it?

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.440
 But it's like, no, this would be a really annoying task to do.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.600
 And it's much easier to write out a paragraph

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.720
 and a bullet list, like, I'd rather do that than do the task.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.760
 So, yeah.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.760
 - I think the other thing I found is,

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.760
 man, does it benefit from like mature code bases

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.840
 with patterns?

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.000
 Like, the terminal code base is very simple.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.920
 And we're like, we've been pretty good about,

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.760
 it's like a pretty clean code.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.040
 It's like, probably one of the cleaner code bases

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.120
 that I work on.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.960
 - Yeah.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.280
 - And cloud is so effective in there

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.600
 'cause it just knows it's like so good.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.160
 - It's so good, yeah.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.880
 And then in older code bases, not so much.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.720
 - Yeah, not so much.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.120
 'Cause there's like older patterns

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.200
 that you don't want it doing anymore

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.040
 or like, it's like stuff that you don't use anymore

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.440
 that it starts to like build on top of.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:57.120
 So, yeah, weirdly, it's all the same things as stuff

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.320
 that would help with junior engineer.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.600
 Like a really clean code base helps the junior engineer a lot.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.240
 It's an exact same situation.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.720
 And I found that there's some of the me and Lizz are working on.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.120
 I realized that we should change

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.560
 some of where we land on UI patterns

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.840
 because putting a little bit more effort

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.920
 into making more consistent UI patterns,

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.200
 more composable UI patterns.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.920
 If you have that in place, like cloud is so good

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.960
 at just building new features.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.840
 Like there's so many feature requests I see

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.840
 for that C console where I'm like,

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.880
 if that C console was like 30 or 40% better,

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.680
 like in terms of stuff we need to clean up,

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.920
 this is just like a single message I send to cloud

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.800
 and the whole feature would have gotten built.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.360
 So, my motivation to fix tech debt

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.540
 is a lot higher now.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.480
 - Yes, that's exactly how I feel at my day job.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.760
 It's that means like we wanna,

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.920
 I just wanna aggressively, using these tools even,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.840
 make the code base modern, use all the same kind of patterns.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.280
 Like a lot of the stuff we do with terminal.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.720
 I just want it to be as effective in that code base

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.040
 'cause it's not when it's kind of,

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.480
 when you let things go or it's just older patterns

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.960
 that you're trying to move away from

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.280
 and you're half migrated.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.480
 Like that kind of stuff is just a nightmare.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.240
 But yeah, I've noticed that as well.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.440
 Terminal code base, it does a really good job.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.280
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.160
 Like in the console code base,

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.920
 we're like halfway between two databases

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.800
 because we're moving to Postgres.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.360
 And like, yeah, it just gets confused.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.120
 Or like it starts, I'd like tell it to,

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.200
 oh, like make sure you update both

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.040
 and make sure you sync the data.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.440
 But it's just like a lot more work for it.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.800
 - Yep, yep.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.680
 - Yeah, so I'm pretty excited about that.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.360
 The other thing from this week is,

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.840
 'cause I think this whole episode's gonna be AI related.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.680
 - Yeah.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.520
 - Azure.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.280
 - Everything from here on out, we should just rebrand.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.960
 - All of my thoughts, all of my thoughts,

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.600
 every single day I've just been about AI.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.640
 I don't think I've, it's crazy.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.840
 - I mean, all of my thoughts about work,

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.840
 I do have other thoughts, Casey, in life.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.360
 But like work related thoughts, it's AI.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.960
 I mean, really, like, it's just,

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.360
 it's not gonna get any slower.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.240
 Things are just gonna keep happening faster.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.360
 It feels so cool to be able to watch it all unfold.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.280
 Like, you just know there's another frontier model coming

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.960
 and you need every couple of weeks.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.040
 Like, there's all these companies competing.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.920
 It's just like seeing the steps up

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.160
 and then something big will happen.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.920
 Even like, after all the, what, two years of AI hype

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.960
 and things been going on, has it been two years?

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.600
 I don't know, when was Chad JBT first out?

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.040
 That was kind of the big first moment.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.760
 My point is, after all that time, whatever it's been,

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.960
 then you have a moment like this week

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.160
 where this image model comes out

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.000
 and it's like still blowing us all away

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.840
 and it feels like the original Chad JBT moment.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.680
 Like, this is crazy.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.600
 - Yeah.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.440
 - It's nuts.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.280
 It's very exciting.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.120
 It's pretty fun.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.440
 But the reason I was saying all this is because,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.800
 I knew some of my posts today.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.040
 Me, then you, then Prime,

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.040
 just all three was independently poked-replet.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.880
 - Oh, really?

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.720
 I didn't see Prime did.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.720
 I knew you had before.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.840
 - So, like a few weeks ago,

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.720
 I posted something about how competitive

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.640
 the V zero bolt lovable category of product is.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.040
 There's like so much competition there and it's like,

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:04.880
 it's really intense.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.520
 And I was commenting on that.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.920
 And a bunch of people replied being like,

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.200
 oh, like an also a replet.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.520
 And I thought about it and I was like,

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.000
 you know, I've only ever heard replet

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.760
 being mentioned by VCs, really?

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.800
 And I posted that.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.560
 I just, you know, the same thing.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.880
 I'm like, this is really just a fact about myself.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.960
 Like, it's just not the major.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.360
 - Yeah, I didn't say any negative.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.640
 Like, I didn't even say any negative.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.160
 I just said, I don't.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.640
 I don't know a single person that uses it.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.800
 And I hear about it too much on Twitter

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.560
 from like the founder to not know anybody that's ever used it.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.240
 I literally hardly know what it is.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.200
 I guess I know it's in that category.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.800
 It helps you with the cursor kind of, maybe.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.640
 I don't know.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.800
 - It's, it's, so I posted that then.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.200
 And to be fair, like I knew it was like,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.280
 obviously it's provocative.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.120
 I'm not gonna be.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.480
 - Yeah, I mean, it's better.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.840
 That's what we do. - I'm not gonna be that.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.920
 Yeah, I'm not gonna say it's not.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.360
 And I know the CEO's like a hothead.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.280
 So he--

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.400
 - I did not know this.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.720
 He quote tweeted me being like, is this Hader, like fellas?

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.720
 Is this Hader correct?

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.720
 Prove him wrong or something like that.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.560
 And then, you know, what people were applying being like,

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.080
 I use Replet and I love it.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.280
 I'm a big fan of Replet.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.400
 Like I use Replet every day for blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.440
 - You picked the profile VC.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.280
 No joke.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.120
 I did that.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.240
 I went to his page and I was like, man, am I just missing it?

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.160
 Like, are these people?

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.640
 Cause he kind of replied to me and it was whatever.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.880
 I actually don't really understand what he was saying to me.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.520
 He said, I just said, I don't know a single person

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.360
 that uses Replet.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.360
 And his answer was like, let's keep it that way.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.200
 - I'll just keep that way.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.680
 - And if I don't actually know what that means, like--

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.040
 - I think he's like, I don't even want you knowing

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:38.880
 about Replet.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.240
 - Like he doesn't want me as a customer.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.800
 Okay, it's like, let's keep it where I still don't know

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.240
 any single person that uses Replet.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.320
 That sounds like a bad deal for your business.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.880
 You should probably want me to know some people that use it.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.600
 I went to his page and I was like trying to see, you know,

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.480
 people that praise Replet, cause it retweets them.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.120
 And two of them were actually VCs.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.280
 And I just think that's really funny.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.320
 (laughing)

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.160
 - Yeah, it's true.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.080
 It's just like a VC thing.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.400
 Well, I mean, they're also like,

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.520
 they raised that like a 1.2 billion valuation

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.160
 during like peak, crazy time was like,

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.080
 one Saudi money was just everywhere.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:14.920
 - Yeah.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.400
 - I think they had like $3 million ARR at that point.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.480
 I didn't seeing like the level--

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.320
 - The people use it.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.160
 - Yeah, people use it.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.000
 Like it's used.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.840
 It's like, a bunch of people use it.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.680
 It's true.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.800
 But at the same time, it's a place you go

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.040
 and you get free compute.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.880
 So it's like, what does usage even mean?

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.480
 Like they're just giving away free compute.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.320
 - Yeah.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.000
 - And like, of course, they've done some interesting things

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.840
 in the product too.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.320
 I looked more into it.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.440
 But again, it's just funny that despite all that,

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.160
 you are competing with V zero, lovable bolt.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.120
 And I like, just don't give you guys

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.760
 mentioned as much in relation.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.600
 - Yeah.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.920
 - That was my point, right?

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.760
 - Mm-hmm.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.800
 - But of course, a bunch of people,

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.840
 and one specific reply was like,

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.040
 oh, these people don't like replying to the CEO

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.800
 kind of supporting him being like,

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.600
 oh, he doesn't get it referring to me.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.120
 People don't realize that like,

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.720
 this is one of those posts that's like,

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.680
 oh, people haven't realized how good AI is.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.520
 And I'm just like--

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.200
 - I hate that, I hate that so much.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.640
 - It's just like, you fucking moron.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.880
 I am looking at this stuff as much as you are.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.720
 - Yeah.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.560
 - It's not more.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.320
 I'm probably doing more than you are in this space.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.160
 - Uh-huh.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.240
 - Anyone that, it's just like, people are so excited

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.440
 to be like, hey, I know something.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.560
 They assume that anyone having any kind

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.720
 of slightly opposite take is like,

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.720
 totally cool as in loss and can't do the future

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.560
 while they can.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.400
 - Uh-huh.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.440
 - And it's like, it's just so annoying.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.440
 I find that so annoying.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.480
 - You brought this up before,

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.200
 and now I've had this experience as well,

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.800
 where the people will also assume,

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.120
 you're like this like 15 year software engineer.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.840
 I care about code quality.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.120
 That's all I care about.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.880
 You're just making bad code, and I make good code.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.240
 Like if you've ever looked at anything I've contributed

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.760
 to open source or on the public internet,

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.320
 I do not care about code quality.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.160
 (laughing)

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.160
 It's not even a little bit.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.160
 So please, don't label me as a non AI,

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.080
 like AI hater that just cares about the quality of code

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.720
 for the quality of code sake.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.000
 Like I don't care about products or making money, just code.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.840
 That's the people, they label us as that.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.520
 - Yeah, they figure out the most stupid,

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.920
 like exaggeration of the opposite side,

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.560
 and they like pop you under it just so,

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.840
 'cause like yeah, you don't have any intelligent thoughts,

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.680
 so you can only win the argument

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.440
 if you make the opposite side look stupid.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.200
 What's so funny about what you just said

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.520
 is think about the first half of our conversation.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.200
 We're in super deep trying to like make,

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.480
 to get the most out of these LMs,

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.120
 and we've discovered that code quality actually

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.760
 don't matter, like turns out like,

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.600
 yeah the LMs are formed better when you're more organized,

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.480
 and we're now trying to be even more organized

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.920
 than we were when we were like not using AI.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.880
 - Yeah, that's a good point.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.520
 - This is a kind of like counterintuitive thing

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.560
 that shows up when you're actually doing stuff

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.880
 versus just being some person being like,

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.200
 I know the future and nobody else does,

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.320
 but you're not actually doing anything.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.560
 - If they're gonna bucket us like that, let's bucket them.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.280
 They're just these like.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.280
 - Unemployed.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.840
 - Unemployed, no life, like big idea guys.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.920
 And is that how you get big idea guys?

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.920
 - They don't even have big ideas.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.160
 - They think they have big ideas,

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.400
 and that they've just been screwed.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.320
 - You know what they are?

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.160
 - What?

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.240
 - Sports fans, they're huge fans, they're giant fans.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.360
 But they have literally have never even touched a ball.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.200
 - Yes.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.720
 - And they think that if they are big enough fans

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.640
 of a pro athlete, they're effectively

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.040
 like the same as a pro athlete.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.000
 - Yes, they're lumped in there

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.560
 with the successes of their team that they cheer on.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.760
 That's a good call.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.800
 - That's what it feels like to me.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.960
 - I don't know why there's this group of people

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.080
 that seem to think like they're in the select few.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.760
 They're the chosen ones that will be,

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.640
 they'll make it in the AI future.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.920
 And all you software developers that we've paid so much

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.120
 for so long, you're all going to burn.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.240
 Why, I don't know why that's so attractive

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.080
 to this group of people,

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.240
 but they really think somehow they're going to be spared.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.400
 Like they're going to have this amazing life

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.560
 where they live with the benefits of AI.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.400
 - Yeah, I don't get it.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.640
 - I'm developers, not those guys.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.000
 - If I, this is like so far from the truth,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.840
 but if I'm somehow pushed out of a space that I'm in,

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.120
 I'm going to enter your space.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.120
 Like that's just what's going to happen.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.600
 - Perfect. And that's not going to be good for you.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.160
 - Yeah. Okay. Okay, I'm done.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.560
 I'm, let's just get that part of it out of our system

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.080
 and we're going to move on.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.000
 - Yeah. Yeah. Pete Bergford messaged me today

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.400
 and he had a funny observation and he's like,

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.080
 "Man, bad week for CEOs on Twitter."

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.360
 It's just like, "Oh wait, what else?"

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.200
 Maybe I'm forgetting.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.920
 - The whole Guillermo seat with CloudFlare,

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.760
 that whole thing.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.600
 - Oh, that was fun.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.680
 - I made a song out of Guillermo's first.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.520
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.080
 - How good is that?

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.200
 - That was really good.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.400
 There's a huge try to use your product.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.000
 (laughing)

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 - They really went at it.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.360
 That was some like no holding back kind of exchange

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.440
 from like pretty big figures.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.000
 That was surprising.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.720
 - CloudFlare's had to help back a lot.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.240
 The CloudFlare's helped back a while.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.960
 No, I mean, Guillermo was taking a lot

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.240
 direct shots of CloudFlare and CloudFlare's always like,

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.560
 been like, "Well, we're the bigger ones

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.920
 so we can't say anything."

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.760
 And this time around, they went the other way.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.600
 - Yeah.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.240
 - We haven't done episodes since the vulnerability, right?

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.080
 - The big.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.000
 - No, I don't think we have, yeah.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.640
 I mean, I wrote like my big summary on it.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.480
 I just think it was a game.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.320
 - Oh, okay.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.160
 Yeah, we can just not.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.720
 - Yeah, another situation where everybody involved

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.080
 is just being annoying, both sides.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.840
 - Both sides, that's so many of the arguments.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.560
 I just feel like I really just like both sides.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.400
 I don't know where that puts me.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.840
 - All these people being like,

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.360
 how could Guillermo not apologize to me

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.560
 (laughing)

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.560
 after this vulnerability, they handled it so badly.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.320
 - And I deserve an apology.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.600
 Where is he?

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.960
 Where is he?

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.120
 It's been 24 hours and we still haven't heard.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.680
 And then he eventually did apologize.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.040
 He goes like, "Oh, we missed the mark."

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:53.880
 Guys, we missed the mark.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.720
 We're so sorry.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.840
 - Yeah, when they probably do apologize.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.840
 We're not happy still.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.040
 We're just never gonna be happy.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.560
 Maybe we just don't like people to act.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.760
 Is it possible we just don't like people?

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.600
 'Cause--

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.600
 - For us, me and you.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.000
 - Yeah, I just think I don't like a lot of people.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 I definitely, I think I have tried hard in my life

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.520
 to be someone that, and am I not seeing this way,

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.120
 but to be someone that--

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:16.960
 - I never just said it.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.440
 - Is it someone that's like, everyone sucks?

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.560
 I'm better than everyone.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.360
 Like, I'm trying to be reasonable.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.680
 - It's so hard, yeah.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.160
 And nowadays I'm like, you know what?

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.200
 I'm just better than all of you.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.600
 Like, I am better than most of you people.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.600
 Like, you suck.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.160
 All of you guys suck.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.280
 That is me, me and my friends.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.360
 We're all better than you guys.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.920
 (laughing)

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.200
 - Oh man, we're doing something.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.160
 Something, some psychologist is listening to this

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.560
 and they're like, classic, whatever the phrase is.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.600
 You probably know it.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.400
 You always know like the syndromes and the--

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.280
 - Classic, being right-itis.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.040
 - Being right, okay.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.200
 Well, I'll take it.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.240
 What up, man, there's actually so many things going on.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.400
 We're gonna have to limit which things we can talk about,

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.800
 which is unfortunate.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.600
 - I don't remember anything else, to be honest.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.720
 - Oh, okay.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.160
 Well, I mean, the terminal stuff,

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.400
 we just did a launch week.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.240
 - Yeah.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.080
 - Launch weeks?

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:03.920
 - Yeah.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.760
 - Turns out.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.880
 So we were making fun of launch weeks.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.680
 I mean, the whole thing was like,

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.080
 we're mocking a launch week.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.360
 And then I couldn't help but get a little pissed

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.840
 when it didn't get that much traction.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.680
 I'm like, come on!

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.520
 - Come on!

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.000
 - I ended our fake launch week.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.880
 - Oh, wait, wait, Adam, but I have the best news.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.880
 I have the best news.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.760
 - Ooh, okay.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.520
 - Do you know who else did a launch week this week?

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.360
 - Wait, who?

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.200
 I don't.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.040
 - Exactly.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.680
 You don't know who else did a launch week this week, right?

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.520
 - Did someone else do what?

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.800
 - Someone else did a launch week this week.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.880
 And it didn't even worse than ours.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.880
 - Oh, well, who was it?

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.880
 That'll make me feel so much better.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.040
 I'm gonna look at every one of their posts.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.720
 - It's gonna make you uncomfortable, I think.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.960
 - Oh no, is it somebody I'm friendly with?

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.440
 Damn it, I actually always do this.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.120
 (laughing)

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.240
 - I've lost friends over this part of this launch week.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.680
 - I do always do this, it was recent.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.640
 - What was recent?

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.000
 - Recent, it was recent.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.440
 - Oh, recent, oh no, it's okay, that's the one.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.320
 Okay, so I just keep losing the friendship

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.320
 of someone I wasn't really friends with.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.760
 They stopped following me on Twitter

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.480
 and I still use Dracula and it just bothers me.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.640
 - That's not using Dracula.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.240
 Yeah, so recent had a launch week this week as well.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.080
 - That's so funny.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.160
 - And I was looking at, I saw their posts today

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.480
 about something and I was like,

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.920
 this didn't even worse than ours.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.040
 - Hey, that's so good, I'm so glad.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.880
 I mean, not for them, I feel bad for them,

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.200
 but at least I don't feel quite as miserable

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.080
 about how bad launch weeks are.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.120
 Well, it's not even like, like, oh, it's so bad.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.000
 It was just like, we could tweet something random

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.160
 in between the launch week posts

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.200
 and it would blow up and like do great.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.840
 It was just like, people just do not wanna hear

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.960
 that launch week.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.280
 - Yeah, by comparison, it was much worse.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.400
 Yeah, it's just like, I think I've known

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.800
 for a long time that launch weeks are bad because,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.160
 and maybe at some time they were good,

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.760
 but just people's attention spans

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.240
 and like the way the internet works now,

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:50.240
 like you need like punchy, like hyper-relevant stuff.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.040
 That's like straight to the point,

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.880
 you consume it very quickly.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.320
 And the launch weeks are just so slow.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.400
 They're so slow and like, it's very hard

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.240
 to grab your attention.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.760
 - You're dragging 30 minutes of news out over a week.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.680
 So of course it's so good, it has to be.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.760
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.360
 - Yeah, it's just like, it's also just like too much

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.120
 navel gazing or something, like too much like,

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.000
 we did things, look at us, like something on the back.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.800
 - Exactly, I mean, we were doing it as a parody,

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.320
 so it was fine.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.440
 - We have a past for everything we do 'cause it's all fake.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.240
 - It's all fake, yeah.

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.600
 Yeah, it's just funny that like, I don't know,

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.440
 so I mean, okay, so to, and we talked about this already,

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.400
 but we actually didn't like intend to do a launch week.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.280
 We just had way too many half-starter projects

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.240
 and we needed to force them all out.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.600
 We can go back to focusing on one thing

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.560
 at a time, which I really want to do.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.400
 - Yeah.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.240
 - Moving forward.

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.480
 - As long as it's the one thing I want to do,

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.880
 then yes, I agree.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.720
 - Do one thing.

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.560
 - Yes.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.960
 - Do one thing at a time.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.040
 - So that's why it was like an excuse to get that out.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.000
 And then this whole thing where,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.520
 I can't figure out how to articulate it.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.200
 So there's something so funny about us doing it

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.920
 because we think companies are stupid for doing it.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.000
 And then we just so deeply experienced

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.760
 the stupidity personally of it.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.560
 It's a point where I felt bad about the launch week,

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.600
 but I'm like, no, this is a joke.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.680
 It wasn't supposed to work.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.520
 - I know.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.360
 It's so stupid.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.800
 - And also our sales were like incredible for me.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.600
 So like the end thing did work.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.640
 It's just weird by comparison where we post a stupid tweet

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.800
 and it gets like five exit impressions

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.280
 as anything on our launch week.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.320
 - It really was a lesson for all of you out there.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.280
 If you have a startup,

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.720
 just maybe don't do launch weeks anymore.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.920
 Let's just make it the new trend

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.000
 where we just do like a day, a single day, a launch day

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.480
 and just pack it all into that one day,

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.520
 make it really punchy,

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.560
 make a really cool video

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.360
 where there's stuff exploding or something.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.840
 No, whatever the kids need

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.040
 to get their brains engaged on Twitter anymore.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:39.880
 Just do that.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.080
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:41.920
 - We learned the lesson.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.320
 - I'm looking forward to finally,

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.160
 I mean, it feels good.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.040
 There's a clear all that stuff hanging over heads.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:46.880
 - Yeah, for real.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.800
 - Like ask extension, the Europe stuff.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.840
 But now we can just focus on just the next thing coming up,

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.600
 which is react Miami.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.600
 And I'm making sure that's really good.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.440
 - Yeah, I feel like I'm so exhausted and just like--

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.280
 - Yeah, it's like a lot to do there.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.640
 - Yeah, it's real slow.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.960
 - I don't think there's so much to do.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.800
 - Oh, good.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.360
 - I mean, I'm always, but that statement

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.360
 is basically always wrong.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.720
 So maybe I shouldn't say it.

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.880
 - Yeah, it really is.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.840
 - Yeah, so I guess I'm breaking this to you on the podcast.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.680
 Why not?

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.920
 I'm gonna come.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.840
 I can't be there for seven days.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.680
 - I'm sorry.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.520
 - That's fine, yeah.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.600
 - Okay, it's difficult to pick the days,

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.360
 like how, what stretch is the most important stretch?

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.640
 - Do the first half, I think.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.800
 - That's what I think, yeah.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.000
 So I'll be there for the Monday and Tuesday activities,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.720
 which are, I think, the most important.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.720
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.440
 - So I'll come Sunday and then I'll, yeah.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.280
 Okay, so I'm gonna miss, like, the conference,

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.000
 (laughing)

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.160
 which I'm fine with.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.800
 I mean, Michelle, that's a great job.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.960
 Conferences are cool.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.200
 - I need to meet you, basically.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.040
 - It doesn't need me.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:45.880
 There's nothing there that like--

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.720
 - The conference does not need you.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.560
 - Needs me and my family needs me.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.080
 So anyway, yeah, that's gonna be

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.760
 just a little breaking news for you there.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.960
 - I think what I really liked about,

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.120
 I mean, the other thing I was gonna do this week

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.240
 is prime siege and all those people were locked in a tower

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.560
 in terminal tower, so in their game.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.120
 - 24/7 streams.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.400
 - Yeah, and I think what was really good,

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.440
 which I didn't really understand going into it,

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.920
 was those recap videos they do every day.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.000
 - Where are you seeing those?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:10.840
 I didn't see them.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.920
 - They're on YouTube, they're on primes YouTube.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.640
 And they're so funny.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.480
 They're really funny.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.000
 They're a little bit too long for me,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.040
 but-- - Yeah, I saw you complimenting them.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.120
 - I burst out laughing a bunch of times, yeah.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.600
 - And I just had to not smile

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.520
 'cause I did not actually know what you were talking about.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.480
 - Yeah, yeah, so they do these recaps,

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.240
 which is all like behind the scenes footage,

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.360
 cut together, and they do like the reality show,

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.960
 like a confessional thing,

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.000
 where they're like talking to the camera.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.920
 - Are they shorts?

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.120
 - It's just one long video.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.280
 It's like, back to back, like short clips.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.520
 - Primes other channel.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.520
 - And I'm like, we need to do that for React Miami,

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.760
 where we have cameras on us the whole time, basically.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.160
 And, you know, we're just capturing

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.560
 like all the stupid stuff we could do.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.680
 - How are we gonna do that?

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.680
 We need somebody like doing that.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.520
 - He's gonna do that.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.800
 So I'm gonna talk to Began this week,

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.720
 'cause he basically figured that out for them.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.720
 - And we have like, we have some people coming already,

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.720
 it's gonna, they're gonna help us with that,

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.680
 but we might just hire someone full time.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.240
 The, the super based people linked me

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.120
 to the guy that they're using,

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.920
 and he is really cheap.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:16.640
 So I'm gonna see if that's like an option, huh?

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.160
 - What is it, the prime time agent?

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.520
 What, what is this other YouTube channel?

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.280
 - The prime time. - It's the prime time agent.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.320
 Oh, wow, his, the prime time agent channel

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.360
 is way bigger than his original channel.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.000
 It's just called the prime,

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.320
 oh, it's called the prime time agent, you're right.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.280
 - The prime time agent, but it's the prime time.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.520
 - The prime is the name.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.360
 - Oh my God.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.800
 I didn't know he was getting close to a million

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.640
 on that channel.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.800
 Like, I thought the other one was so bigger,

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.480
 but that was probably the information from years ago

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.320
 in my head.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.920
 - So what I wanna do is to treat React Miami

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.160
 as a way to kickstart our YouTube.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.960
 So if we just make these daily things like this,

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.880
 and we post them just on our YouTube and nowhere else,

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.760
 that'll help us at least start to build up

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.960
 some kind of audience.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.800
 - Yeah.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.600
 - But yeah.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.280
 - It was like little blooper type things.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.640
 There was a line that Ben delivered from Crazam,

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.080
 Ben and Crazam.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.520
 He goes, they're making, they ask me if he's lefty.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.280
 And he's like, what, no, I'm not lefty.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.920
 Like, while they're, like, while they're working.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.760
 - Yeah.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.520
 - And it's like kind of funny interaction.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.720
 And then it cuts to him.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.440
 It cuts to him, like in a different room,

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.960
 like talking to camera, being like, I'm not lefty.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.840
 I just like to ride the mouse goofy.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.760
 (laughing)

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.280
 I found out the way he delivered it was so funny.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.040
 - Oh, that's funny.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.560
 Like a skateboarder.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.000
 - He's like funny hand gesture.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.320
 And he's like, he's like naturally like so funny.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.320
 - He's so funny.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.680
 I love that guy.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.520
 - Yeah.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.360
 So just stuff like that.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.040
 - He's gonna be, he's gonna be in Miami, right?

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:39.880
 - Yep.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:40.720
 He's gonna be staying with us.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.560
 - Yeah.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.880
 - So yeah, I think there's just a lot of opportunity

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.720
 for hilarious stuff.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.560
 And all of it just needs to be captured and cut up

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.880
 and uploaded. - Yes.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.120
 - And I think it'll do really well.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.040
 - We really need to hire some, we're looking to hire.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.760
 If you're a podcast listener and you're below the age of,

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.880
 I'm sorry, this is discriminatory.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.880
 But if you're below the age of like 28.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.880
 Is that if you have the energy in the sense of theory?

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.720
 - Energy, okay.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.400
 - And the, you know, someone that typically would be

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.520
 considered a Zoomer.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.760
 - Yeah, you know, you're right.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.600
 It doesn't matter.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.680
 You're 50 years old, but you have like internet native

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.800
 personality and you have media skills

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.480
 and social media skills, video editing skills.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.680
 If you have all of that, please reach out.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.200
 - Yeah, no friends in real life.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.040
 - If all you do is go on the internet and make jokes.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:22.920
 - Yeah.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.600
 - That you're our guy or girl.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.360
 - Yeah, we're looking to hire someone or some work.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:31.000
 - Yes, just reach out jobs at tomorrow at Zoom.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.840
 - Terminal dot shop.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.680
 - Terminal dot shop, something.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.320
 Just DMS, find a way.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.240
 Life finds a way.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.080
 If you're really serious.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.640
 - You're on the internet, you can figure it out.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.120
 Wait a minute, are we recording?

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:42.960
 - Yeah, we've been recording.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.800
 - Okay, the button looks different.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.960
 I think Riverside changed the button

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.760
 and that just terrified me.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.360
 Like, I'm not gonna spend 30 minutes talking to Dax

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.480
 if it's not content.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.520
 - Well, that's kind of what I'm saying.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.360
 Like, if we're gonna spend seven days together,

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.200
 we might as well.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.040
 - We might as well.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.160
 - Yeah, it really does.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.680
 Okay, is there not other stuff coming on?

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.000
 I feel like there's more stuff.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.120
 I feel like the AI stuff,

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.640
 there's just, we didn't really talk about the image model.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.520
 How much you've played with it?

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.400
 What are your thoughts on?

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:15.800
 It's another example of the zeitgeist being so intense.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.360
 Every time something catches fire now,

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.480
 it's like literally every post on Twitter.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.720
 It's nuts.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.480
 But what are your thoughts on the new image thing?

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.560
 - I think, I posted something today that I,

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.880
 I think it helped me clarify a feeling really intensely,

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.720
 which was kind of cool.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:35.600
 So I saw a bunch of posts being like,

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.440
 by the way, I hate these.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.640
 I was advocating for the death penalty

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.240
 for people that post like this.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.520
 They were like, it's so over, we're cooked.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.000
 Like graphic designers are cooked.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 They don't even know what's coming.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:46.840
 - Oh, right.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.680
 - A bunch of those threads,

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.040
 the showing like, hey, product photography,

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.200
 and they were able to like, make a model holding in.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.600
 And like, look like professional-ish photography.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.840
 I don't really have an eye for it,

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.240
 so I don't know if it actually did.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.000
 They're talking about how graphic designers are like,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.240
 or designers in general should be threatened by this model.

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.440
 So I started playing with it for some UI stuff.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.440
 And I did some, it was pretty interesting.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.920
 So I like, gave it an image of something that I liked,

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.080
 like the vibe of something that I liked.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.560
 And I was like, hey, create a paragraph.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.080
 Or even before I did that, I was just like,

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.360
 hey, based off of this, like,

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.640
 show me what a UI kit based off of this vibe would look like.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.080
 I put a button, a dialogue, check boxes.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:25.920
 - Yeah.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:26.760
 - And like, drew something that was

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.920
 kind of interesting, like not incredible,

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.720
 but like, you know, it was, it did match it.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.680
 Then I tried saying, hey, describe the vibe

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.200
 that this image captures in like a paragraph

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.840
 that describes me in detail.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.160
 And it did a really good job with that.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.520
 And I iterated and I was like, okay,

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.040
 strip all color information, strip all specifics.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.440
 And it gave me like a really good description

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.080
 of what I liked about this image

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.800
 that I couldn't really articulate myself.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.280
 And then I would use that as a prompt

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.160
 to generate other stuff in that same style,

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.960
 which again was like interesting,

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.480
 like better than stuff that I'd seen before.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.520
 Definitely helps me play with ideas I have on my own.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.040
 But then at the end, I was like, you know what?

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.760
 I just still want to hire a designer.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.320
 I just want to hire a designer

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.080
 that is just better than me at this stuff.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.280
 And I only have so much creative energy in a day.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.680
 There's so much to do, so many things that I'm trying to do.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.240
 Someone is better than me at this.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.280
 I just want to continue to pay them to do this.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.480
 And their tools might change their process change and whatever.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:24.440
 But that crown page that David did, which looks amazing.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.520
 - So good.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.560
 - Incorporated a bunch of AI generated imagery into it

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.000
 mixed with the traditional skills.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.240
 Also, the ability just to prompt that image

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.080
 into existence is better than mine.

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:39.720
 - Yeah, that page really to me is an example of like,

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.680
 AI is not doing this.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.360
 It also can't do the Devs side, just so you know.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.960
 I mean, like there's, I tried.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.400
 There's pieces of it that could get right,

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.040
 but like getting those lines in the word cron

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.800
 in the background on desktop, unbelievably hard.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.240
 The number of layers of tricks,

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.640
 because you don't have like native,

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.120
 you can't do those like inner shadows on text natively in CSS.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.120
 So there's like a lot of tricks being done to implement it.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.080
 But the design itself, like that's just an example of like,

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.560
 if you don't have David's brain,

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.040
 you're not making that like not that quality.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.560
 - Yep, like I, this tool gave me 10x ability

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.800
 that I had before is still like a thousand x away

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.520
 from anything that he can do.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.200
 And I was like, okay, that's interesting

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.480
 because I wonder if people feel that way

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.960
 about software engineers, where they're like,

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.440
 oh, cool, this helps me get further

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.440
 and like try stuff out before I even go to the person

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.520
 that's good at this, which is useful and valuable.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.240
 But ultimately like, I just felt the desire

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.080
 to continue to hire for this.

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.480
 Like I still, I'm so designed but like bottlenecks

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.080
 with so much stuff I want to do.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.000
 I have to always a bottleneck.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.320
 And despite that, the AI thing is still not

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.440
 making a huge difference for me.

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.480
 Like I just still need a person that's good at it

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.400
 to hit the bar that I'd like to clear.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.240
 - No, I hear you.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.080
 I don't think of it.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.800
 Yeah, I wasn't thinking in terms of design.

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.120
 I think it's more like,

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.760
 there's a few things that are asking to me.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:08.640
 Like memes and media, just the quality of them increasing.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.120
 Like the ability to be more creative.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.520
 Seeing like when people, early on,

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.320
 people are turning like the president

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.160
 and the vice president and Zelensky in the room,

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.680
 turning them into like South Park characters or Muppets.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:23.560
 It's just funny.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.800
 Like I enjoy that it can do that kind of thing.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.560
 I know that's like one off anecdotal

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.760
 and it's flashing the pan.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.200
 Maybe it's just the moment on Twitter that was funny.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.160
 But it does feel like it raised this like possibility

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.040
 of being more creative in the way we express things visually.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:39.880
 That's exciting to me.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.080
 And I think like, I mean, I've wanted to build a game forever.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.120
 We've talked about this.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.600
 I think the idea of like building sprites and stuff

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.440
 for a game.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.280
 - Yes, that's huge.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.640
 - I would love to do something like that.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.440
 And it's just, it's too hard to like hire somebody

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.620
 for something that's like a side project.

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:57.160
 You're just gonna settle around with it.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.440
 It's not a real job.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.320
 And it's gonna take way too much time

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.280
 to like have somebody just doing it with you.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.680
 It's just like, it opens up those kind of possibilities

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.200
 that are very exciting.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.800
 But I don't even know, I mean, I'm not tried.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.860
 I don't know that it really can.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:10.120
 It just seems like it could maybe.

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.200
 - Yeah, I was talking to AJ about this morning.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.080
 This idea of induced demand.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:19.080
 Like if you, there's this like classic economic phenomena

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:23.600
 where if you have a highway and it's just full of traffic

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.720
 all the time and you can double the lanes,

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.360
 it continues to be full of traffic all the time.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.640
 It doesn't actually make anything go faster.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:32.480
 - Yeah.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.400
 - Cause of induced demand, there's like hidden demand

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.640
 basically that gets like once there's more capacity

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.720
 like it shows up.

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.560
 - Yeah, with a lot of this stuff, like it's not like

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.900
 you're replacing something you're currently doing.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.200
 It's more that you now do a new thing

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:49.400
 that that would otherwise exist before.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:53.800
 - And our work jar is just gonna be continued.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.280
 It's gonna continue to be filled up.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.120
 It's a liquid.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.560
 It will expand to fill.

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.560
 - Yeah.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:46:59.400
 - Or is that gas out?

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.400
 - I don't think liquid's do that.

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.240
 - Whatever.

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.960
 (both laughing)

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:04.800
 Maybe gas.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.800
 I don't know something.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.000
 Something expands fills up containers.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 - I think it's a gas.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:09.840
 Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:10.680
 - Yeah, it makes sense.

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.120
 - Oh, man.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:12.960
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.760
 I thought the image thing was exciting.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.920
 The more exciting thing I think is,

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:18.760
 there's not more exciting,

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:23.760
 but the more interesting observation is just how inflamed

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.340
 Twitter can get so quickly.

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.680
 Not inflamed like in an angry way.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.720
 Just like how pervasive stuff can spread.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.640
 And I wonder like, is that all of Twitter?

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.240
 Is it just our little circle that gets like that?

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.320
 Does the whole of Twitter?

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.240
 'Cause it feels like every post on Twitter right now

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.280
 is the same stuff.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.800
 And it's just like so infectious.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.640
 - Yeah.

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:46.040
 - It's a rare moment where something crosses

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.280
 all the bubbles in Twitter.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.960
 And I think that's what this thing was past week.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.800
 I think it was like.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.280
 - I did, just to find everybody.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.560
 Yeah.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:57.040
 - That said, I saw someone make like a crazy compilation

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.120
 video of all the images.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.480
 And there was a bunch of stuff that was clear

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.520
 from outside of our circle,

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.200
 but like a lot of it was from inside of our circle.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.880
 So it probably wonders if there's like this tech,

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:11.760
 in terms of Twitter, X, whatever in general,

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.400
 I think the authorship from our bubble is really high.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.520
 That is like a, like there's a lot of content being produced

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.280
 from people in our bubble.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.200
 - Our little bubble.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.040
 - Yeah.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.800
 - That gets consumed by the overall, overall one.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.200
 Yeah, it was crazy.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.360
 It's fun once over that happens.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.480
 - You're saying maybe us tech centric folk

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.480
 were the main characters maybe?

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.320
 - I'll take it.

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.240
 - I think a little bit on X

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:38.760
 just cause like stuff is just shifting more.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.080
 Like tech in general is there's people who are central

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.720
 to people's lives.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.680
 Yeah, that's another part of it probably.

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:49.000
 The only community still standing.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.320
 - But yeah, it's cool and stuff like that happens.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.960
 I can't, I think what was like the last time.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.800
 - The last big thing was MCP.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.320
 - No, no, no, something like that was like crossed.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.760
 - Oh, crossed over to normal Twitter.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.160
 - You mean like a post from someone in our circles that like.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.280
 - No, not just like a trend like this thing

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.360
 where like all of Twitter were just talking about the same thing.

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.920
 - Well, there was the single word thing, right?

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.440
 - Single, that's just like a single word thing.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.400
 - Or the actual companies.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.240
 - Yeah.

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.080
 - Yeah.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.640
 Yeah, that was probably the last one I can remember

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.080
 and bite into we did.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:18.920
 What a heat tweet.

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.120
 - Freedom or something.

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.320
 I don't know, something America.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.840
 Something America would claim is like uniquely us.

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:28.800
 - Democracy maybe.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.640
 I don't know.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.960
 - I don't remember what it was.

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:31.840
 - Something like that.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.680
 - I don't know.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.600
 - That was pretty crazy.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.680
 - I did think of one other thing and then I lost it

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.960
 but it was important.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:42.800
 No, it wasn't.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.120
 That's setting a bad expectation.

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.240
 Shoot.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.120
 But I don't mean, I can't even read my eyes are not great.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.440
 I can't even read how long we've been on here.

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.880
 Is it like people's eyes are rolling right now?

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.120
 They're so tired of listening to us.

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:53.960
 - No.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:54.800
 - Can you tell how long?

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.280
 - It's only been 51 minutes.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.440
 - I'm gonna have to make the text bigger.

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.280
 I'm getting old.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.840
 - Oh my God, Adam.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.560
 - I know, I'm sorry.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.400
 Oh, there we go.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.240
 I made it bigger.

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.080
 - Oh, sure it was.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.440
 - Yeah, okay.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.280
 Whatever.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.120
 I can't remember.

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:07.960
 I feel like it was important.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:08.800
 Something going on this week.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.280
 Oh, I was gonna ask, yeah.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.400
 Just, I've been traveling.

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.280
 A little unplugged.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.680
 A little focused on very specific things.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:22.760
 How's the like world politics

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.320
 or even just American politics?

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.680
 How's that whole situation looking?

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.520
 Anything crazy?

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.120
 I feel like if I've been unplugged for a week,

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.320
 I've missed some crazy shit probably.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.920
 - Yeah, the tariff situation continues

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.440
 to like turn back and forth.

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:39.400
 I will say relative to the previous couple of weeks

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.320
 has been kind of quiet.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.280
 Nothing like crazy incendiary.

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.120
 - Okay.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.920
 - The tariff situation continues to be like back and forth.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.880
 Like, you can actually just,

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:50.760
 if you just want to catch up,

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.960
 just go look at the S&P chart for like the best.

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:54.960
 (laughing)

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.800
 But you can see how the fixed chart won't stop that.

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.920
 Like, oh, turns out the tariffs are less bad than we thought.

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.240
 And then it was like, nope.

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.080
 Today again, you know, back to chaos.

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.480
 Yeah, Trump said something today about like,

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.840
 automakers should not increase their prices

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:10.680
 because of tariffs.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.560
 I'm like, that's not how things work.

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:15.960
 - Like corporations should stop seeking profits now.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.880
 - It's like, isn't that, is that how the other side says?

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:18.720
 I'm like confused.

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.280
 It just, both sides are just like in favor of price controls.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.640
 So now that's like causing a bunch of confusion.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.520
 - I am so biased now because I've taken all of my money

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.400
 out of the market.

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.000
 - Oh, so you want to see it burn?

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.720
 - A small portion of it is betting on a downturn.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.560
 - Yeah.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:41.280
 - So there's like crazy feedback where I'm just like,

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.000
 I want, I want, I want to get worse.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.240
 I want to get worse.

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.080
 - Crash and burn.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:45.920
 I've been in that situation.

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.400
 - I'm happy with my portfolio today since looking green

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.840
 for me, red for everyone else.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.400
 - The VIX is quite up.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.400
 A lot of volatility.

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.240
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.080
 - Names.

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.520
 - Another thing is Robinhood.

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.440
 Man, I have grown to really love Robinhood as a company.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.280
 - Oh, yeah?

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.120
 - And I've like gone back and forth on this over the years.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.960
 So I'm, I just came out.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:05.800
 - That's all in that.

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:06.640
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.480
 - They came out as like a free stock trading app

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.920
 in a time where everything, you know,

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.400
 you paid per commission is pretty expensive.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.120
 And it was like a mass market thing, right?

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.120
 They got a ton of people using it.

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.840
 The reality is, is most people shouldn't be trading stocks

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:20.680
 like that.

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:21.600
 - Yeah, right.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.400
 - They're not really like massively successful from that angle.

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.120
 But in terms of adoption, it was hugely successful.

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:31.480
 And they've just slowly been adding and expanding

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.240
 into other areas.

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.200
 And they'd execute really well.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.600
 Like their products are well designed.

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.440
 They feel good.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.280
 They work well.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.120
 - Yeah.

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.760
 - And they're taking over my financial life at this point.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.280
 So they put out a credit card.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.200
 And I canceled my AMX Platinum which I've had for years.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.040
 And I switched to theirs.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.680
 Cause I'm just tired of all the AMX Platinum.

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.680
 It's like, you have these like 29 benefits

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.500
 and they change every year and make sure you're signed up

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.340
 for them.

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:55.240
 Oh, by the way, these other deals here

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.240
 that don't get applied automatically have to pick them.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.760
 Oh, convert your points.

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.660
 And like, you know, it's five X you put on travel.

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:01.760
 It's just like so confusing.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.240
 - You've got to like, you've got to like subscribe

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.160
 to the nerd wallet newsletter to be able to like

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.680
 know anything about how to use all those benefits.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:08.520
 - Yep.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.160
 It's a, it's a whole thing.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.920
 And if you're not doing that,

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.160
 you're probably like not getting that much benefit

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.280
 maybe even losing money.

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.120
 - Yeah.

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.960
 - When you compare to the.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.880
 - It's like 500 something right here.

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:19.720
 - You're going up.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.540
 It keeps going up.

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:22.800
 And I think the final straw for me was I was telling someone

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:27.280
 like, oh man, I just have all these audible credits

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.400
 that I never use cause I don't really listen to audio books.

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.800
 But you know, it's an AMX benefit.

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.880
 So I have not all the count.

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:36.560
 They're like, man, like AMX canceled that like two years ago.

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.720
 Like you just been paying for it for no reason.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.880
 (laughing)

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:43.440
 And I was just like, okay, I'm done with this.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.600
 And then Robin Hood has a gold cart and it's physically gold.

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.280
 Nice and solid, middle physically.

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.640
 It's not, that's not literal gold.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.480
 It looks gold.

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.640
 - Yeah, yeah, just looks gold.

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.240
 I love, did I tell you gold's my favorite color?

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.320
 I finally figured this out.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.600
 It's almost pretty as well.

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.440
 Yeah.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.280
 Anyway, keep down.

00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.360
 - Well, you should get it then.

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.200
 - I should.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.040
 - 3% cashback on everything.

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.240
 - So it's just a credit card?

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.800
 You don't have like an account with them.

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.560
 Like a bank account, it's just a credit card.

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.320
 - Well, he, well, that's what I was going with it.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.840
 So I signed up for that 3% cashback,

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:13.840
 very straightforward, great app, great experience,

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.760
 has all the stuff amazing.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:16.840
 Then they announced yesterday,

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.400
 they were launching a bank and they're launching

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.680
 a mobile advisor.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.720
 So I mean, I just pull all my money out.

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:23.840
 I just said it from Wealthfront.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.240
 But if I ever, when I put it back in,

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.080
 I'm just going to use Robin.

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.400
 I'm going to use their mobile advisor.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.400
 - Okay.

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.720
 - I use Mercury, which is great.

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.680
 And I have a lot of business needs.

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.840
 So I don't know if I'll use their bank,

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:36.000
 but you know, theoretically, I will just use their bank.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.640
 I think I would just use them for everything.

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:40.400
 And then now it's this hilarious feature,

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.800
 which sounds like such a bad idea.

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.360
 But as someone that's been using these like,

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.280
 new modern banks for a while now,

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:51.560
 there's just a cute pain point that you just always need cash.

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:54.480
 Like there's always situations where someone only takes cash,

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.800
 or you're paying for something in cash, you need cash.

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.880
 And so same, you have to go in ATM and like, do whatever.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.600
 Robin just bank announced.

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.800
 It's effectively Uber for cash.

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.800
 You can like order a cash and someone drops it off

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.840
 at your house.

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.960
 And it just seems like a horrible idea.

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:14.240
 Cause it's like, okay, but that is random person knows

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.800
 that you have like thousands of like, it just, it feels weird.

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.880
 Like it doesn't feel safe.

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:21.320
 Maybe it's a rational, but.

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.640
 - Is it actual Uber drivers?

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:23.920
 Or it's different?

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.880
 - It's their own like, it's their own network, I think.

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:27.720
 - Yeah.

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.560
 - Of whatever.

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.960
 Maybe they're probably someone for this, but.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.520
 - I can't think of a single Uber driver I've had

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.040
 that I would want to deliver me cash.

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.680
 - And like, are they targets themselves?

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.880
 Because people know that they have cash.

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:39.040
 - So are they having around in a cold car?

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:42.240
 - You know, like Robin had written on the side, like.

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.200
 - Yeah, it's like those, are they driving in those like,

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.600
 you know, those ATM trucks?

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.640
 - Oh, like a Brinks maybe.

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.000
 - Yeah, they're going to make a little more sense.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.520
 - I would feel a little better.

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.520
 - Yeah.

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.360
 - Gee.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.680
 - I bet this is only in major cities.

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.760
 This is the kind of thing I won't hear about.

00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.600
 Neo's actually like five.

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.400
 - No, no, no, no.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.080
 By the way, when I first moved to Miami,

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.600
 we get like GTA headlines all the time.

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.600
 This is one of the first ones.

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.560
 One of the drivers of that truck locked himself

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:14.000
 in the back by accident and just started shooting.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:14.920
 - What?

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:18.560
 - You started shooting at the lock from inside trying to,

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.080
 like he's panicked.

00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.480
 And so people were just like.

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.320
 - Oh my word.

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:25.280
 - Three gunshots around this ATM vehicle,

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.280
 but which is like a guy dropping side.

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.280
 - He's just trying to get out.

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.120
 - Yeah.

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:28.960
 - Yeah, just trying to shoot the lock.

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.480
 - Couldn't that like ricochet or something?

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.320
 I don't know.

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:32.160
 - Yeah, I think it was really dangerous.

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.280
 - Gee, it was okay, but.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.640
 - But yeah, I guess it's better than suffocating.

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:39.000
 Go down, that's a bullet wound.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.160
 Geez.

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.480
 - Okay, I love the Robin Hood website.

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.640
 I'm sorry, I'm just so distracted

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.880
 'cause everything is gold and I just love gold.

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.200
 - Yeah, they execute really well.

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.320
 And I love this thing where they enter the market

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.240
 with this like kind of weird product

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.520
 and you just never would have guessed where they went.

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:53.360
 And I just love this.

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.560
 I just don't know how companies

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.520
 are gonna eventually make money.

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.880
 Like, no, I don't think anyone would have really guessed

00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.840
 that they're gonna launch a credit card,

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:02.840
 they're gonna launch all these things

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.040
 and their brand is gonna be very strong so they can do it.

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.360
 - Yeah, they just kind of became,

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.040
 yeah, they became this brand

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.520
 that like the younger generation associates

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:12.880
 with financial everything.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:13.720
 - Yeah.

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:14.560
 - Very smart.

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.560
 - Yeah, it's well executed, takes a long time

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.840
 and they've been through ups and downs,

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:21.040
 like they had all that trouble with the GameStop situation.

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.280
 - Oh, they had trouble with that?

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.720
 - Yeah, remember they shut down trays

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.760
 and they were like kind of insolvent on something

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:26.760
 and they had to like get a quick,

00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.360
 like a big cash infusion from--

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.680
 - Oh, I didn't know this.

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.760
 - There's a bunch of chaos with it.

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:32.600
 - Okay.

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.200
 - Yeah, I'm a big fan of their products.

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.880
 They're giving away a thousand gold bars.

00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.440
 - Oh my word, that's so cool.

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.920
 - Oh man, it looks so cool too.

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.240
 - I love gold, not like actual gold, but the color.

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.200
 And I guess gold bars are the actual color,

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.360
 so I love them too.

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.200
 - You know what's funny?

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.600
 I think that's actually a very not white trait,

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.600
 loving gold.

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:52.600
 - Oh really?

00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.080
 I've decided like white and gold,

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.920
 like the combination of white and gold

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.040
 is just like, it does it for me, man.

00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:58.880
 - Nice.

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:01.080
 - In terms of a color, like combination

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.440
 or just it's mostly the gold,

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:06.120
 but anything that they put like gold foil on or something,

00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.440
 ugh, love it.

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:08.960
 I just want that, whatever it is,

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:10.640
 unless it's like a steak.

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.480
 - Just give me that.

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.320
 - That's good to say.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.640
 What about this?

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.240
 Come down in Miami, they'll put gold

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.080
 on whatever you want.

00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:17.960
 - Oh, I'm sure, yeah, yeah.

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:21.640
 Well now you should get a necklace as you'd like to say.

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.120
 (laughing)

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:25.040
 - That's not so sad, is Casey,

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.520
 watch that episode when I wore it,

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.280
 and she's like, we're just a silver girly.

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:30.240
 Like you need to wear the color silver.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.080
 Gold is not for you, and I think it's true.

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.640
 I think gold doesn't look good on me.

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:34.480
 So that's why the--

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.300
 - Oh really?

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.240
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:37.240
 If it would have been a silver necklace,

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.080
 I might have pulled it off.

00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:40.240
 - Yeah, that's maybe why I say it's not so much.

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.200
 Like I feel like not white people love gold, okay?

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.760
 - Not white people.

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:47.160
 - Here's a funny thing.

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.320
 Indian people love gold, like--

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.160
 - Oh really?

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.400
 - To like a weird degree, like to like a,

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:56.280
 it's like a, like a dragon hoarding gold degree.

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:01.000
 - When I was little, we went to Singapore,

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.400
 and I remember the trip,

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.120
 'cause my parents bought me a Game Boy color on that trip.

00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.040
 - I remember playing the Game Boy color.

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:07.880
 - Oh, take it back.

00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:11.040
 - But I also remember we were at some store,

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:14.960
 and my parents just bought a bunch of gold coins

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.080
 in like, they were just like acquiring physical gold.

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:20.120
 Like not jewelry, I think some jewelry,

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.280
 but they were just like,

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.600
 they got like a sack of gold coins.

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.920
 And they were just like, yes,

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.920
 this is something we're gonna buy gold coins.

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:27.000
 - That is awesome.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.620
 I want a sack of gold coins.

00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:29.760
 (laughing)

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:30.760
 - There you go.

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:33.760
 So yeah, brown people, we love gold, we hoard it.

00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:35.960
 - Poor gold.

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:39.480
 - Mid the gold discussion.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.720
 I switched over to the Twitter tab,

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:46.800
 and I just saw where Prime and the Replit founder

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:47.840
 are having an interaction.

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:48.680
 It's quite funny.

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.200
 - Oh, did he respond?

00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:51.040
 Yeah.

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:51.880
 - That guy's so abatable.

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:52.880
 I'm so excited.

00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.720
 (laughing)

00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.080
 I'm so excited.

00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.240
 No, we're not getting the pockets.

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.680
 I wanna see what it is first.

00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.680
 - Prime saying it was this first interaction with him,

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.000
 but it wasn't great.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.760
 And he's like, it's not the first time

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.880
 you did a whole video about me.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.720
 - Right, what?

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.560
 I don't know.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.400
 Should I read all this?

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.240
 It's on Twitter, it's public.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.080
 - Where is it?

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:08.920
 - It feels weird.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.760
 - I don't see.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.600
 - It's a reply to my tweet.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.200
 Okay, so the CEO, Amjad replied to me.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.200
 (laughing)

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.040
 Wait, what?

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:16.880
 What happened with that?

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.280
 - Dude, just quote tweeted my thing going,

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.120
 what's a Replit?

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120
 Never heard of it.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.600
 (laughing)

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.600
 - I love David.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.840
 (laughing)

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.680
 - Oh, I love it.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.520
 Nah, just TJ.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.640
 Did he do the last one?

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:30.600
 - No, Prime responded to him.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.600
 So this is where Prime responded to him,

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600
 and then it goes on from there.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.840
 - I see, let's give this away.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.680
 This is my first interaction I had with the internet.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.520
 (laughing)

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.440
 Open Source Project, destroyed by legal threats.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.480
 - Okay, I've talked about this situation

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.120
 more than I'd like, if I'm being honest.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.160
 I just stated a fact, listen, I'm not,

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.080
 I didn't say a single negative thing about this company.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.640
 I just said I literally don't know what it is

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.680
 or know anyone that uses it, that's all.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.160
 It's not even negative.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.960
 It's just, maybe it's not for developers.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.680
 Is it not for developers, is it for other people?

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.680
 Is it so VCs can build their own ideas?

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.520
 - Is what?

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.360
 A Replit?

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.200
 - Yeah.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.480
 - Is it the product is?

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.840
 I just don't know what it is.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.640
 But I feel like if it was for developers,

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.360
 I feel like I would actually know what it was

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.800
 because developers would be using it

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:14.960
 and I would know about it, right?

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.400
 - I think it's, I think broadly it makes sense.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.960
 It's like, what if we built like a full unified vision

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.560
 for someone brand new to programming,

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.640
 get them going to fully deployed?

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.400
 Like everything from education to like development

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.200
 to hosting all of that, like it's a full, full featured thing.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.040
 - Gotcha.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.320
 - I would say it's like for developers.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.800
 It's just, I think it helps grow the pool of developers

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.680
 that exist and they've had to like pivot,

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.040
 obviously with the AI stuff to know

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.800
 how much, like what does that look like?

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.520
 But, I don't know, I just know that CEO is a hot head

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.480
 and he's always like saying all this crazy, crazy stuff.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.640
 And he gets upset pretty easily.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.480
 - Good to know.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.440
 Wish I would have known that before I tweeted.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.840
 - I really thought you did that 'cause you saw my thing

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.360
 'cause for me, I knew he was like that

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.000
 and I knew he was gonna like jump on it.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:06.840
 I knew it was gonna be something too.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.640
 - No, you told me that you tweeted something

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.440
 and then I found it but I didn't know you had before that.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.640
 - Yeah, we're all just, we're all just

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.080
 (laughing)

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.640
 terminal versus replit.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.280
 You know what, I'm gonna DM him for a sponsorship.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.200
 Hey, do you guys want us fun?

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.040
 (laughing)

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.760
 - Nobody would do that coming.

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.120
 (laughing)

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.000
 That's effective marketing right there.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.040
 (laughing)

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.360
 We did it, we did another episode.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.880
 This podcast isn't gone yet.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.560
 You thought you could get rid of us?

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:36.560
 - Uh-uh, we're back after a week's off.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:37.400
 - That's funny.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.560
 - I'm making it sound like we just took three months.

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.040
 (laughing)

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:40.880
 - It feels that way.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.080
 - Can't wait to see whatever this is gonna be animated as.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.400
 People aren't gonna have to look at our faces.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.720
 They're gonna look at some kind of cartoon.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.400
 I bet we look so good here right now.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.400
 Do you have any requests?

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.320
 - Rick and Morty.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.040
 - Rick and Morty, okay.

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.000
 Yeah, that'd be fun.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.160
 (laughing)

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.000
 We'll do that.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:55.840
 I'm doing Rick and Morty.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.320
 All right, this is gonna be fun.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:58.160
 - All right.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.000
 - All right, see ya.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:02:59.840
 - See ya.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.420
 (upbeat music)

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.940
 (upbeat music)

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:18.040
 - You see, Mr. Powers.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.880
 I love gold.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:26.400
 The look of it, the taste of it,

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.480
 the smell of it, the texture.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.120
 I love gold so much

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.120
 that I even lost my genitalia in an unfortunate

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.120
 smelting accident.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.120
 Hence the name.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.440
 - Gold member.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.020
 (upbeat music)
