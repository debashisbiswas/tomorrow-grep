WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
 - That's obviously an embarrassing group of people

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.840
 to be a part of.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.320
 - Yeah, I mean, like, it's like the first time

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.560
 in human history, right?

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.160
 That we've been like, let's pause on technology.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.160
 Slow down, you're going too fast.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.740
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.280
 (upbeat music)

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.200
 - What exactly has happened is the last time

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.880
 we've talked about it 'cause it feels like forever go.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.120
 And it was only like a maybe a month ago.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.960
 - Yes, we were just talking about

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.160
 what we talked about in the last AI podcast.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.880
 And it was mostly like the generative stuff,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.560
 the AI image generation stuff.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.520
 Now I feel like Chad GBT is the giant elephant in the room.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.560
 Open AI, I mean, Chad GBT's been around for a while,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.880
 but like they just started shipping stuff

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.520
 that seems to like fill a lot of the gaps in.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.440
 So they announced the plugin API

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.000
 and this internet connectivity where you can like write

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.300
 plugins that can then go out and fetch real time data,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.240
 not just, you know, stuff prior to the knowledge cut off.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.840
 There's that date where the model was trained 2021

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.760
 or something.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.960
 And before this, you sort of like all answers are

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.920
 in the past before that date.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.760
 Now the plugins allow you to fetch up-to-date information.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.800
 So hopefully filling in the time gap

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.720
 and then also like it's allegedly eliminating

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.120
 a lot of the hallucinations because now they can go out

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.940
 and fetch real data.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.200
 I guess you have to install the plugins.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.660
 I'm not really sure how it's all going to work,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.800
 but they showed like examples of it running like

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.000
 FFmpeg commands in open or in chat GBT.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.360
 Like it's running Python code natively in chat GBT

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.080
 to solve things that you ask it, which is just wild.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.720
 - Yeah, that stuff is really cool.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.840
 I think people, and I think that's why it feels like it's fast

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.760
 because when open AI came out, people were like,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.080
 oh, you obviously need this capability in other places.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.000
 So people started to build all these little mini tools.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.520
 Then chat GBT was like, no, hold up.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.480
 You don't need to do that.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.520
 It's just going to be in our platform.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.600
 You're never going to have to leave.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.040
 The whole model is actually reversed,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.040
 which again, it's a great example of why I feel like

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.480
 there's a lot of chasing that happens

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.880
 whenever there's something new and revolutionary.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.480
 And it's obviously a lot of opportunity with everything.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.840
 But if you're just going to hop on something,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.280
 'cause there's some excitement around it

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.920
 and you just do the first idea you think of,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.640
 things are moving quickly and you probably,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.880
 your idea might not even be relevant.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.000
 And it's kind of what's happened.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.560
 I think with a lot of those simple startups

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.720
 or two weeks ago or no, it's not super relevant anymore.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.880
 - Yeah, I had this thought,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.320
 even before they announced all that stuff,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.120
 that I would not want to build something

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.160
 on top of chat GBT.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.480
 I see a lot of cool examples people post on Twitter.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.120
 I would not want to build a thing

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.280
 that's just relying on chat GBT.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.800
 So much as I would like to say,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.000
 okay, this is a new era.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.400
 We can build products way faster than we ever could.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.320
 What I want to build, it's not related AI,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.000
 but AI is just going to help me build it way faster.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.600
 I think that's the more exciting thing to me

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.920
 as a technologist.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.240
 I mean, it's not helping me make rebase any faster, I guess.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.640
 Sorry, Dax.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.920
 But allegedly, theoretically, we could build it way faster.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.760
 - I think we are building it faster.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.680
 'Cause I, and both of us, I've seen you on stream

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.520
 and you've probably seen me.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.960
 I open up chat GBT for everything, whenever I need,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.440
 whenever I know what I need done, and I just need to do it,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.680
 and I don't remember the exact details on how to do it,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.200
 it is flawless, and it's such a habit now.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.640
 It's what integrated into my workflow.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.600
 And I think that's actually where the shift was for me.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.720
 That's how I've been feeling about this for a while,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.920
 which is wow, it's making me so much more productive.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.360
 And that was like only positive, right?

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.440
 It only made me feel like I was already pretty good

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.680
 at what I do.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.840
 Now I feel like I'm like 100 times better at what I do.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.480
 I think it also is weirdly creating,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.920
 like if the gaps between people,

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.440
 like if one person was like, you know,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.160
 twice as experienced as someone else,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.800
 I feel like chat GBT just amplifies that,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.480
 and now they're like 100 times better,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.320
 'cause you know, there's better--

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.000
 - So the 10x engineers, the mythical 10x

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.120
 becomes like 100 or 1000x.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.400
 - Yeah, exactly, 'cause they just amplify their judgment,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.000
 and like people that are good at what they do,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.960
 it's just they have good judgment and good instincts.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.320
 And when they see the joke how it spits out,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.880
 they immediately know what to refine,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.520
 like what's right, what's wrong.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.280
 So they're just faster at like the whole iteration loop.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.640
 So with that in mind, tell me Dax,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.160
 how does this not eliminate jobs?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.720
 I feel like everyone comes out and wants to defend

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.560
 and be like, you're an idiot

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.680
 if you think this is gonna take jobs.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.600
 How does it not take jobs?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.280
 - It's so layered, like I feel a lot of people

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.280
 that are saying it's gonna take jobs

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.080
 are kind of saying in a dumb way,

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.480
 and I don't agree with them.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.080
 But then I also find people that are saying,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.840
 it's not gonna take jobs, also kind of misguided.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.320
 Like the people that are saying it's gonna take jobs,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.600
 I think there's kind of in panic mode,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.240
 I'm not really thinking about it too deeply

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.880
 and they're scared, which makes sense

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.080
 'cause this is all like very disruptive

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.800
 and I myself have had some of those feelings.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.280
 And then I think that people that are saying,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.400
 it's not gonna take jobs, this is just another hype thing.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.640
 I also feel like they're panicking,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.560
 but they're like really good at being denial.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.840
 So I feel like the general takes I've been seeing

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.600
 have just been just kind of annoying to be honest.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.000
 I don't know where I said this,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 but I was like, there's people literally saying,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.160
 I saw this is like a real tweet,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.760
 I saw they were like, intelligence is no longer valuable.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.880
 - What?

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.200
 - Like we live in a post-intelligence world.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.400
 This is no longer a thing that is gonna help.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.440
 The only thing that matters is having an audience.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.800
 And I'm just like, okay, that guy,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.360
 he does have an audience and I'm like,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.280
 I see why he wants to live in a world

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.640
 where intelligence doesn't matter.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.160
 (laughing)

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.620
 - I don't think he had intelligence to start with.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.240
 He's just as excited as he doesn't need it.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.760
 (laughing)

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.600
 - I know.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.960
 So there's that and there's other people

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.920
 that are completely in denial that are like,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.560
 this is just a dumb machine

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.400
 that is like emulating intelligence and is useless.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.660
 So I feel like both sides of those takes are kind of,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.080
 I don't know, I'm not like super interested in that.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.440
 I would say these are negative feelings.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.240
 I think I've processed them and now I feel excited again.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.680
 But there was a moment when I realized,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.600
 'cause me and Liz, you know, work on a product together,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.720
 like a very traditional SAS application.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.000
 - Boomy. - Yeah, boomy.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.040
 And we think it's very good.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.120
 And we spend a lot of time really understanding

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.400
 our users and building something like way better

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.560
 than everything else in the space

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.000
 to solve a similar problem.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.760
 And we were able to do that 'cause we have just years

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.360
 of building SAS application.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.840
 Like we just picked a space and just put our skillset in there

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.200
 and we knew we would guarantee good results, right?

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.680
 'Cause we've done it before.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.880
 But then when I was looking at this stuff

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.760
 and I'm like, wow, the way I build products

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.440
 and all those skill sets I rely on

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.840
 to be better than other people,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.280
 to like deliver products that are really good,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.680
 it's a complete reset.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.600
 'Cause now you can solve the same problems

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.000
 in a completely different way.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.640
 And it's a whole new world of like learning UX things, right?

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.200
 There's all these little UX things that I know

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.200
 that work really well on a traditional product.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.240
 But now there's like, okay, how do you integrate this stuff

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.240
 into a product?

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.360
 How do you deal with non-deterministic output, right?

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.640
 Like now you have stuff where you can ask chat

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.360
 if you do something integrate that into your product,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.000
 but you don't know exactly if it's gonna be correct

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 when it comes back, like how do you build these interactions,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.600
 interfaces, and I realized like, this thing,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.960
 I was going to have to be better than other people.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.760
 I am now, I can still rely on it somewhat,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.800
 but we're kind of all beginners in this world

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.200
 of building products with chat, GPT,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.920
 and we're all kind of at the same level.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.280
 And it's like the race resets and now we're starting again

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.400
 to compete with each other.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.320
 - Yeah, I think like, it's hitting me most at home

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.760
 with Stammus, like I feel like, so Stammus, sorry,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.760
 it's like a sports statistics search engine with Stammus.com,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.040
 check it out.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.080
 So Stammus, we're like basically dependent on Google.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.440
 We get tons of traffic from Google

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.960
 and I just don't know like where it's all,

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.200
 people talk about like chat GPT being the end of Google.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.040
 I just don't know if there's any sliver of truth there.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.200
 If like, will Google's numbers start dipping

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.520
 because people go to chat GPT instead of searching

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.760
 on traditional search indexes, that's like,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.680
 that's a big deal for us.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.600
 Stammus, like we depend heavily on getting lots

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.280
 of traditional SEO stuff.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.640
 And if people start searching for sports questions

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.320
 in chat GPT or elsewhere, how does that affect the landscape?

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.040
 I don't know if you have thoughts on any of that.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.840
 Like, is that stuff gonna change?

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.240
 Are people actually using Google less?

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.320
 I guess I do.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.040
 - So, yeah, I mean, I think I definitely use Google less.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.480
 I think the Stammus case, I think that's actually

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.800
 a great demonstration of what will continue to exist

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.520
 and what is different.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.880
 So, Stammus, you guys have two parts, right?

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.840
 You have the work of collecting and organizing information

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.480
 that is accurate, true, and correct.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.800
 And that's a lot of work and that's where like a lot

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.480
 of the value is and you guys have put in a ton of work

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.000
 into organizing that.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.320
 Then there's the interface to accessing that data.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.480
 I think a lot of products fit like how this dichotomy,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.400
 like even with Boomi, we help our businesses

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.000
 like just collect accurate information

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.240
 about their customers and make sure

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.600
 everything's organized and structured correctly.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.320
 - That stuff I feel is never gonna go away

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.680
 'cause chat JPT gets trained on correct information.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.680
 So, part of your business is like creating that

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.800
 and creating the source of that information.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.160
 I feel like that's still gonna be the same and be valuable

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.000
 and chat JPT might help you in like building the tools

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.840
 for that, of course, but it's not gonna replace that.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.920
 People, the interface for Stammus might end up being

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.760
 chat JPT, right?

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.200
 I don't think you guys have a problem there

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.320
 'cause they would just find Stammus through chat JPT

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.880
 if that's where their entry point is.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.760
 - I mean, so I'm very interested in the plug-ins thing

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.040
 when that came out for that reason

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.440
 because I don't know like, could we have a Stammus plug-in

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.000
 and I've applied like to do it,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.160
 but I don't know like if we do have a Stammus plug-in,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.320
 will we get like attributes?

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.240
 Are people still gonna end up on Stammus.com

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.760
 or is it just gonna feed, chat, chat, JPT, all this stuff

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.400
 and then we're just, we're no longer relevant, I don't know.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.080
 - Yeah, and that's why we're kind of a,

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.160
 it's kind of a reset, right?

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.240
 It's like business models need to change.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.440
 How do you monetize this stuff?

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.160
 Is it gonna have to end up being like a licensing thing?

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.680
 - You also have to pay to use chat JPT currently.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.520
 So it's not like, like Google

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.920
 where literally anyone can just use it.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.960
 Like does that model even make sense long term?

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.440
 Like you do want people just accessing it

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.320
 without having to pay for it upfront, right?

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.160
 - Right.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.280
 - Yeah, so I have no idea, like business models

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.360
 have to completely be rediscovered again.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.360
 Jay from SSD, he made a funny parallel.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.720
 He's like, when the iPhone first came out,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.280
 it was all fart apps.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.280
 Like despite the power of the iPhone, iPhone apps,

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.640
 it was really hard for people to think about anything

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.360
 more grand than fart apps.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.760
 And he's like, right now we basically have a bunch of fart apps

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.120
 on chat JPT effectively, like not literally,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.960
 but like in terms of like level sophistication.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.040
 - Yeah.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.240
 - But now there's like, you know, iPhone apps,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.080
 there are billion dollar companies

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.920
 with like million line code bases that build iPhone apps.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.280
 And we could have, none of us could even conceive of it.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.800
 We had kind of the scaffolder way up there with like,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.160
 over time we all sort of understand stuff that we can do,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.920
 patterns we can do.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.560
 I talk about the Pulte refresh thing a lot.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.840
 Like Pulte refresh wasn't a thing for a very long time

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.360
 on apps and so I'm not to invent that now.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.200
 It's everywhere.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.400
 So yeah, I think we're gonna have to go through the same thing

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.480
 with all this.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.840
 Like we don't know what to do with this stuff yet.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.480
 - That just reminds me that you,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.400
 we've talked about Simon Wardley before,

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.400
 big like serverless prognosticator.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.280
 Is that the word for something who makes like predictions?

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.000
 - I've never heard the word prognosticator before.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.920
 - Is that how I make that up?

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.880
 I might have made that word up prognosticator.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.720
 - Does medical?

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.200
 - I don't know, maybe.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.400
 - He's a person who like thinks a lot like prognosis.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.760
 - I see like you give like a maker of prognosis-ies?

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.840
 Prognoso, prognoci?

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.840
 Okay.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.680
 - We'll fact check this later.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.520
 We're gonna ask tragic ideas.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.360
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.360
 So he makes like a lot of predictions about the world.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.600
 He maps, he does mapping, which is like a thing.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.200
 I don't know much about it, but I just realized he talks

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.840
 about like the thing after serverless

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.400
 is conversational programming or something.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.600
 And I never knew what that was.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.440
 And it just occurred to me, this is that, isn't it?

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.480
 - He's right, isn't he?

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.760
 - He like, he laid that out at a time.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.320
 - Oh, five years ago, he had diagrams

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.120
 that were like mapping out how the next thing

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.920
 after serverless is conversational programming.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.520
 And when he says that, I just thought he meant like,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.400
 speaking English to program stuff, what is that?

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.400
 But this is it.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.240
 This is like, we're trying to figure out

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.160
 how to program on Chad JBT now.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.480
 And like what experiences can you build?

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.320
 Maybe?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.160
 I don't know.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.000
 Did I just, did I miss it?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.600
 - No, I mean, that sounds exactly like what we're doing.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.280
 Yeah, wow, that's impressive.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.600
 Did he post something the other day where it was like a chart

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.320
 of like, people were like,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.760
 oh, when does singularity gonna happen?

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.280
 And it was a good chart of human intelligence going up.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.760
 Oh yeah, I found that 'cause he retweeted it.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.840
 And then it was like human intelligence

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.480
 going down to meet AI at the intersection.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.840
 And someone was like, what evidence do you have of this?

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.560
 And they were like, and Simon Warley was like,

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.360
 the fact that Jersey Shore is in this good season.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.400
 - Do you really watch that show?

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.240
 What is it?

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.280
 You gotta tell me what that is.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.120
 You said you--

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:51.960
 - You don't know what it is.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.800
 - No.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.960
 - Did you reply to me and say you watch it?

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.800
 Is that true?

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.320
 - Yeah, I watch every episode of Jersey Shore.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.480
 I've seen every episode of Jersey Shore.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.320
 And I love it.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.200
 - Is it just like Ken Wheeler?

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.280
 Is that basically what the show is?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.880
 It's just like a bunch of Ken Wheeler's.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.720
 That's what I imagine.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.360
 - Here's a story with it.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.080
 So I'm from New Jersey.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.000
 And there was a really big reality show called Jersey Shore

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.480
 that was documented a very specific stereotype

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.000
 that does exist in parts of New Jersey.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.880
 It's not like probably New Jersey.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.520
 It's like the Italian, like Guido, like,

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.600
 specific lifestyle thing.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.960
 And these people were just like insane drunk,

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.360
 like just not people you would look up to at all.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.680
 And they did like two or three seasons of the show.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.000
 Then 10 or 15 years later, they rebooted it.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.760
 And now they're in a different part of their life.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.600
 - Okay.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.600
 - And they're all so mature, like smart.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.480
 And they've all like grown so much.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.120
 And like they've followed their lives now.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.920
 And like, you know, they've had all these bad experiences

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.640
 'cause if they got famous and like rich

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.480
 and they did all this stuff

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.960
 and but now they're in a better place.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.800
 Every single one of them, all of them in therapy,

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.320
 like doing great, is it still entertaining?

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.760
 - I find it very entertaining.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.080
 Again, it's close to me 'cause like I saw it

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.720
 when I was younger and I was in New Jersey

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.480
 and they all live in New Jersey, so.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.320
 - Okay.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.360
 - Anyway, but anyway, that's proof

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.760
 that human intelligence is declining,

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.000
 which I'm not even gonna, I don't even disagree.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.520
 - Yeah, well, is there any truth that?

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.160
 So kind of going back to the AI thing,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.480
 you said this person that tweeted

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.880
 that like the intelligence isn't worth anything anymore.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.240
 Is there actual data on like,

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.600
 I think there is like test scores and stuff going down

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.840
 for like the last 50 years or whatever in the US,

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.960
 mass scores have never been worse.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.880
 I just saw this in the last couple of days.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.160
 - Yeah, I mean, I think, I think my whole life

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
 I've been seeing that information about that going down.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.240
 I don't know, I don't know.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.600
 I think there's like different components of this,

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.800
 like is biological intelligence,

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.240
 like your capability for intelligence going down.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.440
 You know, technically I think there is proof

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.760
 that our like ancient, ancient ancestors

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.960
 were a lot more individually smart than us

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.240
 because they had to be.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.040
 They had to like know all this stuff to survive.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.640
 Like, well, plants are safe.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.200
 Like what can, like where do I need to migrate?

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.440
 Like what are the weather patterns?

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.600
 As an individual, you have to be so much smarter.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.200
 Now we're collectively so much smarter

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.720
 that we individually don't have to be as smart.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.080
 So I can see an argument for individual intelligence

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.040
 going down mostly because we have so much structure

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.440
 in place that it compensates for that.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.200
 And I guess that's kind of what his chart shows.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.600
 Like as AI gets better, we individually don't have to be as smart.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.440
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.280
 It reminds me of the,

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.480
 have you ever read Rational Optimists?

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.520
 I think it's that book.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.440
 - Yeah, I love that book.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.280
 - Yeah, okay.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.880
 So in that book, is that the book where he talks about

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.040
 like he's setting at his desk, eating breakfast

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.920
 and it's like the plate was manufactured in Sweden.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.440
 The bagel is made from ingredients

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.400
 from like seven different countries.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.760
 Like just all the different,

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.280
 how our whole world is our whole framework

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.440
 that we live in is made up of like collectively thousands

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.280
 or hundreds of thousands of people.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.120
 It's just wild when you think about it actually.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.960
 - Yeah.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.320
 - So collectively we accomplish a whole lot.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.160
 - Yeah.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.360
 Like way, way, way, way more than what the smartest person

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.120
 who's ever lived can do on their own.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.200
 Like like a hundred dumb people can do better than.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.920
 - But like individually, we just watch Jersey Shore.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.920
 That's how smart we are.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.920
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.800
 And that's kind of what chat GPT is.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.440
 It is kind of dumb in some ways

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.320
 'cause it doesn't like know a lot of obvious things.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.080
 But it also has an infinite memory.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.000
 It's basically like a billion dumb people.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.840
 - Interesting.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.680
 - It's kind of what you're tapping into.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.120
 So does it have infinite memory?

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.280
 When you say infinite memory,

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.200
 like you just mean it's trained on so much more data

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.920
 than any one person could actually store in their head?

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.320
 - Yeah, yeah, just relative to a human, it's effectively.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.640
 It's like if we could just remember literally everything.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.640
 - Yeah.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.600
 Yeah, no, that's a good point.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.960
 I've heard a lot of people say like,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.040
 it's like having an intern or like a thousand interns.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.880
 But it's like one person who has like bits

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.800
 of a thousand people in their head

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.880
 are more than a thousand, I guess.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.720
 Yeah, interesting.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.880
 It's all hard to think about.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.120
 It just kind of hurts my head.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:44.960
 I'm not very smart.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.640
 We're not individually very smart anymore.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.800
 It's very hard for me to wrap my head around it.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.160
 - So how do you feel now?

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.680
 Do you feel excited, worried, nervous?

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.640
 - I mean, I don't know that I feel anything.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.960
 I mean, this is just a meat problem.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.920
 I don't really have emotions.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.000
 But I think there was a day

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.720
 where it was when they announced the plugins.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.080
 I got a little anxious.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.720
 Not like I thought I was gonna lose my job,

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.280
 but more just like I don't know what the future looks like

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.680
 and that just freaks me out a little bit.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.760
 I had also had coffee for the first time in months

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.200
 and I was like coffee anxiety.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.080
 But I think now I'm just kind of settled back down

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.400
 to a normal plane of existence.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.880
 I think like I'm somewhat excited.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.440
 I don't know that I have an emotional,

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.680
 like I don't feel excited day to day,

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.560
 but I think I am excited to see where it's all headed.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.680
 It does feel like this is different

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.200
 than any of the big fads or like people want to compare it

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.920
 to like NFTs and Web3 and that stuff just drives me crazy.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.760
 This is not like that.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.840
 This is like actually useful right now for lots of people.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.840
 But I do wonder like I guess I go to the pessimistic side

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.240
 on some things like societally.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.360
 I just can't imagine if like some people

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.760
 are a thousand times more productive than they were before

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.360
 that employers will still continue

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.600
 to hire the same number of people.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.000
 Like it just seems like fundamentally we have bigger levers.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.120
 So we need fewer people pulling those levers.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:00.960
 I don't know.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.800
 Maybe that's, you always say like there's infinite opportunity

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.680
 or infinite desire.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.520
 What do you say?

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.360
 Make me feel better.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.440
 - They're just infinite things we have to do.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.200
 I think yeah, in the short term,

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.720
 there's just gonna be some reshuffling.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.920
 Which is kind of already happening.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.440
 Just ignore the AI thing.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.200
 Just looking at just like those shrinking

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.160
 in some of these bigger companies.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.560
 So it takes time for that stuff to reshuffle.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.400
 But I don't know.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.680
 Like it's possible that this time it's different.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.960
 Just but historically like when we've gone through phases

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.920
 like this, yes, there was a little bit of chaos

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.200
 but then like stuff emerged from there

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.160
 that ended up being way crazier than we can imagine.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.520
 Again, I want to believe that that's true.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.920
 So I do believe it.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.160
 But I also think it makes sense

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.800
 and there's a history in it.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.640
 I also feel a little,

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.800
 they're coming back to like how we feel.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.880
 I feel a little humbled in some ways

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.400
 because so my dad is a software engineer.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:54.400
 So he's been in tech through like other big moments.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.800
 And looking back, I was kind of like,

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.400
 oh man, like you were so close to all this.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.520
 Like how didn't, how didn't,

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.280
 why didn't you have the idea for like Uber

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.880
 or like all these like very seemingly obvious things?

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.840
 Like how come you would like didn't work at Google

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.760
 like when they were early?

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.040
 Like it all seemed so obvious to me.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.040
 And I was like he was right there

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.480
 and he had the skills and he could have done it.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.960
 But like now being at a similar point,

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.680
 it's like, oh, you just have no idea at all

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.080
 what's going to happen and you just like try

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.640
 to like blindly figure it out.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.480
 Yeah.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.080
 And it just seems obvious in hindsight, but it really isn't.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.760
 No, this is the most like in terms of my entire career

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.280
 or 15 years, whatever it's been.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.480
 Like this is the most uncertain I've been about

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.680
 what my job will look like in five years.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.640
 Like what all of this looks like.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.120
 Yeah, it's just so fast.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.880
 I think that's the thing is like,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.520
 you can look at OpenAI's roadmap

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.280
 and like yeah, they're shipping impressive stuff

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.720
 and doing it quickly.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.400
 Just looking around on Twitter just like every day,

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.560
 there's some new like media thing that somebody put out

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.640
 that's like totally transforming video editing

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.520
 or totally transforming audio editing.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.280
 It's just like completely changing industries.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.880
 And it feels like it happens every single week.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.400
 There's these major products coming out.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.800
 I look polished and like, they're all because these AI models

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.760
 have gotten so advanced.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.680
 So you do wonder like, what is the curve like

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.520
 with these models?

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.400
 Do they continue to progress?

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.720
 What is AGI?

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.640
 Does it matter if humans just keep getting dumber?

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.560
 Like I don't know, it's the target moving.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.400
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.880
 It's all very interesting.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.640
 It's hard not to be excited about it,

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.280
 but at the same time, I understand when people are anxious,

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.560
 like I understand those feelings.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.640
 And I do think it's interesting with the macro stuff,

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.720
 like just the economy kind of slowing down at this time.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.560
 It was like lots of tech layoffs.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.960
 Will they ever return to that peak?

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.200
 I don't know, I'm a pessimist.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.200
 As nice as it was to know that, okay, worse case,

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.680
 there's always some like overpaid job at Google or whatever

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.720
 that I can like go get.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.680
 That was nice knowing that that existed.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.400
 I think that's effectively gone now.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.960
 I don't think that is gonna come back.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.520
 But more broadly, if I really think about what I believe in,

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.640
 I don't actually believe that should have existed.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.240
 Like I am much more into there being

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:07.760
 a million 20 person companies than like way less of those

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.840
 and just a few massive ones.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.720
 Like I think we both like have been trying that for a while.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.080
 So this could be the thing that helps that happen.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.920
 And that makes, that kind of gives more people

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.920
 alternative work in the way that I think both of us

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.080
 have had the fortune to work in.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.760
 And it just is way better and way more fun.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:26.120
 So I think after the chaos and people,

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.880
 there are people that can like, you know,

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.760
 figure out opportunities and build stuff.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.920
 I think they will build like very solid

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.600
 10 to 20 person companies that do very well.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.640
 So I'm just hoping that just makes it all

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.760
 way more possible for them.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.800
 - Yeah, that's probably the thing I feel most certain about

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.000
 is that small teams will build better products

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.280
 because of all this like it would just be more common

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.320
 to see the really powerhouse small teams,

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.320
 which is exciting because I do love that environment.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.320
 - Yeah. - This is good.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.560
 I always love talking about this stuff.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.120
 I'm not an AI bro or whatever they're called.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.720
 But this is very exciting.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.000
 - Is that a thing AI bro?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.320
 I feel like, I don't know.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.680
 I think a lot of the people that were in the web three

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.800
 kind of shifted over to AI all of a sudden.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.560
 - And I was telling you this like that literally happened

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.480
 in a physically happened in Miami.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.600
 There was a bunch of people that physically left

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.880
 that came here for the NFT hype that are now an SF

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.360
 for the AI hype and just like, man,

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.760
 what's it like to live life like that?

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.280
 - Yeah, what do you think about like open AI as,

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.600
 I don't know, our warlords in five years?

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.880
 Like are they just gonna be the major, major tech company?

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.080
 'Cause you could kind of imagine,

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.520
 you could plot that out and imagine

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.840
 that they're just gonna be this powerhouse.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.720
 - Yeah, we'll see what happens.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.400
 I think if you play back some of the stuff

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.920
 in previous eras, it was kind of news to people

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.120
 that a company like Google could start out so small

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.000
 and end up being as big as they are.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.480
 And we had a bunch of examples of those

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.400
 like Google, Facebook, et cetera.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.000
 So now we know very quickly

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.320
 that if something starts to get traction,

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.960
 like, oh, they have a shot at being a unicorn.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.000
 I just feel that just wasn't as well understood before.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.840
 - Yeah.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.680
 - Because that's more understood now,

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.960
 the competition they're gonna face is really intense.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.120
 I still think like they're very good

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.880
 and like the team behind it is very good

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.560
 and they have a head start, of course.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.640
 We'll see what ends up happening

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.640
 if they are able to, like I said,

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.720
 the business models around this stuff have not been invented.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.680
 It's a very expensive business to run at least today.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.200
 They get rather their next model is rumored to be trained

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:29.200
 on like a $225 million like computing thing.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.520
 So if GPT five costs that much,

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.440
 that's like insanely capital intensive.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.280
 - Yeah.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.320
 - And if it turns out like there isn't a great business model

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.680
 around this stuff, you know that that's like the part

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.760
 that needs to be figured out.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.880
 I think right now people are willing,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.560
 I'm willing to pay like crazy amounts of money

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.560
 'cause this is super useful for me,

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.560
 but you have to figure out how to make it

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.320
 effectively free and derive the money from somewhere else

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.680
 that always falls back into advertising.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.760
 But with something like this,

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:04.040
 advertising so clearly dilutes the value in a lot of ways.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:04.880
 - Oh, wow, yeah.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.680
 - 'Cause the whole pitch is like insane accuracy

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.520
 that you don't get.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.560
 So it's like, what is the business model?

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.640
 And we'll see like it might, yeah, we have no idea.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.160
 I'm okay with them growing and being successful.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.720
 I know there's general anti-corporate sentiment,

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.440
 which I get, but you know, they're gonna create,

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.040
 they probably are, how much value do you think

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.880
 they've already created?

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.840
 Like they've probably saved billions in dollars already.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.240
 Just in like equals times,

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.560
 they probably will end up saving trillions and trillions

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.120
 of dollars if they capture one or two percent of it.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.440
 That's fine by me.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.520
 So yeah, I don't know.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.360
 We'll see.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.360
 - One of my favorite things on this podcast X

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.240
 is when we've basically landed the plane

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.680
 and then I ask you a question like that

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.400
 and just like totally spark things back up.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.240
 It's just probably like a terrible thing to do

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.040
 as a potter gasher.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:50.880
 I love doing that.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.120
 - I mean, let's just double the length of our pockets.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.800
 - Let's go to one hour.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.560
 - It's weird how many times we hit like right on 24 minutes.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.200
 Not like 24 zero, but like they round up to 24 minutes.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.080
 Every single episode, this one's gonna be a little longer,

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.440
 but like that happens a lot.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.960
 It's interesting to me.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.240
 We're just getting so efficient.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.480
 We're just like little AI monkeys or something.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.960
 Okay, we should probably get off here.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.000
 This has been fun decks.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:14.840
 - Okay. - So it again.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.840
 - Yeah.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.680
 - See ya.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.520
 - See ya.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.660
 (upbeat music)
