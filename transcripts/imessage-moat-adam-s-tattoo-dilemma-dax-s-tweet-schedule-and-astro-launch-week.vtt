WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 Can hear you for what? Oh, no. Oh, no. It's my fault. Oh, no. I'm the problem. Hang on. Oh, no. It's me

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.720
 Sorry, I was late. I'm setting up my texts.com

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.920
 Have you have you seen texts calm? Yeah, okay, I've tried it. Oh big sigh and I don't know

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.400
 I've tried that and I've tried a few others that are like it. Oh, there's others. There's alternatives even there was one

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.720
 I feel this idea pops up every once in a while. Is it not good? It seems like the answer to all my problems

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.380
 Okay, so here's the thing

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.760
 Yes, it always seems that way and I think this is in the category of a tarpet problem. Have you heard of that concept?

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.660
 I'm sorry. I'll let call it a tarpet. Yeah, no, there's like an entire category of

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.360
 problems that are very attractive

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.180
 That they seem like obviously attractive to founders to users, etc

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:24.960
 And you'll just see them companies pop up around the exact idea over and over and I kind of wonder if this is a tarpet problem

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.240
 where like it seems really obvious but then the company gets started and then it never

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.300
 Ends up going anywhere because it actually turns out. They just don't take off

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.120
 Yeah, but yeah the key thing with those is like it just keeps happening forever

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.320
 So I kind of wonder if this is one of those

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.460
 Those categories, but we'll see I mean people people seem to like it. I guess like it's free right now

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.840
 I don't know if I would pay for it. I haven't used it enough to know if it changes my life

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.480
 Yeah, but I guess if they made me pay for it. I'm not sure that I would so

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.560
 Back in the day. I used to use something called pigeon. Do you ever use that?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.220
 No, so back when like things were simpler, but there were still a lot of different chat

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.720
 Places like there was like aim like MSM messenger

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.660
 IRC like all these different things there was this tool called pigeon that I would use

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.320
 Like constantly I use it every day. I talked to my friends. Whatever. It was similar concept. We're aggregated a bunch of different

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.640
 Different services into one single app. Yeah, but I

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.800
 Just feel like things were simpler back then where like the differences between each service were like really minimal

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.720
 whereas with most of these I found it to be like

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.680
 Kind of janky. I don't know like it. Maybe they executed on it. Well, I haven't I haven't tried it fully. So yeah

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.840
 I'm just I'm minutes into my experience here. So I don't I couldn't tell you. Are you happy and excited?

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.840
 I mean, I'm excited right now

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.040
 But again, I haven't I'm literally I'm just in the adding my accounts phase

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.120
 Which I always like this kind of part of using anything

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.800
 Like going into the settings like as soon as I start using anything new I go straight into the settings

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.000
 I look at every single setting. Yeah, I'm one of those people. I know it's not everybody set it up

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.800
 And then and then you never open the app again, and then I never open again. Yeah

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.900
 That's so my personality - so what are you what are you gonna connect to this like what are it?

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.120
 Everything I really connected everything. Oh, okay. I message signal

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.840
 Twitter LinkedIn

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.560
 Discord very excited about Twitter and discord being in one place I

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.960
 Was just adding slack and then I'm like why am I adding slack?

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.740
 I don't really use slack anymore, and I have no reason to still use it you can also add open AI which I added

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.780
 Well, you got a TV from here. Yeah, that's kind of cool

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.800
 and then

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.680
 Facebook Messenger I added I don't use Facebook or messenger, so I don't know why I added it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.480
 But I I still have an account so I did it so it's a lot of things so would you so would you stop using the discord app?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.480
 I mean theoretically that's the idea right

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.280
 like if I were

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.120
 For going down this path the idea would be to stop using all those apps and just messages in one place

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.760
 I would probably use the Twitter app less like I would see the timeline less. Oh, I set up your

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.520
 Your one sec thing really does work. I haven't been on Twitter for a week

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:36.600
 I have no idea what's going on, but it's really annoying when it like you think about opening the Twitter app and it's like that little

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.800
 I'm not gonna take a breath. Yeah, it shows you how many times you've tried to open it in the last toy part

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.120
 It's a crazy number right the numbers always wait. Yeah. How did I do that? Yeah? Yeah, yeah

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.080
 So so here's the thing here's how it goes for me with these kinds of apps, right?

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.520
 So I'll set it up somewhere to you. I'm excited at connect everything out of these in one place

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.560
 But I can't actually stop using the discord app because we run our company through there. Oh

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.840
 So there's things you wouldn't get like there's more to just

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.240
 To these apps and just messages. Yeah, yeah, so that there's a whole bunch of things. I would still need a discord app

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.120
 Then you look at something like so on my computer. There's two

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.880
 Things I always have up which is slack and discord

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.880
 like a dedicated spot for them. They're always there and

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:30.200
 Then I think about okay, can I merge slack into here? No, I can't because there's a whole bunch of things that I

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.600
 Me and Liz use it to manage all our house things. I use it. I have like all kinds of alerts going in there

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.480
 Just because everyone has a slack integration and to me. I use slack as like a unified

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:49.640
 Notification stream which I think it works great for email should be that but obviously email gets filled with a bunch of other garbage

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.800
 So it's hard to control where slack you have exercise control over what shows up

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.920
 So I still need both of those up

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.600
 So now I have the third app that I also need up

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.360
 So I feel like it doesn't really get rid of anything. It only adds yeah for me. Okay, I could see that

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.440
 That's where I usually end up landing, but again, maybe not everyone is in that exact situation

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.000
 But it's hard for me to actually remove anything with an app like this. Yeah, well, I'm gonna try

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.520
 I'm gonna try like see how much of my usage is

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:23.160
 Just DMS back and forth the idea of discord Twitter and I message being together is really compelling

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.640
 Yeah, at least on paper. We'll see. Can you think can you imagine all the hacks they had to do to get items is working?

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.720
 Oh, yeah, it's got a run like on your Mac in the background. Oh, is that how they do it? Okay?

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.720
 Yeah, it's like it's running

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:42.600
 There's a there's a yeah, there's another app called air message or something and it's a way for Android people to use that message, but

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.740
 So obviously one option so just running the background of Mac

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:53.640
 But they even have ways to get it working without that but involves all this crazy stuff with like

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.880
 Getting an iPhone and doing all these like sim card tricks and it'll work for three months and every three months

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.880
 You got like reset it and do this thing

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.920
 I read that and then I was like, okay, I'm gonna buy an iPhone

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.000
 Yeah, exactly. I used an Android phone for like a week

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.320
 I don't remember why I think it was like I got an Android phone to test when we were building the

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.200
 Stapuse app a long time ago. I wanted to test it on Android

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.080
 And then I was like I'm just gonna use this phone and try life without an iPhone

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.400
 I've had iPhone since the original iPhone like always been iPhone the eye messaging was the thing that got me

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.400
 I couldn't I couldn't handle

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.940
 Yeah, I just couldn't give away. I message. So that was it. I was back to iPhone in like a week

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.140
 It's crazy. I was sticky that is I was so I've been using Android since

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.400
 So all the way around for me like I was using Android pretty much since it came out

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.440
 And I just switched to iPhone in the past year

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.920
 And it was for two reasons one the iMessage thing was annoying

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.560
 And I hate it. I hate that like that network effect is yeah

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:59.280
 The strongest network effect example I've ever seen because it involves like a really expensive purchase

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.840
 Yeah, so that was annoying

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:07.360
 But it is a very good app like I love certain things they did that I don't know why other apps don't copy like

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.980
 You know how they do the threaded thing where you like reply to a message and it like

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:16.840
 Layer and you just see just those messages amazing way to do that concept like I feel like every

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.440
 Chat option should just steal that

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.960
 Then the other reason I switched was for a long time Android was

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:32.760
 If you got like the Google pixel or like was one of like the ones that were like really minimal stripped down just the bare basics

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.000
 It all worked

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.560
 Very stable phones like pretty high quality

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.680
 The past like two years

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.240
 I don't know what happened like the quality that software quality has been declining like crazy like crazy amounts of bugs

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.800
 Like just was not a good experience and I like don't use my phone enough to justify

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.000
 It not always working a hundred percent of the time

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.680
 So I was just like I was very I know I know I say I seem to get something that I know is

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:02.180
 Not gonna annoy me ever and I don't know how to use my iPhone like I like don't use any of the features

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:08.000
 I don't understand notifications work. I don't understand any of it, but again. I don't use my phone for much

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.680
 Yeah, it's interesting to think of that perspective like I've used iPhone so long

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.680
 I've seen features come and go or come along in iOS you know over a long period of time

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.960
 Like you come again brand new. I wonder yeah, how overwhelming that is like you just ignore most of it

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.720
 Yeah, it gave me a taste of what it must be like cuz whenever you see people that are older that like struggle using technology

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.720
 And you're like how could they not get it so obvious

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.680
 but it's crazy that there's such a difference between

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.120
 Things getting complex like within your lifetime

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.080
 We're like a simple version comes out then like they add one feature then they add another feature

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.640
 I don't know if you're kind of growing with it super easy to go in that process versus just being dropped into something

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.200
 It's like it you like can't really understand until you're in that position

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.320
 I think about this a lot with web development and the software in general

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:04.160
 I never felt like I had to really put in the effort to learn software programming because stuff

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.200
 Just got complex at the same rate that I was gaining experience

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.320
 Yeah, and I imagine like starting web development today and like

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.080
 Learning all that stuff. It just must be

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.800
 So much more difficult than it was for us. I would think so. Yeah, no, I

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:26.040
 I don't know my powers going out. I have lights going out. There was a noise

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.760
 rated

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:37.560
 When I hear rated I just think like we're streaming oh, but yeah

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.080
 The other kind of rating I've never been that kind of rated hope to to never be

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.400
 Yeah, I want to revisit this it's funny

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.080
 I haven't thought about this in a long time

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.360
 But I remember like growing up thinking like watching my dad

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.400
 Pick up our Nintendo 64 controller and just be terrible at video games

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.840
 Like just couldn't figure it out

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.600
 I'd like look at the controller and we were just so natural as little kids using that stuff

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.640
 And I remember like growing up thinking like what's gonna be the thing when I'm a dad and I have kids

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.120
 That I'm just so dumb at and that they can just wizz through

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.040
 And I have an eight-year-old now like I've got I mean I've been a parent for a while now. I

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.520
 Can't think of what that is. I don't feel like I'm bad. Maybe it's cuz it's the occupation

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.000
 But he also doesn't play video games. I don't know like if you played today's video games

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.320
 Maybe I'd look like an idiot. Maybe if I picked up whatever they use these days

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:33.760
 I don't think you would cuz you had a whole call of duty phase, right? I did. Yeah, so that's okay

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.920
 Hasn't evolved past that it's really like the same as that like I don't think I think it would be fine

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.200
 Yeah, I also think about that. Well, so in this category

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.720
 I was also worried about this cuz as someone that is really into tech

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.000
 I don't want to like one day feel like the world is not understandable to me and that's yeah

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.320
 Yeah, but I have my dad's good example because she we worked in tech and

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:07.480
 It's funny that there's like this weird thing so one no he never got to a point where he didn't understand what was going on

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.000
 In the tech world he's able to keep up with it continues to work in a like understands at all like so it wasn't like

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.880
 The world got too complicated and he couldn't keep up. So that one fear is gone

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.520
 But on the flip side

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:24.000
 There was this weird dynamic where he like deeply understands a lot of this stuff

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 But he like couldn't figure out how to turn on the speakers and our TV set

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.160
 And like but I don't think that's like a dude that wasn't really like him being overwhelmed

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.240
 I think he just didn't care. He like refused to yeah

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.360
 I think he was like yeah, I put my effort at work and that's where I like do all the tech stuff

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.240
 Oh, I do so bad like just did not want to learn it at home

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.680
 Like I always had to like fix it for him Casey gets frustrated with me sometimes because she does feel like I use my brain

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.120
 So much at work that like after in real life like when we do stuff I'm just so dumb

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.080
 Like I just don't do anything correctly and like I'll do things that just take a lot longer

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.160
 And she's like you could just just think about it for two minute like you could have done this so much faster

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
 I guess I could have wasn't thinking at all

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.920
 Brain is off

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.360
 And I don't want I don't want that to be the case like that sounds awful to go your whole like for your kids

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.680
 I don't know. Yeah, I think their dad was just this idiot their entire lives

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:26.160
 But it's hard you only have so much mental energy every day. I guess yeah me and let's have this thing where if I

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.800
 If we like get something new and I'm the one that sets it up

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.520
 For whatever reason that makes it impossible for her to like learn how to use it like so always go through me for the thing

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:43.360
 Yeah, that's the thing right if we store a lot of our memory a lot of our knowledge in our spouses or in people who are close to us

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.320
 That's like a whole there's a name for it. I think a paper probably there's a study

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:55.760
 No, it is like when you lose somebody like when you lose somebody really close to you the part of it is

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:01.640
 I mean, there's the loss and the grief with that but then also like there's so many practical things that you just don't even know about

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.840
 Everyday life that they took care of like they took care of the I don't know

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.000
 Balancing the check, but what are people doing? I don't know

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.680
 Whatever people do in life. I can't think of a single thing right now

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.840
 Yeah, like knowing you know what the kids eat like Casey is on top of their lunches

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.680
 Like those kind of things you just store a lot of life in the other the other person

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.920
 You don't have to learn those things or remember those things. Yeah, it's like a like doubly sucks

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:36.200
 It's like you're dealing with lose someone and there's like all those random stress. They didn't even know exactly up. Yep. Yep. Yeah, that is tough

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:42.520
 Can I can I totally change topics? Yeah? Yeah, first of all, I mean, I want to talk about like I don't know

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:48.560
 What's been going on at like is there anything going on right now and tech Twitter tech X whatever?

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.240
 It's called I just haven't been on for like a week and I want to catch up on that

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.800
 But also I have a totally non tech and random question

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:02.920
 You have tattoos, right just one. Yeah, just one this is one of my own tattoos

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.520
 Yeah, does it have like a meaning to you? Is it just cool?

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:13.440
 So many that's the way to do it. Let me tell let me explain the concept like the meaning thing with my tattoo

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.680
 so

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.240
 For those of you that can't see this I have two

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.680
 Black lines around my farm. It's a pretty popular tattoo. You've probably seen a bunch of people. I've seen it. Yeah

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.840
 That's what I thought of it. I was like, oh, Dax has that tattoo

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.600
 I saw some energy just to have that similar tattoo. Yeah, go ahead

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:34.960
 You've you picked like the woods and the race between them like I spent so much time like drawing it out to get the exact thing that I wanted

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.280
 And whenever I see other people's tattoos that are some around like they went too thick on the top line

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.680
 I know the mind perfect so

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.200
 But here's a thing with this tattoo

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:53.440
 I was once at a store as a jewelry store and I was I was looking for stuff and

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:59.560
 The guy working there was like oh nice had to I have the same money rolls up his sleeves

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.480
 They shows me the same one and he goes who did you lose? And I'm like

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:09.720
 Nobody I just thought it looked cool and he goes, okay. Oh, no, there's a meaning to it

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.480
 I got this when I lost my brother or something like that and I was like goddamn. I feel oh no

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.520
 Just like I thought it looked cool and he was like I love my family member. Oh

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.080
 He like he like was he wasn't friendly about it

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.200
 He was like kind of giving me like a look and I just awkwardly left

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.720
 Yeah, like you're not part of the club. You tried to be part of the club. You're not part of the club

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.800
 Yeah, you don't belong. So for me tattoos. I like to keep them a hundred percent aesthetic

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:44.160
 I just like the way they look visually. I think it's grabbing me into it is great. I just don't I struggle with that because I

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.880
 Feel like I'm just gonna

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.920
 Okay, here's everything I've talked about with it. If I look at all this stuff

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:56.000
 I cared about five years ago. I just cringe at myself. I think it's true for most people like you're just like every five years you just find yourself

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.400
 Like lame, right?

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.800
 So I'm pretty sure whatever deep meaning that I currently ascribe to something

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.400
 I'm gonna look as a clue. It's gonna feel like a cliche later interesting some stuff. Some stuff is some stuff is timeless. That's true, but

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.360
 Yeah, I just haven't hit on something that's so foundational that I want to put it on my body

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.960
 Yeah, so like if five years ago I would have gotten like, you know, the binary stuff written up my arm today

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.780
 I don't care about program. I've been like full. I was I thinking

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:28.720
 Are you thinking about getting one? So the jiu-jitsu community very tatted. I would say very tatted up

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.680
 Uh, there's a lot of it and a lot of like my heroes in jiu-jitsu

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.400
 Uh like people that are well into it brown belts and black belts

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.280
 They've got like the full sleeves and they just it just looks really cool

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.960
 Yeah, but I feel like to come up with that like a full sleeve

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.040
 You gotta have a lot of ideas like

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.040
 Into to really like they look cool on these people

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.440
 I don't know if it would look cool on me and and then like the rest of my life. I have this full sleeve

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.080
 You could go like half sleeves like a more long sleeves. I don't know. I just don't know if i'm a tattoo person

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.680
 I have no tattoos and to start just because of jiu-jitsu feels like a kind of thing five years

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:10.880
 Like maybe you shouldn't go jiu-jitsu tattoo the thing with sleeves though is uh, so you can go two ways

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.560
 You can do what I do where I did where I had a very specific thing in mind

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.600
 And I went to someone that could execute it really well by the way as simple as this tattoo is it took five hours

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:26.400
 She spent one straight lines like that. Yeah, she spent one hour just drawing like the outline of the lines

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.880
 So she can trace over it and she did she like initially did it and I was like that looks great

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.520
 And then she spent another 50 minutes straightening it up and I was like

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.040
 Wow

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:40.720
 I paid a lot of attention to this and it came out great for that reason but other people go to just really great artists and they're like

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.360
 Just just do your thing

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.120
 Uh, and I think like let them come up with yeah. Yeah, like for sleeves. I imagine it's a lot more like that because

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.240
 Yeah, like how are you gonna come up? I'm not gonna come up with it. Yeah, I might say I want this and this in it

00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:00.000
 But like yeah and oftentimes like they're built up over time. So like you kind of add to it progressively and to be clear

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.200
 I wasn't saying I should i'm gonna get like the word jiu-jitsu on my body

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.920
 No, I meant like in the

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.760
 Something about in the ghee. Yeah, like when you see it's something about it

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.320
 It just looks really cool coming out the bottom of the ghee or whatever

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.800
 Yeah, it's funny because it does change your vibe a ton. So oh, yeah

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.840
 I like forget that I have this tattoo like I've had it for so long

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.720
 I like catch it in reflection once a month like okay that that was good

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.080
 But I don't think about it at all

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:29.920
 But I realize when people see me because it's so prominent and visible like that's one of the first things that they see

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.040
 So they're like impression or like they're understanding. They probably project a lot of stuff into it

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:40.560
 Yeah colors and i'm like that's really funny because I bet that whatever they're projecting is like extremely inaccurate

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:47.520
 Like you don't think of yourself as being uh that vibe that you have that tattoo

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.320
 No, they probably think i'm like like a really they probably like

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.040
 Ascribed some kind of coolness to me that isn't they probably think you lost someone really close to you

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.920
 I don't think i've ever known anyone that's died. So it's like i've not lost anyone close to me ever

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.480
 Yeah, yeah, I mean I say that sounds awful

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.240
 I've lost grandparents and they were close to me

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.000
 But not people that are in my life every day like i've never lived close to my grandparents

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.560
 So yeah, i've not lost like

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:19.440
 Someone in that immediate sphere of influence. Yeah, and that's a fear of mine. Honestly is like

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.760
 That I won't handle it. Well, I don't know. I think about this all the time. Do you think about that stuff?

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.040
 Yeah, me too because I feel like a lot of people go through that young and they're like

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.360
 Yeah, like they're tested

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.640
 Yeah, the probably worse it is even for me with with pets, right?

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:38.480
 I've had a I had a family dog that died, but he died after I'd moved out and hadn't really been home for years

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.720
 Yep, then like so I I haven't even experienced that so I had that too. Yeah, so when someone zuko dies

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.880
 It's gonna be like the first close pet that dies. I think it's gonna be from the beginning

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:55.120
 Yeah, really intense and then like obviously with people it's like another level. So yeah, I feel like I don't know what's gonna happen

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.360
 I worry that i'm like i've not been

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.080
 Tested in any way on that front and like what if i'm a terrible greever or I don't know

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.360
 I spiral into depression or I mean it would obviously depend on

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.960
 The circumstances and how close up a person we're talking. Yeah, because there's definitely degrees

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.200
 But yeah, no, that's something I think about all the time and I I think I

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:20.080
 Did you do the personality stuff like personality test? Do you I feel like you're gonna be like those are dumb?

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.520
 No, no, no

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.360
 I think we talked about before but uh the time of the Myers Briggs or whatever

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 Myers Briggs or maybe this gets more

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.040
 Thing anyagram. Yeah, yeah, so I think that's more I know true true

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.840
 The thing with how we say is it Briggs Myers and Myers Briggs? I don't I always think it's Myers Briggs

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.680
 Okay, I think that's right. We'll go with that

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:46.080
 I am I have such a stereotypical personality that all of those personality tests are like insanely accurate

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.840
 I have like a very standard like well-defined well-understood personality

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.040
 Uh, so yeah, it's an intg

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.840
 Type 8. Yeah. Yeah, you're a jerk. I know

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:01.360
 Yeah, so whenever whenever I read those it feels

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:07.680
 Insane it feels like magic that they're able to pinpoint these exact ways I think and feel but

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:14.000
 I've noticed personality tests in general are very effective on on me. So yeah, there's something to them

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.640
 But you think maybe not everybody yeah, I imagine some people it's like there may be a little bit more unique or that it can make some different things

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.480
 Yeah, okay. I feel like I'm pretty well. I mean, I always have that experience of reading

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.800
 You're probably an INTJ also. I would guess I am. Yeah, so Myers Briggs

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:36.480
 I don't I don't know much about like what my personality is in Myers Briggs Casey got really an Instagram

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.720
 So I know like I can look at people and be like that

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.160
 That's a type 5 if I've ever seen why you chuckling me say that

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.360
 Because like personalities

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.520
 No, not necessarily. Uh, well eight. I mean like eight is like the people I know who are eight really good leaders

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.320
 But very hard on people very like I joke and said you're an eight. I don't know that you actually are

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.200
 I think that sounds like me, but it does. I mean the leading the the being hard

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.720
 Uh, I'm a nine which is like peacekeeper. I don't like conflict

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.520
 I don't want anyone to have conflict that I was a middle child

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.840
 A lot of that stuff. Yeah, but one of the things about anyagram they go into like

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.960
 Deepest fears for each personality type. I don't know how that can be like I guess

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.160
 Maybe it makes sense that it would be tied to your personality that you're I don't know

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.440
 But my greatest fear is a type 9 is the fear of loss

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:30.800
 So I'm just assumed it's related to that that like I really fear losing like a child or a spouse that that kind of stuff

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.600
 Uh, just sort of haunts if I ever go to dark places. That's where that's where I go

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.920
 I try not to though

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.400
 Try to just flood my brain with technology and jiu-jitsu

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.720
 So I don't have time to think about this stuff someone should fake their own death for you so that you can like oh god

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.800
 Don't do this to me next

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.200
 Don't know so I could just attest run

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.880
 No, no

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.880
 You try

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.440
 You fake your death. We'll see how I handle

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:06.320
 Someone on tech twitter needs to do this where they like fake their death and they like rise from the dead and it's like this whole epic thing

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.800
 That would be pretty awesome

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:13.840
 That would be people would be angry and but yeah, I feel you could do it in a way where it's like

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.160
 It's meaningful and deep where it's tasteful. Yeah, maybe maybe

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:23.360
 Meaningful like we would all come out of it and say we learned so much more to life

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.240
 script and

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.240
 And tailwind

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:34.000
 So can you catch me up like what's been going on? I may have you been active. I see tweets

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.680
 I always say it'd be sstk version 3. I'm complaining about it. How do you have so many thoughts?

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.560
 How do you how do you do every morning if you look at my tweet patterns? I'm surprised

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:50.720
 That nobody has called me out on this, but I will post like four tweets every morning

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.600
 Just back to back. Yeah, it's because

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.320
 During my morning routine. That's like when I'm just thinking

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:04.640
 I'm like doing stuff. That's like when I'm working out or when I'm like, uh-huh doing stuff with Zuko like my brain is elsewhere

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.040
 So I'll just have like three or four thoughts and I'll like posting back to back in the morning and I like won't really post still

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:18.000
 The evening, but it's like my routine every single every single day. Uh, I'm now. I'm just reading all of your tweets

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.960
 Uh, it's just kind of stay on top of the next tweets

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.560
 Uh

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:30.640
 The stucy thing was that stucy the s you didn't growing up you didn't ever everyone

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:37.040
 I haven't met a single person that doesn't know what that was and I like I I swear to you

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.080
 I literally never saw it. I don't know how to draw it. Well, I do now because we were talking about yesterday

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:49.440
 Uh somehow I missed it, but I grew up in america in the 90s in the 2000s. I was very prevalent

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.640
 I'm my brother had like notebooks full of those. I don't know what the deal was me. What was I doing?

00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:00.240
 Yeah, that's so wild knowledge gaps are so fascinating to me. Yeah. Oh, did I ever tell you about my turkey chicken thing?

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.880
 No, what was that? I ever told you this so I was in college a freshman college

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.680
 This is just so like the Ozarks just thinking of like

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:12.560
 I don't know education in a small rural area in the middle of the country

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.480
 Uh, I made it to my freshman year in the big city of springfield

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.960
 And learned that a turkey is not in fact a male chicken

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.760
 I thought turkeys were male chickens

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.440
 Chickens were the females turkeys were the males

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.280
 And the way I found out was just very embarrassing

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:37.520
 It was like within a week of also finding out what a cul-de-sac is we had no cul-de-sac in my small town of willow springs

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.040
 So somebody was like, I'll pick you up at the cul-de-sac. I'm like the what?

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.480
 The cul-de-sac. I don't know what you're saying

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:51.520
 That is a really fancy word. cul-de-sac. It really is. Is that french? I think yeah cul-de-sac

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.240
 To this song. I actually don't know what that translates to. That was a terrible french accent

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.360
 I don't need my own spot in the road. I don't know

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:05.440
 I love cul-de-sac. Here's the craziest part. I lived on one in New York City. How insane is that?

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.360
 Oh, in New York, there's cul-de-sacs. That must have been in my street

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:16.640
 The street that my building was on or at the end of a street in Manhattan in Manhattan. Yes in the middle of cul-de-sac

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.200
 It was a cul-de-sac. It was great because when we call noober, it just pulls up and they call the sac

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.040
 Yeah, it's a that's a far cry from what I'm used to in Manhattan

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.640
 Yeah, like it's great. I mean, I don't drive but just the roads don't seem to stop ever

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:37.840
 Well, I guess that's why we were right by the water. So, you know, it's the roads got to end at the water

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.360
 Oh, you've told me this. I think battery park. Yeah, battery park. Yeah. Yeah

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:48.000
 You're right at the tippy tip of Manhattan. Great place. If anyone's looking for an apartment in battery park city

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.960
 Please reach out to me because my interest rates keep growing up

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.640
 Oh, no, how does that work? Oh, it's it's an arm. Did you tell me this? Yeah, it's an arm. Yeah

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.560
 Our interest rates now

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:05.040
 New mortgages are like seven percent something crazy like that. Yeah, which is like

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:11.840
 Are people doing new mortgages or is this just killed the housing? No, I think nobody is really buying or selling

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.120
 That's it's so hard to get data on because I'm trying to I'm I need a constant understand what my apartment

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.640
 Is yeah, how you that so I understand like what makes sense for me to do

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:26.960
 Uh, but I can't trust the data because like the number of transactions that are happening are so low

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.480
 So it's interesting the data wildly is every transaction

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:36.480
 Yeah, what does that do to the housing market to the broader economy? Like it's as weird stalemate

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.240
 It's like the naive thought is interest rates go up

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:45.360
 Which means mortgages are more expensive which puts downward pressure on house prices

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.440
 So you would think prices would go down

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.520
 that's not what's happening because

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.760
 Nobody is nobody wants to get a new mortgage

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.880
 So nobody is selling there. Yeah, nobody's selling their house. So the supply is there

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:05.760
 Uh, so I think it's like a weird stalemate and I don't think stalemates can last forever eventually one side is forced

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.560
 Yeah, I imagine it sounds like like uh

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:14.400
 The plates like earthquakes. Yeah, well those plates called tectonic. They're just like yeah

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:20.320
 Tectonic eventually like they'll get stuck and they'll just kind of keep building pressure and pressure until it just breaks and then goes crazy

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:25.200
 Yeah, like the pacific north west is due for that giant one. Yeah, you heard that

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.440
 Yeah, I feel like that feels like the housing market is in that situation, which doesn't sound good

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:35.040
 And whenever it does my current plan is uh, i'm gonna switch careers. I'm gonna get into

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:43.040
 Uh, like bioengineering. I'm going to engineer the next covid covid 2.0. I'm gonna release it out in the world

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.880
 Cause the cause everything is shut down again. The fed will have to lower interest rates

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.680
 And then I can buy a house. That's probably as simple as path

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:58.160
 That's simple. Yeah, really simple. Maybe not easy, but simple. There's just a few steps

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.240
 It's the best option right now. I think of all options looking out that's the only way

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:10.400
 It's gonna happen. Could you not have gone a more positive path? Like I don't know actually invent lk99 make everything in the world cheap and

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:18.080
 Free energy as you said vision. Oh, right. Right. Right. Uh, did I hear murmurings?

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.560
 Sorry, we keep talking about lk99 or I keep trying to

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:25.760
 Did I see a murmuring that like maybe it's not all over? Maybe there's still a chance?

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.880
 I don't know. I I go I haven't been keeping track of it, but I imagine that

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.840
 uh, what stuff like this it's it's gonna be like

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.680
 Conspiracy theory forever. I mean it's possible. But I mean with everything like this

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.400
 It's always like maybe you can work and people kind of keep okay

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.800
 I'm just gonna forget about it then. I don't know. Who knows. I I feel like it's

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:49.120
 It's still too early to know. I mean, maybe it maybe it's not but

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:56.240
 I don't know what stuff like this. You just never know. Uh, I just saw on twitter, uh, astro is launching all kinds of stuff

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.040
 Have you kept talking about this? Yeah launch week. They're launch week starlight

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.200
 They announced yesterday that they're now sponsored by vercell

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.280
 So astros interesting because they are

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:12.720
 I think they represent like the opposite extreme of how you can run an open source company compared to sst

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:18.560
 Uh, so with sst to be honest. We don't do much of like the traditional open source stuff

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:23.680
 We are like just trying to get the product to be sustainable and like build a company around it

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.920
 uh astros split into kind of two different groups like one is

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:33.840
 The foundation type part of astro which just manages open source part and then there's like astro the company

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:39.280
 And they kind of separate their finances in this way too. So when they get this sponsorship from vercell

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.000
 That's for specifically the open source part. So it's going back to community

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:51.040
 It's getting reinvested in in all that. It's like not revenue for the company. Yeah, then that was there. That was our announcement from yesterday

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:56.960
 Um, yeah, I wanted to point that out because people like I think a lot of people look at that and they're like, oh, they're getting

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:02.560
 That's like that's a business model. They're getting paid by vercell, but it's not it's just like a bonus

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:08.560
 That just helps them run the open source effort. Yeah, it's like set people who kind of like work on one of the other they don't

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:15.760
 They don't necessarily like people at astro are either on the open source team or they're sort of on the commercial

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:22.400
 I think they might flow between the two, but it's like I think there's people that are not employed by astro but still get money

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:28.000
 Oh, gotcha. That makes sense. Yeah, but yeah, they're launching starlet. I think that they already launched it

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.960
 Was that beta before? I think it I think it it I had heard of it before so I think it's been out there

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:40.000
 But maybe it's the version one or something. Uh, so that's their docs template. So it's like it's built on top of astro

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.960
 But it's everything you need to build good docs

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.480
 Uh, I think we will probably eventually switch to this. We're using docusaurus currently, which is

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.720
 Terrible. I hate it. It's been around a long time, right? I mean, that's yeah

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.000
 And a lot of reasons like a lot of the stuff in our docs that aren't great

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:02.080
 It's like limited by by docusaurus. I just so hard to work in uh is whenever I have a part of

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:06.400
 My system that isn't a joy to work in

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.320
 It just naturally gets less attention

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.200
 Yeah, and then like when their docs aren't as good as it could be because i'm like

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.080
 It's always a pain when i'm in there to do anything so I do it less than I should

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:22.720
 So starlet looks great. We'll probably switch to that at some point. Cool. Can we talk about open source economics for a sec?

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.520
 Yeah, like where is that today because I know the last few years there's been a lot of talk of like

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.600
 How do we make it sustainable and

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.480
 Is like github sponsorships the answer did it work? Are people now sustainable?

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:40.160
 I don't really like people's approaches to this generally. I think it falls under the camp of

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:45.120
 Okay, let's make it easier for people to contribute to these

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.320
 Projects, right? So I think one idea

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:52.160
 And this idea does make sense. Um, I like it as a concept

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.980
 But I don't think it's going to fundamentally change anything

00:33:54.980 --> 00:34:02.640
 Have a way where you can just allocate a budget every month 20 bucks a month me personally 100 bucks a month whatever

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:07.760
 And it just like gets attributed across like there's a kind of growing fund of people that are opting into this

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:13.440
 I think that's a good thing to have. I think that's like a better form of the sponsorship system or like right now

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.280
 I have to go remember to like

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.440
 Individually subscribe to each each person

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.200
 Um having just a general pool and letting like github distribute it. I think i'm

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:28.400
 It's probably a better system. You're saying github distributes it automatically based on what software you're downloading and you just

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:34.800
 You could yeah, you could do it that way or you can just have a general pool like nine different than how spotify would work

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:39.680
 Uh, it's something it's a kind of issues with that as well. Um, I think people have talked about yet

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.560
 like analyzing your npm dependencies and like

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:48.160
 And distributing out based off of that. Yeah, I think that helps but I don't really think that like

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.040
 That like moves in need a little bit. I don't think that really like

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.240
 Solves this problem. Mm-hmm. I think

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.880
 The reality is a lot of open source

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:01.360
 I think if you are going to do open source, you need to understand how to make it sustainable

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.360
 That's like your job as an author

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.920
 And I just don't think people think about this where they don't feel like it should be their responsibility

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.080
 You have to figure it out. There's a difference. There's a range of spectrum. There's a huge spectrum with that, right?

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.240
 It might be something very small

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.560
 Small project that can never be like in its own business

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.480
 That's fine if mentally you're like, this is a small thing i'm investing in but it gets my name out there

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:30.480
 The ROI I get is like from increased job opportunities consulting opportunities, whatever like you have a clear mapping of i'm working on this because it drives

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:36.080
 This other other thing. Mm-hmm. Then there's like bigger projects, which you can just define a business model around anything that

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.560
 Can still work? I think a lot of projects that like struggle with this

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.720
 I like look at what they try and it's always just a call for donations

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.240
 And I feel like you can think of something more clever than than that. Yeah, so I just think people need to that

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.320
 People don't like this but I just put it back on the the authors like you need to

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.720
 Just because you built something doesn't mean like the world has to make it sustainable like that

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:04.160
 Just kind of is your job to figure it out. It's like part of part of the process. Yeah, I like as a consumer

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.080
 I there's been cases where so there was this really

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:17.200
 Pintura, I think it used to be called Doka now. It's pintura. It's just like really good image editor component like a javascript

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.880
 component for doing like image cropping and whatever

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:25.360
 Uh, it's made back on a rick. I'm blinking on his last name

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.240
 But he's this indie developer and he sells it

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.520
 As like a download like you just download this zip

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.320
 And every time there's new version you're downloading another zip

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.800
 And and then you're just kind of like dropping

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.040
 The folder for your type of project if it's a react project or angular or whatever

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:46.480
 He's got all these different folders and you kind of drop it in your project and that's how you consume the components

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.840
 It's like one of those things where you'd really like it to just be

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:54.000
 Where another mpm install like a dependency that you're just installing

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.440
 But like there's is there really plumbing and ecosystem around like paid

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.640
 Packages that you can buy because that'd be really nice if I could just pay for it and just install it that way

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.720
 Yeah, I do think this needs to be a thing. So the the elixir founder

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:12.240
 Uh at some point he left

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:18.000
 Working on elixir full-time and I remember he initially was working on this product that was to do that

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.040
 It was to help people distribute paid elixir

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:26.640
 Packages. Yeah, uh, and he was like working all the plumbing and stuff ultimately ended up abandoning it

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.400
 I think just the at least in that community that maybe the market just wasn't there

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:37.120
 I think it's definitely viable npm just because it's like the universal thing like if you have front-end everyone has npm somewhere

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:42.320
 Um, I think the team buying npm has not shipped anything good ever

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:49.920
 I have I have so many problems with npm. I'm like, I just hate how much they control the ecosystem and how little is it owned by

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.560
 Yeah, it's owned by magus off now

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.120
 But like I just think it's like can we get some resources over here?

00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:00.000
 Microsoft could we could we maybe inject a little life into the npm ecosystem? That'd be great

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:06.240
 So I think there is probably an avenue for that so replica has this issue because they are not an open-source product

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.560
 They are a paid product

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.000
 If you pay for they do give you the source just so you can like debug it and stuff

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.880
 They had to invent their own plumbing for this like they had to

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.440
 They like they make you get a license key and you kind of put it in your front end and they kind of track certain things

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.240
 Yeah, they had to invent a lot of it

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.320
 But I do think it's a really great model because they can

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:28.240
 You know sustain themselves as a really good product worth paying for yeah

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.880
 But ultimately it is code that just runs

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.520
 Inside of your application, but yeah, I think I think you're right. It's that the plumbing isn't there

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.840
 Yeah, because there's a lot of stuff like that that I would pay for that just makes life a lot easier

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.920
 And even if you can't directly monitor

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:47.520
 And I think a lot of cases you can't it doesn't make sense to directly monetize the tool because you want it to be as widely used

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:52.240
 As possible. Yeah, I like for sst like we would never charge you for using sst

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.360
 That's like not viable, but it's up to us to figure out

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.200
 Something complementary that is valuable enough to some percentage of people

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:04.160
 And we haven't like reached that yet, but that's like, you know, part of our responsibility to figure it out

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:09.440
 Yeah, and I think a lot of companies just don't think about that side of it or just projects don't think about that side of it

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:13.520
 I think they like suddenly one day they're like wait. We're not making money. Like what do we do?

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.880
 And there's they weren't like building towards anything, you know

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.440
 Yeah, it's like a lot of people use our open source thing

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.040
 We should be entitled to like sustainability

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.800
 Not like entitled, but that it's kind of an afterthought as opposed to it's like a surprise that

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.040
 Yeah, and it needs to be baked in and it's not

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.680
 Evil or bad. I think it actually makes a product better when you're when you think about things in this way

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.840
 Yeah, and that's true sustainability because

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:43.440
 People are choosing to pay for a service and they're getting value of the service and it should be among

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:49.280
 A large number of people. It's not just like one giant corporate sponsor that could just decide one day

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:55.280
 Hey, like we don't care about this anymore or like we're cutting costs. Whatever. I think I've seen that a lot when it's kind of just

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:01.280
 That's our one thing's a good example. Honestly because it's it was just one company really sustaining it

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.000
 And the moment they had

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.960
 Some issue that was unrelated to anyone else using it now suddenly all this chaos is happening around the project. So yeah

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.440
 Yeah, why don't you be among the money's coming from like a large number of sources. It's

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:21.520
 I think it's better. Yeah, I hate just rehashing the same things over and over but has there been any breaking

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:26.400
 Developments on the hashi corp stuff. Well, it's funny because uh fireship made it

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:32.400
 Oh, we did the juice. I don't know if he saw it, but it was in his like weekly code report thing and he talks about uh

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.040
 The stuff that happened there

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.760
 At the end he spends one minute being like

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.040
 Do not steal from these big corporate companies do not go to this github repo and star

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.200
 I repeat do not go to this exactly repo and do not star this thing

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:52.800
 And then they uh they posted the star chart and it's like in like like 10x overnight

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:58.960
 Yeah, that was great. That was funny. Uh, so I think yeah, it's it's continuing. That's an interesting conversation

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.600
 In itself is just the influence of like someone like fireship

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.440
 I mean these big youtubers like what they can really do with their influence

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.080
 That's awesome. Yeah, I'm locked a lot. Yeah, I posted about this

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.840
 And people most people you know, so you saw my thing. I posted about like

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.120
 Just the things that happened like they made it this

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.320
 Yeah, they changed a license and open TF came up, etc

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.000
 There were people really upset at me for that. Oh for that tweet

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.400
 Not a lot, but there was like two people being like this is like a bs attempt is not going to go anywhere

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:39.040
 Someone was really like they're doing everything in private. They haven't even open sourced the code yet

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:42.960
 Like where they're contributing. He was just asking for all these things and I really replied to him being like

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.520
 It's been three days like they thought it's three days ago. Like what are you expecting out of something?

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.120
 It's three days old. Yeah, they're trying to pick discord or slack right now like

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:57.920
 Yeah, but people are like, I don't know. I don't get why this drew

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:04.240
 Are there are they like so loyal to hashie quirk that they're just like upset about this. I can't imagine that like I don't

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.680
 I like no emotion around around the company. Like I know right they made this thing great

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.600
 Like whatever. I can't imagine being like so loyal to this random company. I just want to use the tool

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.760
 You know people were angry. Yeah, I I don't have any terraform experience

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.120
 But is it weird that this has made me want to look into terraform?

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:26.080
 Like this bad publicity is good any publicity is good that kind of thing

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.280
 I think I didn't get made a lot of you want to look into terraform more because you realize

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.560
 Oh, there's like all these people using this thing and like it's actually

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.400
 People are like upset about this. You can use it enough. They're upset about this

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:41.280
 There's all companies that are built on top of this. So I think yeah, I think it's it's probably good for terraform overall

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.840
 Yeah, you should check it out. It's it's really great

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:49.200
 Yeah, you can do stuff with like because everything I've used from like an infrastructure is code standpoint

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.600
 it's very centered around like

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.840
 Just your cloud infrastructure, but with terraform you can do like github repos

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.920
 There's all kinds of outside

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:04.880
 Ancillary things you can loop into your yeah anything that has an api and you want it terraform lets you manage it declaratively

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.880
 Yeah, so that's that's all they do. They transform like an imperative api. It is something declarative

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:13.840
 Yeah, when I first discovered I didn't I initially didn't get it like with everything someone was like

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.880
 I was doing Kubernetes stuff. I was managing my yaml files

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:22.480
 And they were like, oh, you choose terraform instead and I didn't get it because I was like I can already just apply

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:28.960
 My yaml files. Yeah, my cluster like why do I need something else? Uh, but then what what clicked for me was

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.880
 Oh

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.760
 When I run my business and I build anything

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:41.280
 There's like all this time spent where i'm in going into a ui somewhere and clicking a bunch of stuff is totally undocumented

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:48.480
 Um, i'm like setting up rci tool where i'm doing all this these different things are understood that okay terraform is a way to just

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.200
 Never log into a ui again. Yeah

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.000
 Kind of caught a bunch everything through code. Yeah, and then that way

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.600
 It's all documented and if someone can recreate it and people can just read it to understand what's going on

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:04.720
 Yeah, so just managing everything that way is great. I really want to find like a really elaborate

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.920
 Terraform setup from like an organization that's made it open source where I could see like the kind of things

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.800
 Yeah, people pull off with this because my mind's racing now with all the possibilities

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:19.120
 Yeah, it was great because uh once you know it when you enter a new company

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.120
 You can just go read their terraform files understand what they're doing like when I joined

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:28.000
 Yeah, the last company. I was at uh, I didn't have to talk to the DevOps guy at all

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.800
 I just went and read all the terraform files and I was like, okay

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.760
 I get exactly what's going on and that was it because I understand how to read those

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:39.200
 Yeah, that's pretty cool. Is it weird that like the last few weeks every Tuesday and Thursday?

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.640
 I forget that we have a podcast until you're like you ready today. I'm like, oh, yes

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:48.240
 I am in fact, I mean, I am ready, but i'm just always ready. You know, you just gotta stay ready

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.040
 Stay ready

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:58.240
 I think you should get a tattoo. I'm always encouraging people to get tattoos

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.080
 Yeah, I just don't know if it's my vibe

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:05.200
 I just don't know if like I'll regret it because I don't seem like a tattoo person

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:10.400
 Like the people who have all these tattoos are very like hardened individuals and i'm a pretty soft

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:14.080
 I think you're projecting. I think you're projecting stuff. That's kind of what i'm saying

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.720
 Like I think people project a lot of stuff into that. Yeah, of course people regret tattoos

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.120
 I don't think you're gonna regret your first tattoo

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.600
 Okay, because you're gonna think about it a lot and it's gonna be just my last tattoo

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:30.960
 Point here's what I see tattoos are very addicting as soon as you get one

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:35.680
 You're like, I want to get another I want to get another the ink goes to the brain actually now now that i'm saying that i'm like

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:41.120
 You want another tattoo? You're the type no you're the type of person that would get really into it

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.640
 No, yeah

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:48.240
 I'll just be tattooed all over the face people like spend like a year thinking about their first one

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.040
 Then they spend like a week thinking about their next one. They spend like a day thinking about their next one

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:57.200
 Yeah, so I feel like your the regrets are like later or like if you get them when you're drunk

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:02.320
 I don't know. Yeah, that wouldn't be good. My mom got a tattoo. She got a tattoo for mother's day a few years ago

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.400
 Yeah, to me is really crazy because she's like

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.480
 Again, you just project a lot of stuff into the act of getting a tattoo like yeah

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.720
 He's not someone that would ever I would have ever guessed would get it remotely

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.600
 Would do something like that, but yeah, she got one and it wasn't a big deal

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:22.560
 So I'm taking private digital lessons from a brown belt who's awesome and he owns a tattoo parlor

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:28.240
 So I feel like yeah, there's this inevitable crossover where I'm gonna be like after a private lesson

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.480
 I'm like, hey, can we just top in the shop and just

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.040
 Cat me up real quick. Have you ever

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:37.040
 Thought about what you would get if you got one? I feel people generally have a rough idea

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.240
 So this is gonna sound dumb, but this is this goes way back

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:44.960
 So I have thought about if I were ever gonna get a tattoo. This is way prior to five years ago

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.320
 I wouldn't regret it

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:51.920
 It does feel a little like I have all these weird crossovers with Japanese culture without being a weeb

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.160
 I have a lot of weeb characteristics

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:58.480
 Uh, that's not derogatory, right? That's just a white guy who's really into only to yourself. Okay

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:03.360
 It's the kind of insult I'm here for just the ones that are insulting to myself

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:07.200
 So I I don't like I'm learning Japanese. I don't watch anime

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.320
 Okay, so I feel like I can't be a weeb if I don't even know what anime is

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.200
 I've never watched a single second of anime. So okay, uh

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.760
 The word in japanese uh kaisen have you heard of the word kaisen? You surely have

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.040
 I've heard a bunch like this. Oh, it's always like stuff is named that

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:27.520
 Yeah, and it's a lot of times it's in like business operations that people that's really I think toyota popularized the term

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.200
 Oh, right. Okay, but the term itself just it's basically just mastery. It's just like

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.560
 long term improvement over like

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.600
 Your entire lifetime like trying to achieve things

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:43.280
 You'll never be perfect, but you're gonna continually get better. It's that idea. It's just mastery

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:50.160
 I love like anything that's got like a clear progression anything that I can just like throw myself into and see the improvement

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:55.840
 So that was like the one thing I ever thought about getting was the word kaisen or probably in japanese characters

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.880
 But then I'm going full full

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:03.120
 Weeb path if I have japanese characters tattooed up about it, right?

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.960
 What's tough about that is your reason for getting it is

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.000
 Deep and personal and like that makes a lot of sense

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:14.160
 The problem is getting Asian characters is like the most cliche

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:19.680
 Yeah, so you're screwed with this so you I don't think you can actually do that. Yeah, probably not

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.960
 I think there's a lot of Asian characters on jiu-jitsu bodies. I will say that

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.680
 So it's even more cliche within jiu-jitsu

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:32.800
 There's just like everybody takes off their ghee and they've got it like down there spying, you know, like some word in japanese

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:38.320
 Yeah, there's some really crazy. I'll send you some stuff later. There's some really crazy if you like look into

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.840
 Really really high-end tattoo places

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:46.160
 They're effect they're effectively like like some of the crazes art you'll ever see

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.800
 They just happen to be on people's bodies and those just have the places where you go in and you don't even you're not even

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:54.400
 You can't even say what you want. They just go and they do a random thing

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:59.920
 Like they just oh man now you're making me really want to tattoo when you said high-end I was sold immediately

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.640
 Luxury. Yeah

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.960
 And like it's fine because every single thing they do looks looks amazing

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:12.320
 it's like just some of the craziest image you have ever seen and it is and when I say these people think like

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:20.320
 maximalists like large like complicated tattoos. It's not necessarily that sometimes it's like a very minimalist just like well executed thing

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:27.280
 Yeah, it's uh, it's a crazy world and those people are so so talented and it's weird because like how do you get good at it?

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.240
 You have to practice on yourself. Oh, right? Like you're not

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:34.880
 Like who's gonna let you practice on that? How do you practice touch? Oh interesting

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.960
 I mean, I guess you could be really good. Just pen and paper up front like just a good artist

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:45.120
 Yeah, I guess it yeah, that's where it starts but still like there's still like the practice of like how they ain't goes in the skin

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:50.640
 Yeah, I would take on yourself just do it interesting. I didn't know they did their own tattoos. Yeah, I would assume

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:54.560
 That would be hard. It's just like how we'll see I got is there like synthetic

00:49:54.560 --> 00:50:02.400
 Maybe humans that you can maybe get like uh like cadavers. Oh jeez. Oh that oh no

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:08.880
 Just imagining cadavers being pulled in the back of a tattoo parlour. That's just a terrifying idea

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.720
 Yeah, yeah, I don't think that's the thing. I imagine there's like more important uses

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:17.840
 Yeah, rightovers that they go to first. It's reminds me a funny story. So my last company again

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:25.680
 We built software for mostly salons, but any appointment based business. It made sense for so we had this one company

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:31.200
 I forgot the name of the company, but the reason they were significant is uh, they would often crash

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:37.840
 They were often like crash certain things in our system. This was before basically this company wasn't using serverless obviously

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:41.760
 But they were like hit us with like crazy amount of load and we'd always have to like kind of

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.960
 Scale things and kind of and deal with that

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:49.440
 And the reason why is because they were this

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.680
 Business that gave you these tattoos that would go away after a year

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:58.160
 So they're not like temporary tattoos that wash away, but you can like try it out for

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.840
 And it looks just like a normal tattoo and you can try it out for like

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.240
 a pretty long time

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.320
 Always sold out like crazy

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:11.200
 Doing so well like just always sold out like just crazy appointments

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.320
 The reason they would crash is they would like open up their bookings

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:19.840
 Like once a month or whatever and it would just be like a ton of people hitting their booking widget and uh

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:24.240
 And yeah, I forgot the name of the they have a good name a femoral tattoo

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:29.760
 Maybe there might be more than there might be more than one now, but I don't think it was necessarily them

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.040
 Not that one necessarily. Oh, I'm so into this idea. It's like

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:38.080
 Long-term regret. Yeah, I can just try it. Oh, I love it

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:43.040
 Uh, how do you do it? They just have one location though. Like you have to go there

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.680
 They last for a year and then they fade

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:52.160
 Do I do it? Chicago DC, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston. Ever been to Houston, Texas

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:55.520
 Which ones are close to you? No, I've never been to Houston. Probably Houston, Texas

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.440
 It's not a great city. I'm sorry everyone who lives in Houston

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.840
 Or at least my experience was not the best

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:09.440
 What was why is it bad just there? It was just it was for one like maybe we just had a bad spot with our hotel

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.960
 But it was like getting to the hotel off the highway. It was just a nightmare

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.280
 Just felt like I don't know

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:21.360
 It we went there for a super bowl one year like stat mu stuff. We recorded some people. I think I can't remember

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:26.640
 Uh, yeah, it was uh, it was not my favorite city. I don't know the whole experience

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:31.200
 There's just like the armpit of America. I don't know. Sorry everyone in Houston. Maybe I was just in a bad spot

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.520
 Well, there's that classic quote. I think sometimes he Williams. It was uh

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:40.320
 Uh, america only has three great cities and everywhere else is cleveland

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:48.240
 That kind of sounds like what you were I mean, I enjoy cleveland. I did not enjoy houston

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.000
 But one thing i'm we're plant-based eaters

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:56.160
 So like I judge a lot of cities based on american access to like plant-based food and there was not a lot of options in houston

00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:01.600
 This was like eight years ago probably so maybe it's gotten better most cities have gotten better in eight years

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:04.000
 this reminds me of something so uh

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.800
 last year

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:11.520
 I've got what magazine some big magazine times that wasn't that it wasn't time

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.680
 There's another magazine with the word time in it. I forgot what it was timed out time out something like that

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:22.400
 Uh, they did 30 they like listed the 30 best neighborhoods to live in in the world. Oh, yeah

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:28.560
 And my neighborhood was was listed in there. Are you kidding me top 30 in the world?

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:34.480
 Yeah, I mean again, let's like any magazine magazines make these lists like who knows, but they like surveys still

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.320
 like 20 000 people or something

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:40.160
 Uh, and at first I was like, yeah, that's right. My name words. Awesome. And I was like

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.360
 No, I don't own my house here. I don't want more people moving

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:48.800
 I don't want people moving and driving up. Yeah, I was like, I gotta like it just stressed me out

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:52.720
 I was just like I don't want people knowing like I really really love my neighborhood

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.600
 And it is nice and I see why it's placed on that list like that. But

00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:00.000
 Right now it's definitely underrated and I don't want

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.400
 Both to overrated

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:07.200
 Literally in a top 30 in the world neighborhood list. I don't think you can be underrated

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:13.280
 And be in the top 30 and prior to that it was underrated. But now now it's correctly rated

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.840
 And soon you're already overrated

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:23.040
 That's funny. I feel like we've got a really great spot. I mean just in terms of our kids ages

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:28.480
 We've got this whole backyard situation where we have like five backyards joined that all the kids got fun

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.240
 It's great. Yeah

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.640
 But I mean and we've got the one gig up and down

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:38.000
 That's the one thing I come back to is like if I lived in the Ozarks and I was stuck on like, I don't know terrible internet

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.680
 10 meg or something

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:45.440
 Then I would be looking for a way. It's amazing. You get one gig up also. I know one gig up and down

00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:51.280
 Never had symmetrical. Yeah, it's awesome. The fiber literally terminates in my office closet. Like 10 feet away from me

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.280
 You love saying that you love you

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.800
 So much you're always like the fiber terminates

00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:01.040
 It terminates right here. I see the fiber cable if I just open that door. It's right there

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:05.840
 All the time uh your switch overheated and shut off

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.720
 Oh, yeah, it was it was my uh the adapter

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:11.760
 The ethernet adapter that takes my 10 gig internet

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.760
 I'm not even using my 10 gig anymore

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.760
 Or my 10 gig ethernet connection

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.640
 Because the little thing won't it just overheat

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:21.600
 and I'd rather have 300 meg consistently than

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.080
 10 gig

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.040
 intermittently

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:25.840
 Yeah

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:31.440
 Well, it's because you shove it in a closet and it just overheats. Yeah, it's hot in there. Yeah, it's really yeah poor adapter

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.640
 It's really it's not that's not the adapter's fault. It's doing its job

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:39.520
 All right, so I got a book a an appointment here in chicago to go get a temporary tattoo

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:43.280
 Well, you got to figure out what you're getting because I don't I don't know if that kaizen thing is gonna work out

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:48.160
 No, I'm not gonna do that. I'm just gonna be like do whatever you want to do. Just here's my arm. It's just a year

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.800
 Oh, where would you get it? You think the form?

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.960
 I think the forearm is like the perfect spot

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:56.160
 I think that's the best spot for a tattoo. You can save it for your best idea

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.440
 Can you do like uh like I really wanted to come down

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.480
 Up to the wrist so you can see it under the key

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:06.960
 So if you do a sleep, can you just do a farm sleeve and not have your upper arm?

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.760
 I know people that just have the wrist. It's just here. Oh, really?

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.920
 Yeah, there's a guy's to play sports with that had a really cool like wrist

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.840
 Situation going on interesting so it would look like I have a sleeve

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:25.040
 But it's really just like this little baby. It's like I clip on tight. Yeah, exactly

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:32.720
 I love this idea. Okay. I'm just gonna get my wrist only is your tattoo ephemeral. You're just gonna get it

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.480
 This is gonna be on the wrist. Yeah

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.200
 Yeah, well

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:40.800
 I gotta see pictures of people after a year that it really is completely gone and not just like super faded

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.520
 This has been a long one. I mean for just like me and you hanging out. We didn't have anybody on

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:51.680
 So now I wasn't I wasn't even streaming it. Oh, this reminds me. Oh, we didn't even stream it. Yeah, I forgot to I have a

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:54.720
 Weird idea. I'll try to get it working

00:56:54.720 --> 00:57:00.240
 But I really think that the twitter space's idea is like a clever hack. Oh

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:06.400
 We could do this. Yeah, so like because just because like it twitter like features it so much and it's so

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:12.880
 Yeah, like alerts anyone. What's my fault? We definitely do twitter spaces. Yeah, we don't need video. Okay, but how do we

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:17.600
 What's like the best way to do it because like twitter doesn't let you connect

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:22.880
 You can only listen on desktop. You can't like right on desktop. Yep

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:27.680
 So I'm trying to just get an android emulator running

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:32.080
 I'm a computer people do that. Yeah, then I can just route my audio through there

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:37.680
 I've got cables that can route from my audio interface into my phone. So that's how I used to do

00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:42.880
 That first podcast wait, wait, wait, wait. So I can do that too because my interface supports that

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:48.080
 But what is it? Is it like into your lightning port? Yeah, it's like two adapters

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:55.280
 So it's it's like the cable. It's like a balanced pair that comes out like 3/4 inch or whatever comes out of the audio interface

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.520
 turns into

00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:00.160
 I'll have to send you all the products. It's like it turns into

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:05.200
 The one there's like three and there's four posts and you have to get the right one

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:10.480
 But I have to use two different adapters to get to the right thing to be the right lightning. Okay thing

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.920
 I'll send it to you. I'll send you everything. Yeah, that's maybe a smarter option

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:19.280
 I mean, we would both have to just pipe our audio separately. I guess and it would just yeah, but that would work

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:22.720
 Yeah, oh twitter space. We totally need to do the podcast on twitter space

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.240
 That's where you do it because when you first did AWS I found that's how everyone found it

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.400
 Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:32.880
 Oh, I love it. I was I wasn't even thinking about twitter spaces because it's not video

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:39.760
 But we don't need faces on it. They need to just merge twitter spaces and twitter live. Whatever. Yeah, I think I think they will. It's too obvious

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.920
 Yeah, makes sense

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:44.320
 If it's too obvious, they probably won't though, but we'll see

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:50.560
 All right, all right, I've got work to do tattoos to get and plan

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:57.440
 Planed tickets to fun. Yeah, exactly
