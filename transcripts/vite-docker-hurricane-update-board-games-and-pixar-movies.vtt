WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
 Why is Canada populated at all?

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.600
 Why are there people in Canada?

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.720
 I don't understand.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.300
 (upbeat music)

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.040
 Long time no talk.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.280
 - Yeah, I know, you skipped last week.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.380
 - I skipped last week.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.220
 - Bitch.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.560
 - So. (laughing)

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.080
 That's funny.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.400
 We had to replace you with someone.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.920
 So I wasn't here talking to myself.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.640
 - Yeah, that sounds more fun, really.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.320
 I'm sure people enjoyed that.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.520
 You're welcome, everybody.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.440
 I'll skip more.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.960
 (laughing)

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.920
 Not really, I'm just kidding.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.120
 I'm just kidding.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.560
 I feel like if I threaten that,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.320
 people are gonna freak out.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.880
 Sometimes I do just think like,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.000
 is this the slow fade?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.160
 Am I not gonna disappear?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.840
 I'm just gonna slowly fade out of the internet

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.960
 and all of my friends.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.400
 - Adam, this is literally the guy

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.000
 that made that bingo card of our podcast.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.440
 This is like, is this one of the things I said?

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.760
 - This is like one of the things.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.200
 (laughing)

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.560
 - Oh, let's try new stuff.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.480
 - It's like, I'm just trying to do the internet.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.800
 - Yeah, let's try new material.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.800
 I mean, I don't wanna go back to the bingo card,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.600
 but I really do need you to catch me up on months.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.440
 - It makes sense.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.220
 (laughing)

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.040
 That's just one of the things I need from you

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.840
 in this relationship.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.080
 - Has anything happened?

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.280
 I don't know.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.200
 What's new?

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.040
 - Yeah, maybe nothing.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.280
 That's fine.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.120
 That's actually great.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.360
 - I guess the main thing was

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.000
 Beats finally announced their round,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.520
 which they closed a long time ago,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.700
 but I didn't go public.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.540
 Yeah.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.480
 - Yeah, so how's that work?

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.560
 I mean, in the sense that like,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.440
 Evan is doing a lot of things.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.000
 So, Beat is like a company?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.360
 - Well, they established a new company called Void Zero

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.240
 and their goal is to make a unified JavaScript tool chain.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.080
 - Okay.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.680
 - Which, I think if,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.980
 puts them in the same category as BUN, more or less,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.400
 I think that's like a hundred, almost near overlap.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.160
 - Like computing the runtime.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.000
 - BUN?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.760
 - I think BUN is a super set in a lot of ways.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.760
 Like I think BUN would consider,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.760
 even if they're not focusing on the same things right now,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.360
 I think BUN would consider everything Void Zero

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.240
 is doing as something they eventually wanna do.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.800
 I don't think Void Zero is gonna build

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.080
 a JavaScript runtime.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.920
 I don't think that's outside of their scope.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.520
 - Okay, so BUN has executed really well.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.760
 Are they gonna have similar business models

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.800
 or have either of them picked a business model?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.680
 They've both raised money.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.200
 - I went on PrimeStream a bit to talk about this a bit

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.080
 because I'll just give you this bill real quick.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.040
 So, with a lot of these projects,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.120
 these like open source projects that are very free

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.240
 and like fundamentally need to be open source and free,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.800
 the question of like, what's a business model always comes up?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.920
 And that's a valid question.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.280
 But the point I made was,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.280
 I don't know if we talked about this already,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.000
 but these are venture scale companies

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.640
 very different than a traditional company.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.920
 The example I gave was,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.760
 if search engines didn't exist

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.240
 and someone invented a search engine today,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.000
 people would ask what's a business model.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.200
 And the company would be like,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.600
 oh yeah, we'll give you like 10 free searches a day.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.000
 And then if you want to go over that,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.040
 we'll charge you $10 a month, right?

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.320
 And you would probably make a lot of money doing that,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.960
 especially if it's as good as Google is

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.080
 and there was no other search engine.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.800
 But it would never be a product

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.760
 that every single person in the world used.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.600
 - Yeah, right.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.000
 - Like there's natural friction with the paid tier.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.120
 And eventually someone would build a version

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.120
 that's not paid.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.840
 And if you do build the version that's not paid

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.680
 and everyone in the world starts to use it,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.240
 you now have this opportunity to build

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.640
 a like trillion dollar ads business, right?

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.120
 Which is really, really hard to imagine ahead of time.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.960
 Like it's so hard to imagine like if every single thing,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.280
 if we capture 100% of market,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.480
 like what are the business models?

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.480
 Like none of us would have come up with,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.840
 like Google just serves as not on their own properties,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.680
 but like across the whole internet and other sites,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.240
 like it's like a giant, giant business

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.360
 that came out of this thing.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.200
 And it feels like really random and unrelated.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.480
 So with these companies,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.360
 the question isn't really what's a business model.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.200
 The question is, do they have a big enough goal?

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.160
 In Bun's case, it's every piece of JavaScript,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.560
 every executed should happen inside Bun.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.000
 That's a really big goal.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.500
 I can see that, I can see that potentially.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.840
 Same with void zero, like their goal is,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.920
 all JavaScript builds anything like pre-run time,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.920
 building, linting, whatever.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.840
 That should all run through their tooling.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.960
 And if they get to that level,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.720
 there's probably going to be interesting business models

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.360
 that open up, it's going to be hard if they invent them.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.560
 Like there's companies like Docker that got to that level

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.040
 and then like really struggled

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.080
 to figure out how to invent the business model.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.820
 But the moment Docker did find something,

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.400
 they went from like zero to 100 million AR in a year.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.280
 So it's just like, that's kind of

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.440
 what venture scale stuff is.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.640
 Like it's really hard to see business model upfront,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.160
 but when you crack it, it's like boom.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.880
 So to be fair, I don't know if this stuff

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.840
 is actually going to work out, I'm not saying that it will,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.760
 but yeah, it's just very unclear right now.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.760
 And, but that's like just not the question.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.760
 The question is like, can they actually grow to that level?

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.600
 - Yeah.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.400
 Yeah, I think all that tracks for me,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.640
 if it weren't DevTools.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.800
 I just feel like the DevTools part is this quite,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.840
 I mean, Docker is an example.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.440
 The aren't, isn't Docker struggling?

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.920
 Like everybody uses Docker,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.400
 but doesn't Docker like have all these issues

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.320
 and they have to put all these restrictions

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.480
 because of, I mean, the nature of images and bandwidth

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.440
 is unfortunate.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.040
 So maybe that's inherent to their type of business

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.000
 or their tool.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.160
 But are they struggling?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.560
 Did they make it?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.720
 Because everybody uses Docker.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.360
 - I think for a very long time, yeah, it's an interesting story.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.880
 They're actually a really interesting story

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.920
 where anyone has wanted to understand there's like some

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.120
 write up about their whole business history.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.440
 And it's a, if anyone wants to understand this space,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.560
 it basically captures every type of thing that can happen.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.320
 So they did the impossible.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.600
 They made something that like changed the world.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.800
 Like every single, like Docker is massively impactful.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.400
 Totally changed how we deploy stuff.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.680
 It's everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.440
 But the immediate winners were incumbents.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.760
 Google Cloud, AWS, like all the big cloud just added it.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.480
 They were at the distribution at Docker support.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.280
 Docker does not see really a penny of any of that.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.120
 - Yep.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.600
 - So Docker struggled for a long time.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.520
 And then it seemed like they're about to go under

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.960
 and then they just really focused on Docker for desktop,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.480
 I think, which is like really weird.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.800
 I don't really understand it.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.040
 And they like just sold.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.480
 - I just hate it on my Mac.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.000
 I just hate Docker for desktop.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.280
 So that's why I laughed.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.440
 - I mean, I don't know if it's a good product,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.560
 but it was just an angle that they could take

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.040
 that the big clouds would never.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.840
 And that's where they made a bunch of money.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.120
 Is that like super long-term sustainable?

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.320
 I don't know, but they did hit a hundred million ARR

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.920
 with that, which justifies a billion,

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.200
 multi-billion dollar valuation.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.520
 - Yeah, okay.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.600
 - It's hard.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.520
 'Cause they had to do two things, right?

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.000
 They had to do the first impossible thing

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.440
 that somehow capture value dodging

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.440
 all the big giant companies trying to get there before you.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.400
 And they did.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.720
 They're always gonna get there before you.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.560
 Even if they get there later,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.080
 they're just gonna win, like BUN, for example,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.920
 the same situation.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.720
 If BUN becomes the fault way people do JavaScript,

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.920
 obviously Google, AWS, we're gonna have support for it.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.280
 So it's gonna be tricky, but yeah, it creates, it's hard.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.800
 - Everywhere the JavaScript runs,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.000
 except for the browser, right?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.440
 - Except for the browser, yeah.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.720
 - So the browser still has its own thing,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.520
 but all the backend JavaScript being BUN,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.440
 and all the local development tool chain,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.080
 that's the BUN goal.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.520
 And then we're gonna have ads in our terminal.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.880
 I'm just saying, we'll see.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.080
 - Maybe that's not very imaginative of me.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.880
 (laughing)

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.480
 - Yeah, I mean, who's to say?

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.680
 Like, the void zero thing,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.880
 like the most obvious path for them is,

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.800
 if they are handling all these like heavy, crazy builds,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.280
 giant companies need like really, really good caching systems

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.200
 and typically pay for them, or willing to pay for them.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.800
 So they could build like a service that matches that.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.520
 Again, I don't know if that's a venture scale thing,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.560
 but it's like not totally out of the question

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.160
 that there's ways that even now we could imagine

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.000
 what they could do.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.440
 But again, there's not the goal.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.560
 There's no point in monetizing something

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.320
 that doesn't win when it comes to venture scale.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.680
 So try to win first.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.160
 - Interesting.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.360
 - Try to win.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.680
 I mean, yeah, that makes sense.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.160
 I guess I said the dead tools thing,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.560
 and then I forgot SSD is also the same situation.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.400
 Yeah.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.240
 So I'm not saying--

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.000
 - That's why I know it's like, I have mixed feelings,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.080
 'cause I know how unlikely and hard and difficult it is

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.600
 and how, I think the problem actually

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.240
 is that everything I just described,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.760
 I actually don't even know if the founders in this space

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.080
 understand what this is what they signed up for.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.520
 I technically didn't when I joined SSD

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.600
 and I understood this a lot better a couple years ago.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.280
 But yeah, if you don't understand this,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.640
 then what you're gonna do is like focus

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.280
 on like the business model too early

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.440
 and then it turns out like your product isn't even win

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.360
 and like the whole thing is always the time.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.200
 - Yeah.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.040
 - Yeah.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.440
 - Mm.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.960
 - Yeah, what we, I mean, Stammie's is like consumer.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.040
 It's a sports statistics website, though.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.960
 (laughing)

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.840
 - I love Bingo Card.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.680
 (laughing)

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.520
 - I love Bingo.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.400
 - Like we were pre-revenue for like five, six years,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.440
 something like that, but it's like different

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.600
 'cause it's a consumer website.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.440
 And I think--

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.120
 - So different, that tool is like very,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.320
 I would say that tool is close to B2C companies.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.320
 - Yeah, I guess so.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.160
 Yeah, I guess so.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.320
 There's a lot of developers.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.520
 Yeah, I don't know where I was going with that,

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.200
 but like we were, it was like very fun to be pre-revenue

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.240
 because nobody judged your revenue

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.360
 when you don't have revenue

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.160
 and we could just kind of keep not having revenue.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.040
 But I feel like it was very predictable that like,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.520
 we're gonna have ads on a website.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.360
 It's just how it works.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.640
 We have a lot of traffic on our website.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.040
 Now we have ads on the website.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.360
 We didn't get more creative than that, I guess.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.200
 Not yet.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.400
 - Yeah, but I mean, if it works, it works.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.240
 - Yeah.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.080
 - But yeah, exactly.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.040
 Like I think there's like a over rotation on,

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.960
 it's just, I think when you're in,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.560
 when you're observing some of these things,

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.760
 I feel like you get the right conclusion, but not really, right?

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.240
 So we had a period of time where there was these like,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.080
 really big blowups of like overfunded companies

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.160
 that just never had a business model and never made sense.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.440
 And a lot of people witnessed that.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.880
 So now there's like this thing of like,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.120
 anytime they see a company saying something like,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.160
 pre-revenue or like, we'll worry about the business model

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.520
 later, they're like, oh, it's one of those.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.080
 It's gonna like blow up and fail, but.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.120
 - And dev tools in particular had a lot of money.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.240
 It was a very hot VC segment.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.320
 So I think there's also like tangential,

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.680
 but not completely the same blowback on dev tool stuff

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.520
 for that reason.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.840
 Like there's like venture scale across all the industries

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.240
 has its own taint from, is that a word I can say?

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.440
 I don't know, is that a bad word?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.360
 I feel like somebody's technically a fine word

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.040
 that also has more intense meaning.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.040
 - An urban dictionary meaning?

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.880
 - Okay.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:31.160
 Like venture scale as a term and as a concept

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.440
 was tainted by lots of free money.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.640
 But then dev tools, if you're a developer,

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.000
 you've kind of like soured on some things about dev tools

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 because of poor usage of venture money

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.920
 or like memeable usage of venture money

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.320
 over the last few years and that still goes on.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.520
 So yeah, it's kind of a double whammy.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.800
 When I hear like venture scale dev tools,

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.520
 I just, I think of all the negatives of both sides.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.480
 - Yeah.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.320
 - Yeah.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.160
 - It's not fair though.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.360
 - I mean, it's just easy to remember the negatives

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.040
 and forget the pauses 'cause the ones that win

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.800
 become so normal that you like just don't ever think

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.640
 about them that hard.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.120
 - Again, Docker venture funded.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.680
 All the HashiCorp stuff venture funded.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.440
 Like ghosty technically wouldn't exist unless,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.080
 you know, he had a nice exit where he can kind of focus

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.920
 on that. - That's true.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.720
 - All the HashiCorp stuff is really great.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.080
 Like, like, tire form, a bunch of things like that.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.080
 So yeah, just so the ones that are good do the thing,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.760
 that's hard, which is you become invisible

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.600
 'cause you're just like a default.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.200
 - Yeah, and nobody talks about it.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.240
 Yeah, that makes sense.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.680
 - Yeah, some of this stuff is really crazy.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.640
 Like we were talking internally yesterday about like,

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.960
 okay, if our growth continues,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.200
 what will our competition look like?

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.760
 'Cause we start to eat into places that technically

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:55.480
 are competitive with companies we aren't competing with today.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.560
 And it is funny dynamic where it's only a problem

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.360
 once you start making money, like a lot of money.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.920
 Otherwise people just look at you as like,

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.880
 oh, that's a cute project.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.640
 Even if you're growing a ton and become really popular,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.360
 they'll like not really copy you or try to like stop it.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.200
 - Yeah.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.840
 - So there's a lot of benefit to staying small

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.520
 with your revenue for as long as possible

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.800
 'cause it catches the competition off-guard

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.680
 as we're spending into their markets.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.840
 'Cause like a big established company

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.680
 is never gonna be like, oh, this like open source projects

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.520
 is getting really popular.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.520
 We need to make sure we clone it.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.280
 There's be like, what do you mean?

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.200
 Like they're not making any money.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.600
 Why would we waste time on that?

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.960
 By the time they see it,

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.400
 by the time it actually starts to impact them,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.720
 it's like too late.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.480
 So yeah, there's a lot of funny dynamics

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.720
 with being pre-revenue of some like advantages

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.800
 or low revenue rather.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.020
 - Speaking of pre-revenue.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.760
 Can you catch me up on the hurricane?

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.840
 (laughing)

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.040
 There's like, there's a big hurricane hitting today.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.160
 - Sorry, yes.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.760
 - Known for my transitions.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.240
 - Yeah, it's funny.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.720
 - Is it hitting? - Yeah.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.080
 - No, they keep pushing the landfall time further and further.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.760
 Hurricanes move slow.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.040
 - Yeah, I think I've caught that.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.360
 - Do you know the speed of a hurricane

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.680
 like in terms of how fast it travels?

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.440
 - No, like across the ocean.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.080
 - Yeah, 'cause you always hear like wind speeds

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.520
 of 165 miles an hour,

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.960
 but the hurricane itself is moving

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.640
 at like below 10 miles an hour.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.760
 - Are you serious?

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.720
 Wow. - It's so slow.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.400
 - Yeah, does it speed up or slow down

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.520
 when it gets over land?

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.600
 - So land absorbs a lot of the hurricane's power.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.420
 So you'll see as it hits land it like weekends.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.440
 But right now it's so forecast to hit Tampa,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.800
 I'm not gonna be affected by the case.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.320
 - It's like a category four now.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.280
 I just googled it.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.840
 - It went from five to four to five again.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.560
 They think when it hits, it'll be a three.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.560
 - Oh, okay.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.040
 - That's better than a five, right?

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.100
 It goes that direction.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:48.940
 - Yeah.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.800
 - It's weird because it's almost like binary.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.800
 There's just a bunch of structures

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.120
 that are still not able to deal with any kind of hurricane.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.240
 And when they get a direct hit,

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.240
 all those structures are affected.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.680
 - It blows my mind actually,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.880
 whenever something like this is about to happen

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.840
 and they point out it's been like 100 years

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.880
 since Tampa has been direct hit.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.320
 It's like in the Gulf of Mexico, how is that possible?

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.120
 I feel like hurricanes are like constant

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.680
 in the hurricane season.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.960
 - There's this feeling, there's like this,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.160
 I feel like I wish I could communicate properly.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.720
 When you see all these hurricanes flying around,

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.960
 it feels like you're just like,

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.400
 it feels like you're playing dodgeball

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.160
 and like the ball is just like flying around you

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.000
 and somehow you're not hitting.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.400
 - Like meow, where the bullets are just dodging.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.560
 - But it's funny though, 'cause like the hurricanes,

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.120
 sometimes have crazy paths, right?

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.880
 Like this hurricane started in the Gulf,

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.360
 which I like didn't even know was a thing.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.760
 Like it can start from the left side.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.280
 Like what the hell that all came from.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.920
 - It's like, oh, I didn't know that didn't happen.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.760
 Yeah, okay.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.000
 - I mean, I guess they do, I just never.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.920
 I don't even know if they typical,

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.160
 I just never realized that.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.920
 But like the last one, I think it was last year,

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.760
 it was gonna hit Tampa,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.800
 but then I think it went south and hit Naples.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.640
 - Yeah.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.800
 - It came from the right, like hooked around

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.680
 and it came back and then hit.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.080
 - I think I saw that, yeah, I saw the path of that one.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.080
 - Yeah, so it feels like someone's throwing

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.720
 these like crazy trick shots, like at the US.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.960
 - The, we just had one, right?

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.280
 The Asheville situation's super bad,

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.440
 which is crazy 'cause it's so inland

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.440
 and it makes me rethink all of my like,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.960
 I'm safe from hurricanes in the Midwest.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.280
 'Cause like Asheville's in the mid, not Midwest,

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.480
 but it's like, I guess it was like a damn situation.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.320
 - Yeah.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.200
 - Like it was like over flooding in the mountains,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.720
 washed out the city, basically.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.560
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.520
 I mean, that's what's funny, it's like random canals,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.320
 which are like everywhere.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.160
 - Yeah.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.960
 - Even if you're not by the coast,

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.960
 we'll just overflow and then cause all these problems.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.680
 - Yeah, I wanted to look up,

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.880
 I feel like there's probably like a list of cities

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.880
 that there's like possibility of catastrophe

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.880
 if a dam breaks, like cities that are downriver from a dam.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.120
 It's probably way too many.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.520
 It's kind of like when Katrina happened so, so long ago,

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.840
 it's like, why do we have cities that like rely

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.320
 on structures to stay out of the sea?

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.680
 Like what are levees and why did we build them?

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.480
 Why not just not build a city there?

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.720
 Like why don't we just go out and build the Atlantic Ocean,

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.480
 like build a big like tunnel and be like, here we go.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.320
 Let's put a city here.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.160
 Why do we do this?

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.000
 I don't understand it.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.520
 Or did it start out higher above sea level

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.760
 and then it just like the water rose?

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.000
 - Yeah, I think the reality is historically

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.560
 there was no possibility for any kind of wealth

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.760
 unless you were a port and you could tap into trade.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.240
 So every major city just on the water

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.920
 and now there's like a side effect

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.320
 of that is you're exposed to any kind of water,

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.480
 natural disaster.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.160
 - Is that why we're so poor in the Ozarks?

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.840
 There's no ports here.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.680
 Turned out, we're all.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.480
 - Yeah, I think, maybe.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.760
 - What major city is?

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.840
 - Like wealthy and like Teddy Lee, Chicago,

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.800
 but isn't Chicago, Chicago has a port.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.800
 - Yeah, yeah, I mean the Great Lakes, so they, I don't know.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.160
 - But like, didn't they use that to trade with like,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.480
 I don't know, I'm not making some shit up.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.320
 - No, probably.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.160
 - So there's some Canada or something.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.600
 (laughing)

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.240
 - Maple syrup, I don't know.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.560
 (laughing)

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.080
 - There's like a time where like,

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.920
 everybody was like stopping around in the Canadian woods

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.920
 like trapping raccoons and shit, like.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.760
 (laughing)

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.600
 - It's funny.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.000
 - Yeah, I guess they probably do have ports in Chicago.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.080
 I mean, why would they be on the water otherwise?

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.920
 Like, what's the point?

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.760
 - Yeah, and even things like Philadelphia,

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.360
 like it's on the river so they could trade up a pound.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.480
 That makes sense, I guess that makes sense.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.240
 - That said, humans, I've always felt,

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.080
 the thing you were saying, like,

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.760
 why did we establish a thing there?

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.000
 I feel this way about the whole earth in general.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.080
 Like, if you look at the whole earth,

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.280
 there's clearly places that are way nicer to live

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.600
 where the food's more abundant.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.880
 Why are a bunch of humans in the middle of the desert?

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.720
 Like, how did-

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.240
 - Why is Canada populated at all?

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.240
 (laughing)

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.440
 Why are there people in Canada?

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.280
 I don't understand.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.760
 - We're just like, we'll live anywhere

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.560
 and we'll just make it work or not.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.400
 People aren't just like-

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.040
 - It's really true, yeah.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:18:59.880
 - Yeah.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.320
 - I mean, some people just want their space, I guess.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.560
 Like, they just like don't wanna be where everybody else is.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.880
 - Even then, like, it's crazy to me that

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.000
 like, there's so many crazy cities in the Middle East.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.200
 Oh, I guess there's oil there now, which is what?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.600
 - Um, oil.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.960
 - Don't those cities, but even historically, right?

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.960
 Like, I mean, all the ancient cities,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.880
 isn't like the original, like, Mesopotamia,

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.680
 it's not like, actually no, that was on a river,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.600
 so that makes sense.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.920
 But yeah, I just feel like there's like the desert case,

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.000
 but then there's also, like, the really cold,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.760
 like, Scandinavian, like Northern area.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.600
 - Yeah, what are they doing there?

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.080
 - Why did you guys go all the way up there?

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:39.920
 - Yeah.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.240
 - What are you following?

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.080
 (laughing)

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.520
 - Yaks or something?

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.360
 - Yeah, I know.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.560
 - I started playing risk with my nine-year-old.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.060
 We got it out, grandma still had it, my mom.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.240
 Risk is so fun.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.760
 Have you played risk in a long time, 'cause it's so fun.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.160
 - Is it fun one-on-one?

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.480
 - Not as fun, but I didn't know this.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.640
 I, growing up, we played one-on-one all the time,

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.400
 me and actually me and my co-founder of Stat Muse,

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.320
 we grew up together, and we played risk all the time,

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.040
 and I'm pretty sure we played one-on-one all the time,

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.000
 never did this, but there's, like, a neutral,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.880
 you set, like, neutral armies up.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.960
 There's, like, a third player,

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.320
 but, like, you both control it.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.560
 That's how you play one-on-one, and it makes it better.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.560
 That's how me and my son have been playing.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.280
 We gotta talk the other two into it, though.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.400
 My other son and my wife need to just play with us,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.720
 'cause that would be more fun, but he's five,

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.920
 so he's probably gonna be into it.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.360
 - Yeah, I think it's challenging,

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.720
 but your wife is a little older than five.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.640
 - Listen, you wanna control a whole continent.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.920
 Yeah, my wife is old enough.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.280
 Yeah, we could just stay up late

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.880
 with my nine-year-old, but it'd be fun.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.120
 Yeah, risk is great.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.840
 Old board games, good stuff.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.160
 Who is it that's really into board,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.680
 is Chris into board games?

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.440
 Did I make that up?

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.080
 Somebody, oh, we talked about Python.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.320
 - I've met a lot of people recently

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.800
 that are super into board games.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.640
 - Yeah.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.360
 - And I wanna get more into it.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.760
 I actually have one here that I borrow that I need to play.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.440
 - Yeah, 'cause we go to Target and all of 'em are garbage.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.520
 Like, you just look at the wall of 'em, they're all bad.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.560
 - That's what's so crazy.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.120
 Like, I don't know why I never put this together.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.280
 It's like all the ones that we know,

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.760
 but even risk, this is fun,

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.360
 but it's not like someone like tried really, really hard

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.560
 to come up with, like the coolest thing ever,

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.720
 and there's like a whole world of that,

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.720
 of people that have tried that hard.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.080
 - Like they figured out how to make really good board games.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.360
 - Yeah, like there's board games that take like an hour

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.400
 to set up and you play over several days,

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.520
 and you need to like leave it. - That's crazy.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.820
 - Like Monopoly.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.720
 (laughing)

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.080
 - But like never finished a game

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.720
 with Monopoly, you have more fun.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.360
 (laughing)

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.720
 - Yeah, Monopoly, I feel like literally,

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.840
 I think it's actually a very bad game,

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.920
 and the only thing it has going for it is like the money

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.480
 feels so cool and fun,

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.040
 and I think that's the only reason anyone has ever like,

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.320
 oh, let's get Monopoly or let's play Monopoly.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.160
 But the game actually so much.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.120
 - Yeah, we're driven by, yeah, no, I get that.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.400
 - The game of life also has money.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.280
 It's not really as popular.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.800
 I do feel like there's a certain like,

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.200
 lore around Monopoly,

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.360
 or it's just like embedded enough into the pop culture.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.320
 Oddly enough, they apparently knew what they're doing

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.840
 when they did the McDonald's stuff.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.760
 'Cause I feel like I like Monopoly more

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.240
 because of my memories of peeling out those stickers

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.040
 off McDonald's cups, you know what I'm talking about?

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.480
 I'm collecting it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.680
 - Like was that Monopoly like paying McDonald's, I guess,

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.680
 to be- - That's a really good question.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.520
 - Like some promotion, how did that work?

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.440
 - They just were trying to like get exposure.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.360
 - I think McDonald's might have played Monopoly,

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.200
 paid Monopoly.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.080
 - Paid Monopoly for the rights.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.160
 See, it's interesting 'cause that could go either way.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.040
 Like when it comes to a deal like that,

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.920
 like I could see either side benefiting like McDonald's.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.360
 - But who has, like Monopoly's not gonna move more.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.840
 Like, that's what I'm saying.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.200
 It doesn't make sense that they would advertise

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.560
 on McDonald's cups like so people would buy Monopoly

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.280
 'cause they're barely owns Monopoly.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.240
 Well, that's a great point.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.440
 Like, what does they have nothing to gain?

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.800
 - They're just IP.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.200
 But that's interesting to think of Monopoly as IP,

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.920
 as like Marvel characters.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.760
 You know what I mean?

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.600
 - That is true, yeah.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.560
 - Like that McDonald's is like,

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.320
 "Hey, you know what would give us some credibility?"

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.560
 Monopoly.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.320
 That's just funny. (laughs)

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.480
 And who owns Monopoly?

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.040
 I guess Hasbro or something.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.040
 Like there's this one company that owns all the board games.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.280
 - Oh, that's a good question.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.200
 - Like who did like a startup create Monopoly

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.480
 and then sell the Hasbro?

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.440
 Like how does that work?

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.160
 - Hasbro has owned the rights to Monopoly since '91

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.440
 when it acquired Parker Brothers, the maker of the game.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.120
 - Parker Brothers, I've heard of this.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.560
 I just started typing in like a live code playground,

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.400
 Parker Brothers.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.200
 - I just saw a picture of the Monopoly board

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.080
 and just like, it just brought the crazy memories.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.480
 - Yeah.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.920
 You ever played Monopoly Go?

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.120
 - Oh, is it like a mix of?

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.280
 - It's like a card game.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.120
 It's like a shorter version of Monopoly.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.080
 It's kind of got the feel of Monopoly, but it's like,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.920
 oh, that just reminded me.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.920
 It's like the Apple Store ad just popped up.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.040
 If you ever played like digital Monopoly, that's fun.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.440
 Cause it's like animated and there's like the cars driving

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.040
 and like blowing exhaust and stuff.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:58.880
 Yeah, good times.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:04.240
 There's like a million different Monoples like every,

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.840
 so they're licensing IP.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.560
 There's just so much money flowing around

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.960
 when it comes to Monopoly.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.040
 Like Monopoly apparently is paying Harry Potter,

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.640
 the franchise to like get rights to their,

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.880
 that's so interesting to me.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.440
 - It must be like a rub share though.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.760
 - Yeah, cause like Harry Potter benefits from it, I guess.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.120
 But does, I don't know,

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.160
 but something like Harry Potter, like they're on everything.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.400
 Do they need more exposure?

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.400
 - No, no, I think it's just ways to sell more stuff.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.720
 Like if I own Harry Potter the brand,

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.400
 I'm just going to like partner with every single product maker

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.800
 to slot my shit on it.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.200
 - So just sell more stuff.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.400
 Do you ever think about that though?

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.040
 Like your, your, what's her name?

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.240
 - Who's the lady that wrote Harry Potter?

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.160
 - Tiki Rowling.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.600
 - Yes, you're JK Rowling.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.080
 I'm assuming she owns most of the Harry Potter enterprises

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:50.920
 or whatever.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.440
 You know, maybe she doesn't share holders now.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:57.240
 But like she has this giant empire that is Harry Potter

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.240
 and she's made more money

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.240
 than she could ever need or spend.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.040
 Do you think she like thinks about like,

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.600
 oh, if we move into China with this stupid product,

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.360
 we could sell, you know, like $10 million next quarter.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.240
 Does she care?

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.400
 Like at this point, who cares at this point?

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.200
 Like how much product they move?

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.360
 - Yeah, it must just be like the Disney machine.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.280
 That's just like, she's like not really-

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.560
 - This is so good at consumer products.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.680
 - Oh, you know what?

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.640
 Does Disney own Harry Potter?

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.760
 No, they don't own Harry Potter.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.960
 They bought everything else.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.120
 - No, but Marvel, Lucas Zone, they know.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.720
 - I'm pretty sure Disney is like their publisher

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.280
 or like the equivalent 'cause like-

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.400
 - Oh geez, so complicated.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.640
 - Oh, is it universal?

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.400
 - Oh, yes, 'cause Universal Studios-

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.800
 - 'Cause they have, they have the-

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.800
 - They have, yes, Universal.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.640
 It's not a-

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.480
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.600
 - Which it makes sense 'cause that's who did the movies.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.600
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.680
 - So they are remaking Harry Potter as an HBO TV show.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.200
 - And we're old enough to remake Harry Potter?

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.400
 - I really don't see how this is a good idea

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.440
 because the original Harry Potter movies-

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.600
 - Yes, different actors.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.240
 - Oh, no, we don't do this.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.480
 - The original Harry movies were very good.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.080
 You can watch them today and they don't feel outdated-

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:07.920
 - Still good.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.000
 - That they show them to someone new,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.680
 and they don't feel outdated.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.520
 - Uh-huh.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.760
 - And I feel like this can really only be worse.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.600
 - Yeah, how's it gonna happen?

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.000
 - And I don't wanna, we've all seen the stories-

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.520
 like a billion times already.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.560
 - Why do this?

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.640
 This is like when there's a new Spider-Man.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.080
 Every time I hear there's a new Spider-Man,

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.880
 and we've talked about this on the podcast at some point,

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.680
 because every time I hear there's a new Spider-Man,

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.720
 it's like, I don't know if it's a continuation

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.240
 of some story or they're like going back

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.320
 to the first one again.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.400
 It's like every 10 years, they don't wait that long.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.120
 They're like, new Spider-Man, it's the new actor

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.080
 that everybody knows, and like, look, we did it again.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.520
 I don't get the whole, like, it really,

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.960
 people make fun of Hollywood for like,

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.720
 not coming up with new stuff, but it really is true.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.120
 Like, they really just keep remaking the same stuff,

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.600
 and it's kind of cringe.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.100
 I just use old cringe in a sentence, that was awesome.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.960
 (laughing)

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.320
 - I mean, I've been thinking about this a bit,

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.440
 and I've seen some people in Hollywood talk about it,

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.800
 and it's so funny.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.640
 It's like the same thing that happens in business,

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.080
 which is eventually organizations

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.080
 just become crazy risk-averse

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.120
 to an irrational degree, right?

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.200
 So if I am someone that's gonna produce,

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.800
 I work in a movie studio, I'm gonna produce a movie.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.640
 If it fails, that looks really bad on me.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.120
 But if I attach it to some existing IP,

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.960
 nobody could say that it was a bad decision.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.440
 'Cause like, there's like a perceived safety net of like,

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.160
 well, I wasn't taking some crazy risk,

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.600
 I was just like betting on a sure thing, you know?

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.160
 So there's been so many cases that I've heard of

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:39.160
 where there will be a script, brand new concept, new script,

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.720
 they will take the script and attach it randomly

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.440
 to some existing thing, just so it feels like more de-risk.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.440
 - So, I mean, I know I'm sure I do it too.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.200
 It's probably like some human nature thing

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.840
 in the right situation, I would do the exact same thing.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.080
 But it just makes your soul die a little bit.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.880
 You just want people, like it makes us,

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.440
 I think that's why we look up to the people

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.720
 who've taken huge risks.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.800
 It's like, even if they have flaws

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.880
 and you don't like that person,

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.160
 like there's something about, I don't know,

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.640
 real artists, you know, people who step out there.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.840
 - This just reminded me of a thing in the NFL,

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.840
 this whole idea of just avoiding risk at all costs,

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.520
 even at the detriment, like the New York Jets,

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.560
 they're doing poorly, they just fired their coach,

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.280
 they're kind of in the news.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.720
 But before they fired the coach, it's like this year,

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.000
 they're all in on this organization,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 like the GM and the head coach,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.160
 if they don't win this year, if they don't do well,

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.000
 they're all gonna get fired,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.800
 they all know they're losing their jobs.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.160
 So they all just like go for broke

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.520
 and they hire all these really old people

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.040
 with bad injury history.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.240
 And it's like everybody knows this is not best

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.600
 for the New York Jets for the next five years,

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.320
 but it's like, all that matters is the people

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.720
 making the decisions are trying to keep their job this year.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.480
 So it's like, that reminds me of something we've talked about

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.400
 where it's like, the people who make the decision

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.600
 can just completely jeopardize the future

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.320
 because it only matters to them right now.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.320
 Is it monetary policy?

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.160
 What is it?

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.000
 We've talked about this.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.840
 - There's something, yeah.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.920
 I mean, I feel this comes up, this comes up a lot.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.880
 Yeah, it's super annoying.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.160
 And I feel like this is happening,

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.200
 I guess you brought a football,

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.520
 I think it's happening everywhere where we're just in this

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:19.520
 like weird phase of, it's like really short term minded

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.320
 and you would think that looks like craziness,

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.320
 but it actually looks very boring, you know?

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.160
 - Yeah, it's very boring.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.560
 - Yeah, the thing with Hollywood

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.880
 just like turning out sequels and stuff.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.560
 There has to be some like corrective thing that kicks in.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.160
 At some point, do these movies just start doing bad

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.000
 or is it like?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.720
 - Haven't the Marvel movies started doing bad?

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.720
 - Yes, they definitely pass their peak, for sure.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.360
 - Yeah, like there is a saturation point where people are like,

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.240
 you know what, I don't care about Ant-Man 7.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.080
 Like I'm done with the story, I don't care.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.400
 Ant-Man was kind of a dumb character.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.560
 - But do you see what they're doing?

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.400
 - No.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.440
 - I will say this worked on me.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.280
 - Oh no.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.360
 - So they're like, their headline thing

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.880
 is like the Avengers movies, right?

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.880
 And that series ended with like all the famous,

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.880
 actors from the last 10 years,

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.120
 like their stories ending and like their contracts basically.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.440
 So that's what they're kind of struggling now.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.160
 But they're making the next series of Avenger movies.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.760
 And the main bad guy in it, who's playing it,

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.560
 Robert Downey Jr.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.400
 They just like brought him back as a different character.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.600
 - He was Iron Man.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.480
 Wait, he's gonna play the villain?

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.320
 - Yeah.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.960
 - Is it like Iron Man became the villain or it's like,

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.240
 no, just ignore the fact that this is Robert Downey.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.720
 - It could be like in a different dimension,

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.800
 like Tony Stark went bad or it could just be,

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.080
 he's a totally different person.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:43.920
 - Oh my goodness.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.880
 - Like at some Comic Con,

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.640
 a bunch of these masked people showed up on stage.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.480
 And the one guy in the front removed his mask

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.040
 and was Robert Downey Jr. and everyone went nuts.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:55.400
 And I'm like, yeah, like this is like another flavor

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.600
 of this rebooting thing, whether we be the actor, you know?

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.320
 - It's so nuts to me.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.560
 I don't know.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.880
 I wanna care about something.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.640
 I wanna like be into something that's worth being into.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.160
 Like when it comes to media,

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.520
 I haven't watched stuff and forever.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.600
 - Yeah, we've really struggled too.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.040
 There is still some good stuff.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.360
 And even within the zone of like,

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.700
 they're just like doing the IP thing.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.000
 Have you seen The Last of Us?

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 - No.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.840
 I've heard of it.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.680
 - I think I've heard of it.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.600
 - The Last of Us was a really good video game,

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.880
 like narrative narratively.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.880
 It was like one of the best narratives in any video game ever.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.200
 And they made two games and HBO made a TV show.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.520
 They did one season of the first game

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.040
 and now the second season is about to come out.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.280
 I think at the beginning of the next year.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.640
 Like phenomenally good.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.800
 Like really, really, really good.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.080
 - Give me like the TLDR.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.240
 Like what's the setting?

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.080
 Is it sci-fi?

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.920
 - It's a classic like post-apocalyptic thing.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.560
 Like some kind of, in this case, it wasn't a virus.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:54.120
 It was like a fungus and like destroyed society.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.040
 There's some people that are surviving.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.840
 And if you get even scratched or something,

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.280
 you like turn into like this crazy zombie thing.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.280
 And they're just a girl that got scratched.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.600
 So everyone's like, you're fucked.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.360
 And they usually just kill them right away

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.860
 before a reason they didn't kill her.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.880
 And she started to recover.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.080
 So this story is this really reluctant guy

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.520
 who's like kind of like a,

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.200
 he lost his own daughter like way at the beginning,

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.560
 right when everything was going down in a really like crazy way.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.560
 And he's like reluctantly agreeing to take this girl

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.280
 to some research facility like across the country.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.600
 So they travel across the country.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.740
 And it's like some of the most intense,

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.560
 like hard to watch situations that they like run into.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.680
 And the acting is amazing.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.640
 Like everything is done really, really well.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.240
 And that's technically just like this IP shuffling thing,

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.680
 but they did a really good job with it.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.880
 - Well, yeah, I guess it's not inherently bad to use IP.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.880
 But like our TV series, better than movies now,

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.480
 is that like, I feel like the good stuff people talk about

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.040
 are like HBO TV series.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.120
 They're not movies anymore, but they replace,

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.000
 'cause they're all competing for the same attention, right?

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.480
 Like, I don't view them differently.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.720
 If you have two hours to watch something,

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.200
 you could watch two episodes of a series

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.280
 or you could watch a movie.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.240
 - What's the difference?

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.720
 - Yeah, I think the production quality of TVs

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.400
 have gone up, TV shows have gone up a lot.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.640
 - 'Cause that was glaring.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.000
 Like 20 years ago or 10 years ago or whatever,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.920
 like TV series being so much lower budget.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.800
 Like the effects, everything about them,

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.320
 they were limited, they had to almost be like a drama

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.320
 to be any good, but that's changed.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.000
 - Yeah, it's changed a lot and it feels like the gap is closed,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.200
 but if you actually like,

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.720
 'cause there's been some things that have been,

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.880
 even like an animated TV show that gets a movie,

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.400
 you're like, oh, what's the difference?

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.320
 It's just like a two hour long episode.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.040
 But they actually look, yeah, there's still like a gap

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.000
 if you like pay attention.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.920
 But like, obviously the gap is closing.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.760
 But I mean, now there's some shows,

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.760
 mostly actually failures that,

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.680
 like their budgets are like $30 million an episode.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.520
 - Oh, wow.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.760
 - Of an episode is one hour,

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:02.320
 that's roughly the same budget as like a $100 million movie.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.160
 - Yeah.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.400
 - So yeah, the buds are closing in,

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.160
 but they're still really good movies.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.840
 I still think the movie side,

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.240
 they're still really good ones.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.800
 There's just a lot of junk on both sides, I think.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.040
 - That reminds me, so we still have like a family movie night.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.400
 I haven't watched any movies just on my own

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.560
 that were good in a while,

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.160
 but we watch like, we go back through

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.760
 the Pixar catalog and all that.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.680
 We just went through all the Toy Stories

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.720
 and I have something to say about like,

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.600
 revisionist history here going back

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.640
 to Toy Story 1 all the way through them.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.960
 I don't know if you realize how,

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.760
 so I've read like the creativity ink.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.280
 Have you listened to a read that book about Pixar?

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.880
 - I know the stories of,

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.680
 I like know a bunch of stories from that book, yeah.

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.520
 - Yeah.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.680
 So the first Toy Story, not very good.

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.560
 I like, not just that they weren't,

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.960
 they're technologically with the graphics.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.400
 I remembered, I thought like Pixar came on the scene,

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.800
 just amazing at the storytelling, all that stuff.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.240
 It wasn't until like Toy Story 3,

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.760
 I think it was three, the one where they go to the daycare,

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.160
 that like the story was like,

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.920
 maybe it just resonated with me in case we have kids,

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.840
 but it was like heartstrings,

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.320
 all the stuff you think about Pixar now

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.680
 where they're so good at like emotional storytelling.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.200
 The first two, not so much.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.320
 It's like kids play with toys.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.200
 - I can see that, yeah.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.960
 Toy Story 3 came out the month that I graduated high school.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.000
 - Really, oh your parents just ripped their heart out

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.680
 and stomp on it, 'cause that's like the whole story

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.640
 'cause he's going off to college.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.880
 - Even for us as like, it was really intense,

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.440
 even just for like--

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.480
 - Oh, for the kids, like for high schoolers, yeah.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was really crazy.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.440
 - But I feel like, they went several years there,

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.360
 those first couple where I don't feel like

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.240
 they had the Pixar magic.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.520
 Maybe they did, maybe I'm just too critical

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.440
 or I didn't resonate with the stories,

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.160
 but it didn't feel nearly as Pixar

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.680
 as a modern Pixar movie.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.960
 - I think they definitely got better at that.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.240
 And I think it's similar to video games

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.000
 where it was such a technological effort at first

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.080
 that like also executing on narrative on top of that

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.400
 was really difficult, but then you've seen over time

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.960
 that they're hitting like, video games are hitting

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.720
 like movie levels of like narrative and acting.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.040
 And I think that probably suddenly happened

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.920
 to animated stuff.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.120
 Have you noticed that every Pixar movie

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.960
 in a lot of kids movies, the plot is we got lost,

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.160
 we got to get home.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.440
 That's like the plot of so many kids movies.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.880
 - Yeah, that reminds me of Homeward Bound,

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.720
 do you remember those?

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.840
 - Yeah, not exactly, yep, yep.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.560
 That was the Finding Nemo, like it's the next story.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.160
 - Oh, Finding Nemo, it really is.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.000
 - Well, it really is.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.800
 - Wow, it really is, huh.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.320
 - Yeah, and obviously it's the stuff that happens

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.680
 in between is different, but the rough,

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.880
 you start off with your home, some mistake happens,

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.440
 you're not home, then you have to get back home.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.280
 - Yeah.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.880
 - Hold on, it's fine, 'cause that's a reverse.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.360
 - Oh, he was home.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.320
 - Well, not the New York one, he was not where he wanted.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.160
 - That's true.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.720
 - He was away, he wanted to get back home.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.160
 - Yeah, no, no, no.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.280
 - But there's something universal about that, I guess.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.600
 We're just trying to find our way back home.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.920
 And I tried to stand deep there,

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.680
 but that just sounded really cheesy.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.520
 - No, like what else?

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.200
 Like I'm looking at the Pixar movies, Coco.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.080
 Again, he gets lost in the afterlife,

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.080
 and he has to get back home.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:13.920
 Right to where he's different.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.760
 Have you seen Ratatouille?

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.880
 - No.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.000
 - Ratatouille's very good.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.840
 It's very, very good.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.920
 - It's been cooking mice or rats.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.360
 - You're cooking us, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.880
 It's actually really good.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.160
 - Yes.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.000
 - Okay, I need to go through all the Pixar movies.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.560
 I've just been watching that scene.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:33.280
 - The little girl gets lost in the monster world

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.560
 and has to get back home.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.080
 - It literally is the plot of every movie, that's crazy.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.400
 - Was it the plot of Up 2?

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.320
 Like they also get lost in the house.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.720
 - There's one that I'm trying to remember the whole plot,

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.360
 but I know it's so painful.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.400
 - Up you just can't watch.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.720
 I couldn't watch it.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.320
 It was hard as a kid, and now I'm married.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.800
 - I'm getting sad just thinking about it.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:58.800
 Yeah, the mortality, oh, why'd you have to remind me?

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.080
 I just don't even know that that movie exists.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.880
 That was Pixar too, huh?

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.520
 Stinking Pixar, just crushing Oliver.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.160
 - Cars, also he gets lost and he has to get back.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.520
 - So I can't tell Teaches this.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.720
 I've just not been able to say, I've never seen cars,

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.160
 and I know Teaches has a lot of cars in his orbit,

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.040
 and I've just, I've never seen it.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.240
 I have nothing to say, I don't know anything about it.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.600
 - You should definitely watch the first one.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.800
 It's a classic. - Okay, good.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.640
 Yeah.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.600
 - I just forget all these franchises are Pixar.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.040
 They really are the best at this, right?

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.480
 - Yeah, I think the thing that they do great is

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:33.080
 it's a kids movie that's really entertaining as an adult,

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.840
 so it's truly like a family movie.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.240
 It's like, there's like two things going on at once,

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.400
 like two storylines, yeah.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.720
 - Yeah, and that way you're not bored as an adult, you know?

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.800
 - Yep, oh, inside out another one.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.280
 I don't know if you saw the latest inside out.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.280
 - Yeah, I did, yeah, those movies are fun.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.680
 I've met Metaphor, it's brilliant,

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.800
 and it just leads to like a lot of really funny,

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.840
 funny things I can do with it.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.000
 - I will say, we watched that one,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.520
 and I couldn't help but notice that I am anxiety.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.520
 (laughing)

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.880
 Casey and I talked about this, it's like, oh geez,

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.000
 I'm watching that movie the first half,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.120
 and I didn't realize like, oh, this is bad.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.400
 You don't want to be like this little orange person.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.160
 I was like, this is, yeah, no, I agree.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.520
 You should definitely think through all this stuff.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.520
 - That's probably why, yes.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.640
 I didn't realize like she's kind of a bad guy.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.280
 Like, oh, this is not good.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.600
 And then it was like, oh, I let that little person

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.840
 run my brain and I shouldn't got it.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.680
 - Yeah.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.560
 - That's the moral of the story.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.240
 - Have you noticed that when they zoom into the parents' brains

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.720
 that a different emotion leads them?

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.840
 - Oh, I didn't notice.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.280
 - Yeah, like for the main character's joy,

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.040
 but then the dad, it's anger.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.200
 And then for the mom, it's sadness or like whatever.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:45.320
 - Interesting, like the joy is not the default leader.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.740
 That's really interesting.

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:47.580
 Yeah, yeah.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.440
 - Yeah, so the metaphors are so good

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.480
 that they can like think through all these little things.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.720
 - Oh, yeah, I love those movies.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.720
 They're really brilliant.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.000
 And the core memories, all that stuff.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.800
 I feel like I've learned stuff about our brain

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.480
 from watching those movies somehow.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.680
 (laughs)

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.520
 - Yeah.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.680
 - Personality islands.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.880
 Okay, I really have to pee.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.840
 We also really need to record two episodes today.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.680
 - I'm just gonna call this one.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.600
 - I'm just gonna pull the curtain.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.960
 Yeah, we're gonna pull the curtain back.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.360
 We're gonna talk again immediately after this

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.720
 and pretend like it's a new episode, a new week.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.120
 - Yeah, but they won't get to hear it till next week.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:18.960
 - That's right.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.960
 We're just gonna string this up.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.960
 Yeah, this one has a to be continued.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.000
 So-- - To be continued.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.080
 - This story is to be continued.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:25.920
 Okay, be right back.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.760
 - All right.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.340
 (upbeat music)

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:50.960
