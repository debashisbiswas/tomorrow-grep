WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 You're getting ready to enter into a different phase of life.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.800
 I'm so excited for you, and Liz.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.400
 It's going to be so easy.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.700
 Oh, my God.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.920
 If it's an easy baby, I swear I'm going to lose my mind.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.540
 I was looking at a bright screen.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.840
 Oh, my God.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.200
 What are you looking at?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.540
 Did you pull up a picture of the sun?

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.640
 No, the open router page is brighter than the sun, I think.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.240
 Wow.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.440
 OK, now I've got to look open right now.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.040
 There's a white.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.640
 It's just white.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.680
 I've got to just look at the reality page, yeah.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.360
 OK, on off.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.040
 Oh, mine's not nearly as extreme.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.040
 Yeah, yours is--

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.280
 Your setup is a lot nicer.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.520
 I've always had this problem where my screen just lights up

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.720
 my face like crazy.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.440
 I want to figure out I set up.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.800
 Like, it just got in way too crazy.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.600
 And I have all this equipment for doing content stuff,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.080
 but none of it is set up exactly right,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.480
 so I don't get that much benefit.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.120
 And then it's still like clutter.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.640
 So I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.160
 Yeah, I feel this pain because I want

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.800
 to start doing some streaming.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.560
 I want to start doing some videos,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.280
 a lot of open code content stuff.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.160
 I hate the word content.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.680
 I hate when I say the word content.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.280
 I hate when I talk about how I said the word content.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.280
 I'm just--

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.040
 You're doing content right now.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.800
 I know.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.440
 I hate it.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.800
 Someone said that to me yesterday, like, you have a podcast.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.680
 And I just forget that we have a podcast.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.680
 It doesn't feel like we have a podcast, if that makes sense.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.200
 It still just feels like we record some of our calls

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 and share them with people.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.800
 Some of them we don't.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.560
 We've been talking a lot more on the phone

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.560
 without recording it.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.000
 We used to never talk unless we were recording it.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.400
 Yeah, every morning.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.000
 That was start my day.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Kind of with Adam.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.800
 We'll stand up.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.200
 I mean, the thing I was telling you,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.920
 I wanted to figure out how--

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.600
 OK.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.080
 Yeah, just browsing the internet.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.800
 Don't worry about me.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.960
 You just did a weird hand motion.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.520
 I was like, I think you were talking to me

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.520
 to hang out for a second.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.440
 I don't know.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.200
 You kind of did.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.680
 Oh, geez.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.520
 I think I did.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520
 It's like a hand-moved.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.520
 And I don't know why.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.520
 I don't know what it did.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.520
 It was like all the way up by our face.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.520
 I know this.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.120
 I'm having this like memory of my hand going up.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.240
 And I got to watch the tape now because I don't know why I did it.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.240
 And that's so weird.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.240
 Maybe I'm having a stroke.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.240
 Sorry.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.600
 It was a pretty feminine gesture, too, if I'm just kidding.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600
 Was it?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.600
 OK.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.600
 It's so weird.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.680
 I can't remember why I moved my hand.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.680
 I'm kind of stressed.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.680
 OK.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.680
 Continue.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.680
 OK.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.160
 So I want to make it so when we put out a new feature,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.920
 I can just easily jump in and do a two-minute video on it.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.120
 And I've done this a bunch in the past, and they typically--

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120
 they work really well.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120
 People like them.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.800
 And I think you get more out of it than just a silent video.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.200
 And it's not that much work right now.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.480
 I just have to record.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.480
 But I want them to be a little more polished than what they

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.240
 currently look like.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.320
 So I'm trying to figure out how to have a workflow around that.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.080
 So my root issue is I'm kind of limited in how good I can make

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.280
 my current space look, because my room is pretty small.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.040
 So I don't--

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.720
 I think maybe I'm maxed out unless I literally find a place

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.960
 in that downtown area.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.720
 Well, I did look.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.040
 There's actually places like the downtown area where I live.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.160
 There's a recording place.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.800
 Just like we had the--

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.120
 we found the music recording studio in my area.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.040
 There's also a video recording podcast type thing.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.720
 But I'd have to go to that and record.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.920
 So I don't know if that's any easier.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.040
 I feel like that sounds like the opposite

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.640
 of removing friction from recording content.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.200
 It's like driving somewhere.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.400
 I mean, it removes stuff.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.880
 It removes stuff from my office, which

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.880
 is just like a dirty thing.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.520
 OK, so I feel that pain.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.800
 Yeah, OK, I have all these same pain points,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.760
 because I moved my office from my very nice-looking room

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.440
 to the dungeon that is our unfinished space.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.640
 So I have this very dark room.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.240
 I thought that I'd have advantages.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.600
 But now it's like I don't enjoy the background.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.920
 But it's the only place where I feel

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.280
 OK having all this stuff, the camera, the lights,

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.640
 the mics, all of it.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.640
 I do want to just be in a nicer space.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.320
 But it's really hard to do that with this junk just out.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.680
 It's like I would just move into a big open area out here

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.480
 that would look really nice with lots of natural light

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.440
 and it'd be great.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.120
 But then Casey would hate me forever, because--

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.120
 All your stuff is out there.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.760
 That's stuff.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.280
 Yeah.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.320
 So obviously, it's streaming that you can go crazy.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.160
 But in terms of just making a quick two-minute video,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.360
 what's the absolute minimum you need?

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.920
 Obviously, you need a camera.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.920
 And one of those--

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.360
 What if you didn't, though?

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.920
 Do you need the camera?

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.640
 Do we have to put our faces on the camera?

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.360
 Can we just go fire ship and just make explainer videos

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.840
 that have funny motion graphics and whatever

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.960
 and create a style that doesn't require all this shit?

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.240
 Because I hate it.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.000
 That's very interesting.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.760
 You know what I'm saying?

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.320
 Yeah.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.880
 And we would just find someone that can kind of help

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.000
 that stuff for us and we just throw them the raw footage

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.920
 and they do it.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.480
 We just share a screen, because that

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.360
 would eliminate a whole lot of problems.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.520
 That is interesting.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.200
 I mean, we lose the competitive advantage

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.200
 of our attractiveness.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.080
 But we gain a whole lot of simplicity,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.560
 and our offices will look nice again.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.400
 This is interesting.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.160
 I don't know what was streaming, how I feel about this.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.520
 I feel like streaming--

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.680
 Yeah, yeah, you were streaming probably doesn't work.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.520
 Yeah.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.240
 So this is going to work for you and not for me.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.520
 I give up the idea.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.880
 Ugh.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.520
 I mean, yeah.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.600
 But I think the fire ship thing is really cool,

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.800
 but he might be like a one-of-one situation.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.600
 I think it's pretty hard to do that.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.720
 It's not so much like the precedent has been set.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.400
 You don't have to have your face in your videos

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.160
 for them to be good.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.120
 No, no, yeah.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.760
 I agree.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.320
 I just wonder if there's enough.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.760
 Yeah, we have to find a very distinct style

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.400
 that feels better than having our faces in there.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.600
 Yeah, I had this thought with all the new--

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.240
 so VO3, which is Google's video generation model--

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.680
 with all these new AI generation for video things,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.960
 I wonder, could you make good supplemental b-roll stuff,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.880
 not like--

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.960
 Yeah, b-roll stuff for sure, yeah, yeah.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.040
 But I mean, making graphics without having to learn

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.080
 how to use After Effects, because people who are really

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.040
 good at that stuff can make really good-looking stuff.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.480
 But can you just do it in Vio now?

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.280
 That's a good question.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.880
 I've never seen anyone post stuff like that.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.640
 I wouldn't always post photo-realistic stuffer.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.040
 Yeah.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.440
 Why does that stuff always look so glossy?

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.680
 Do you know what I mean?

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.680
 Yeah.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.880
 There's something shiny about it that feels off.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.600
 Yeah, I feel like they'll figure it out, maybe.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.640
 Some of the latest stuff that I've seen, like VO3,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.680
 does look better, I think.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.200
 It definitely is way better than anything I've seen, but--

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.360
 But there's still a little uncanny valley element to it that's--

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.480
 And I think this problem predates AI stuff,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.080
 because I feel like at some point, most CGI

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.040
 started getting this glossy, clean look to it that made

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.520
 it look really fake, maybe just because older stuff wasn't CGI.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.520
 It was more practical.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.720
 But yeah, I don't know.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.320
 It just feels too clean.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.720
 There's something like smooth and clean and glossy.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.800
 Yeah.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.120
 That just reminded me of something else I wanted to share.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.520
 This is a complete tangent.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.520
 I guess I don't need to preface that at this point.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.680
 But I was just telling someone the other day about we watched--

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.520
 some of my boys are obsessed with Minecraft,

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.320
 I think I'm told you.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.400
 And when the Minecraft movie came out,

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.320
 we wanted to watch it as soon as possible.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.480
 And in order to do that, I guess sometimes you

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.640
 have to resort to these versions of the film that

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.560
 are not finished.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.440
 So they're like the editors use them.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.720
 You know what I'm talking about?

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.960
 I remember I watched some crappy X-Men movie like that,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.280
 and it was hilarious.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.920
 It's hilarious.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.680
 I didn't know these existed, but we

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.360
 watched this version of the movie.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.920
 And it's still green screens everywhere.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.240
 It's like all the anime characters' mouths don't move,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.960
 and they're really deformed and weird.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.760
 We watched the whole thing.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.840
 It's like an hour and whatever, hour and 40 minutes.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.040
 And my boys loved it.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.040
 They didn't care a bit.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.800
 And I'm like, why do they even spend the time and money

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.880
 finishing the movie?

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.960
 It's like for kids' movies.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.080
 It's just like, ship anything, and they don't care.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.480
 I mean, maybe it's because it's Minecraft,

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.840
 and they're such that's with that, but like--

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.920
 Yeah, I remember I watched this movie that I watched.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.680
 There was some--

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.440
 I distinctly remember there were some--

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.880
 there was some X-Men movie, and there was that classic scene.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.000
 I think by "Clops" a guy can shoot lasers from his eyes

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.360
 where he can't control it.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.200
 There's a scene where he can't control it,

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.360
 and the laser blasts through the ceiling,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.640
 and you see an over-shot of building the lasers

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.800
 coming out of the building.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.480
 But in this print, it was just a giant three rectangle

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.520
 that was red.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.440
 They're just like a placeholder for it.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.680
 It looks so bad.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.920
 But what's funny, I don't know if it's the same for years,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.880
 though, because it wasn't like the whole movie was equally

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.640
 unfinished.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.840
 It was like random--

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.200
 No, right.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.160
 --part of it.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:45.640
 Yeah.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.760
 Which is completely ridiculous.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.240
 Yeah, it'll go from like a semi-normal scene.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.240
 I guess ones where they didn't have as much work to do,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.880
 and then cut to like they're all just standing on stage

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.640
 with a green screen.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.440
 It's like, does that make you appreciate actors more like?

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.240
 It does, actually.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.520
 What a hard job.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.520
 Actors and also the people who do all the post-production,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.800
 because to take the shit show that it is,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.520
 the state that it's in, and turn that into good-looking footage.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.720
 Because we later watched a real movie

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.040
 when that came out recently.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.560
 It's incredible.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.960
 None of the bad stuff.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.760
 It's all fixed.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.160
 But you watch-- yeah, there'll be footage

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.680
 where you don't see the green screen,

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.040
 but you just see all the green halo around them.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.400
 All their hair is green from the lighting from the green screen.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.320
 But they've kind of replaced the green screen.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.360
 Every frame they have to fix that stuff.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.520
 It's kind of incredible to think that a movie gets made ever.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.520
 It just seems like there's so much mountain of work.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.640
 Movies seem so--

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.560
 I do not understand how so many get made.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.440
 There's so many people involved.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.160
 Think about how hard it is to a team of five.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.960
 Can you think of five to all that work probably?

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.040
 That's hard.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.720
 There's hundreds of people working--

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.160
 Oh, yeah, the credits.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.920
 Yeah, when you watch the credits, it's incredible.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.200
 So much money involves compressed time schedule.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.440
 The thing I also think about is oftentimes

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.320
 you'll see when a director first gets their big break,

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.080
 it's usually that they've made something small that was good.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.920
 Then they get picked up by the Hollywood studio

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.400
 to make something that has a $200 million budget.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.560
 Of course, they have people around them supporting them.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.120
 But I've always been like, that's such a crazy jump.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.560
 Imagine you're just making these like--

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.680
 $10,000, $100,000 movies.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.360
 And all of a sudden, you're like, oh, yeah.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.160
 Here's $200 million.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.240
 You're in charge.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.680
 And there's like hundreds, thousands of people working on it.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.760
 It's-- yeah, I don't know how anyone makes that jump.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.200
 This is actually something I can't believe

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.160
 we've never talked about.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.080
 I don't think we've ever talked about this on the podcast,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.280
 which kind of blows my mind.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:44.440
 Why have we not taken movie studios, the model,

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.680
 whatever they figured out?

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.600
 Because you're mentioning compressed schedule.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.280
 Sometimes they turn these movies around in what, like,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.520
 two years or something?

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:50.960
 Yeah.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.680
 How have we not taken some lessons from that

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.800
 and applied it to like startups or companies?

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.320
 Because there's a finished date on the project.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.720
 OK, so that's why it doesn't apply?

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.520
 I think that's fundamentally why it's different.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.160
 There's a date when the thing is complete.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
 You cannot do anything else to it.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.880
 And you're done, like, there's no mystery on, like,

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.640
 do we need to keep it?

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.520
 Do we need to go into this?

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.480
 We need to go into that.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.040
 It's just like there's a project and needs to be done.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.640
 So movie studios, game studios, et cetera, yeah.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.880
 Hear me out.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:23.320
 If a movie ends up, we create this, like, amazing artifact.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.240
 And all these people come together

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.920
 to push it to this crazy, awesome state

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.040
 in a short compressed time frame.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.960
 And the only constraint is you have

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.360
 to pick a date when it's done.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.040
 Can we not do that with software and then just be done with it?

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.600
 Yeah, let's go video games.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.080
 OK.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.520
 I think the only software that is sold that way,

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.480
 where it's like there's a day where everyone buys it

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.240
 and it's, like, basically done.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.440
 And it's funny, because even video games are, like,

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.760
 totally transformed now, right?

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.640
 Like, a lot of other studios have, like, infinite updates,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.800
 expansions, like the whole live service thing.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.000
 It's built, like, a fast product.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.600
 And that follows the trend of, like, yeah, they suck now.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.320
 It's the inshitification you've talked about.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.240
 Like, now video games, people complain

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.880
 about how buggy they are when they first ship.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.280
 And, like, that's all because we got rid of the movie studio

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:10.920
 model.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.120
 Let's just bring it back.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.560
 It's the problem that, like, the real world is too messy

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.480
 for software to have an in-date.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.360
 That's the problem.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.360
 I think there's just-- it's kind of, like,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.720
 accepting the reality of the world, which is with software,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.000
 it's somewhat fungible compared to a movie.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.840
 Like, one movie versus another movie is not replaceable.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.560
 Like, you can't be like, oh, I can replace this movie

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.560
 with another movie, because there are totally

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.560
 different experiences.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.040
 But--

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.760
 OK, I'm still-- I'm sorry.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.640
 I've got to stop you.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.720
 I still am trying to just think of what fungible means.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.480
 I was trying to pick up context exclusion words.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.440
 I've heard the word.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.280
 I'm afraid to ask now at this point.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.680
 But, like, what is fungible?

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.360
 It means, like, that you can replace one instance of it

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:48.800
 with another.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.120
 Like, in a group of things, all the things

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.080
 are effectively equivalent.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.920
 So I have this group of almonds on my desk, one almond,

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.120
 eating one versus the other, they're effectively the same.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.440
 You just snack on almonds.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:01.920
 It's like raw.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.600
 Yeah, it was probably that.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.840
 You don't like almonds?

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.760
 I'm not a big fan.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.440
 Kind of a sneaker.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.720
 Do I know it's in general?

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.560
 I do love nuts.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.440
 Yeah, just not on a mess.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.720
 I think you're going to say macadamia.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.360
 Oh, macadamia is that how we're talking about.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:11.960
 I can do it.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.120
 I am so sweet.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.960
 Oh, yeah, macadamia is too.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.880
 But, of course, it's the most expensive nut that you like.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.320
 They are.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.920
 I literally do.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.480
 That's so funny.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.360
 Oh, I think they're probably like grown in Hawaii or whatever.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.920
 I have expensive taste.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.440
 OK, so back to the fungible.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.720
 So you're saying software is not fungible or is fungible.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.520
 It's more fun.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.120
 It's more fungible than a movie.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.040
 So, like, someone else can come in

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.760
 and make similar software that does the same thing

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.640
 in the same space.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.960
 Oh, OK.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.960
 Competitors.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.040
 I'm only learning what those are recently

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.920
 because we work on open code.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.760
 And there are 1 million and two competitors to open code.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.640
 Oh, my God.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.560
 That's new for me, too.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.680
 Yeah, like, yo, yeah, you've worked on SSC.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.080
 Like, most of my career has been working on statmues.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.720
 And, like, there's nothing like statmues.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.960
 I mean, there's a couple of comparisons.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.520
 But, like, largely built for five years on statmues

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.720
 without ever thinking about, like, our competitors.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.520
 And it's been, like, a month of work on open code.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.240
 And it's like, there's new ones literally every week.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.960
 What in the world?

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.560
 There's too many AI coding agents.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.240
 I can't say that.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.800
 I feel-- I even felt an experience in a while,

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.440
 especially in the startup stuff.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.520
 But this now is something that I feel a lot of an experience

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.520
 with where, like, my--

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.680
 I don't have, like, the experience of psychology

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.320
 having, like, so much intense competition that

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.280
 shows up every single day.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.600
 Yeah.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.560
 Like, I need to, like, develop my own sense of how I, like,

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.040
 operate with that day-to-day.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.480
 Yeah.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.720
 It's definitely very new for me.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.240
 It's new.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.520
 There's a lot of things about it.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.440
 I don't like, if I'm being honest.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.720
 There's probably parts of it that are nice.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.480
 I don't know.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.960
 It's a different kind of, like, to have a look

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.080
 at what other people are doing.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.360
 And it can kind of either motivate you or give you ideas.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.240
 That's interesting.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.720
 You're not just, like, making everything up as you go.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.920
 But it also is really annoying.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.840
 That part of it's annoying, because it just feels like everybody

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.280
 feels like we have to copy each other.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.040
 Whenever somebody does something, you have to do it, too.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.320
 And it's like, somebody's going to come into your discord

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.080
 and be like, why don't you support x, y, z?

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.800
 And it's like, well, I guess we should support that.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.760
 And then you have to add it.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.120
 I don't know.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.200
 It's just like, there's a lot of annoying parts to it

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.400
 with this whole competition thing.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.280
 I don't think I like it.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.080
 But I feel like you're a big capitalist person.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.640
 Pro-capitalism, you're going to be, like,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.480
 competition is very important for the health of the economy

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.480
 and the river.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.240
 Yeah, it's good for everyone else.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.320
 But-- But it's not the people in the thick of it.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.320
 Compute it.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:44.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.960
 So it's like, I think the way I'm approaching it

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.840
 is kind of trying to take a step back

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.720
 and thinking about what I personally am really good at

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.920
 and the decisions we've made and how, if you replay that

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.640
 every single day over the next year,

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.920
 they'll probably add up to a good spot.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.920
 Every day is not going to feel like we're winning.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.000
 That's I think that's the thing that's new for me.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.800
 Because when you're in a space, it's not as competitive.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.040
 If you're-- I guess he had no competition,

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.800
 but there was other things.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.640
 But we're always the best option of the options.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:24.560
 So there wasn't a day where someone else had a spotlight

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.920
 on them or anything, which is kind of different with this.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.920
 That picks at one of my insecurities--

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.560
 or not insecurities, but one of the things

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.640
 I don't think I'm good at, which is knowing what I'm good at.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.840
 So maybe that's why I hate the competition thing,

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.040
 because what you said makes sense.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.880
 That sounds refreshing to be like, listen,

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.040
 I know what I'm good at, and I'm just

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.760
 going to keep doing that, and things will be great.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.800
 I don't feel like I know what I'm good at often,

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.160
 and I question it all the time.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.480
 And I try and figure out, why have I

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.680
 had any success in my career?

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.720
 Because I think I'm good at it.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.440
 Yeah, I guess for me, it's a little more tangible,

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.800
 because ultimately, we're building a tool for developers.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.320
 I've been doing that for a very long time,

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.680
 and there's a lot of counterintuitive stuff

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.360
 that I've picked up, and as a team we've picked up.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.840
 So that is not something you can kind of drop in overnight.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.120
 And the tough part is, that doesn't manifest as, oh,

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.440
 we built this one feature that nobody else did

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.320
 is a very experience.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.600
 It's more around positioning and little details

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.560
 and knowing what we should focus on,

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.800
 what we should focus on, what kind of paints you

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.360
 into a corner.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.920
 But none of those things are cute.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.920
 They're things that show up after years of working on something.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.280
 You see the results of that kind of experience.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.720
 I think that that's kind of like the struggle.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.320
 All of our advantages are more small things every day

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.080
 that add up to a big thing.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:54.920
 OK.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.440
 Yeah, it is interesting how when you're

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.920
 building in the dev tool space, that you've

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.560
 got a lot of experience with this.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.200
 When you're building a dev tool, all your competitors

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.600
 have a lot of the same advantages.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.760
 You don't have some advantages where you're a developer

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.080
 building a product for yourself.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.440
 Everyone's building a product for themselves.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.520
 We're all developers.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.400
 That's actually the counterintuitive thing, though.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.320
 It helps that we're building products for ourselves.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.600
 That's good.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.320
 But this market is so, so, so massive.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:29.160
 That there's just so many different situations that

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.720
 exist that you can't even fathom of.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.760
 The long tail, and it's like huge.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.320
 You would imagine that, oh, most people are like me,

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.160
 and there's like a few people not like me.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.360
 It's actually most people aren't like you,

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.160
 especially the people operating in this space.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.120
 And I've just learned that over the years.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.280
 We see people--

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.360
 I mean, the funniest thing with SST that always happened

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.240
 was we've worked so hard on making certain things work

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.760
 really well, and certain features,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.440
 and get to a really high level of developer experience.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.080
 Then we'll talk to some enterprise company using our stuff.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.240
 And 80% of the features don't work in their environment.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.880
 But they're really happy.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.960
 They're really happy, and they're like, this is great.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.160
 It's just like from their point of view,

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.560
 this stuff that we're like, this is so important,

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.560
 their expectations are so low for one.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.800
 And then for two, we just assume some of this stuff

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.400
 would just work everywhere, but it doesn't.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.680
 Because there's all these weird setups, and restrictions,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.800
 and all that stuff.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:32.600
 So that is something you cannot buy or learn overnight.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:37.120
 It is like learned after years of messing up over and over.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.720
 Yeah, so that's one thing.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.000
 And the second thing is this B2C focus.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.680
 I think most developers do not have the B2C bend to them.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.480
 You worked outside--

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.160
 OK, that I believe.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.240
 --B2C.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.080
 I have only had one experience prior to SST

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.400
 that was more B2C oriented.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:59.160
 And I wouldn't even say, I learned the right things from that.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.400
 Jay and Frank, extremely B2C oriented,

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.120
 I've learned a ton working with them.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.840
 And it's all very simple stuff, but just kind of a different mindset.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.600
 I think developers are--

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.960
 it's very counterintuitive to the way most developers think.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.680
 And you can see that why you can see that most big consumer

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.160
 apps aren't really founded by really strong engineering

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.600
 founders for the most part.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.480
 And I think DevTools is that, and people don't really realize it,

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.520
 because it seems very technical and engineering.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.800
 Just this conversation, this little--

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.200
 where I'm like third branch of the original conversation.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.440
 I don't know if we're ever going to resolve

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.040
 what we were talking about, but made me think of like three

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.960
 more things I want to talk about related to the open code stuff.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.800
 Yeah, go.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.920
 I may assume we'd talk a lot about open code.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.920
 One, before I forget, just things that seem really overrated.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.720
 We've been now working on open code for a while,

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.320
 and there's so many competitors.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.800
 And everyone, like I said, we're all just copying features

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.360
 from each other, and you have to have all the features.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.240
 And some of them are just so stupid.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.720
 And I want to just say things that are stupid.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.760
 Reasoning models, I know you're going to agree with a lot of these.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.120
 Overrated, maybe.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.080
 Not stupid, but just like, I don't get it.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.760
 So reasoning models, I know people

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.720
 say they're so much smarter and look at the benchmarks and whatever,

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.160
 but they're just really slow.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:17.920
 And I don't care.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.640
 They're so slow.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:24.920
 And subagents, also stupid, don't care.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.600
 Agents.md, stupid, don't care.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.080
 Like, initializing the project is just stupid.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.160
 There's just so many of these things I'm just reevaluating.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.160
 Like, should we just cut this stuff out if we actually

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.120
 don't believe in it?

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.720
 But you just feel like when so many people

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.680
 keep asking for the same stuff, custom commands.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.560
 Why don't you guys use custom commands?

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.200
 No, it's not worth the time.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.520
 I feel like all this stuff, people

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.040
 are really trying to just tinker too much.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.560
 I don't know.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.760
 Yeah, I think it's one of these things

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.320
 where it's like, you can get to a really good experience

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.560
 without any of those things.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.360
 Yeah, I believe that.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.960
 And I think you can actually continue to use it even

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.360
 on your first day, on your 10th day, on your 100th day,

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.520
 still without using any of those things.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.520
 I don't.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.640
 And I'm happy using these tools.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:20.240
 But yeah, there is this push of putting more and more stuff

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240
 around it.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.680
 Yeah, I think I've said this before.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.720
 I'm generally OK with that, as long

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.760
 as the new user experience is not hindered at all.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.360
 Yeah, I think.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.140
 But yeah, some of these things--

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.560
 People do work differently, I guess.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.720
 That's the thing I'm just counting.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.800
 Yes, people do work differently.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.280
 Something like custom commands, you can imagine that if there's

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.960
 something that you're constantly doing with the LOM,

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.840
 it's kind of nice to just give it a shortcut more or less.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.480
 It's just a shortcut at the end of the day.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.960
 The sub-agents thing, yeah, that one,

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.160
 I'm just like, I'm surprised Cloud Code shipped it for one.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.400
 We knew how to do it for weeks.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.160
 And we knew how we were going to do it for weeks.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.920
 And I didn't bother shipping it, because I had no reason to.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.880
 Then Cloud Code added in, that was like, OK, I guess,

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.120
 I'll turn this on now.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.680
 It just doesn't work well.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.840
 The problem for me is the expectation versus reality.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.440
 It's like, agents have these, another good one.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.640
 I actually would love to use it.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.600
 I would love to say, here's how we do CSS.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.640
 Here's how I don't like using pry-catch.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.960
 Throw errors and handle high up.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.800
 I don't like using L statements, return early.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.280
 It's just stuff like that.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.400
 And in theory, that's great.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.080
 I think I can spend five minutes trying that up.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.840
 And it would actually save me a lot of time.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.320
 But the reality is, this is never--

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.640
 It doesn't look that way.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.480
 Weighted enough, yeah.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.600
 Yeah, maybe we can tweak something with that.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.440
 But I don't know if you saw people

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.760
 were looking at the way Cloud Code sends it up.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.600
 It was like, here are some extra instructions.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.000
 Feel free to ignore that.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.680
 That's awesome.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.280
 So yeah, it just doesn't work.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.520
 In theory, sub-agents worked really well.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.040
 I think I have one.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.400
 I tried to set one up for docs writing,

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.120
 because I was like, here's how we'd like to write docs.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.480
 Don't write a big chunk of text with every sentence.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.560
 Break it up with an example or something else.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.520
 Would be great.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.040
 But again, even if the sub-agent gets triggered, which

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.960
 half the time it doesn't, and then it goes,

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.040
 not really listening to it.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.400
 So these are kind of disappointing features

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.160
 at the end of the day.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:20.600
 Yeah.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.200
 For me, they've been just not something I care about.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.520
 I mean, I've tried, I've used them at times,

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.400
 and then just kind of not seeing the point.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.640
 But I guess, to your point, if it's not in people's way,

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.840
 and the people who do care about this stuff

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.880
 can just opt into it, then I guess it's just a surface area

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.800
 we have to support, it's whatever.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.480
 It's just so interesting to be working in this space,

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:47.120
 where I do believe that the model's not even getting better,

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.640
 just the model's this good.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.560
 I feel like there's still a huge amount of stuff

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:57.160
 to improve about this whole agentic coding assistant world.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.480
 And I feel like everyone's working toward that.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.560
 But it's so unknown.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.880
 There's just still what is the best workflow.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.480
 I feel like there's got to be an 80/20 best way

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.360
 to use these things that we just haven't found it yet,

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.680
 and everyone's still just searching.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.680
 But it's so elusive because all the evaluations

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.240
 are all over the place, and people

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.240
 have their own little homespun way of evaluating,

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.200
 and there's some YouTubers that do stuff.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.760
 But there's no concrete evidence that anything you do

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.120
 is actually making anything better.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.360
 It's all just kind of very fuzzy.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.200
 Yeah.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.640
 I had a conversation yesterday, which

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.840
 was a little bit enlightening in one of these directions.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.880
 So we shipped permissions yesterday.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:41.360
 And I was talking to someone about how they use these tools.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.400
 Now, when you hear permissions, you

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:48.400
 think, oh, they are really worried about it breaking something,

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.080
 so they want to review every single thing.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.040
 But a person was talking about a different perspective.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.960
 They actually don't really use it for permissions.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.440
 They're reluctant to let it run in the background

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.280
 and come back to it, because they feel like they are more

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.560
 likely to not properly evaluate a giant diff, which

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.840
 would you like when I get a giant diff,

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.760
 I don't really evaluate it properly.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.240
 So they use permissions as a way to see the changes

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.800
 incrementally, so they're absorbing it not as giant chunk

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.000
 at once.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:18.600
 Interesting.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.840
 And that's interesting, because we've

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.320
 talked a lot about how open code should

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.400
 be just a good code review tool.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.440
 So they were expressing their need very adamantly.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.840
 I need permissions, because I don't

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.360
 want to go off the rails.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.360
 But in theory, if the thing you got at the end

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.280
 was very easily digestible.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.600
 Yeah, we've stepped through it.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.240
 Yeah, exactly.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.320
 A lot of, like, yeah, effectively someone

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.640
 that really organizes their commits,

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.720
 you can set them in one at a time,

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.280
 like the equivalent of that.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.400
 Maybe they would feel differently.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:47.880
 Yeah.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.200
 So these are some of the product-y things that I think--

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.480
 yeah, I think the bar's pretty low.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.720
 I don't think people would really thought about it in this way

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.120
 or talk to people or try to understand some of these things.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.000
 Agreed.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.400
 Yeah, I'd like to say, we'll figure it out first.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.000
 I don't know.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.360
 I mean, when it comes to competition,

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.640
 that's kind of what it comes down to.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.520
 It's like there is the current table stakes

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:17.240
 and there's the stuff that you're doing above and beyond.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.840
 But that just shifts down all the time.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.000
 Like, the thing that's above and beyond becomes table stakes.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.520
 So--

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.040
 Yeah, as long as you always get the one that's

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:28.320
 first to the above and beyond.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.880
 You don't have to worry about competition.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.800
 And that's kind of what I'm leaning back on.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.400
 I want to get into a place where I'm not

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.680
 thinking about competition at all.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.440
 I think, like, I mean, Cloud Code has just taken off.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.000
 It's huge.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.840
 And you feel like you're chasing this giant.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.000
 But also, this is what makes me think it's

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.920
 more about just avoiding the terrible fatal flaw--

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.880
 or not fatal flaw-- but you talk about architecture,

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.800
 stuff like that where you just get into situations

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.120
 where there's a fundamental reason

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.320
 your thing does not adapt to the new paradigm.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.680
 And I feel like with Cloud Code, that

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.520
 could be just anthropic models not being the best.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.800
 As long as they only support anthropic models,

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.200
 then they kind of fall out of the running

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.320
 for maybe months on end while they're playing catch up

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.000
 if some other model leapfrogs them.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.600
 I mean, there's a lot of talk of GPT-5 coming.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.080
 Could it be better?

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:23.720
 I don't know.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.160
 Could Gemini-3 be better?

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.880
 Like, some models going to come out and be better

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.680
 at agentic coding than the Cloud models.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.080
 And that means if you're using Cloud Code,

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.560
 you're just opting into something less than, which is tough.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.960
 So I just view it almost just like minefield,

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.200
 where you're just trying to avoid the fatal flaw to keep you

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.120
 in it longer.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.440
 Yeah, that's why it's like I said earlier,

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.200
 it's so much about this is just positioning

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.480
 and picking the right spot on the board, which

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.200
 is why when I think about competition,

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.240
 Cloud Code actually draws no emotion for me at all.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:58.920
 Yeah, no same.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.440
 Actually, because I like them.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.240
 Yeah, me too.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.000
 Like, it's just like the team, like the people on the team.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.840
 Yeah, it's like, I only feel like good things.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.600
 Yeah, same.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.400
 I don't really feel that because they're not

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.680
 in the similar spot on the board as us,

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.640
 even though the product is very similar.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.880
 If I really think about it, if I can step back

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.760
 and have clarity, I think there's really only one other company

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.480
 that's in a similar spot and that's

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.280
 Klein with their fundraising announcement yesterday

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.760
 and how much they talked about their positioning.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.560
 They're probably the only other company or product

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.240
 that would say that really gets that spot that we're

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.000
 trying to occupy and how we're positioning stuff around it.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.560
 So when it comes to them, I also don't feel that negative

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.960
 about them either.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.600
 I don't either.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.920
 Because in their case, their product is very different,

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.800
 at least for now.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.240
 So for them, it's just like a straight execution battle.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.680
 Like, who can execute better?

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.760
 And that's something that I don't feel worried about either,

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.840
 because I have confidence in myself.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.600
 I think that's really all that--

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.960
 there's a lot of noise and a lot of things

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.800
 happening in this space.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.480
 But I think that's really only--

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.200
 that's like the only thing to really think about and take away.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.640
 The rest of it is kind of a normal noise,

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.880
 because they're either on totally different spots

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.880
 on the board, spots that we think

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.520
 are not good to be on.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.800
 And so it doesn't really matter what they do or what they're

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.040
 doing, it's just the positioning is off.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.160
 I kind of want to dig more into it,

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.880
 but I don't know, just Y-cline and not

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.360
 the three other forks of Klein or whatever.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.880
 You just mean because they just raised

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.400
 and they're going very enterprise.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.840
 I don't know.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.480
 I think their business model similar--

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.160
 focus on open source is really good.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.480
 It's not just like-- the thing is, everyone says,

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.320
 oh, open source is great.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.040
 Everyone says that.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.480
 It's obviously not controversial.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.560
 But I think they specifically understand why it's good.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.120
 It's not just like a general statement,

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.440
 and they're actually very much positioned around that.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.160
 The way they want to charge--

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.880
 the way they want to make money, I think, makes total sense,

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.000
 exactly the way that we're thinking about it.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.960
 And they launched a preview of their product,

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.280
 their paid product yesterday.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.800
 I think-- yeah, it's like very exactly how we're thinking

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.800
 about it as well.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.120
 Like, not charge for usage, pure seat-based model,

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:27.320
 only charge enterprise companies for the typical team--

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.080
 using this product as a team problems.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.680
 I think-- so that's all there, so I'm like, OK,

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.880
 we're basically the same positioning-wise.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.120
 The thing that I think is very different

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.280
 is they've been around for a lot longer than us.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.720
 And if you look at their scope, it's so pretty narrow.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:47.440
 And one thing our team is really, really, really good

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.040
 at, it's funny, because we feel like we're bad at this,

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.320
 because I think everyone's bad at this.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.840
 But I would say we're very good at compared to the average team

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.680
 is we do not restrict our scope, ever, because it's painful,

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.680
 because it means that each thing that we do

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.920
 isn't as polished as we could possibly make it.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.120
 That's why most people are bad at this,

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.560
 because you want to just really polish.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.680
 You want to focus on something and really polish it.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.520
 But we are really good at expanding scope

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.640
 to cover way more than most people

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.320
 would be comfortable taking on.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.720
 Yeah, it's interesting to seeing clients fundraise

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.080
 and seeing a picture of them in their office or whatever.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.560
 And there's a huge team.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.280
 Yeah, it's a big team with a narrow scope.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.000
 This open code is a small team with a wide scope.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.460
 It seems bad to actually make me feel better about that.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.080
 Yeah, I mean, this is what I mean.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.960
 It just comes out in execution.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:51.320
 Yeah, so we have resources to put behind the wider scope now.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.600
 But yeah, it's counterintuitive.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.120
 And I would say in a lot of ways, like,

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.880
 if you're not doing something counterintuitive,

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.560
 then you're probably not going to win.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.400
 So this is like our factor of that.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.120
 Everyone else will kind of look at this and be like,

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.600
 oh, that scope creep, or you need to go narrower.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.480
 But we'll make it work.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.240
 The wider scope always has a better benefit.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.080
 It just always does.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.680
 We've been getting a lot of open router tokens.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.080
 We had our first billion token day.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.680
 And then, well, I say a lot.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.080
 Like, we're still early.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.000
 I had our first billion token day, and it was like--

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.560
 We got 2 billion the next day.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.760
 The next day is 2 billion.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.800
 Yeah, we're just--

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.880
 It's jumping.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.320
 I like it, except I don't know if I like open router.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.880
 So I know you're looking at it right now,

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.760
 because your face is blowing out.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.920
 Boy, it's funny how blind we've been

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.960
 flying, because open router's been like our only source of data.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.000
 So we're like latching onto it.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.680
 It's like the only chart we can look at.

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.360
 So it's kind of you.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.480
 And it's a chart.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.240
 Look.

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.600
 But I finally got a daily active user chart up yesterday.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.920
 Which is nice.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.800
 I'm excited about that.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.880
 Wait, it's an actual chart, because I like charts.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.600
 Not just numbers.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.560
 Can I look at a chart?

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.680
 It's a chart.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:03.040
 Yeah.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.360
 Like where?

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:04.840
 I don't know.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.920
 Are you in there, a CloudFlare account?

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.680
 Probably not.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.800
 Oh, probably not.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.880
 I'll give you access after.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.160
 I found deep inside Cloud.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.680
 I literally spent like two hours yesterday clicking

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.560
 every single screen in CloudFlare.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.080
 The CTO CloudFlare was responding to me,

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.080
 helping me find the right screen.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.080
 That's how it's funny.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.680
 Funny what the situation this was.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:34.960
 But I found a place to compute unique active users.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.480
 So cool.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.360
 I just enabled-- I have to enable something.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.760
 So I just enabled it at midnight last night.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.640
 And we're already at 2.4k for the day,

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.160
 which is higher than I would expect.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.280
 Oh, that's great.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:46.800
 Yeah.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.720
 So there's thousands of people using us every day.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.800
 Good to know.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.040
 Yeah, we have no-- this is the first time learning that.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:57.680
 Like we had no way of knowing, which is unfortunate.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.720
 Like when you build a website, it's like--

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.960
 Everything's just there.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.920
 You just know.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.760
 Like you always know.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.320
 I've been working on a website for a decade.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.360
 And I just always know how many people use it.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.040
 But not so in dev tooling.

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.080
 People don't want you sending off random requests.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:10.580
 Yeah.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:11.040
 Sorry.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.640
 It's annoying.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.440
 That's why the Cloud3R Analytics didn't work right away,

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.040
 because it's oriented around websites.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.720
 And I like-- they're like, what do you mean you

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:21.560
 want the number of unique visitors to API slash and JSON?

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.680
 If you have a dot JSON.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.680
 Like we don't--

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.380
 We have zero.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.640
 And look at that, zero visits.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.360
 Oh, that's funny.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.640
 Yeah.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.520
 But yeah, it's fun to see some of this information,

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.120
 because you can kind of-- I got it though,

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.600
 the version of open code and the user agent header.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.040
 But they don't be able to see the distribution of people

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.760
 updating and stuff.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.400
 But yeah, that'd be nice.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.000
 What else besides open code?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.600
 Or other things about open code?

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.620
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:54.800
 Let's see.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.280
 What else is going on in my life?

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.920
 I almost died in my run today.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:58.360
 Oh, he almost died.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.640
 I'm not a baby.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:04.480
 Yeah, so my Friday runs, we go to this beach park area.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.720
 And the last few times I took Zuko with me,

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.200
 so he goes on my run.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.640
 And today, we were a little late later than we normally go.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.800
 And I took a path that's not directly on the beach.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.800
 And on the way back, we got caught in this one mile

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.440
 of zero shade path.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.840
 It was so crazy hot.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.640
 It was super hot.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.800
 Zuko was barely moving.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.520
 He was walking so slow.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.680
 I was like, oh.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.280
 This is like, I'm dying.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.440
 You're going to die.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.200
 I literally ran.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.280
 We made it to back up parking lot.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.720
 And I had lives like drive all the way to other sides

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.080
 so she could pick us up.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.160
 And yeah, it was funny.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.120
 We were walking.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.920
 And then we had a little bit of shade.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.400
 And Zuko was like, realize it.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.440
 He would just stop moving.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.000
 He would just stay there and not want to--

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.760
 Just chill.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.440
 I want to move.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.040
 Yeah.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.840
 And I'm like, it's funny because at the beginning of the run,

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.320
 he was like way too hyper and like going way too hard.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.840
 I'm like, you're going to regret this so hard.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.960
 Because you can't tell a dog, like, hey,

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.280
 this is actually like a 10 mile hike.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.360
 They're going to go into it.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.240
 They're just going to go out right away.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.040
 And they're going to be like, wait.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.040
 This is going on forever.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.920
 He's going to pace himself.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.520
 Yeah.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.600
 I'm going to go on a deep and deep run this.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.160
 The implication of what I just said

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.720
 is also really crazy because they like

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.160
 live so crazy in the moment.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.400
 Because they can't even think like, oh, this walk

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.160
 is going to last this amount of time.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.400
 And then we'll be done with it.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.200
 They're just like in the moment running.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.480
 And they're like, I'm running.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.280
 I'm outside.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.560
 I'm happy.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.040
 They can't even like, there's no concept of eventually,

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:41.880
 this will be over.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.240
 This will be over in 30 minutes.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.760
 And I'm like, what is it like to live like that?

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.800
 Because we obviously are nowhere close to anything.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.000
 But like that kind of onset.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.680
 Like I can go a whole day and not live

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.200
 in this current moment for like 10 seconds.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.120
 Yeah.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.880
 Yeah, Casey and I talk about this with kids

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.280
 because they say like kids.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.360
 Oh, true.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.000
 I think it's the is it the default mode that adults are in.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.640
 Your brain is in default mode or whatever,

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.240
 where you're both you're not really in the present moment.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.920
 You're like, anxiety about the future.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.160
 And pressure about the past.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.360
 Yeah.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.680
 But kids don't have it until a certain age.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.120
 And so they say like kids, you also

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:21.160
 can deactivate it with mushrooms, like magic mushrooms.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.400
 And so Casey and I, like kids are basically just

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.760
 always running around on mushrooms.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.080
 And that's what Casey and I say.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.160
 Like when they're doing something,

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.080
 picking a flower and just like staring at it

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.480
 or like chasing a bird around.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.480
 Like we just always say like mushrooms, man.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.480
 What's it like?

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.240
 Just man living on mushrooms.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.760
 We described that like picking a flower looking at it.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.320
 I wonder how much of this is like a purely biological thing

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.360
 and more like a lifestyle thing.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.240
 Because I know people, I've come across people

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.360
 that are like this as adults because they

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.720
 have a certain way of living.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.440
 There's this woman that lives.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.120
 She's so weird because she kind of looks.

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.280
 She's always like dressed in like barely any clothing.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.800
 She's always like, not like I'm not like saying like,

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.960
 oh, she's like things actual.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.200
 I'm saying she's like always in.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.920
 These look sunburn all the time.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.280
 She's like, she's outside all the time.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.680
 And she's always just got like the middle clothing you need

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.360
 so she can absorb as much sun.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.200
 And she's white.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.200
 She's like just like red and sunburn all the time.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.320
 Yeah, I always see her around.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.000
 And she's always like just looking at her.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.080
 You just feel like she's in the moment all the time.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.120
 And the funny thing is she's got,

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.400
 and she almost seems homeless.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.880
 Like that's kind of the vibe.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.680
 But then she's got this like really perfect

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.760
 Australian Shepherd that's always with her.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.160
 Never on a leash.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.080
 And the dog is like her and the dog are both like

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.880
 the same exact energy as living totally in the moment.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.840
 And it's always walking around.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.680
 I'm like, what are they?

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.120
 Clearly this person like doesn't have to work,

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.000
 doesn't have like is in some kind of lifestyle where like,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.920
 you know, things are pretty relaxed.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.760
 Yeah.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.600
 So I feel like they like,

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.640
 yeah, she probably lives.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.480
 Figured it out.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.640
 Like that. Yeah.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.120
 Yeah.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.200
 I want to figure that out.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.800
 That sounds so nice.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.960
 I mean, I think the dog thing,

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.720
 don't dogs very much take on the personality of their owners,

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.600
 right? Like, or just like take on the mood and everything.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.720
 Like they feed off of their owners.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.480
 I've known other dogs where they were very amped up

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.280
 because their owner was very amped up.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.680
 That's definitely a thing. Yeah.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.800
 Yeah. That's definitely a thing.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.640
 At the same time though, like we always mean,

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.120
 let's always talk about this because they're like,

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.720
 so Dormans are extremely,

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.200
 generally really extremely focused on individual people

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.720
 because they're like personal protection dogs.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.560
 So there's before getting a Dormans,

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.240
 you hear all this stuff about like,

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.760
 oh, they're so entombed your emotions.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.480
 They're like, they like marry you, whatever.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.560
 And Zuko just never does that at all.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.400
 Like let's just like,

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.080
 there's been times where I've been crying.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.120
 And he just like,

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.760
 just is annoyed that I'm not like playing ball with him.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:52.080
 But he just doesn't. He just doesn't take take on the owners stuff at all.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.760
 He's kind of in his, in his own world.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.960
 But I think other dogs. Yeah, they do that.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.280
 Yeah, this whole in-the-moment thing is,

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.960
 it's a constant pain point for me.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:08.160
 I feel like I don't ever just like appreciate a given moment.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.840
 Or just like, it makes the days go by so fast in years, I guess.

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:16.160
 Just when you're always kind of buzzing toward the next thing.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.320
 So do you know what Jay does every morning?

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.520
 Meditates, right? Yeah.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.080
 But he's been doing this since he was a kid because his dad wasn't to it.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.080
 So he's gone to a really crazy level of meditation practice.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.480
 And he always shares like, there's like different levels.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.600
 And your brain starts doing

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.360
 weirder things when you unlock these different levels.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.320
 He's always talking about that.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.320
 It's basically like hallucinogen effects, right?

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.240
 Like the same thing was saying about mushrooms.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.880
 He was telling Liz that this is the crazing I've ever heard.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.640
 Because no one on the planet feels this way.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:47.760
 He's reached a point where he looks at his life and he's like,

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.040
 "Man, this is going to take forever.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.920
 My life is so long.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.440
 Like what am I going to do with all of this time?"

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.560
 I have never heard anyone express that feeling.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.040
 Yes.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.080
 Isn't that crazy?

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.320
 Like that's what that does.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.600
 Yeah, because none of us feel that way.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.360
 Well, like where's the time going?

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.480
 Like I have such a little time left.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.920
 But he feels the opposite.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.760
 That sounds amazing.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:12.960
 Maybe this needs to be a team thing.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.080
 Maybe you all need to.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:14.480
 Yeah.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:14.800
 Okay.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.800
 I want to get it on some meditating.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.440
 For one hour.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.080
 Can I?

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:18.400
 Yeah.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.120
 The other part that he's mentioned is hour.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.560
 Does he do an hour every day?

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.440
 I think it's an hour.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.680
 I don't know the exact thing, but.

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.400
 Oh my god.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:30.000
 Is there like a light version of this where I can do it in like 10 minutes?

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.960
 Maybe you built up to an hour.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.640
 Maybe it's like running when you build up to it.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.840
 Yeah.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:36.960
 The other funny thing is,

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.280
 and this is a very common thing that when you meditate,

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.480
 there's like weird physical body effects.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.880
 And one is you feel like your hands are really large.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.080
 You feel like you're giant, giant hands.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:48.800
 Dax.

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:49.840
 I'm not kidding you.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.280
 Is that what happens when you have too much rooms?

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:56.960
 I cannot confirm her demise, but I'm going to send you a tweet.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.120
 Let me see if I deleted it.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.160
 I might have deleted it.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.360
 That I don't know.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.800
 Oh, did I delete it?

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:03.600
 Maybe I shouldn't.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.240
 I don't know.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:09.120
 I feel like I've been talking a lot about things on this podcast that maybe I shouldn't.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.200
 Is it like rappers?

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.320
 How they can be like a shot a man and like you can't get onto them?

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.360
 Because it's like a song.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.480
 This is like a podcast.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:16.720
 So.

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.360
 This is entertainment.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:17.840
 Yeah.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.240
 When I talk about work print movies and.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.360
 And work for listen drugs.

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.720
 Like listen, this is art.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.360
 Okay.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.000
 It's art.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:30.880
 Get off me.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.000
 Get off my case.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.560
 Anyway, at one point I tweeted a picture of my hand

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.360
 because I was so crazily impressed at how large my hand was.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.080
 I just tweeted it.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.480
 I can't find it.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.440
 I might have deleted it.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:52.720
 But can confirm an elevated states, your hands look huge.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.920
 But I mean, that's what they say.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.600
 That meditation, you can do all the same effects as hallucinogens.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.040
 Just do it naturally.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.600
 Interesting.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:02.720
 Yeah, man.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.920
 But to be honest, the hallucinogen thing has been.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:11.040
 I feel like this feeling of not able to live in the moment has even messed that up.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:17.120
 Because from now, well, I haven't done them in a while, but the reason is because the last

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:23.920
 couple of times I like hyper fixate and all the things that I'm thinking about or worried about.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:24.480
 Yeah.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.480
 I like need to be trying to solve.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:32.960
 And like the actual experience of the trip is very negative.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:39.280
 I will say the next day it feels incredible because I feel like I literally cannot think

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.080
 about these things anymore and my brain just can't even go there.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.200
 So it helps in that way.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.760
 But the actual experience itself, like I don't want to do it anymore for that reason.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.720
 There's like too many things that I'm like worried about.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.160
 Yeah, it is interesting.

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:57.440
 I mean, I've had some experiences in adulthood.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:01.680
 It's interesting that those like, they were great experiences for me.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.600
 Never had any negative experiences.

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.000
 Yeah.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.480
 But it's not a thing I ever think like, man, I want to do that again.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.120
 It's not there's like no habit forming nature to it.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.000
 It's just kind of like.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.320
 No, it's because it's not like a pleasureful feeling.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.840
 Like even even just even when you're having a good trip, you're like,

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.680
 you're like kind of uneasy and like it feels a little off and weird.

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.480
 So like yeah, it's just not something you want to dive into every single day.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:27.040
 Yeah, but I do keep seeing like psilocybin and art news articles and stuff.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.680
 There's a lot of people pushing like for PTSD and other things like clinical purposes.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.960
 Yeah, it's not really good. Yeah, it's not really good. The ketamine also,

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:40.880
 obviously, and medically controlled doses, non-Pelon musk doses.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:45.120
 That's funny.

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.840
 You know what I'm thankful for living in this current moment?

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.560
 I'm thankful that I haven't heard nearly as much about Elon Musk or Trump or dough.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.000
 That's a really good point.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:54.560
 You know what I mean?

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.360
 I feel like it's been like weeks of really not knowing what they're doing or caring,

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:04.080
 not being inundated with updates about, I don't know, all that stuff.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.360
 I have no perspective on this because, you know, I told you I was like unplugged from everything.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.160
 Oh, right, right, right, right.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.720
 The only thing that didn't make it to me was a tariff officially going back into place.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.680
 Oh, really?

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:14.880
 I haven't heard too much about that.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.520
 Well, that's not because the deadline was the 31st.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.320
 That sounds bad.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.800
 Is it going to ruin our economy?

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:21.360
 I don't know, we'll see.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:21.920
 I don't know.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.240
 What is our economy even doing?

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.840
 Well, it is an economy.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:35.680
 Something you ever just think about the broader machinery of the world and how does it all work?

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:40.320
 When people talk about printing money and they talk about all these things and mechanisms and

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:44.400
 countries lending each other money, it just all just blows my mind.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.600
 I can't even got brand.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:51.600
 The thing to bring it down to a micro level, sometimes when I travel, I'll drive through

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.920
 some rural place with a small town and people in this small town will have these big pickup

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.720
 trucks that are maybe worth like $100,000.

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:05.280
 And I'm like, yeah, this pickup truck required $100,000 worth of parts and materials and labor

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.080
 and all that stuff.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:11.200
 Like how, and if you think about the little town as like it's on country,

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.960
 they can produce stuff and trade.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:19.040
 How are these small towns able to produce that much stuff to trade externally to buy

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.920
 this very expensive vehicle?

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:22.720
 Like, what are they?

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:23.280
 Whoa.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.760
 Like, imagine that when the town can service each other, that makes sense.

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:30.960
 Like someone grows food and someone, whatever, but they need to produce extra stuff on top of that

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.560
 to sell to the outside world.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.480
 I'm like, how does this work?

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:34.480
 Okay.

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:39.360
 So I feel like I know the answer to this and it's surprising that this isn't obvious,

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.360
 I guess to you, but maybe it's my unique.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:41.920
 Is it government?

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.280
 No, maybe it's my unique life experiences.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:49.120
 I've lived in those small towns of like a thousand people my whole life.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:53.600
 And I've made my money on the internet where it's not just-

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.440
 Well, yeah, the internet thing makes sense.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:55.760
 Yeah.

00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:00.160
 So like, it's just they make their money elsewhere and they live in the small town.

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.400
 But that doesn't explain every single person.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.520
 Like that makes sense.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.960
 It's not every single person now.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.120
 Okay.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.320
 Even in your town, right?

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:09.360
 I'm sure the wealthiest people probably do that.

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:14.800
 But like, let's say like the middle class, the more middle area.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:18.240
 Are they also making their money elsewhere remotely on the internet?

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.120
 Yes, probably not.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:19.600
 I don't know.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.960
 What were they doing 10 years ago?

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.440
 I do.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.000
 That definitely wasn't-

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.600
 I do often have the thought like, how do so many people have money?

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:31.520
 And like not like crazy money, not like generational wealth, but just like, I don't know.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.840
 It's like, there's a lot of nice things in America.

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:37.280
 Even in the like, podunk area that I live.

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.920
 It's like, there's a lot of wealth just floating around.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:43.840
 Well, whenever we drive to the typical place that we drive, like to the beach that we go to

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:48.240
 or to like our grocery store, there's like a unique route that we take usually.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:52.640
 And it's like a 15 minute drive, let's say to the Whole Foods.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:50:00.720
 And the whole drive, you were driving by like the nicest houses you can possibly imagine.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.080
 Like short of a $100 million mansion.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:08.960
 These are like in the like $10 million range, $5, $10, $20 million range.

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.800
 And it's not like a couple houses on a road.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.040
 It is all the houses on this road.

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.120
 And then all the roads that fork off of them, all down that road.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.480
 It's a massive, massive area.

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.040
 Yes.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:23.200
 And I'm looking at all these, I'm like, what the heck?

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:28.640
 This is like thousands of people that are living at this level of quality of life.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.000
 We drive through neighborhoods like that.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.080
 Like we go to Kansas City.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:36.320
 And this is not like a major wealth center in America, right?

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:39.760
 This is like, I don't know, Midwest, modest.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.680
 And you'll drive through a neighborhood like that.

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:46.640
 And you just see, and I just wonder, I need to understand, what is the default?

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.720
 Like, is there like a 80% case here where it's like doctors or like lawyers?

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.880
 I think it's like doctors, lawyers, real estate.

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:53.360
 Is that it?

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:58.560
 You get into that field and like, yeah, it's, I think the, all those, all of those careers

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.200
 are just a function of how many people are around you.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.120
 If you get to real estate, and there's like, you live in a place with thousands of people,

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:09.280
 like, you know, that that's a lot of money for you to tap into.

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.120
 Maybe the lawyers, maybe with a doctor, because these are just things that everybody uses.

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:18.080
 So that would explain why every city in America has these neighborhoods

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.280
 where there are dozens and dozens of houses that are.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.480
 It must just be that.

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.600
 I will say it's funny.

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.760
 Like Miami is always funny with this stuff.

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:30.720
 One of the houses in the corner, we know that this family makes these crackers.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.960
 These like crackers that are like Cuban people love.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:35.600
 Yeah.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.000
 And they're like really popular, I think, and they have like a mansion because they make

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:40.560
 these crackers.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:44.320
 So that was my next question is like, where do small business owners rank in the?

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.880
 And I think construction is another one.

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.480
 I mean, these are all small business owners like that.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:48.800
 Yeah.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.720
 For a lawyer, you're probably on your own.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.440
 I guess so, yeah.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.560
 If you're doing construction for your contractor, if you're like a plumber,

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:59.040
 like, you know, kind of those work your way up to, it's not just solo.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.640
 Like you're, you have a good team and stuff.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:07.280
 So you're saying, you're saying a plumber is amongst these levels of standard of living.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:11.280
 The reason I bring that up is when I was growing up, the first dog we got, we got

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:16.080
 this breeder and we went to the breeder's house to get the dog.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.600
 Massive, crazy house.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.720
 We learned that breeding is just like a side thing that he does.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.720
 And he's got like staff and all this stuff.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.960
 He's just a place that he's a plumber.

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:30.480
 But like, obviously, you know, probably doing like commercial stuff, like, you know,

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.720
 he probably has like a team and all of that.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.280
 Yeah.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:33.280
 Yeah.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:33.760
 Yeah.

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.760
 It's, I think it's all these jobs that are just like,

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.800
 every person will eventually hire you at some point in their life.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.840
 That the standard like foolproof jobs that kind of always exist.

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:47.680
 I think that's, that's who lives there as my guess.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.240
 Yeah.

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:51.360
 And then I guess it's like a function of time too.

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:56.560
 I was just thinking yesterday in the shower actually about like, man,

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.680
 I feel like I've been like working for an eternity.

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:05.120
 It feels like my career has never like, it's just was the beginning of time.

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:09.920
 And I feel that like worn down and old and like just toiling away.

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:13.200
 And then I realized like, oh man, I turned 40 next year.

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.080
 And then I was like, wait a minute.

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.760
 When do people retire like 60?

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.360
 I have 20 more years.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.120
 Like what are you talking about?

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.680
 Like 20 more years of working?

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:24.960
 No, I can't do this for 20 more years.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.440
 That was a lot of years.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.280
 I just, I burned too hot.

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.160
 Like I go too intense.

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.960
 You've got that like zen quality where you're just like,

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.200
 you got that low blood pressure, low heart rate.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:35.920
 You're just going.

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.120
 I feel like you could go forever.

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:42.720
 And I feel like I am like a, just a, I don't know, blowtorch.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.160
 And it's going to run out of fuel.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.360
 And it's going to go out.

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:45.760
 Yeah.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:45.920
 Yeah.

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.440
 That's probably we have to figure out.

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:50.640
 I mean, it's funny you described that about me, but it's all relative.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.920
 Like I think Jay and Frank are even more like that than me.

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:58.560
 And I feel like relative to them, I feel more like you that can relate to that.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.240
 Yeah.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.760
 So I'm like, it's free.

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.720
 It flicks on and off.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.560
 Now this past week has been very much like that.

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.760
 The previous couple of weeks, I've been in a really good place.

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.720
 Like just low and steady, like consistent every day.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.840
 So yeah.

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.880
 And Jay is like just flat all the time.

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.520
 That's amazing.

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.520
 No one I've ever seen.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.240
 I'm happy for him.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.440
 Frank is a little more spiky.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.360
 Frank will do this thing where.

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:28.480
 I love you saw my message the other day, but he's gotten sick a few times this past year.

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:31.600
 And every single time it's been after a major feature release.

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.160
 He keeps doing this thing where he just stops sleeping.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:38.720
 And eventually whatever his body's fighting off, his body's not strong enough to fight it off.

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.400
 And he gets sick for a couple of days.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.920
 So I'm just like, okay, so maybe Frank is like this as well.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.080
 Yeah, I can relate to the not sleeping thing.

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.920
 It's a pain point of mine.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:48.560
 It's hard.

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:49.360
 Life is hard.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:55.440
 But yeah, anyway, going back to, yeah, like these neighborhoods, it's just I look at them

00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:00.400
 and it takes me a while to realize like, oh, they probably moved into this house when they were like

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.880
 probably close to 50.

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:03.360
 Yeah.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.840
 It's not like they moved in there when they were like 20 or 30.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:10.080
 And you imagine like a lawyer, you know, 10 years away from retirement.

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.720
 Like, yeah, of course they should be able to afford something like this if they're

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:13.920
 decently successful.

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:16.000
 But yeah, it's bigger than you think.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:22.320
 I think about that same, it's the same idea with Brian Johnson because I try to like

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:26.960
 do really well and like eat and be active and do all the things you're supposed to do

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.960
 to like be healthy long term.

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:34.240
 But he like, and I look at him and I'm like, man, like he's so healthy.

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.360
 I bet it feels amazing.

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.560
 And it's like, wait a minute.

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.920
 He's like 45.

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.320
 When he was my age, he was way worse off.

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.880
 So it's like I got five years of just partying it up.

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.160
 I could live however I want.

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.040
 And then I can turn on the Brian Johnson in my 50s or whatever.

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.680
 I'm way ahead of schedule.

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.240
 It's fine.

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:50.640
 Yeah.

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.960
 I think about that too.

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.280
 Yeah, it just feels like everyone's your age.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.120
 But yeah, it's like they're not.

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.400
 They're like in a different phase of their life.

00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.120
 Mm hmm.

00:55:59.120 --> 00:55:59.440
 Yeah.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.760
 You're getting ready to enter into a different phase of life.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.200
 I'm so excited for you.

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.560
 It's going to be so easy.

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.760
 Oh my God.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.680
 If it's an easy baby, I swear I'm going to lose my mind.

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.920
 I mean, I'll be happy for you, of course.

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.760
 But if you actually get off easy, it's going to be so annoying

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.160
 to listen to you talk about parenting being so easy.

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:25.040
 Have I told you the observation I've made with our friends and their kids?

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.320
 Well, maybe, but I don't remember.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:31.520
 OK, so we have friends that are what's the right way to phrase this?

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.040
 Because I don't want to sound offensive.

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:40.240
 We have friends that are kind of like in our bubble where they're like really like

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:44.080
 quote unquote smart and like really focused on like queer stuff,

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.040
 like doing like really intense stuff like that.

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:52.560
 And then we have our other friends who are they're also like pretty successful,

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.880
 but they're like kind of that like more normal lives.

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:57.840
 There's not as an intellectual bent to everything that they're doing.

00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:58.320
 Yeah.

00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:02.640
 When we hang out with these two groups, we hang out with our more intellectual friends.

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.360
 We're like, we made a huge mistake.

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:09.360
 We should not have kids because they're all really miserable.

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.920
 Kids are like really crazy.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.840
 Like they like have not figured out this stuff.

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.840
 We can have with our other friends and we're like, man, this is going to be awesome.

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.960
 Because they're all like doing really great with their kids.

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.960
 They all seem happier than they've ever been before.

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:29.360
 And I'm like, there's something, I mean, there's something to be learned from here.

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.480
 I don't think I have that bent like that.

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:35.520
 I see the way that our smarter friends approach having kids.

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:37.440
 And I'm like, don't have that just out of pure laziness.

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:42.880
 I feel like they're like, they go really hard and like really overbearing in a lot of ways.

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.640
 That is just difficult to live in.

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.400
 I think this is a millennial problem.

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.880
 I think it's an epidemic amongst millennial parents.

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:53.520
 I think we're maybe it was the internet and just how much information is available.

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:57.760
 Maybe it's like going hard the other way from what our parents were.

00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.760
 Like, I think there's something about that dynamic.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:04.720
 Like our parents generation, as parents, we look nothing like them.

00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.480
 And I think that's probably on purpose.

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:10.640
 Like we're just rebelling against things we did not like or whatever.

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:16.400
 Anyway, I would say it seems like the norm to me amongst millennial parents

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:20.960
 to be kind of like hyper-intense about parenting and it's exhausting.

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.160
 And having been on it currently is a thick of it.

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.120
 It's exhausting.

00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.320
 And it feels like, I don't know, it feels like it's permeated everything in my life.

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:33.360
 Like, I'm this way about everything, about work, about relationship, about kids.

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.240
 Yeah, don't do it.

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.080
 Stay away.

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:38.720
 From what?

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:39.680
 I mean, from being the-

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:44.400
 No, no, no, for being the intense, the thing you described.

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:49.200
 Like gravitate towards the friends you have that do not have that bend and be that way.

00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:54.480
 Yeah, I think that this really basic wisdom that's really been around forever.

00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:59.200
 But it's whatever is good for you as the adult is effectively good for the kid.

00:58:59.200 --> 00:58:59.360
 Yeah.

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:03.280
 Because if you're like dressed out and barely able to operate,

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:07.200
 like, it doesn't matter if what you're doing is technically good.

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.240
 It's practically probably not a good thing in net.

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.640
 And I'm sure other friends have like difficult moments and stuff.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:17.600
 But yeah, we've been hanging out with them and their kids from like the moment they were born.

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:22.880
 And I don't know, they just seem like they adapted to it really quickly.

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.640
 And things feel straightforward.

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:24.880
 Yeah.

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.320
 Maybe it's some kind of coincidence where their babies were just easier.

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.880
 But I don't know, that's like way too strict of a pattern.

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:32.240
 Do they have like hobbies?

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.920
 What do they describe more about these people?

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.360
 Yeah, they definitely have hobbies.

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.400
 Yeah, I mean, like what specifically?

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.160
 Or just tell me more about their personalities.

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.000
 Or like, are they outdoorsy people?

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.360
 Or do they have a lot of friends?

00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:46.560
 They definitely are decently social.

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:49.040
 They feel like they're like alive.

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:51.440
 Like I feel like they're like really experienced life.

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:52.960
 And they're like live in the moment.

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:55.840
 I think the other thing is maybe they're a little more settled into their career.

00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:58.400
 Whereas, you know, for me, like I don't see it that way.

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.360
 I'm like still to me, it feels like an early stage.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:04.800
 But they like thinking more about other parts of their life.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:08.000
 Like, you know, they're like, hang out with their friends or they watch sports.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.120
 Or one of them, one of them has like a new hobby every time we hang out.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.600
 But it's like some new thing he's really into outdoorsy-ish.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.160
 Yeah.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.320
 So yeah, I don't know.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.360
 It just feels like there's a good harmony with everything going on in their life.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.760
 Yeah, just the reason I asked all that.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.480
 Like Casey and I, the strong feeling we have is that we need to spend a lot more time

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.960
 with other people and a lot more time outside.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.640
 I feel like if we could do those two things, like when we do those things,

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.920
 our kids seem to thrive and we'd all seem just happier.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.520
 So yeah, yeah, I want to get there.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.040
 Yeah, we're glad we have them because then when we have kids,

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.880
 and you know, our kids can hang out and everything.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:52.000
 I'll hang out. Yeah, the other funny thing is we also have Liz's cousins.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
 So Liz has a cousin in her family.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.480
 There's basically only one kid.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.080
 There's two now that they just had another second baby, like the first kid.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.440
 He's like six or seven now.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:06.560
 Like the best kid you could ever hope for.

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.880
 Like super nice, really fun.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.440
 Like I don't think I've ever seen her miss babe in all the years that I've known her.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.040
 It's like really nice to be around.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:22.480
 Like really sweet and you just would never, you can't point to what the heck caused that.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.720
 It's just like the there's nothing you would look at, like how she was raised or anything.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.600
 And there's nothing you would point to be like, oh, yeah, that's why.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.520
 It's like nobody will.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.760
 I don't think anyone, I mean, we mostly know her dad, but he's not like he was not.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.680
 He was reading books or like even thinking about any of this stuff at all.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.840
 She's kind of came out and I guess was like that.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:47.760
 Yeah, is that like an old soul though, they say like some people just seem like.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.160
 Yeah, they've been around up.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.040
 Yeah.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.560
 And now they're the second baby and we'll see how this baby turns out if she's the same.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.240
 The great spirit has something there.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:56.720
 Yeah.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.320
 But like her family's crazy.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:02.240
 Like, you know, they're like loud and they're like yelling and they're like,

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.960
 they're not like following any kind of like good parenting stuff that you read about.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:11.840
 You know, like the kids are great. So what can you say?

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.720
 What can you say?

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.040
 I'm so, so excited for you guys.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:19.680
 So anxious to see how the sleeping goes, how all the other things go.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.640
 I'm excited and nervous and all of the things.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.400
 We're going to do shifts and it's going to work perfectly.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:24.880
 Oh, yeah.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:25.360
 It's going to happen.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.240
 It's so easy.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.040
 This parenting site.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:27.360
 It's so easy.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.920
 It's going to be so easy.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.360
 All right.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.800
 Well, all right.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.320
 It's probably done to get out here.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:34.960
 A lot to do.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.800
 Yeah, and we're going to talk about other stuff now.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:41.120
 Oh, yeah, probably because we don't always record guys.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.960
 Listen, now we're talking about secret stuff.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.560
 We, we have a friendship outside of the podcast now that you don't get to see.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.160
 You don't get to be a part of this stuff.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:48.960
 We do in private.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.680
 What happens in the privacy of our bedrooms?

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:56.800
 I just remembered that this is a podcast when we start talking about stuff like that.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.000
 Where are we on YouTube again?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.520
 Are we going to move somewhere else now?

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.280
 I have no idea.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:01.840
 Should we?

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:02.640
 We're kind of a mess.

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.040
 I don't know.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:03.760
 We're kind of a mess.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.400
 Wherever you've found this, congratulations.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.280
 It might be somewhere else.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:11.760
 That's part of the fun.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.920
 You got to find us every week in a different YouTube channel.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:14.560
 Different YouTube.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.520
 All right.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.000
 Yeah.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.560
 See you.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.120
 All right.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:17.120
 Yeah.
