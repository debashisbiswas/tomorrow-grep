00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 How's that noise? What noise? It sounded like a cat. I think it was a squeak from my mic boom.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 Oh, my video's not on. It's...

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:42.800
 Oh my god. What is that? What is it? Are you dressed like me? I'm sorry, what?

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 You and Ken, I mean you guys wear these cool necklaces and like you're not the only men that can wear necklaces. I can wear a necklace.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.800
 I totally love a necklace. It's funny because you're calling it a necklose and me and Ken will call it a chain.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.800
 Is that what they're called?

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.800
 Oh my god, that looks like a Cuban link too.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.800
 Oh really? Maybe it is from Cuba.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.800
 I'm going to wear it to Miami.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.800
 Just see if anybody says anything.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.800
 Just like see, like, would people just think, "Oh, this is how Adam dresses when he's like in person?"

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.800
 It looks a little off on you. I can't tell what it is.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.800
 Maybe it's just so out of the character.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.800
 You know this is a joke, right? You know I'm not actually going to wear a necklace.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 I know it's a joke, but I'm like, "Why does it look so funny?"

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.800
 That's what I want to know because like I thought about how when I put it, so I bought this just for this, just to gag you, just to prank you.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.800
 But I thought about like it's going to look so weird on me. I put it on. It does look so weird on me and I thought like it doesn't look weird on Dax or Ken.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.800
 Why? What is it about me?

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.800
 Is that like a real chain?

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.800
 I got on Amazon. I mean it's, I don't think it's real gold.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 Okay, I'm going to say, because look how like yellow it looks, it looks like a cartoon concept in gold.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 My mind's like, you know, like a little dull.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.800
 Okay, so if mine were duller, would I look normal in a, "Oh, do I got to tuck it in the shirt? I got to tuck it in the shirt."

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.800
 Well, it depends. Sometimes I tuck it in, sometimes I don't, well, now we can't see it at all.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800
 No, you can't even see it.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.800
 Just a little subtle like a little, is that nice?

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.800
 That's funny. Okay, I'm taking it off.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.800
 I think you start trying to try to get a real one.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 I'm not, no, I'm not actually going to wear one.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.800
 I'm going to send this back. Amazon returns are too easy.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.800
 I've won one for a while, but it's because it's like someone my mom got me.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800
 It's not.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.800
 Oh, nice. It's like sentimental value.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.800
 Yeah, it wasn't like, I was, initially it wasn't like someone that wants to go get a chain, but then Liz's dad.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800
 So the one I'm wearing now is Liz's dad's.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.800
 Because he had one that was like

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 super old and he gave it to me and it looked really bad because it was old.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.800
 But then we took it to the place and they polished it and then it looks like amazing now.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.800
 And it's like worth a good amount of money. So it was like a nice, nice thing.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.800
 That's awesome. Yeah, I don't know why it looks so weird on me and it doesn't look weird on you.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.800
 I really, I'm not making fun of you. It looks totally normal.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 If this is what it would be like, if I got a tattoo, it would look totally wrong.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.800
 Maybe. Yeah, it is crazy how people's like personality can kind of affect their appearance, but.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.800
 So like something just don't match, but I don't know.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.800
 When you're in Miami, you can put this one on and we'll see if it looks weird still.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.800
 Okay. Yeah, we'll see if anyone notices that you're not wearing one and then I am wearing one.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.800
 I was going to come on to be being like, wait, did you lose your chain?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.800
 Adam's borrowing it for an experiment.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.800
 I'm sick, by the way. I don't know if that was clear.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.800
 Yeah, no, I could tell. I might notice a little stuffy, but I don't think I'm sick.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.800
 Interesting. I slept terrible. Do you track your sleep?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800
 Have we talked about this like three times?

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.800
 I have an eight sleep, so it's like I can't not track my sleep, you know?

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.800
 Do you know like what a sleep score is?

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.800
 Yeah, my sleep's sort of always amazing every single day.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800
 Really? Like how amazing?

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800
 Like 90s.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.800
 Really? You're like Casey. I get like 80s are good for me.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.800
 Most days are in the 70s and this morning was like 47.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 I slept like three hours. I couldn't sleep because of how sick and stuffy.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.800
 So like I'm not going to get better because I'm not sleeping, you know?

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.800
 You're checking your score.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.800
 Okay, 85 today, but I went to sleep on characteristics late today.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.800
 What the why'd you go to sleep so late? You mean last night?

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.800
 I was actually working. I was super into into work.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 You know that thing that I always say where if you just change up your workflow,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.800
 you get a proximity boost, even if the workflows are better.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.800
 So that kind of happens to me yesterday because do you remember I was asking a while ago,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.800
 like, Hey, has anyone made a better front end for GitHub issues?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.800
 Because I'd love to like actually use GitHub issues for us as T stuff.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.800
 And it's just so slow when you're managing the stuff day to day.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:15.800
 And I know and I know there was an app that like synced the issues to linear and it would be bidirectional.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.800
 So changes you made in linear would reflect back.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 And I used that a while ago, but it was like a little off.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.800
 But then I remembered, Oh, linear actually released a native version of this.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.800
 So they have this thing where you can connect your GitHub and it syncs everything into linear.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.800
 Also, like it just like kills me how good they are itself like you connect it like a normal country GitHub thing.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.800
 Then they have this migration assistant flow to like import your existing issues.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.800
 And they just like thought of like every little detail.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.800
 It's like they knew that okay, sometimes some of the users and the GitHub issues are going to be people on your team.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.800
 So let's help you map them like just every little detail was just flawlessly executed and it's like damn.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.800
 Even the places where like, like that's less about like speed and performance.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.800
 And that's more about just like really good details, right?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.800
 Yeah. So even there they did a great job.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.800
 So you sync it over and it's perfect like everything works.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.800
 Like everything's synced by directionally.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.800
 They have like a native like a different comments UI pops up so that when users are commenting on GitHub,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.800
 they like still show up inside a linear ticket as though it's like a native comment and everything.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.800
 Yeah. And it all just works and it's obviously fast and super performant like linear.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.800
 So now they just fix GitHub issues like you just don't have to use GitHub issues at all if you're maintaining a project

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.800
 and it all just works and have to like look at a bit of issue screen again.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.800
 So that they were really excited to me.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.800
 So I was like just burning down a bunch of issues.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.800
 Is there actually an issue or a sorry, that was going to be stated.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.800
 There's actually a problem with GitHub issues or is it just GitHub notifications?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.800
 Because that's the thing I hate about GitHub is notifications are meaningless.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.800
 There's just so many of them.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.800
 If you do anything at all on GitHub, you just get overwhelmed and then you don't look at them anymore because they're pointless.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.800
 Yeah, I think notifications are much, much more broad problem because even if you just create an issue,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.800
 you like might miss the fact that someone replied and everything is notifications are bad.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800
 Yeah.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.800
 I don't really like when you're actually working on like when you're someone that's working across a bunch of issues,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.800
 your workflow isn't really notification driven. It's just like you want to view where you see all the most recently updated issues

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.800
 in that order and you just go through it.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:23.800
 Yeah.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.800
 So that's what I get in linear and then obviously linear has notifications as well and that also just works.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.800
 So yeah, it's funny because I go a few weeks ago, I was like, man, someone should just build this.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.800
 Someone should just build like a better find for GitHub issues, but linear already did.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.800
 Linear was just like, yeah, it's like their scope is broader if they like also solved this problem as like a subset of whatever they're doing.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.800
 That's awesome.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.800
 That's an interesting startup product thing.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.800
 I hate the term product market fit because it just sounds, the people who say it just bother me.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.800
 I know it means something, but it just bothers me, the people who talk about product market fit.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:05.800
 But I guess like from a startup strategy perspective, just make a broad thing and then be like, oh, you know what?

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.800
 A lot of developers are using this.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.800
 Let's make like a thing that makes it really good for developers.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.800
 Is that a strategy that other people, like have you heard of this?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.800
 Do people do this?

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.800
 Does this have a name?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:25.800
 Well, this happens all the time where like someone with a better, there'll be like a bunch of people trying to like solve a problem.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:31.800
 Then someone with like a better angle on it solves many problems and also that problem and like kills you.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:42.800
 So that's usually like, if you look at SST ion, like we were always thinking from that perspective of what would what could come out that can make SST like irrelevant.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.800
 Yeah.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:51.800
 And we realize like the moment someone does something like what we're doing, but not pinned to AWS, where's irrelevant?

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.800
 Because like their thing can do our stuff and other stuff.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.800
 Yeah.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.800
 But yeah, you kind of have to always like watch out for that.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:08.800
 The other thing I was a little bit interested in then with this is, yeah, this thing where like you build a front end, a better front end for an existing like big product.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.800
 That usually doesn't work out, but in linear's case, they're like, they're obviously big on their own.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.800
 So it's a little bit different.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.800
 But this thing I just grabbed with GitHub, they're doing with everything.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.800
 They're doing it with like Asana with Jira with with all the existing software.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.800
 So you can literally be on a team that's like we've been using Jira for 10 years and you're like, I fucking hate this.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.800
 You personally can go create a linear account and just use linear and the rest of the team wouldn't even know.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.800
 That's amazing because a lot of people hate those tools like Jira and rally and whatever.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.800
 Yeah, and like you're never going to convince certain teams to put an effort to switch.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:51.800
 Or I was on a team that went through like four of them and ended up back on rally.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.800
 It was like started one place and then ended up back on it like eight years later.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:03.800
 It's like they can't, they just can't decide like every PM or person, every top stakeholder decides something different.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.800
 And then there's like a six month migration and then they're on it for a year.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.800
 That whole thing.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.800
 It's fine with a lot of these tools.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.800
 Like the unset thing is is the tools are the problem.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.800
 It's like it's hard to use.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.800
 It's hard to be organized and like have a good process.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.800
 It just makes you think about organization sites.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.800
 Man, my brain is slow today.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.800
 I mean, it's always pretty slow, but just heads up.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.800
 It's going to be rough.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.800
 Like you're going to try to have a normal conversation with me and I'm just going to be like boom.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.800
 Like normal then.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.800
 Ouch.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.800
 Yeah, just organization size.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.800
 Like I feel like sometimes I talk about the small team thing.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.800
 I know you talk about the small team thing.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.800
 A lot.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.800
 Like the future belongs to these tiny teams.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.800
 It can do more and more all the time, more leverage per person.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.800
 So you have these small teams doing big, big things.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.800
 But then there is like the other side where you need the big, big companies.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:04.800
 Like Amazon has to exist because you can't do what Amazon does with AWS with a small team.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.800
 Lots of those cases where there's big companies that need to exist.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.800
 I feel like in the middle is where you're in trouble.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.800
 Like if you're like 200 engineering team, I don't know.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.800
 I just, good luck.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.800
 Like I feel like a team of five is going to come in under you and do what you're doing better and more efficiently.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.800
 Or like you're just never going to compete with the big company, right?

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.800
 Is there like any theory around this?

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.800
 Why do I keep searching for validation?

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.800
 I keep looking for like, has anyone written a book about this?

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.800
 Could you tell me what it's called?

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.800
 We could just talk about it.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.800
 It's funny.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.800
 It's funny.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.800
 You bring this up because I've been thinking a lot about this over the last couple of days as well.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.800
 But before we get into that, there actually is a theory of what you're talking about.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.800
 But again, much more broad, but actually I've applied to this.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:52.800
 Just in general, middle zones in approaches tend to be really bad.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.800
 And there's like lots of cases like this.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.800
 Like it's very, it's good to like go to extremes.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.800
 Yeah.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.800
 Like if you're doing a little heroin, that's okay.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800
 A lot of heroin.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.800
 Also, okay.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.800
 Like middle zone heroin?

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.800
 Not so good.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.800
 You need to go all in or just dabble.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.800
 Yeah.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.800
 Otherwise, what's the point?

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.800
 But I think we've talked a little bit before.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.800
 Like a lot of celebs of work is built on this idea.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.800
 This barbell strategy idea is what he calls it.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.800
 Oh, right.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.800
 I've heard this.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.800
 Just so the two waits at the end.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.800
 Nothing in the middle.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:29.800
 But yeah, it's funny because I had this weird feeling where, of course, me, you, a bunch

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.800
 of people harp on this.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.800
 Small teams are important and good and can do a lot.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.800
 It's a thing that's in the air.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.800
 Like, oh yeah, like a lot of times small teams out ship bigger teams.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.800
 So we do talk about it a lot.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.400
 But at the same time, I feel like we don't talk about it enough and it should be driving

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.760
 people insane because there are so many examples that we just take for granted and don't look

00:12:52.760 --> 00:13:01.080
 at where a small team is acts is like demolishing a bigger team, like destroying a bigger team.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.080
 Yeah.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.440
 And we're just like, oh yeah, that sometimes happens.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.840
 But then when you think about it, like, what the hell, like that is crazy that like someone

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.240
 spending millions of dollars and having no impact and we're just like, okay, with this.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.480
 Like, yeah, I was joking the other day where I'm like, people should be like committing suicide

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.480
 when they find this out.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.480
 When they find out that like a small team is doing that, like it should be that.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.360
 It should be really good.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.360
 It's serious.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.360
 It's awesome.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.600
 Like you've never laughed more on the podcast than when you just talked about suicide.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.600
 That was awesome.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.600
 I'm just like, yeah, I'm just picturing like, you know, in Japan where the samurai's like

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.600
 commit something.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.000
 Oh, like, it's like a noble thing.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Okay.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Yeah.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.280
 I'm just like, people should be doing that because I was entered again to brag a little

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.280
 bit.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.680
 So indulge me.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.720
 There's like a set of companies that are considered like SST competitors are in the

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.680
 same zone as us.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:56.560
 And I was looking at their NPM stats from like around the time the SST came out.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:03.080
 They all kind of came out at the same time and completely flat charts for all of them,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.800
 like barely any growth, like insanely small to the point where I'm just like, how are

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.760
 they motivated to like get up in the morning and keep working on this?

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.160
 Like it's just not working.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.160
 Yeah.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.080
 And you look up all these companies and they're like so much big.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.200
 I mean, they're not like huge 200 Pearson companies, but you know, worth three, they might

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200
 be like 10.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.040
 Some of them are like 30.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.240
 They have like full time people doing stuff that I spent like 10% of my time doing and

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.600
 wish I could spend more.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.600
 Yeah.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.400
 And it's just not working at all.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.720
 And like how do people go on every single day?

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.880
 Because I know if I'm looking at their stats, they're looking at ours for sure.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.520
 And aren't they just like, what the fuck?

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:45.600
 Is it possible that not every DevTools company looks at those stats?

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.600
 Impossible.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600
 It seems.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.600
 Impossible.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.600
 Is it possible?

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.520
 Sometimes I'm surprised by humanity, from like, why would anybody ever do that?

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.200
 Why do they have to warn you not to do that?

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.000
 And they're like, well, there's people that would do that.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Right.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.440
 So is there a possibility they're just completely oblivious?

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.240
 And that's not a metric they care about or track or think about it.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.840
 I guess what I'm describing, I am describing people where I'm like, I don't understand

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.840
 how they're operating.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.520
 So it is possible, but like they kind of at least be looking at their own stats, right?

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.680
 Their own stats are just flat, just flat for like, maybe they're looking at their website

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.680
 traffic or something.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.600
 Maybe they're looking at some status, not the right stat.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.360
 Like they're publishing their publishing MPM packages, but they're not looking at MPM

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.360
 downloads.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.360
 That's what I'm talking about.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.360
 I look at MPM downloads.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.360
 Yeah.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.360
 Maybe they, I don't know.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.360
 I guess.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.360
 Okay.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.480
 So because I was thinking like, I've never looked at MPM stats for anything.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.480
 But I guess like, I don't publish MPM packages.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.480
 So that makes sense.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.640
 But if you're a business trying to like distribute MPM packages.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.400
 If you're a business actually publishing an MPM package, you would be aware of the stat.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.640
 So it should be a hundred percent participation in the looking at MPM downloads stat, if you're

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.640
 a dev tools company.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.640
 Sounds like.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.640
 I think so.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.720
 But I guess yeah, because anything is possible, but it's just like, and they're doing all

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.720
 the same things.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.240
 They're like writing these long blog posts where they write these blog posts that are

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.960
 like more detailed than anything I remotely have the attention span to read or write.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:13.400
 Like I've never put that much effort into producing anything like that.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.440
 And like they do that and I put in all that effort and then I look at their chart and

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.480
 it's just like, there's less downloads that week, you know, it's just, how do they go on?

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.520
 So you look at the stats a lot.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.680
 Maybe they're just going on the other end of the barbell and just not looking at them

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.680
 at all.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.320
 They're just like, we're going to work on our business and we're not going to like

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.320
 observe anything about it.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.040
 We're just going to keep pushing stuff out there.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.900
 It's like the people who, yeah, the people who are like, I'm just going to keep making

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:37.900
 content.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.600
 I'm not going to look at the numbers.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.600
 It's like that.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600
 That whole attitude.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.600
 It's like confidence.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.600
 Like, I don't need to see it.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.240
 I mean, the difference is you got to, you know, you need to send your quarterly investor

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.240
 updates.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.760
 So that's a good point away from it so much.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.760
 Yeah.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.760
 Okay.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.080
 So then they all have to be looking at those stats because that would definitely be something

00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:00.280
 that an investor in a DevTools company would be like, wait, all my other in dev tool port

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.080
 codes, send me in there much.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.080
 Don't you have MPM packages?

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.520
 Let's get some numbers.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.520
 Okay.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.760
 So they're all just depressed.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.760
 That's the answer.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.040
 But I don't think they are like, how are, because for me, I like my motive and my hold

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:21.440
 in our whole team is like this, our motivation, our emotions, how we feel, what we feel like

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.760
 working on.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.480
 It's so driven by looking at those things because it's a pulse on whether what we're

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480
 doing is working.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.480
 Yeah.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:34.280
 And I can't imagine like the thing that strikes me is if my chart looked like theirs, I would

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.760
 have started over with a brand new company like five times over now.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.080
 There's no point in continuing when it's that ineffective.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.000
 I don't think this is specific to DevTools.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.760
 I think this is the broader general talking about the zerp thing, the zero interest rate.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.440
 Like I just think there's a, there's been an era of startups where it's like, you're

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.840
 not really concerned with metrics or how things are going.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.840
 It's like we have runway, we have two years of runway, like we raised a bunch of money.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.840
 Who cares?

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.840
 Yeah.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.920
 Like do some founders honestly just not even care if it works out?

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.120
 Is it just like this was a ride?

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.120
 It's like this was fun.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.120
 I think so.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.120
 It feels that way.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.120
 Good time.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.120
 Yeah.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.440
 Raised the money, had a office space in the Bay Area.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.600
 I don't know.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.400
 That's probably, now I'm getting way too specific.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:26.680
 I mean, I was a lot of people like eight years ago, but office space in the Bay Area on Market

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.080
 Street on the fourth floor.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.440
 What are you talking about?

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.440
 Sorry.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.600
 I'm thinking about specific founders here.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:41.200
 No, there was an experience with a very large consumer website, the founders had an office

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.000
 and they had, they told us about their baller water.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.360
 Now it's a, and they're not going to hear this, like that they, they literally had water

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.880
 bottles printed that said baller on them.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.880
 And they were so proud of it that they told us, we just met them.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.160
 We got in a vehicle with them and they're like, yeah, we just got our baller water in,

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.160
 check this out.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.240
 And they're like showing us the photos.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.760
 And that's what I think about most founders in Silicon Valley.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.760
 That's like.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.760
 That's so fun.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.760
 Baller water.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.760
 Yeah.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.760
 Good job guys.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.760
 Because it just raised like $60 million.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.040
 So like they had all this cash and they were a couple of characters.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.040
 Man, I'm white.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.040
 I'm such a white guy.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.080
 A couple of characters.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.800
 They're a couple of characters with their baller.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.800
 They're old.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.280
 I'm not sure if that's a white or an old thing.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.280
 I'm both.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.280
 So it could be either.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.280
 Yeah.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.280
 That's really funny.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.400
 So I saw a tweet a couple of days ago.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.280
 I think it's my suit, Kyle, like the mixed panel founder that he didn't mighty and that

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.680
 was working on this AI image thing.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.680
 Yeah.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.680
 Yeah.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.680
 He was like, good looking guy.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.680
 Can I say that?

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.680
 I don't know.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.680
 Just I can see his little avatar.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.640
 He's got a good photo, good avatar, you know, he's got a nice appearance to him.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.640
 I don't know.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.640
 Like he looks clean.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.640
 Yeah.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.640
 I don't know.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.640
 It's a good.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.640
 He's got a good profile photo.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.480
 I don't think it's so much his face and his appearance is like, good job on that photo.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.280
 Like the right lighting.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.280
 Everything about it.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.880
 It's like, it's really accentuating the good parts of him.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.880
 I feel like.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.880
 Does that make sense?

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.880
 You should be right.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.880
 He's proud of him.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.880
 Yeah.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.680
 It just popped in my head and I just had to say it.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.880
 It's like, that's what I do on the podcast is I'm just going to say it's in my head and

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880
 that was in my head.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.200
 I don't remember exactly what he said or how he phrased it, but it was something along

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:22.400
 the lines of like when you're a founder, the stakes are so high because your dream job

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.280
 is at stake because like for a lot of founders, I think they love their day to day and it's

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:31.920
 like the best job ever, and if the company doesn't work out, they lose that job and I

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.080
 relate to that so much.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.680
 I was like, I love my job so much that if the company doesn't work out, that's going

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.600
 to be like the biggest loss for me that yeah, I can't do the same thing every day anymore.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.440
 So that is like extremely motivating.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.800
 So yeah, I guess you're describing where you're describing also makes sense where I'm like,

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.840
 maybe people don't like, they're not that emotionally attached to it.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.840
 They're just like, kind of see more like a normal job and if it ends, it ends and they

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.520
 move on to the next thing.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:03.680
 Or it was just too easy for long enough, like if you raise $60 million off one meeting and

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.880
 it was pretty easy, maybe you're like, I don't know, if it doesn't work out, I'll just do

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.880
 it again.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.880
 Oh yeah.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.880
 Like how hard is this?

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.880
 This founder thing.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.160
 Piece of cake when there was just money everywhere, I don't know.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.560
 Maybe fundraising just got too easy.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.160
 And so people didn't really realize the opportunity in front of them.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.640
 Like how many, yeah, I want to know now, like how many founders after their startup fails

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.600
 because we know 95% of startups fail or whatever after they fail.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.080
 What is the like breakdown, like the Gantt chart or whatever?

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.080
 That's not a Gantt chart.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.080
 You know what I'm talking about?

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.080
 Like the bars get smaller.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.280
 Yeah, you're talking about the one with a funnel chart.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.280
 Okay.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.600
 But the reason I'm laughing is because that was an orgy chart that was going around.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.600
 What?

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.200
 I honestly didn't see it.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.200
 Like on Twitter or something?

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.160
 Yeah, it's funny that I'm forgetting it was everybody was making jokes about this type

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.120
 of chart now because recently, like this is, I'm topical on accident.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.840
 This woman who's like pretty notable.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.320
 She's like, she's definitely a sex worker, I guess, in that field.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:14.960
 But she like has like this autistic level of like analysis over everything in that world.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.960
 Yeah.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:23.640
 Like had a birthday or a G for herself and she like documented in detail like the process.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.000
 And she like created one of those funnel charts to see what the outcome of people that like

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.840
 applied to be part of it and like where they ended up like all the way.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840
 Yeah.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.840
 Yeah.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.840
 Yeah.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.840
 And like fully details.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.480
 Everyone was like joking about that because it was like really insane.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.480
 But that's.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.480
 Yeah.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.880
 I only see them in like Google search console or whatever.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.360
 But I'm just looking at website analytics, but I'm sure that topical reference.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.560
 Well, no, I'm going to lean into it.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.560
 Yeah.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.560
 That's what I saw.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.440
 I'm bringing it up because I'm on top of trends, but you know what I mean?

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.520
 Like I want to know where do startup founders end up?

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.400
 Where do they go after their startup fails?

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.400
 Do you know?

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.760
 A lot of people were talking about this and this kind of happened where and I think this

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.960
 is like a huge signal who you really are a bunch of people that raised money in the

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:13.560
 last two years or so like right when like on the cusp of before everything became a lot

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.560
 harder.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.560
 Yeah.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.000
 A lot of them returned the money and went back to their jobs in big tech.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Interesting.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.080
 And to me, that's like impossible for me.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.080
 Like I would never do that.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.720
 I would like try a million ideas.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.600
 So there were zero dollars in the bank before I like moved off of it.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.840
 But there were a lot of people that did that.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:36.840
 They like left their PM job at Google, started a company, spent a year as worth a burn, gave

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.720
 the money back and went back to that job.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.440
 So, yeah, I think it was like a random, yeah, I'm just going to go try this for a little

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.440
 bit type of.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.440
 Interesting.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.120
 That was available to a lot of people for a while.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.120
 Yeah.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.120
 I don't know.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.200
 Like if I would have done that, if I didn't have a co-founder that was good at sticking

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:58.760
 with stuff, like I don't think I would return the money.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.840
 I think I would just like keep trying.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.840
 Yeah.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.960
 Like return the money is a crazy point because you're like, you still have the weird conversation.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.960
 It's a weird conversation.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.960
 Option to try more.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.960
 Yeah.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.960
 Yeah.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.960
 Huh.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.960
 Man, I do remember the beginning.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:11.960
 You're just taking me back.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.960
 This probably has nothing to do with it.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:19.480
 Now I remember in like early days after quitting jobs and not having like, it took us a year

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.480
 to fundraise.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.640
 We thought it'd take six months.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.040
 So like we liquidated IRAs.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:28.440
 I mean, we literally were down to like, because we had one employee and we were down to like,

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.120
 I don't know if we can pay him and this is going to feel bad.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.280
 And then we raised our seat.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.440
 So it was a happy ending, but man, there's some stress in the founding thing.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.840
 I guess I never really thought about like my pull to stay in this job.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.040
 But yeah, no, I mean, I, we definitely fought really hard to, to keep the company alive

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.240
 because it was like our baby.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:55.000
 I think it was more of that than it was like, I mean, my job looked pretty similar before.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.360
 It was like, I was on my own anyway.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.000
 I don't know where I'm going with this.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.080
 Just, you're just made me think, you made me think for the first time today.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:05.160
 I've just been taking baths and drinking herbal tea.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:10.560
 The other thing that I read that I think is really interesting advice is so you were talking

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.440
 about how many of these people may have raised a bunch of money and they're like, that was

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.200
 easier and probably just do it again.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.240
 Someone was like, people should operate more like their NBA players where there's a small

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.360
 window where they're going to make a lot of money, but that's going to go away and they

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.120
 have to live a whole lifetime in whatever they built such a good and I'm like, that advice

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.160
 probably would have been really good for a lot of people.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.160
 Yeah.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.160
 Yeah.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.160
 No, that's perfect.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.480
 I think like, I mean, I do stuff with sports, right?

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.360
 Like, I start up a very sports centric.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.640
 So I think about these salaries and salary caps and all the stuff that goes into it and

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.640
 it's hard if you follow sports not to think about like, wow, a lot of these guys like

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.320
 30 and it's like, there's a cliff, especially depending on position and sport you play.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:01.320
 Like, your career is literally 10 years and that's just such a different life.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.120
 But then you think about technology and it's like, I don't know.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.240
 How much longer is our window?

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.240
 Yeah.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.240
 So like, you never know.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.560
 So you might as well operate that way.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.560
 Yeah.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:16.120
 Another funny thought where I was like, you know, I think I'm pretty smart and pretty

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:24.080
 good at my job and I'm wondering if everyone that's better than me is already retired.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.400
 And that's why I never hear from them.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.920
 I feel like if you're like better than me, you're like at the point where you're already

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.880
 like very successful and then you're just like, you made your money and now you're out.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.880
 Yeah.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.880
 And you're out.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.880
 So that's what it feels like on Twitter, doesn't it?

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.880
 Does it kind of feel that way to you?

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:44.920
 Like when I describe it that way, it's like, uh, like we're definitely at a level and there's

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.520
 no one like really above us.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.080
 And then I'm assuming the people above us are just like above it all because they're

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.080
 crazy rich.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.160
 So I, I am not you.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.600
 I don't want, I don't actually have lots of good things to say.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.640
 So I feel like on Twitter, you probably do feel like, why is everyone else an idiot?

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.640
 I don't feel that way.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.640
 Cause I'm also an idiot.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.640
 Uh, on the barbell, you're on one end and I'm on the other.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.640
 We'll just say that.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.640
 No, that's not true.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.640
 You feel like I wasn't an idiot too.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.640
 Don't lie.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.240
 I don't feel like everyone's an idiot, but I guess like post things and you get replies

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.040
 and you're like, why are people so stupid?

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.040
 Okay.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.040
 Yes.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.040
 Sometimes.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.040
 Sure.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.040
 Yeah.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.040
 I felt that.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.040
 Yeah.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.040
 But I would also say that my personality is very like deferred to authority.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.040
 So I always assume there are people above me at all times.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.040
 No, they're two.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.040
 They're keeping things.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.040
 Okay.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.040
 I do too.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.040
 But, but my point is they're not, they're never around in our circle.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.240
 So they just cashed out and they're like, I'm done here.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.640
 There was a, who was the founder?

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.640
 Wow.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.640
 I'm blanking on his name.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.840
 Uh, founded like an analytics thing that got sold to Stripe.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.520
 No, I'm butchering this for profit.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.520
 Well, no.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.680
 Is that a company?

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.040
 There's a founder who was kind of like in our community in the like, well, more like

00:27:54.040 --> 00:28:01.000
 the like startup indie hacking space, probably not really our community, but he's like somebody

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.960
 that you bump into on Twitter and sold this company.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.760
 I want to say it's like Stripe or something like that for like a hundred million.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.760
 And you kind of saw him tweeting still for a little while, like about what he's doing

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.760
 with his money.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.960
 And you kind of got to like live vicariously is like, that's what that kind of exit would

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.840
 be like, like this is the kind of stuff you'd be dealing with and thinking about.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.840
 But then he did taper off.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.320
 I don't feel like I see anything from him anymore.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.320
 I wish I knew the company or the founder name or who it sold to.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.000
 I wish I had any detail here.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.320
 This vaguely sounds familiar to me.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.560
 Does it?

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.260
 I think so, but yeah, it's kind of exactly that.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:38.080
 I just feel like there's no one that's like 10 X better than us.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.080
 That's like in our circle.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.080
 Yeah.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.080
 Like they're retired.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.080
 They're done.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.080
 It was to paddle.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.080
 Fold it to paddle.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.080
 I think it was profit.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.560
 Well, I wish I could remember like the paddle board.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.560
 Like the payments.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.560
 Oh, no.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.560
 Okay.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.560
 What?

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.560
 Okay.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.560
 Oh my God.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.360
 I got to scratch him into you, which is, which I think is awesome.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:02.960
 So in Miami, and maybe in other places, there's a company called Paddle, P-A-D-L.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:08.520
 And they just go around anywhere there's like a beach or any kind of coastline and they'll

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.200
 just drop a bunch of paddle boards there and you can just grab them and use them whenever

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.200
 you want.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.200
 What?

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.200
 And it's just like a subscription that you pay for.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.800
 It's like the scooters kind of same business model, I guess.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.800
 Yeah.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.800
 Yeah.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.800
 But it's like way more fun and like way more useful.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.800
 Under everywhere.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.680
 Like anytime you see, anytime you're like near any water, they're just one of those things

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.680
 I just go out and if you want.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.680
 That's interesting.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.680
 The idea.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:35.600
 It's Patrick Campbell, Patacus on Twitter, sold profit well to paddle HQ.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.640
 There you go.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.640
 Does he tweet still?

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.440
 Is the question April 25?

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.440
 Oh, wait.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.440
 That was a repost.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.680
 I tweeted on March 12th, but that's about the pace.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.680
 Yeah.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.080
 That's like a few weeks ago, like a tweet every few weeks.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.320
 If I sold for a hundred million, that's probably where I'd be at.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.320
 Maybe.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.320
 I'm going to go the other way.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.320
 Oh, really?

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.480
 You're just going to tweet constantly.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.480
 You have nothing else to do.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.480
 Well, why not?

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.480
 Nothing else to do.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:07.240
 And I'll have like infinite, I'll have like no reason to like, you're like, well, maybe

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.240
 I'm wrong.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.240
 You know, you're right now.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.800
 Well, just look at my hundred million.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.800
 Oh, well, how much, yeah, how much?

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.840
 So okay.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.840
 Here's a question for you.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840
 It's not well formed.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.640
 None of my questions will be worth well from today.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:25.120
 How much do you think like you're doing the right things right now?

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.000
 And there is a percentage chance.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:35.120
 It turns into a huge exit or you get unlucky and it doesn't or you make mistakes and it

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.120
 doesn't.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.880
 What do you think the breakdown is of your outcomes?

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.040
 Like, I guess what I'm getting at is if there were five Daxes.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.240
 Oh, God help us all.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.240
 If there were five Daxes, we would all feel so bad about ourselves.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.000
 But if there were five Daxes and they were all doing exactly what you're doing right now,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.240
 would you feel like you made the right call if one of those ended up with a hundred million

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.760
 dollar exit or they just got lucky?

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:02.000
 Like, do you feel like at this point you're doing everything you can you guys as a group

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.360
 and it's really going to come down to luck and not I mean, like as long as you continue

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:12.760
 to not screw up, this is a terrible question or so many qualifiers.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.760
 I don't know.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.120
 I feel like we're most likely not going to succeed.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.800
 And if we at this point, if we do, I don't think it's luck.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:28.000
 I feel like we're, there's like maybe like a lot of historical luck that like got us a

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.040
 point where we even like met each other and started doing this stuff and all things like

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.040
 go into that.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.280
 But like from this point forward, I don't know.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.600
 I feel like if we don't succeed, it's just because idea, it's really just the idea.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.600
 It didn't make sense.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.120
 I think that's it's actually that pure at this point.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.480
 Like I think I need to frame it differently.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:54.080
 So maybe it's just that like with your continued excellence and navigating the right paths

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.920
 and doing the right things and just being good at what you are doing, like the three of you,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.200
 I would guess that with all of that combined, you can ensure some kind of success.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.120
 You're going to make it in some way.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:09.840
 Well, maybe you can't ensure it, but I'd say like I bet I would bet on you guys making

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.520
 it somewhere, but the difference in like a soft landing somewhere because somebody needed

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:19.120
 to scoop you up because it wasn't going to work out financially and like a 500 million

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.720
 dollar exit, that's the part that feels like luck to me.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:27.320
 It's like the numbers, it's all the external forces you can't predict, market timing,

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:31.880
 the people, the strategic people that would end up scooping you up and what's going on

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.880
 for them.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.840
 It just feels like there's so much in terms of the size of the exit that is just like

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.240
 literal luck and you have no control over it.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.240
 Did you agree with that?

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.000
 I would definitely say there's an aspect to that as far as in the past couple of years

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.800
 because you see these big acquisitions where you're just like in hindsight, like did that

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.800
 make any sense?

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:54.320
 Also, by the way, most M&A fails, like most acquisitions like do not, it's not looked

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.320
 at in hindsight.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.560
 It's like this made sense.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.560
 Yep.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.560
 That's also there.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.840
 But I think again, just depends on your company, depends on what you're doing.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:06.120
 I think for us, it actually feels a little bit different.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:14.920
 I feel like we constantly have options to make decisions that would get us a medium

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:22.400
 or like decent thing and it oftentimes feels like we're very explicitly not taking those.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.640
 You know the barbell theory, you've read Talib, you're like, I'm not going in the middle,

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:31.280
 we're going to the big end.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.280
 Yeah.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.000
 I feel like we're all aligned in that we're like, I don't know, we just, we rather go

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.260
 all or nothing type of thing in a lot of cases.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:42.960
 Like if you look at where we are right now, you know, we have thousands of real companies

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:48.360
 using our stuff, we could probably spin up like one of the most successful consulting

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:55.520
 businesses in this space just because we have that pool of people, like service based, like

00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:02.480
 we offer services and like, you know, probably make a, like more money than any of us really

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.480
 would need.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.480
 Yeah.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.080
 And the option is there and it's always there and it continues to be there, it needs to

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.600
 grow and get more and more attractive.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:14.840
 But like, I don't think any of us are like even a little interested in that.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.840
 Not tempted at all.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.840
 Yeah.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.840
 So that's like an explicit decision, right?

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.520
 Like we're like choosing, but it feels like it is a kind of inner control.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.520
 Sorry.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.520
 Here's my actual question.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.400
 This is where it was born out of.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:36.760
 If your company, let's say SSC died or had a, what you'd call a low end outcome versus

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:44.040
 big, made it moment, huge, whether it's an acquisition or just financial, like you guys

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.040
 make so much money.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.640
 It doesn't matter anymore.

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.920
 You have like on the other extreme, amazing outcome.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:54.160
 Do you actually feel like you were smarter that like, would you feel smarter if you had

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.800
 the big outcome, like you actually did the right things?

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.800
 It's funny though.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.440
 Cause like, I would say yes, but not in like, Oh, I did like a hundred right things or like

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.840
 now I've get it every step, right?

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.320
 It just feels like the initial bet we made was right.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.880
 That's kind of, it just feels that binary and that simple.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.520
 It's kind of like trading a stock, right?

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.920
 You like, let's say you buy an option and you're like, okay, I bet that this stock will

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.360
 go up over a thousand dollars in six months.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.360
 Yeah.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.560
 You don't have to do anything in those six months and whether you were right or not

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.000
 as a good binary thing.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 So it kind of feels that way.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.920
 Like if we're right about our model of the world, yeah, we will be successful.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.240
 If we're not successful, just cause we were wrong about it.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:39.760
 And I think, I think what it comes down to is earlier in my career, I wouldn't have said

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.880
 that cause there was like a ton of execution risk, like I could have had the right idea.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.760
 I've had the right idea a bunch of times and I just like executed it poorly.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.760
 Yeah.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.160
 That's usually why it failed.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.400
 But I think we're all at a point now where it's like, that's not why we're going to fail.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.880
 It's not going to be like, we weren't part enough or we did the wrong things, just comes

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.280
 down to like the correctness of the original idea.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.280
 Yeah.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:04.640
 I think the reason I'm asking is I have had some very near miss acquisitions.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:10.560
 And well, one in particular, like I know like it's not a done deal unless it's a done deal.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:15.360
 I know all the tropes about acquisitions and like, well, how do you know you were even

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.360
 really close?

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:21.680
 Like really close to an acquisition that would have been life changing money.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.680
 It's a big tech company.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:29.320
 So it would have been like cool to be a founding engineer that sold his company to X, not X.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.320
 Sorry.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.640
 That was like, like a fake company.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.040
 I'm not saying the name of the company.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:40.240
 So like I definitely had those moment weeks where I just, I thought that was my life now.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:47.120
 Like we just had this huge outcome and things will never be the same.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.380
 And then it fell through like at the final hour.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:55.400
 And then everything has changed since it's like that is not my life.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.880
 I mean, I'm doing okay, but like there was a completely different world in front of me

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.600
 that I thought was where we were headed.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.600
 And then it was taken away.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.080
 And it's like at the end of the day, I don't feel different.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:09.000
 I don't feel like I'm smarter or dumber because that fell through in the way that it fell

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 through.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.920
 And it feels like we got really close.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:18.640
 But in like in my mind, what we've done is worth that because we got so close.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.160
 It just didn't happen for reasons.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:30.200
 And I guess that's where I detach like my abilities and smartness from like the outcomes,

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.200
 I guess.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.200
 Maybe that's just an excuse.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.200
 I don't know.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.200
 Maybe I'm just like coping.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.000
 No, I think the difference, I think the difference here is actually pretty straightforward.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.400
 It's that you were already a product market fit.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.320
 So for me, if you look at the way I describe everything, we're not there.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:48.480
 So for me, my obsession is so whether it's as very simple as binary, like does this make

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.640
 sense or not?

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.680
 You got past the point where you were like, this thing definitely makes sense.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.680
 And it's working.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.040
 And then there I can see how it's like now you're just looking at the range of outcomes

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.680
 and it kind of seems random.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.680
 What happens?

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.680
 Yeah.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.680
 Okay.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.680
 So it was product market fit.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.680
 I'm glad that you brought us back to product market fit after I said I hate when people talk

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.680
 about product market fit.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.920
 And so I said, like you said, it is the thing.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.480
 I don't know why it bothered me is that I think it's just the group of people I've heard

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.480
 talk about it the most.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.480
 No, of course.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.760
 So it's any business term just gets like someone learns it one day and they're like,

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.720
 this is going to make me sound smarter and they just shove it.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.720
 Yeah, exactly.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.720
 Everything.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.720
 Uh huh.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.720
 So that's one aspect.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.720
 The other aspect I think is, and again, I'm just making stuff up and it's totally possible

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.400
 I'll feel different.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:35.480
 It's hard for me not to feel like any acquisition, even a big one.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.160
 Like there's some negative feeling with that for me.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.960
 It feels like a failure in a way.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.960
 Really?

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.960
 Wait.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:48.080
 So like the only real like when you guys keep going for big, what is that big outcome?

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.080
 Like public.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.800
 I want to build something where yeah, like that's that's the goal and I mean, it's not

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.240
 like that's never happened in the dev tool space like there's plenty of examples.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.240
 Yeah.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.720
 So it's like, I don't think about that.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.480
 I think I'm just such a because I'm on a very different end of the product spectrum.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:08.240
 What I think about acquisition is like the ultimate, that's where you end up, but public

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.240
 company is.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.240
 Yeah.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.240
 But then what do you do after that?

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.240
 I don't know.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.240
 Play golf.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.240
 Yeah.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:19.520
 So say I might be a different phase of my life and I might like think differently.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:27.760
 But in this moment, if today we got like an amazing opposition offer and that would make

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:34.880
 me wealthier than ever need to be, I would probably take it, but then a part of me would

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:39.200
 be like, well, it like didn't work out.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.160
 And now I got to go bet on a new thing, which I'm sure I'll be excited and happy to do.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:51.320
 And like we talked about, but like you see how there's like some negative like, yeah,

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:55.000
 aspect to that whole thing, like that your vision didn't materialize.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.440
 I want to have a public company.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.440
 You sold me.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.440
 I feel we're bust.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.240
 This is like, you've really changed something in my brain.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.080
 Like I'm viewing acquisitions differently now.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.440
 Like that's the easy.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.440
 That's the loser's layout.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.440
 Yeah.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.440
 Cause like you like ran out of steam.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:13.520
 So it's, yeah, it's a, and I think it's less about IPO and more about like you have

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:20.240
 a vision for what the ultimate version of everything you're doing could end up at.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.240
 Yeah.

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.440
 And acquisitions end before you hit that.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.440
 Yeah.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.440
 So that's a negative feeling for me.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.240
 Really the dreams that I had are not going to happen.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.000
 I'm not going to find out their rights.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 Interesting.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 I'm not going to like get to do all of that.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.320
 And like, of course, when you get a choir, you get to still work on that stuff, but it's,

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.800
 you know, never the same.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:43.640
 Are there some good examples of like acquisition that was great that went well for the acquire?

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.120
 Is like the classic one.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.120
 That's a good one.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.120
 Yeah.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.480
 But like, I don't even think the Instagram founders are really how involved were they

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.480
 in that process?

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:56.480
 Like, I feel like it was great for Facebook, but I don't know if yeah, I was talking just

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.640
 from that perspective, like for the acquirers perspective, because for, I mean, the founders,

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.720
 it mostly works out.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:07.640
 I mean, sometimes it doesn't, I guess the WhatsApp one's another example where amazing

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.640
 for Facebook.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:13.200
 Crazy, crazy, like massive, like what is it, like 20 billion, 19 billion, something insane.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.800
 Yeah, I was like 17 people on the team or something.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.640
 It wasn't that small, but it was very small for the acquisition size.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.640
 Yeah.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:24.200
 I think it was Instagram, was Instagram was like 12 or 13 or something.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.200
 Yeah.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.200
 Okay.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.200
 Maybe that's what I'm thinking.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.200
 But WhatsApp, which is massive.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.800
 And then the founder literally like left being like, fuck this, left like some crazy amount

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.800
 of money on the table.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.400
 I think it was like six, seven hundred million or something like that.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.400
 Yeah.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:42.520
 And then gave $50 million to signal to be like, here, I'm going to fund you for life.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:47.280
 And you guys just, you know, continue with my vision for what I think communication should

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.280
 be about.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.280
 Yeah.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.280
 Yeah.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.480
 Obviously the money is huge and you can't discount that.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:58.600
 But you see how there's like something in your heart that is missed.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.600
 Yeah.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.600
 Yeah.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:01.600
 Yeah.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.600
 No, I get it.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.280
 I'm still stuck on the outcomes for the companies that could acquire.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.080
 So Facebook, good acquisitions.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.080
 Yeah.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:13.440
 Also Disney, like they bought some IP and their day with Star Wars, Lucas.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.440
 Yeah.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.440
 Marvel.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.440
 That's worked out pretty well for them.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.440
 I think.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.440
 Interesting.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.440
 Yeah.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.440
 Well, I don't know.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.440
 I don't know.

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.440
 I don't know.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.440
 I don't know.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.440
 What did they?

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.440
 Why aren't they acquired?

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.440
 Oh, the Aspen is acquired by Disney.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.440
 Yeah.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.440
 I mean, the ABC, which owned ESPN?

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.440
 I don't know how it happened.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.040
 Does everything just, does Disney know his owner?

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.800
 It's kind of so crazy to me that Disney's not like Disney does own everything.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:39.560
 Every time I find out about how their fingers are in literally everything, I'm like, how

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.280
 are they not like worth 10 times as much as they are?

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.880
 Like, they just control all entertainment, like all entertainment.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.880
 Yeah.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.880
 No, it's true.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.360
 Oh, just like every store, every little gas station in the Ozarks should go in.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.640
 There's like Disney coloring books.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.880
 It's amazing how their merchandise has like.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.880
 Merchandising, yeah.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:01.600
 It's filled every nook and cranny in this country and the world.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.980
 But the ESPN thing is interesting, like, I don't know if you follow any of the sports

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.980
 rights.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:06.980
 I don't know anything about it.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:07.980
 Tell me.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:08.980
 Oh, okay.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:14.240
 Well, like, so sports rights, like TV deals are enormous, right?

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:21.480
 And like these leagues just keep getting to demand higher contracts for live TV rights

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.560
 for their sports stuff.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.800
 So then they start like the NFL start spreading it around.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:29.280
 They like get Amazon to buy one game a week and all these companies been against each

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.280
 other.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.280
 And they've just driven up rates.

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:36.000
 Well, at one point in the peak when ESPN had a hundred million subscribers because of

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.680
 the cable bundle, like everyone had ESPN in America, whether you watch ESPN or not.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:45.280
 And it was like, most channels, I know some weird stuff that I don't know why I know this,

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.280
 why I know why I know.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.400
 But I'm just realizing this is not common knowledge.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.960
 Most channels in the cable bundle, they're getting like 11 cents per subscriber.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:58.440
 And ESPN was getting over $10 a subscriber, it was some insane number.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.240
 So they had this crazy, crazy revenue where they had a hundred billion subscriber base

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.760
 at the peak.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:09.760
 And like basically the cable bundle was subsidizing sports rights deals going to the moon.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:15.440
 And they were spending enormous amounts of money for very long term contracts on deals

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.280
 with the NBA and the NFL.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:22.680
 And now things changed, I don't know exactly today, like where things are at, but there

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.840
 was a period there in the middle where it was like, is Disney gonna have to offload ESPN?

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:31.800
 Like, it's just gonna kill Disney because they're like the big cash cow of Disney.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.200
 They brought in so much money and then they spent so much money.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.600
 And it's like, how are they ever gonna get out of that?

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:42.840
 Like, as the cable bundle fell apart and people had to go to direct to streaming, like it

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:47.000
 takes a while to build that business and ESPN couldn't really work those rights out.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.920
 Like they couldn't do direct streaming.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.720
 Okay, I'm getting into way too detailed synopsis here.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.880
 Why are we talking about ESPN?

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.880
 What happened?

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.880
 I'm sorry.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.880
 Did I just block out?

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.880
 I don't know how we got it.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:58.880
 We were talking about Disney should just be giant.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:00.880
 Yeah.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:01.880
 You were like, ESPN is not doing well for them.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.880
 Yeah, sometimes giant companies, you know, they get into trouble.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.560
 They make one too many moves.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.800
 Yeah, the sports rights thing is crazy.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:13.280
 So like tech companies get the or like buying rights too now, right?

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.280
 Yeah.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.280
 I heard about that.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.280
 Yeah.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.840
 Because they all have infinite money.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:18.840
 Yeah.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:23.080
 I mean, this is a classic thing where it's not exactly this, but have you heard of, I

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:27.480
 don't know butcher the pronunciation, but it's something like bomb balls cost disease.

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.480
 No.

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:36.040
 So there's this thing that can happen where if one industry experiences crazy productivity

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:44.120
 gains, like example, in this case, the tech industry, they force increased costs on completely

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:49.560
 unrelated industries that have maybe don't even have the ability to like, like they have

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.560
 an experience the same gains.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:55.840
 Just think about like a worker when there were so much money to be made in tech, a bunch

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.880
 of workers started to like shift into tech.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.760
 And if you want to now have those same people and you're not in the tech industry, but you

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.440
 need those people, you now have to pay more all of a sudden.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.440
 Yeah.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.440
 Yeah.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.760
 So it can like ruin other industries just because one is doing well and they're like

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:11.760
 completely unrelated otherwise.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.000
 So it's kind of like what's happening here where the tech companies have so much money.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.560
 So now the traditional players have to like meet that bar, but they don't have the same

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.520
 type of business that can deliver that amount of money.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.080
 How does any business compete with Apple?

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:31.280
 If Apple's like, like that, if the NFL deal expires and Apple's like, yeah, we'll just

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:35.440
 pay like double whatever anybody else would pay, like nobody can compete with their cash.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.440
 Yeah.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.080
 Like, and why not just own like all NFL TV?

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.120
 Like, why not just be like, it's Apple now.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.120
 Watch football.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.120
 Enjoy.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.120
 You can only watch on Apple devices.

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.120
 Right.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:52.600
 I mean, it only is in America anyway, since I'm going to hurt the Android crowd internationally.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.000
 Nobody cares about football.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 Not this football.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.800
 I feel like Apple users don't care about football.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.960
 No, they don't.

00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.960
 That's a terrible overlap.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.760
 But I'm just saying like they have so much money.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.760
 It's like, yeah.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.760
 I don't know.

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:03.760
 It's true.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.760
 Yeah.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.760
 How do you compete with your traditional media company?

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.760
 And yeah.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760
 Yeah.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.760
 We'll see what happens.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.680
 I think we're like entering the beginning of an era where we're like going to like understand

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:16.640
 what happens in these cases because I think these companies are now finally looking to

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:21.760
 really expand into places that are like weirdly the seems unrelated.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.200
 Like, of course, they always have like a point of entry into it.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.720
 But like 10 years ago, if you're like, Apple is going to buy like the NFL, right?

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:32.480
 You're just like, what the fuck that makes no sense, but we're at the place where that

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.160
 kind of things aren't to happen now.

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.160
 Yeah.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:40.720
 I mean, Twitter bought some games, Amazon Prime, like Twitter, NFL on Amazon Prime.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:41.720
 Yeah.

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:42.720
 Twitter air.

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.720
 So this is what everyone is complaining about with the.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.320
 No, that was peacock.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.320
 Which makes a little more sense.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.320
 Yeah.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.320
 That's like NBC.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.000
 So it's like a traditional media company.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.720
 But yeah, people were upset because you had to subscribe to peacock to watch this one playoff

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:56.720
 game.

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.720
 That was a huge playoff game.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:02.600
 I mean, the NFL playoffs are, they're all the games are big and they got a ton of subscribers.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:06.840
 And I'm sure those people all cancel their accounts after they watch the game.

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:15.240
 It's such a fascinating thing because this, I feel like this always happens where we were

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:19.440
 all annoyed with cable because we were like, I don't want to, I don't care about these

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.440
 like 90 channels.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:25.240
 I only watch 10 and we're like, just give me like an on demand service.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.560
 And then definitely Netflix came out with like, Oh, cool.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:29.560
 Netflix.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:30.560
 I'm gonna play for Netflix.

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.560
 And I kind of get this.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.560
 And another thing came out.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.560
 And another thing came out.

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.560
 Yeah, they came out.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.560
 We're rebundling.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.560
 We unbundled.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.560
 Now we're bundling it back up.

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:38.560
 It's worse.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.280
 Cause like you're now you're crazy fragmented that the UX experience of it is terrible because

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.280
 you're like juggling multiple apps and like logging at different things.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.920
 And it's like, I wish I had one service that bundled all these different streaming services

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.760
 into one like cable.

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.760
 Yeah.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.760
 I'm bundling, I'm rebundling thing, but this, I feel this always happens where this thing

00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:01.320
 with it's happening with LMS now where like, you know, there's chat JBT and it worked well,

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.360
 but then now there's this other one that like is better in some cases.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.120
 So you're like, maybe I should use that one, but then sometimes it's worse.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.760
 So then you have to switch back to the other one.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:13.600
 So I was just like, yeah, you can always bet on and I'm like obsessed with this concert

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:18.760
 to just like, it crossed my mind where it's like, I think we talked about where I'm like,

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:22.080
 we always imagined the future to be neater, but it's actually usually more chaotic than

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.080
 it is now.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.080
 Yeah.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.080
 Yeah.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.080
 Yeah.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.080
 This thing's always end up more messy.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.080
 Just like kind of entropy.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.080
 Entropy.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.080
 Yeah.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.080
 Entropy.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.080
 Exactly.

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.080
 It's like a law of the universe.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.080
 Yeah.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.080
 It's funny.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.080
 Cause I had that thought, but I didn't know if you knew entropy was.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.080
 So I didn't know.

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:42.680
 Oh, I was I was pretty proud of myself when I came up with that word and it stopped in

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:43.680
 my head.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:48.320
 And I was like, I can see the pride in your face.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.320
 Yeah.

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.320
 Yeah.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.320
 That's so funny that you did these.

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.320
 That word.

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.320
 How many words do you not use?

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.320
 You dumb down.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.320
 Just to talk to me.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.320
 Yeah.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.320
 Yeah.

00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.320
 Yeah.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.320
 Okay.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.320
 It's not just you.

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.320
 I also like do I need to make this metaphor again?

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.320
 Like do I need to say entropy again?

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.320
 Yeah.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.320
 Yeah.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.320
 I'm going to avoid it this time.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.320
 Okay.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.320
 But yeah, it's like it's like guaranteed.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:13.080
 Oh, also speaking that I don't think there's other thing I wanted to talk about where I'm

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:16.400
 constantly seeing these tweets where they're like, I think you're you may be experiencing

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:21.560
 this too, because you're you're using some of these tools, but people are like, wow,

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:28.120
 Claude, Opus, whatever is so much better than chat GPT, like, here's an examples.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.120
 Huh?

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.120
 Oh, no, I'm sorry.

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.560
 I thought you were talking about these aggregator people who are like, here's 10 of the best

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.560
 of them.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.560
 Oh, no.

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.560
 Yeah.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:37.560
 Like, sure is blowing everyone's mind.

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:38.560
 Yeah.

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.560
 There's 10 best examples.

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.560
 Well, that's just like a million of those.

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:41.560
 That's a different thing.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:45.560
 But then people are like, Oh, like I'm just using Claude for everything and they're using

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.560
 the API.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:49.280
 Oh, it's cheaper and like gives you better results.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:55.640
 But this stuff is so noisy right now where when chat GPT came out was good, but they're

00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:01.840
 clearly like messing with the cost to them performance spectrum and they've like made

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:02.840
 it worse.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.100
 Claude just came out.

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.360
 So they're like trying to show off how good they are.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:09.120
 There's no guarantee that they're not going to like make it worse over time.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.120
 Yeah.

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.360
 The price we're paying for these things are totally made up like we don't have their subject

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.360
 guys.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.660
 We don't know like what the rationale for it is.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.680
 So it's impossible to tell right now.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:20.960
 Like, if I'm going to build the business that uses feature, it's like there's like no

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.400
 stability like is a feature going to get worse over time is going to get 10x more expensive

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.400
 over time.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.400
 Is that break?

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.400
 Yeah.

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.400
 Use of it.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:29.400
 It's just so hard to tell.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.400
 Yeah.

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.400
 It's so hard to evaluate.

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.400
 Are the outputs actually good?

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.400
 Yeah.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:37.800
 Because you can like spot check, you can just do like arbitrary tests, but like across the

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:41.800
 whole point of these things is to take like very general input and then do something very

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.360
 specific with that.

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:46.200
 So like you can't test all the inputs.

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:51.080
 So like most people who say, Oh, this model is better than that model at this type of

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.080
 thing.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.080
 You haven't tested that much.

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.080
 You don't know.

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.080
 Yeah.

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.920
 Like there's very little actual data around, I mean, there's these benchmarks and that's

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.080
 I think interesting to talk about.

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:04.360
 But they're like the public versions of the model, they're like tweaking the hardware

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.360
 behind it.

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.360
 Oh, right.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.360
 Yeah.

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.840
 So then it's like, it's good this week, but then two weeks from now it could be worse.

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:10.840
 Like, I don't know.

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.840
 Yeah.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:12.840
 Yeah.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:13.840
 That's very interesting.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:14.840
 It does.

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.760
 It does make me wonder for AWS because they are usually very precise with their pricing

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.240
 where they're like, this is what it costs.

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.240
 Yeah.

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.240
 I don't remember them ever raising prices.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.600
 They usually bring prices down.

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.600
 Yep.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.680
 But with something so undefined like this, like whatever they're charging for bedrock,

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.560
 like, can you rely on that?

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.080
 Because they historically, and they know they won't have to raise.

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.080
 Yeah.

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:41.840
 It seems really difficult and like this crazy flurry of trying to get these products out.

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:42.840
 Yeah.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.600
 Like the, the cloud models, the entoropic stuff, is that not open source?

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.600
 No.

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:52.480
 I thought they were like, so bedrock can have like proprietary models too.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.480
 I thought they just.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.480
 They have a deal with the entoropic.

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.480
 Yeah.

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.480
 So why don't they have open AI stuff?

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.040
 They just haven't done a deal.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.320
 Azure has that deal.

00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.320
 Oh, okay.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.760
 I think it's a good set up for these companies.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:09.080
 It's like just work on making the models and then Amazon work on distributed and agile

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.400
 work on distributing them.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.880
 So is that the only way cloud is distributed?

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:13.880
 How do people use cloud?

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:21.480
 And they have a direct API, but obviously it's better when it's embedded in a cloud provider.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.480
 Yeah.

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.560
 And I'm like, yeah, just don't even have a direct API, I think.

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.560
 Okay.

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.400
 It's for ease of use and stuff, but yeah.

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.840
 There's some, some nerds on Twitter that won't be able to use your thing anymore.

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.400
 But who cares?

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:34.400
 Yeah.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:42.360
 Yeah, it's like I see, I saw a post where someone was like, I switched from open AI

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:47.320
 to chat JBT and my cost went down 30% and I'm like, yeah, how long is that going to last?

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:48.320
 I don't know.

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:49.320
 Yeah.

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.320
 Yeah.

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.400
 I mean, these things tend to be very easily swappable.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:59.280
 So it's not a big deal, but yeah, I'm having a tough time like modeling any kind of cost

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.880
 or anything with it.

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:01.880
 It's difficult.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:02.880
 Yeah.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:03.880
 It's a big black box right now.

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:09.720
 But there's a lot of growing optimism around this big black box taking us to the promised

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:10.720
 land.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.960
 I don't know about the robot.

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.520
 So every time somebody shows me these videos of a robot, like running around in the jungle,

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.840
 let's stop making so many robots because this is how they're going to get us.

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:22.760
 If we're worried about AI safety, maybe stop, cool it on the robots.

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:28.560
 Like let's figure out the, the software part first and then then let's give it a body.

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.120
 But there's so many of them now.

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.840
 People are all really trying to get the robots out there.

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:33.840
 See how this ends.

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:37.920
 It's wild to me how difficult the robotics stuff is because I feel like we've been seeing

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.000
 robotics demos for like as long as I can remember.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:50.040
 And they definitely get better, but I'm like, they still like can't do shit, you know.

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.040
 Yeah.

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.040
 Yeah.

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:55.340
 And it's like, damn, this is a very hard problem.

00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:59.280
 And I think they're adding in the AI stuff now, which makes it like quote unquote, like

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.000
 learn and understand things in a dynamic way.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.480
 But that's not what I'm talking about.

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:09.040
 I'm actually talking about like it's physical capabilities and how it moves in the fluidity

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.040
 of the movement.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:17.480
 It's just like, wow, they suck still compared to like muscles and bones turns out are pretty

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:22.760
 good at moving around in space and joints, like, yeah, yeah, it's a hard thing.

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:26.040
 It's a hard thing to mimic with metal and silicon and whatever else.

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.680
 I think realistically, we're probably just going to have clones that we enslaved.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.680
 What?

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.940
 How do we get here?

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.240
 Well, if you can't get there with metals, if you can't get there with metal, like the

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.240
 only option.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.240
 You think we're going to clump.

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.240
 Wait.

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.240
 Hey, I want me to do this.

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.960
 You think, okay, I was just kidding, but you know, definitely like a sci fi concept that

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:44.960
 comes up.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.200
 Well, yeah, I need to understand what is the concept like we would, you would clone yourself

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:52.800
 and that becomes a baby that 31 years from now will be like you.

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:53.960
 What are you doing with that clump?

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:57.480
 I'm taking its organs for myself with 30 years from now.

00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.960
 Oh, I see.

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:03.520
 It's going to be a little bit young or that's creepy.

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.920
 That's like a sci fi thing.

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:09.280
 I feel like this is a sci fi concept that comes up all the time.

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.280
 Interesting.

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.680
 I don't think I've seen any movies like that.

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.560
 By the way, don't watch outlaws.

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.760
 What the hell is outlaws?

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:21.280
 It's like it's like on Netflix, it's a happy Madison movie.

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.160
 Why do people like Adam Sandler movies?

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.760
 His sense of humor is so stupid.

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.760
 Yeah, I know.

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.280
 It's just like so over the top and like, I don't know.

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:32.240
 I always thought I liked I'm saying there, but you watch a movie and you're like, yeah,

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.080
 this is totally what Adam Sandler would think is funny, but it's not funny.

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.560
 No, but he's got a weird spectrum of stuff.

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:41.240
 So I think he has like really stupid stuff.

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:43.360
 He has slightly stupid stuff.

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:46.960
 He has stuff that's like really weird and really good.

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:47.960
 What was that?

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:48.960
 A 24 movie?

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.960
 So there was a serious movie he did wasn't there?

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.360
 There's a bunch of good movies.

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.360
 Oh, really?

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.360
 Yeah.

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.360
 Yeah.

00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:00.080
 But I think his older comedies are good, like, it might be nostalgia, but like happy deal

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.320
 more and like all this stuff that happened.

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.960
 But they're so over the top and this one is like a modern movie.

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:11.200
 And when you see the overtop this in a bothered comedy, I'm so dasily.

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.200
 It just was too much.

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.200
 It was just stupid.

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:15.400
 My wife and I just looked at each other for an hour and a half.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.000
 Like, what are we watching?

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 Why do we do this?

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 Okay.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.040
 There was a movie called Uncut Gems.

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.040
 Have you seen it?

00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.040
 No.

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.040
 Okay.

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.040
 Adam Sandler is a main character.

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:30.000
 And this is like one of the most stressful movies you will ever watch in your whole life

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.760
 because he's this guy that owns a jewelry store or something like that, a really weird

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.760
 character.

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:43.060
 And he's a degenerate gambler and the whole movie is a fast paced thing of him like getting

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:47.120
 into these scenarios where he's literally going to die because he's like gambled too

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:52.320
 much and someone's going to kill him, like, eking out a way to like gamble again and like

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:56.960
 getting back to even then doing it again, just over and over and over and over and over

00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:02.040
 and just like it's like this like crazy like buildup of just stress and how the hell can

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:03.040
 people live like this?

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:06.360
 Oh, I do not want to be stressed when I'm watching a movie.

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.360
 It was a good movie.

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.360
 You should watch it.

00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.360
 I just don't.

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.360
 I want to.

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.060
 I want to just enjoy myself.

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:17.880
 I like being like, I think I do like movies that make me like, uh, confused like I think

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:22.520
 I like the ones, I think I like the ones where at the end, I'm like, I don't even know what

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:23.520
 just happened.

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:26.880
 Cause I seem to be drawn to them like inception movies that you feel like you'd have to watch

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:27.880
 a lot.

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:32.880
 Well, you watch sinker Taylor soldiers by you said and that is yeah, it was a lot of

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.880
 that.

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.480
 I don't know what happened, but I like how I'm feeling right now.

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:41.240
 It's in the heart, not the head.

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:47.360
 All right, I've got to blow my nose so bad, but I can't talk on a mic any longer today.

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.360
 This is, I feel awful.

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:54.640
 I've got so many different weird things going on, uh, so I keep thinking the thing I'm doing

00:58:54.640 --> 00:59:00.400
 next is like next week, but it's actually yeah, yeah, yeah, but I'm coming to Miami.

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.400
 I can't wait.

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.400
 It's going to be so fun.

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.400
 You did right.

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.400
 I booked my flight.

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:08.560
 Uh, I don't have a hotel for the extracurricular activities yet.

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:13.040
 I probably will get one because I don't know, sounds like a lot, but I just feel like I'm

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.840
 going to miss out on like the camping experience.

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:15.840
 Like the fun.

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:20.400
 No, no, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll all just hang out together and then I'll just go to

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.400
 sleep.

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:22.400
 Yeah.

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.400
 I'll go back to my hotel.

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:24.400
 Okay.

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.400
 Yeah.

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.800
 There's going to be some people sleeping at Dax's house.

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:32.680
 And I kind of want to like, I don't know, rose marshmallows and like tell spooky stories,

00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:39.520
 but I feel like it's funny because I feel like everyone is adult AF.

00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.600
 So we're just, it's just going to want to go to sleep at 11.

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.600
 Yeah.

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.600
 It's probably even earlier.

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.840
 You got to stay until 11.

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:46.840
 Okay.

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:47.840
 I'm getting out.

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:48.840
 For sure.

00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:54.080
 So you guys are talking about going to bed by 11, no, I'll send you some places by me.

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.600
 It'll be like a 10 minute walk.

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.600
 Yeah.

00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.600
 I think I get a different.

00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.600
 Yeah.

00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.600
 Yeah.

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.600
 Yeah.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.600
 Just like somewhere really close.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.600
 And then react Miami.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.600
 Good times.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.600
 Everybody's coming to Miami.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.600
 It's going to be fun.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.600
 Yeah.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.000
 We started planning our party or like lists are planning because she's very good at that

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
 stuff.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.680
 It's going to be a huge list of things that we need to do.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.680
 But it's going to be fun.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.400
 We're going to try to figure out like we might have a good food truck or something similar.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.400
 Oh, cool.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.400
 Yeah.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:24.240
 Look, you guys have some special decorations like balloons.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.240
 Sorry.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.760
 I don't know what decorations we're going to make it feel like over the top here in Miami,

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.760
 Florida.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:30.760
 Love it.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:31.760
 Yeah.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.760
 All right.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:33.760
 I'm going to go home and ask.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.760
 Okay.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.760
 It's probably be if there's blood.

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.760
 Go to the hospital.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.760
 Ew.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.760
 No.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.760
 Wait, really?

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.760
 There's more blood.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:41.760
 No, no, no.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.760
 Mine knows we'll have time.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.760
 Okay.

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.760
 When I think too hard.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.760
 See it.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.760
 See it.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:47.760
 See you next week.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:47.760
 Yeah.
