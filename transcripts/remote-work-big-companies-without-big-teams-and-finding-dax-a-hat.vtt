WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
 you said the rest of us so we're just we got the fake jobs i guess i mean it's a spectrum i think

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.760
 i think my job is like 50 percent real with the percent fake podcasters exactly the part of my

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.920
 job where i'm on twitter and making a podcast fake

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:40.480
 what do you what's in your ear yeah i was gonna say i'm so i switched up the setup a little bit

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:49.120
 uh oh i got these cheap ear buds i guess they're called so for i mean people listening they can't

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.360
 see what's in my ear just they look like airpods except they're black looks like a black air pod yeah

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:04.640
 yeah uh they're only 50 they're only 50 bucks and the thing with them is they come with a dongle for

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.200
 like rf mode so they don't go over bluetooth they go over like just the other thing i don't really

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.280
 know the differences but i was gonna say same more words what's what's the problem with bluetooth

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.720
 it's what's the advantage of rf okay so this might be all a perception base but for me i find

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.920
 bluetooth to be kind of flaky because i feel like it's optimized for different things i think i

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.960
 think bluetooth is optimized for like low power because usually you're connecting a power device

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.560
 a battery power device to another battery power device or you want that to be as low power as

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.400
 possible um but like gaming headphones like wireless gaming headphones don't use bluetooth they just

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.560
 use they just call rf it's like the same 2.4 frequency that like your wifi or like cordless phones in

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.000
 your house would use uh-huh and it's way less flaky i can walk pretty far away from my computer

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.240
 yeah and so i specifically was looking for headphones that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.400
 or earbuds that did that i figure i'm going to use these when i'm recording

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.600
 or when i'm on a video call because the audio audio quality for me doesn't really matter and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.000
 it's kind of nice for them putting on like my big headphones well yeah what have you considered

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.640
 a wired pair of headphones no i do have a wired pair of phones right here oh okay why don't you

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.160
 yeah what's wrong with those you just don't like wearing them on your head yes exactly i don't

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.720
 like wearing them on it's actually a combination of a steady comfort these headphones are actually

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.480
 incredibly comfortable especially compared to my old wireless ones which were heavy and like they

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.600
 literally can be headaches because i wear them all day but there's something that happens when you

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.520
 shave your head and you put headphones on where it just doesn't look right it looks like you're

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.800
 wearing like a headband and like really it just like accentuates the curve of your head uh i don't

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.520
 know but just me but like like when i put this on i want to see because i've never thought this about

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.800
 you with headphones on to me this just looks worse like you're saying like it outlines your your

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.000
 head yeah like it shows your your the band gets lost in your hair and you just see it on the side

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.880
 and i think that looks totally normal but then for me like the band is super clear and i don't know

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.800
 i've always hated it especially because we're doing these little clips oh yeah yeah the clips

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.920
 which i haven't made more of i mean it's unique so yeah i'm like i gotta i gotta find a look that

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.480
 works for me so i'm okay with the hat and the headphones but i'm currently in between hats

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.280
 oh between hats could you explain that i have so many questions like you had a hat but you're

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.760
 looking for a new hat i'm very particular about my hats but i don't really understand what

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.480
 what it is that i like so i'll just try on like various hats like baseball caps i guess yeah

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.920
 technically we are and i won't like most of them but i like some of them and there was one that i

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.840
 really like it's amazing how differently they can fit sorry yeah like it's like how they sit on top

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.440
 of your head how long the brim is like the curvature all of that so there's one patagonia hat that i

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.720
 liked and just got just got like way too dirty uh yeah they do they get like the build gets all

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.520
 greasy from your hand picking it up off your head yeah yeah and with pets like they get like

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.720
 hair stuck on it and stuff so i just got to a stand if i can't wear it anymore so i'm i've been in

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.280
 between hats for a while now so you need a new hat okay well there's a challenge for the listeners

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.440
 send daks a good hat or i don't know recommend some hats for mail him one not just like send him

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.080
 links mail him a good hat have you put your address out there daks do we know how to get a hold of you

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.000
 maybe we need a fan mail box no oh yeah a p o box yeah i mean i'm sure lots of companies out there

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.760
 have hats with their logos on them that's another thing i don't like i don't like stuff on the hat

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.640
 especially except for patagonia i did wear the database hat a little bit because uh that one

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.160
 actually looked pretty good and extremely exclusive it was hard to get it was limited edition

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.400
 and uh i'm a sucker for those kind of things yeah i thought it looked good uh it gave me it actually

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.520
 like hurt my head a little like when i would take it off i was gaining these like burns kind of like

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.160
 around my head i think you can maybe even there was like a there was a go ring that was developing

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.480
 around the top of my head and uh it's gone now but it's a little feedback for the plant scale folks

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.200
 i guess you hat may cause burns i am getting one of the plant scale jackets now i have a jacket

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.760
 no okay so i love what they do because i think all companies should do this don't focus on your

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.160
 logo just find really good quality thing find a really good quality jacket and maybe put like a

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.040
 little color that's like your color that's somewhere and so plant scale has this bomber jacket which

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.680
 looks really cool i've always loved bomber jackets and it just has like a little bit of an orange

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.720
 tint inside one of the pockets and like a little tiny logo somewhere else uh but it's just mostly

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.360
 a really nice jacket and what how are you you just like send a message to sam and you're like hey

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.560
 sorry about that butt text that one time but could uh could i grab one of the jackets i think it's a

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.640
 reward for how much i i show plant scale my threads on how i hate post gross connection management

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.560
 oh okay so can't trust my opinions because i'm just out here doing it for a jacket so they pushed

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.240
 they pushed this jacket to you they they reached out to you like hey we'd like to send you a jacket

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.320
 for being so kind the plant scale well he posted uh sam posted the picture of jacket and when they

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.920
 were he was like if you do something really crazy we'll send you one of these and i was

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.000
 replied being like this is awesome i said something like that and then he did me being like some

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 year dress sorry i know it's it's really awkward to like describe something that happened like an

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.840
 online interaction i couldn't start saying that loud i was just going like this is stupid that's

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:36.080
 like 60% of our podcast so it really is yeah okay sorry everyone that listens this is stupid i want

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.960
 to talk about remote i saw your tweet that was a long tweet by the way yeah trying to mix it up i was

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.000
 like if i write something really long well people still read it and it seems like they did let's

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.440
 say broke it up into like little i still did that thing where like each section was broken up so they

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:58.240
 felt like white size but i felt like i was reading a blog again remember blogs yeah those are fun

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.720
 maybe i'll start doing more of this because like it wasn't it felt good to be able to write without

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.240
 thinking too hard about the constraining it to a small thing and people still read it so that's a

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.800
 good sign yeah it was a little it was like a little brain dump you just like told a story you laid it

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.720
 all out there all your frustrations could you talk about your frustrations with people being like

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.880
 i can't believe people want me to come back to the office yeah so i i've been kind of i've been

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.960
 seeing this discussion around like it's called that they're calling it RTO i always laugh because of

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.480
 these like corporate acronyms it just come out of nowhere and just becomes things that people are

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:39.280
 constantly saying RTO return to office so everyone's complaining about RTO because they work with

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.480
 these big companies where they went remotes during covid and then now the companies are like

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.560
 time for RTO and that might look like two days a week or three days a week or full time it just

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.880
 varies yeah and i and i prefaced what i wrote with this i was like i'm just kind of like salty about

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:59.040
 this whole situation because you hate remote workers stupid remote workers sorry just like the

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.400
 people complaining it just feels extremely entitled to me and the reason is as someone that's worked

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.200
 remote for most of my career same i remember how painful it was to try to work remote

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.120
 uh like pre covid and like this a year before then it was like a lifestyle they had to really

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.480
 like commit yourself to because it meant 98% of companies were not going to hire you so now you

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.520
 have a much smaller pool yeah so it took like a little bit of dedication to say like i really care

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.920
 about this way of working i believe in it it makes sense for me it's something i want from my life

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.720
 uh and you have to like kind of really hustle like you so in the in the post i was talking

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.040
 about how and someone a bunch of people replied saying they have to do the same thing where

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.760
 when i interviewed and i was mostly consultant so interview meant like kind of initial consulting

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.320
 type of calls yep i would have to like really sell myself and get a really really great interaction

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.240
 and then kind of lay in that hey by the way i want to work remote so it was like it was like a

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.600
 hard mode you have to like really have people excited to work with you to like accept this because

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.000
 most companies were not remote they never really had a remote employee most of people were in the

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.200
 office it was definitely a special exception and i had to like not go after them sometimes i had to

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.160
 like the most lucrative offers no requirement to come and see office so i had to sacrifice

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.640
 those vice versa etc so it was like this commitment that i had to do and i was fine doing that like

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.520
 that's what i committed to and i was fine with accept accept all that the part that has me salty

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:31.520
 though is during that phase where i was trying to work remote i honestly felt like a lot of people

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:37.280
 looked at what i was doing and they liked it but didn't want to put in the effort like they didn't

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.840
 feel like it was worth it to put in the effort to to have that yeah uh which is fine like you know

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.480
 yeah it makes their own like trade-offs and what they want to focus energy on but it really felt

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.560
 like people would just kind of get in the way for no reason uh a lot of people would just write about

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.360
 how remote work could never work and like whenever i try to talk about it like i would just talk

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.440
 about what i wanted to do like i want to work remote people would react to me as though i was

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.880
 saying you have to work remote everyone has to work remote yeah they would kind of make up all

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.480
 his arguments around how like no good team could ever collaborate without being in the office and

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.920
 kind of swung to this extreme where to me it really felt like it was just stemming from the

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:20.000
 fact that no i think you all want to work remote and you just don't want to accept what that takes

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.800
 at least back then uh so everyone's rationalizing it as like oh i don't want it anyway or it wouldn't

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.680
 be a good thing anyway uh and i was like whatever okay but you know what i mean because i just made

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.800
 stuff harder like i just wanted to work remote just you can do whatever you want i don't care just let

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.680
 me let me do what i want to do and not stop stop making up situations where like stop making up stories

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.640
 about how like it's bad for me or like it's bad for the world then covid happened and suddenly

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.560
 everyone could just work remote without all that pain they could just kind of do whatever they want

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:52.240
 most companies you know we're higher still hiring remote workers at least in our field

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.360
 and now everyone got to work remote and these same people that were like saying how all this stuff

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:03.600
 was impossible or bad or hard we're now working remote loved it because you know guess what they

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.600
 always wanted to work remote they were just kind of lines themselves and now they're like in this

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.360
 they're doing the exact same thing in the reverse direction they're now super extreme they're like

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:20.240
 anyone that says anything that's even remotely remotely anti-remote uh they had this crazy reaction

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.400
 to um like any step away from remote work they it's like it's just it just gone to another place

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.400
 where again it's something from the same thing yeah they're insecure that they might have to work

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.840
 in person that means they have to like do something painful like quit their job like try to find

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.080
 a new job that lets them work remote but again instead of like being like i'm committed to this

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.280
 i'm going to make that's make that sacrifice and do that it just shows up as a bunch of complaining

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.160
 of like people are making us go into remote because the executives are invested in commercial real

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.040
 estate and they're just trying to prop up the commercial it's just like all this they're like

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.280
 thinking about all these like conspiracies and like managers are useless and they're they just

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.680
 want us in the office so they can like stroke their own ego it's just like it's going to this

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:08.640
 weird place of uh i like remote work uh i get while all these companies are calling for RTO because

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.720
 most companies are not structured to work well remotely ever with a lot of remote companies

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.400
 the minority of them worked well yeah so i totally get it and it's just like yet again we're doing

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.200
 the same thing except in the opposite direction yeah is it just is it just come down to like

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:30.240
 when the majority of people believe something there's so many more people that are going to be

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.920
 vocal you have a much bigger pool of idiots and so or you have a much bigger pool of people to

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.480
 find the idiots that are going to get really loud about the things that don't really matter like

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:46.800
 when remote was niche there weren't that many people yeah to be annoying and now that there's

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.840
 a lot more of it there's just more annoying people is that basically what's happening here yeah and

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.240
 i think the the size of the groups also correlates with the other thing which is what i think is

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.560
 actually happening i think it's easy to have a belief when you don't have to pay any price for

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.280
 it uh it's easy for me to say i believe in this thing because it's just the default or it's like

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.480
 not very hard yeah when someone says i believe in something and it's contrarian at the time and

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.200
 it's difficult you like really know they believe in it because they're paying some price with it so yeah

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.120
 yeah back then with the people that wanted to work remote uh it was very hard because every

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.600
 point in the world was suddenly was wrong this is actually why i initially was a big fan of dhh

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.440
 because he was one of the people that was really like championing this and like kind of getting

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.640
 the message that's gonna work was there a moment okay yeah yeah it's a book that i sent out so many

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.640
 people to like get them to wrap their head around how it is possible and it can't work and we have

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.200
 examples of it working really well yeah so i can like believe people when it's a contrarian view

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.760
 because i know they're paying some prime price for it yeah now it's kind of like that is the default

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:51.440
 and it is a mainstream when you're like so pro-it it like it seems hollow everybody wants to work

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:58.640
 remote yeah it's hollow exactly yeah i've always been a big proponent of being able to do remote

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.120
 work i've i mean i've lived in the Ozarks and i just had to like there were no job opportunities

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.400
 for what i wanted to do uh so it kind of forced it there were probably periods of my career where i

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:15.040
 felt like everything should be remote why not i think i've i've like matured in that stance at this

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.840
 stage like i don't think we'd have iPhones if apple were a fully remote company and like everyone

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.160
 just worked from home like there are certain things and and certain companies that it just doesn't

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.960
 make sense but i i do appreciate that i've been able to find those opportunities and i think i had to

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:35.360
 work for it over my 10 15 years yeah no definitely like anyone that's not in like you you made the

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.640
 choice of you're not going to move to one of these tech hubs like you cared about other things more

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.800
 you have to like pay the price of still finding a way to make all that work i think for me i was

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.360
 actually always i worked remotely but mostly for companies in my city so even though i was in

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.040
 because i was in New York for most of my career all the companies i worked for most for for the

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.880
 most part were in New York so i always had the option of just dropping by and i would like maybe

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.800
 like once a week or once every two weeks i would yeah and there were some things i observed

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:08.160
 by doing that that were kind of shocking to me you know there were companies where i would

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.920
 interact with people mostly digitally and there were people that would find annoying

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:18.400
 i'd find them annoying and i'd be like this person like i just have like a mostly negative

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:24.960
 feeling around certain people the moment i saw them in person it like clicked into my head that

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.520
 oh i was seeing this weird like two dimension little version of them and the moment i saw them in

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.960
 person all of those feelings just melted away yeah uh and i think for certain people like certain

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.120
 traits were exaggerated when they're digital and you kind of get the skewed version of them and like

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.080
 i have had that experience for sure yeah it's really weird so there definitely is something

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:50.080
 so i like i see the point of it and if i could like i was saying in the thread like if i could

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:56.080
 like dream up any any scenario i live in a very walkable part of Miami um i would love to have

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:01.200
 an office in the downtown which is like a ten-minute walk for me i'd love if most of my co-workers

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.800
 live in the same city and i have a couple times a week we could just go in there and hang out yeah

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.280
 and yeah whether we're doing focus work or just hanging out whatever that's like my absolute

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.160
 dream like if i could make anything happen that's what i would i would do so i my dream isn't just

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.520
 the hundred percent remote yeah it's like some balance of the two so if anyone like everyone

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.400
 wants to tell them things about it i think that's actually what most people would like yeah we're

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:29.920
 at a point now where it's like uh no we want to be hundred percent remote no matter what like going

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:36.320
 to the office means like your company is screwing you or something yeah early in my career one of my

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:42.880
 first like full-time roles as a consultant uh was with a company that had they had like three or

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:48.640
 four engineers in an office it was in salt lake uh and then there's probably three or four maybe

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.760
 five or six of us that were remote so it's kind of a split team from the beginning and they would

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.520
 have us come out like once a year and work for a week in the office all of us and i can remember

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.080
 i mean i i started my career as remote so like all of my software engineering experience

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:10.000
 was from home working with people and doing whatever i don't zoom it wasn't zoom back then

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.360
 log me in or something i don't know what we did i don't even remember yeah uh but doing like

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.800
 video calls and collaborating that way that was all my experience so then i can remember

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.680
 going into the office for the first time and then every year after it was just this kind of like

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.320
 bizarre feeling of hey i could just go ask them but then you just get really like chatty and you

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:36.000
 annoy people because you can exactly exactly it's funny because uh when i when i would work remotely

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.800
 it would be like because most people would be in the office and i would be the one that was working

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:44.400
 around uh the days where it comes to the office they would send me home they would be like yes

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:52.160
 like you're just distracting everyone or just go home uh because for me like i do work at my desk

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.720
 and when i'm in person i'm there to like hang out and kind of connect with people so like why

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.080
 sit and they'd have me in the somewhere room and it's like i could just sit in here the whole time

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.720
 but like why did i come out here yeah i guess for like dinners afterward but no i was gonna like

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.280
 walk across the office and ask everybody a question if i had a question i'm not going to type it out

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.200
 yeah you're in the building here you're here i come yeah okay and here's the other part that's

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:21.200
 maybe a little spicier that i didn't include in the tweet oh i think for truly remote companies to

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.520
 work out you need people that are extremely motivated and it's not just that like i'm drawing

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.680
 motivation from within it's like you're in an environment where you're excited about the people

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.520
 you're around you're excited about what you're doing and you feel pretty motivated to work day-to-day

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.320
 uh because the reality is when someone is not watching you and you're not very motivated

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:44.640
 let's not kid ourselves like everyone milks it like that just is the fact yeah and most companies

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.360
 by definition aren't places that pull a lot of motivation out of people so a lot of these companies

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:56.960
 when they went remote i'm really skeptical that a large portion of the employees were really more

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.480
 productive i'm more productive when i'm remote for the most part because i just can't focus in an

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.200
 office yeah um but if you put me at a company what i don't really care about i'm i'm a hundred

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:11.040
 percent less productive at home yeah oh sure so i understand why like this rto thing is happening

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.920
 because yeah like you do need to have certain things in place like that motivation and these

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.520
 companies didn't have to have that because there's having one of the office before yeah what what

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.560
 are the big measures like nationally or globally of productivity don't they do like i've heard

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:32.000
 anecdotes like oh u.s productivity dips by 15 percent during march madness or whatever i've heard

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.440
 that kind of stuff how do they measure it and i bet it's fake i have no idea and yes it seems like

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.320
 a stupid probably a stupid measurement that isn't really me anything yeah yeah i wonder how much

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.280
 actual yeah interesting i have all kinds of thoughts now like i mean maybe i'm getting into the

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.920
 the people you don't like when i say things like this but like the is most work fake

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:58.640
 like are most people not really doing productive things are not like with their days but just like

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.520
 roles are there a lot of fake roles a lot of fake jobs yeah i actually do really believe in this

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.400
 as well okay there was an entire book about this remember it came out probably during covid

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:14.800
 it was like fake jobs i forgot what it was called and that would be a nice title yeah

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.360
 because when you were saying like measure productivity i was like how would i do that i think i would

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:25.040
 just measure as revenue per employee yeah and is that gdp it may be gdp is the way people measure

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:32.880
 gdp per capita yeah but yeah that's like way too average doubt around like yeah that's like your

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:38.480
 whole country like everything your country is doing uh-huh but on an individual level like

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.880
 yeah some companies make the same amount as other companies with like a fraction of employees

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.800
 right so by definition they're more productive they like found something higher leverage to

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.440
 to work on yeah yeah so that that's i mean that's how i've always thought about it yeah i mean what

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:58.800
 does that mean like does it is it just we're all pretending is it does like our whole economy

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:04.880
 depend on this charade that like everyone has real jobs and we're all helping move things forward

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:10.400
 yeah i mean it's it's it's hard to admit but i think it's kind of how it's always worked there's

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.720
 like a small fraction of people that push us forward and and the rest of us who just get to kind of

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.800
 like hang on to it you said the rest of us so we're just we got the fake jobs i guess i mean it's a

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:34.720
 spectrum i think i think my job's like fifty percent real with the percent fake podcasters yeah exactly the part of my job we're on twitter and making a podcast fake yeah yeah but the rest of it maybe maybe a little real yeah okay that makes

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:47.840
 sense this is what we do for fun this is our hobby and then the other stuff we do is super productive sometimes i think about it like yeah i'm just making i work on just a thing to help people write some

00:21:47.840 --> 00:22:11.240
 javascript for some product that probably doesn't make sense so it's just like so many layers of it's suppressing uh don't think about it too hard i guess but but that's like a million times more productive than like a lot of things i'm thinking of which i don't want to stay out loud because i don't want to call out anybody's job or giant companies just there's so many in between overhead

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:41.160
 roles yeah and i think someone put it put it well the other day i forgot where i saw this but they were like you have to acknowledge that their overhead roles calling it an overhead role doesn't mean that it's not necessary because if you remove it something probably break but the reality is we'd all try to have we'd all like to have less of it right and some companies figure how to do that other companies don't so i think they either are just a lot of overhead type type jobs supporting direct jobs just because we haven't figured something

00:22:41.160 --> 00:23:11.080
 out yeah do you think that like over time is on a trajectory that it's lessons like is it trimming over time is it a generational thing i i mean we thought that was before i really hope that some some of the lessons we've taken from the past couple years is we just need a lot more companies that are a lot smaller i think nobody's happy with this like oh yeah these like a few giant companies yeah yeah like just it's just bad and so many different angles

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:26.960
 and some companies have to be that i get that but i think i think at a time that was kind of like the desire the desire was to try to build more of these massive corporations i'm hoping more people are excited about figuring out how to get really big without literally being really big

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:56.800
 yeah yeah i was just we were talking about this the other day apples now almost a three trillion dollar company like all these companies that just cracked a trillion like apple that wasn't that long ago apple was the first trillion dollar company there's three trillion now what what does that work like this grows faster and faster i don't know that seems bad yeah i mean there's just more and more people more and more people with money to spend more and more so more and more things

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:25.600
 to capture i guess like i say that scene yeah i guess that's good it's it sounds bad in terms of like moving towards the goal of more small companies seems like the big companies will just keep swallowing up all the smaller cut like the trick trajectory seems like it's moving more toward fewer bigger companies i guess yeah i think it just comes on a what the workers desire you desire to work at a giant company are you willing to sacrifice some of the benefits you get a giant company for like

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:35.760
 that's other thing that you might want to push for yeah that's it's got some of the remoting i was talking about earlier like i also never really worked at a big company like that because

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:52.720
 i want this other reality to exist and i have to give up a lot of stuff for that but i'm hoping more people are excited by that that tradeoff and i think they can remind me what what are we giving up i forgot i've never worked at a big company i made this decision so long ago i don't remember

00:24:52.720 --> 00:25:03.520
 i mean i don't really know i guess like benefits yeah all the 401k is a certain thing like the the clear roadmap in front of you to like this is what you need to do next years and you end up here

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:21.840
 yeah the certainty though i would push back yeah exactly it's fake it's a fake yeah it's fake certainty because you get laid off tomorrow yeah yeah exactly uh it's that like you have like crazy stability for five years and then you have like a singular moment of insane instability of those big companies

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:46.840
 whereas the rest of us i think we just have like constant minor instability yeah relative to like being laid off overnight yeah i prefer this way personally yeah me too so and i think more people are kind of getting interested in that i have a spicier tweet for later that i'm going to say oh about this so you gave us some exclusive content on the podcast and then you teased some content you will not give us i'm so good at this fake job

00:25:46.840 --> 00:26:12.840
 it's awesome i feel like we've been really busy like i feel like we have not had a lot of extracurricular activities it's been a busy summer for everybody or have i just been so employed i haven't noticed that everybody's carrying on like normal i don't think it's been a busy summer for everyone i think it's quiet because everyone has better things to do in the summer is it quiet okay

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:24.120
 because i haven't been on quite as much but when i have been it feels like things are quiet around our parts i think people are enjoying the summer and then me and you unfortunately are in a phase of

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:40.840
 uh i think the ship a lot is like enjoying vacations and doing fun stuff and we're like head down for the last three months okay that makes us yeah sucks for us i know when's that gonna get better second better i think for me probably like another month or so

00:26:40.840 --> 00:27:06.840
 uh yeah but i've been saying that for i don't know yeah i don't know i would say the past ten years okay soon it'll get a little better maybe a month it feels like you never make progress in anything because here's how it feels i wake up one day and i'll be like okay i'm working as is he hears like our most burning problem like this sucks yeah we gotta fix it i really want this thing to be fixed

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:36.360
 then we'll spend it related to astro no oh sorry i thought i was like break it looking at this week i've rather responded okay cool yeah you can do it uh so something's burnt like it's burnt you know like this how we have to fix this you spend a bunch of focus effort let's say a month fixing it yeah and in that month you like solely make that thing better but as i think better a new burning fear like shows up so by the time you're finished with it it's been replaced by this new thing like this sucks we have to fix it and then you're in this constant state of being like

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:44.920
 never remembering all the stuff you fixed and then just really just being obsessed with how can we let this be so bad yeah because right now i mean we went through this with sst where

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:57.720
 we're like okay we like we don't have a real funnel to a to an actual paid product that's like important for a business you know yeah so that was a good burning thing i hear from against a point where we kind of have that and now we're looking at like

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:27.200
 oh man like we have such a leaky bucket like we have a lot of people coming in but like our docs suck and like we're losing a lot of people and like people are not having a good ombre and now that's like the obsession and it feels like i've made no progress so just how it goes you know a wise person once told me you got to find a way to do both you got to do you got to do all of it at once you got to improve your your funnel and your leaky bucket all at once you got to RTO RTO yeah get back in that office let's get back in that office

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.240
 - Let's get Frank and Jay down to Miami.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.400
 Let's hold them back.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.880
 - I send them pictures, like really nice, fun pictures

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.040
 every once in a while where I'm like, "So, what are you guys?"

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.480
 - Oh, it's funny.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.240
 I'm about to move down there just from all the mango pictures.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.480
 You keep sending mango pictures,

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.960
 and I'm gonna move my whole family across country.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.240
 - Yeah, it's propaganda.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.800
 I'm hoping that at some point, everyone is like,

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.600
 retiring and we all retired to the same place,

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.440
 'cause that would be funny.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.280
 - That would be cool.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.240
 You think it's gonna be Miami, don't you?

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.440
 - I don't think it's gonna be Miami.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.800
 I think everyone's really particular

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.720
 about their life, understandably.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.760
 - Yeah, the OSRX are in the middle of the country.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.760
 I'm just gonna throw that out there.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.440
 It's kind of like same distance from everybody.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.800
 - Is that your best pitch?

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.440
 That is literally average?

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.760
 - That's all we got.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.600
 Yeah, the average.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.080
 - It is the average geographic distance.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.800
 - It's the best average distance.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.440
 - I think the geographic center,

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.640
 seriously, of the United States, like geographically,

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.720
 is like an hour away.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.960
 Like I know the town that it is.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.120
 - Oh, oh, I worry from you.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:29.960
 How's that work though?

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.240
 Like, do they factor in Hawaii and Alaska?

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.080
 - I don't know.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.320
 Yeah, probably not now.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.160
 - 'Cause why is that?

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.000
 - That was early for their West.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.400
 No, I think continental.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.440
 And I don't know how it works in terms of like,

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.160
 the United States isn't a rectangle.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.880
 So like the distance from what point to East Island?

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.480
 - Well, I guess you just mark all the points

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.560
 in the perimeter and do the point that's the average

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.880
 from each point in the perimeter.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.880
 - Maybe that made sense to you,

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.320
 but did not make sense to me.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.760
 - I'm just making setup.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.600
 - Okay, yeah.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.600
 - Same.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.280
 - I ended in a math class and like,

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.760
 how old am I?

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.600
 Like 12 years, something like that?

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.440
 - Oh, yeah.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.280
 It's been a lot.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.120
 We were just talking about this.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.360
 My eight-year-old, the Hates, learning math.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.760
 And I heard my wife say to him, like,

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.360
 you know, your dad actually loves math.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.480
 Some people love math.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.880
 And I thought like, I do love math.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.160
 I haven't taken a math class in forever.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.440
 Yeah, 12 years.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.520
 But I love it.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.720
 Like I was excited for math class every day.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.560
 - Me too.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.400
 - So why don't I just like,

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.520
 I should get on the Stanford or whatever,

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.040
 the things, the online stuff that's free now.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.600
 I just take math courses for fun.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.960
 It was the thing I enjoyed.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.800
 - Would you really do that?

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.040
 Does that sound fun to you today?

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:37.880
 - Yeah.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.040
 I mean, I loved, I loved like lectures.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:40.880
 I don't take notes.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.560
 I don't like a lot of the other trappings of school,

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.760
 but I love listening to a good lecture.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.160
 So yeah, it does sound fun.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.000
 We'll be able to do it right now.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.920
 - That was the exact same way.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.000
 I would always pay, people thought I was a bad student

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.520
 'cause I never did my homework and never took notes,

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.600
 but I would always pay attention in class.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.880
 Like I loved just sitting and listening.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.720
 - Yeah.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.560
 - And I had some teachers that were like,

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.080
 really good in that format.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.320
 We had a really great physics teacher

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.440
 that was like a great lecturer.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.160
 But yeah, I don't like being distracted by other things.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.000
 - Yeah.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.120
 The power of like a good teacher too,

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.320
 like one of my favorite classes in college

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.400
 was like a just a elective thing.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.560
 It was like a climate science class.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.040
 And that teacher was just, he was so good

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:22.160
 that I was super into climate science for like three months.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.280
 He was just like an awesome professor.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.400
 And that's the sad reality that they're not all the best.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.640
 Some aren't the best.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.320
 - It's what I say with every profession,

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.120
 no matter how smart you have to be to do it,

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.600
 most people just are kind of whatever at it.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.440
 - Yeah.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.920
 - Which sucks.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.800
 We added some of our experience with a high school physics.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.880
 We we've randomly had a high school physics teacher

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:47.480
 that had two PhDs and she was older

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.880
 and she retired from like her main career.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.680
 And then she switched over to teaching us and yeah,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.280
 it was like such a good class because she would just talk

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.480
 and she like didn't care about all like the BS of,

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.800
 well, school is supposed to have, yeah, notes

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.800
 and homework and all this.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.640
 She didn't care about that.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.000
 She was like, talked about it, talked and it was cool.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.480
 And she was really great at teaching.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.000
 But you know, like one, one in 50 people

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:10.840
 probably as good as her.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:11.680
 - Yeah.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.600
 I had a high school course.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.800
 This teacher was eventually fired before tenure.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.520
 They would literally every class was a sheet of terms

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.920
 and you had to look them up and write out the definition

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:23.760
 for the terms.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.600
 - I could.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.320
 - It was like 20 on a piece of paper.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.160
 And then that teacher would set them back and sleep.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.640
 No joke, would sleep.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.120
 - Oh my God.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.880
 - Yeah, I'm not going to go into it any further.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.240
 No more details shared in case anybody listens to this.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.440
 But when you describe that, I had this weird flashback to,

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.680
 do you remember that like burn you would get on your finger

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.160
 from holding your pencil and like writing with it?

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.200
 Did you, yeah, happen to you?

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.440
 - Like a little impression.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.080
 - I can like feel it in my finger right now.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.520
 Like it like flashed me back to that feeling

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.120
 of like writing with a number two pencil

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:53.960
 and it like just kind of.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.000
 - I guess kids still write with pencils in class

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.720
 or do they all just have iPads or something?

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.000
 - That's another thing that like I totally forgot.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.920
 Cause everyone always talks about having like my brother

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.400
 who was 10 years younger was talking about

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.480
 having his computer in high school

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.800
 and just like playing video games on it like during class.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.440
 I'm just like, wait, you all just had laptops out.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.880
 - You just have laptops out in class?

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.720
 - Huh.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.840
 - So that's another thing my eight year old hates is writing.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.560
 You might just hate school, but he hates like having

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.600
 to write out words.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.400
 He can do it and he's developed some of it,

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:26.520
 but he's really would much prefer just like say the answers.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.600
 And then I started thinking like,

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.600
 does he need to learn to write?

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.920
 It's like how we learned cursive.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.880
 Like we never needed to learn cursive.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.480
 Do kids even need to learn to write anything?

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.760
 I never write.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.640
 I never have to use my hand to write something.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.480
 - Yeah.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.400
 - It's like signing my name fakely on the like checkout thing.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.320
 - Do you have a real signature?

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.240
 I don't have a real signature.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.080
 - I just do like those girls.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:44.920
 - I do have a real signature.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.280
 - I stress about it a lot.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.000
 And yeah, it's kind of cool.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:48.840
 - That's not surprising.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.160
 I actually, I didn't know why I asked that.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.480
 Of course you have a real signature.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.160
 Of course it's very particular.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.500
 - It's aesthetically pleasing.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.320
 - Intentional.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.000
 - Yeah.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:58.840
 I guess, yeah.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.440
 I mean, when I have to write in the rare cages after write,

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.760
 'cause you always have to fill out like some form somewhere.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.600
 - Yeah, I guess.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.360
 - Like my hand is shake and like, it's just so hard.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.280
 Like it's so hard for me to write every single letter.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.160
 - We just never hardly have to do it.

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.880
 And I feel like if they just learned to type

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.800
 and spent that time learning typing,

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.240
 that's probably better.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.720
 I don't know, practically speaking.

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.080
 - Yeah, I guess if you don't,

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.920
 if you literally don't know how to write,

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.360
 I don't think it's gonna harm your life that much.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.040
 - But somewhat, I guess you're right.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.120
 Like you go to a doctor.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.400
 Why do we have to fill out the same forms

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.680
 that every doctor we go to?

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.040
 What, I don't understand this.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.080
 Can they not like all share something somehow?

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.440
 Is there not some digital movement to like,

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.960
 you fill out the thing one time

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.640
 and then everybody just can share that around?

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.160
 - I can like talk about this for like two hours.

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.480
 - Okay, we should, we'll save that for the next one.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.640
 - It's like a weird area of expertise.

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.480
 - Yeah, a little teaser for next time.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.480
 - But the TLDR is you legally have the right

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:59.600
 to chip your records between one doctor and another

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.040
 and there should be a standardized protocol for that.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.760
 But it's another one of those things

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.360
 where people are just so short-term focused.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.640
 The doctor's offices are not in said device

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.720
 to make this any easier because they only time people

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.240
 ask them for this when they're switching

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.480
 to a different customer.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.080
 - Oh, interesting.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.360
 - It's just stupid and short-term

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.120
 because the flip side is whenever someone comes to you,

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.200
 now it's a whole hassle for you to get their records

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.840
 into your, it's just like people get obsessed

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.160
 with these little things like they're gonna,

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.880
 we're gonna optimize for like,

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.280
 making it like five percent hard for somebody.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.400
 Someone is not gonna leave a bad doctor

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.560
 because, oh no, my paper will work like, right?

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.000
 I'm just gonna have this bad doctor treat me

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.840
 to avoid refilling up.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.480
 It's just really dumb.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.280
 We had, when I worked for the company

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.920
 that made the software for hair salons,

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.560
 a weird obsession of theirs was,

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.840
 oh, someone is gonna quit and steal their clients,

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.360
 like take all the clients that they have

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.680
 if they're like a barber.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.920
 They're gonna look at it and take them all.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.200
 So there was all these features

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.600
 on like only seeing people's first names

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.520
 so like not being like controlling exactly,

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.360
 you could see what.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.440
 And I get that this literally happens

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.480
 but it's on the day just like, okay, it happened,

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.880
 just let it happen.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.600
 If someone's motivated to, there's gonna make,

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.760
 there's gonna ask their clients like,

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.120
 hey, what's your number, I'm leaving.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.880
 - And they're gonna do that over a couple of months.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.200
 - Just be better, just like be better

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.320
 and make a good place that people don't wanna leave.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.160
 There's a good option.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.520
 - Exactly, like just focus on that

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.440
 and then this thing should be a minor problem.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.320
 - Yeah, it's just, there's so many things in life

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.160
 where I feel like that is what drives it.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.560
 Just some like weird fear over some like weird,

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.800
 like competitive thing.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.600
 - Yep.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.440
 - Yeah, all right.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.720
 I think we're out of stuff to talk about

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.240
 'cause it's been 37 minutes

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.000
 and that's about an episode length, right?

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 That's not a reason.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.880
 That's not a cut.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.800
 (both laughing)

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.320
 I think this has been kind of a low one.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.880
 I think we're both just so busy

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.120
 and I feel like we need to have caffeine or something

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.600
 before we record just to try and make it sound like we care.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.440
 (both laughing)

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.120
 We care, we just, we guys up going on.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.320
 - I sat down and like suddenly felt super low energy.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.440
 I don't know, I don't know what happened.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.400
 - Yeah, same.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.120
 We're feeding off each other's low energy.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.400
 - It's weird. - It's interesting.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.920
 - We should, we should take pre-workout

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.220
 before we do the podcast.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.060
 - There you go.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:21.840
 Well, next one is episode 50.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.840
 So I'm gonna feel pretty motivated

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.840
 (both laughing)

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.400
 to be something different.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.840
 - Yeah, it's a nice.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.400
 - Arbitrary cutoff, round number.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.160
 - Okay, well, sorry, one day we're so sleepy.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.240
 - Yeah, next time we will be so sleepy.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.120
 Next Thursday, this Thursday, whatever.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.880
 If we still do it Thursday, I don't know.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.120
 - We'll do it. - We'll do it.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.200
 - We'll do it. - We'll do it.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.720
 - Nate's asking if you have your morning,

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.220
 if you had your morning beat juice,

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.800
 which for the U is a pre-workout.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.240
 - No, I actually, I skipped the jiu-jitsu this morning.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.360
 It's first time I've like skipped

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.640
 where I didn't have to, like I wasn't traveling or like,

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.040
 I just skipped 'cause I feel like I've not recovered.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.680
 I've had like a cold, and if you can tell,

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.080
 it's been blowing my nose a lot.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.840
 - Yeah, so I've had like a cold,

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.680
 which it's been a casey gas lit me

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.160
 into thinking it was just allergies.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.320
 I've been walking around for a week,

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.960
 thinking I just had allergies.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.000
 And then she admitted that like, yeah, we all have colds,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.800
 like that's what's happening.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.080
 Like, oh wow, it actually helped.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.800
 It actually set me in a better frame of mine.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.840
 It's like, I feel better knowing it's just allergies

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.320
 than I'm actually sick, but the effect was the same.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.480
 Yeah, so I skipped my beat juice

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.400
 and my jiu-jitsu this morning.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.440
 Maybe that's why I'm low energy.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.600
 I just slept in.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.960
 - Yeah, I mean, I've also just been off the gym for a week

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.800
 'cause of my knee.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.200
 My knee feels, darn it feels better.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.040
 - Oh, is it better?

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.560
 - But I don't want to do that thing where I'm like,

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.600
 it's better than I go and just re-injured again.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.440
 - Sound straight into it.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.320
 - Trying to take like one extra week,

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.160
 and we'll see.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.000
 - You're playing with fire.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.240
 It's a slippery slope.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.240
 'Cause eventually it's like, eh, I could just not.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.080
 (laughs)

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:50.920
 That's what I did.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.000
 (laughs)

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.880
 I should let my knee recover some more.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.480
 And then a month later, I'm busy.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.320
 Yeah, I mean, I gotta get back into it at some point.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.160
 - You will.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.760
 And I will get back to caring and being enthusiastic

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.080
 on this podcast, but not this time.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.200
 That'll be next time.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.200
 All right, thanks, Dax.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.120
 - All right, see ya, everyone.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:08.960
 - See ya.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.280
 - See ya, everyone.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.120
 - Bye.

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.700
 (upbeat music)

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:35.480
