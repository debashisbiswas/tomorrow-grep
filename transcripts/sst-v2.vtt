WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840
 So DAX SST2 is officially out. It's officially out, right? Yeah, it's officially out finally. I've been in a hole for I

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.240
 Think six months. I'm not releasing anything and it's rewriting every single line

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.400
 And it's finally out as of last week

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.320
 We haven't made too much noise about it because we haven't updated our docs, but yeah people have been using it and it's going well so far. I think

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 I

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:50.360
 Yeah, that's why I asked if it was official X. I couldn't remember seeing like a big tweet

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.760
 But I've been using like the snapshot and then the whatever the other version was the release candidate before we get into like

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.960
 What all is in SST2 and just talking about SST more generally first question I have when you said that made me think

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.580
 You've been in a hole for six months. Did you ever feel like?

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.900
 That your your SST

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.660
 Counterparts your co-founders. Is that the word? I guess did you ever feel like they were doubting you or wondering is this ever gonna actually happen?

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.880
 Like when you go six months

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.480
 Did you ever worry about the perception of what they might say or they've been seeing it all along the way?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.320
 Yeah, well, here's the thing right. I wanted to do this the moment. I joined the team

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.960
 Which was two years ago?

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.280
 But I had to build up credibility over the last two years before I was like hey

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.240
 I'm gonna do this and I think it's gonna work. So I think the team was pretty bought in

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.800
 That it would work out

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.400
 None of us like it and if you look at our so we review our numbers every week every every Sunday and

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.880
 If you look at our numbers the past six months, they have not been really good like the growth has been

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.760
 Pretty like there's like always like a decent amount of growth. There's been no like jumps or nothing exciting

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.280
 Right when you say none of us like it like what none of you like SST 2

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.920
 We don't like having to like just do a big rewrite

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.880
 We're not releasing you stuff because we effectively released nothing new over the past six months

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.800
 And we're used to releasing new stuff like every two weeks or every month whatever it is and that really drives our growth

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.140
 And gets people excited and so the past six months. We've been operating without that motivation without that feedback

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.240
 So we didn't like having to do this. We knew we had to exit enables a bunch of really interesting things and

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.920
 Now that it's out we're looking at our numbers and like yeah

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.760
 We're back to seeing like these huge jumps from everyone trying it out and people getting excited about it

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.720
 So I don't think they doubted me. I probably doubted myself a little bit because

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.560
 It was there's just a lot to figure out

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.540
 But we got to a place where there's like a working demo a bit and a working demo was pretty exciting

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.120
 We got to that pretty early on so it wasn't terrible. So but I just realized we haven't said what SST is and

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.460
 It's like not everyone knows. So maybe could you give like the

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.320
 Could you give the elevator pitch?

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.240
 You really need to have a pitch. Oh man for SST. Could you give the pitch?

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.200
 What is it just get in a high level? I'll try it

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.960
 So SST is a framework that helps you ship applications to AWS AWS is a big complicated beast

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.720
 We all know this there's maybe 3% of it that you need to use to build

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.700
 95% applications and we try to focus on that 3% and make the best experience we possibly can and

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.440
 Let you bring other complimentary

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.200
 Modern tools like all these cool front end frameworks that come out

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.000
 Yeah, and you would say do you guys label yourselves as an infrastructure is code framework? You're kind of like going beyond that now

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.600
 I feel like but is that is that how you would classify the likes of the CDK or serverless framework?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.920
 Yeah, that's definitely where we started and for a long time. I saw ourselves as a

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.160
 infrastructure is code, but more lately

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.440
 I'm seeing that more is just something that we have to do to let you do everything else

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.960
 We want to help you build an application and deploy to AWS. Of course part of that is gonna be spinning up infrastructure

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.120
 But if you're if you're like someone that's trying to do a bunch of infrastructure work and you want a tool for that

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.660
 It's probably not going to be SST because we're more focused on application developers that

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.400
 Don't really want to spend a bunch of time doing infrastructure work because their infrastructure is not very bespoke

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.000
 It's kind of the standard

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 API's front ends databases

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.200
 Cues things like that and that's what I love about SST as somebody who's come from like the other

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.600
 traditional infrastructure is code frameworks like the CDK or just CloudFormation even

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.020
 It's like SST actually focuses on the application

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.680
 Authoring like what you go past the infrastructure and you actually help with the writing actual code for your project

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.920
 Like it feels like a modern web framework, but it's doing all your infrastructure as well and none of the others really feel like that

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.240
 It's like it's cool. It's like Mac versus PC or whatever you do

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.400
 Linux, I don't know and it's so tight script friendly. It's just very modern. Yeah

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.480
 And I think it's because you know people that work on SST

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.880
 We have a weird mix that I don't like our backgrounds kind of a weird mix

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.600
 So you don't often see we all have done a lot of front-end

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.680
 But we've also done a lot of infrastructure. So

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.480
 These other frameworks

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.760
 I don't think are and they're written by people that are very very good infrastructure that are a lot better than us infrastructure

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.320
 But you don't often see the combination of front-end plus infrastructure and I think our framework reflects that because we're trying to help you build

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.200
 You know, like a full application and I think that's why our position is a little unique

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:50.240
 Most people either are peer front-end engineers and never want to look for structure or you kind of don't really often run to infrastructure engineers that

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:57.680
 Like to do front-end. So I think because we have that combination as a C reflects that. Yeah, so I want I want to like

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:06.400
 dive into what is new in SST 2 versus like for people who actually know what SST is I feel like that's worthwhile doing

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.680
 But I also just kind of want to like share my experiences with SST and some of the things that get me really excited

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.280
 Which makes sense to go first. Yeah, I'll do like a quick explanation of what it is. So people have have context and why I did all of this

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.240
 So SST up until 2.0. So all of 0.0 and and 1.0

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.480
 It was it was the same code base from the beginning and you know when you're a startup

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.200
 You don't really know what you're gonna become. No one knew it as he was gonna become at the beginning

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.920
 And it was also started at a time where TypeScript wasn't as obvious as a choice. It is now

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:43.440
 So large portions of the SST code base were written in just JavaScript not even TypeScript and as you guys all know

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.920
 I love TypeScript. So it was a pain for me to just go into that code base all the time

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.040
 So that was a real limiter. We had some really old code optimized for certain things that

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.520
 We don't really focus on anymore

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.760
 Just because our startup has has shifted and our framework has shifted

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.040
 And then the second side of it is we never really cared about performance when we were building stuff

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.560
 We just wanted to get stuff out. We weren't thinking about okay. This adds 100 milliseconds

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.320
 Or this adds 200 milliseconds, and we did that

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.080
 You know over the course of several years and you eventually end up with stuff that just is very slow

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.560
 so one I wanted to rewrite everything in TypeScript and

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.440
 two during this rewrite I wanted to make sure that

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.400
 Any little thing we add we understand performance cost and we really optimize the heck out of whatever we can find

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.400
 So the experience with 2.0 is as a user it definitely feels faster

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.360
 And I think everyone's like noted. It's like it's not just we did well in benchmarks people can feel it and

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:49.600
 Then for us as people maintain the project we're able to ship way more way fewer bugs. We fixed like we fixed like a thousand little

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.800
 Bugs are like weird ergonomic issues with ST two

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.960
 With 1.0 people could use it

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.840
 But I wasn't really excited for people to try it and I was really excited for the experience for it with 2.0

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.120
 I'm definitely more excited with okay people are gonna use is an avid decent experience

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.840
 Of course, I said I don't feel like it's where I wanted to be but definitely no order magnitude better than where it was

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.840
 Just go ahead down for another six months. I'm sure

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:20.640
 I can't can't do that again. I want to speak to my experience with SSD

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.120
 But it's not really like I think all my experiences with SSD 2

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.120
 I don't think I played with it much before you had like a snapshot release that I could play with

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.560
 I think like there was a recent example on Twitter and and I'm more speaking to web developers

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.940
 I think I'm not like people who've used the CDK or people who've used CloudFormation and they want something new

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.280
 If you're just a web developer so rocks who streams on Twitch

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.400
 He is building this thing and you need to do uploads

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:58.000
 ideally multi-part uploads it's like huge video files he's trying to make this app where people can upload their video files and

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.120
 He wanted to use s3 he heard that'd be better than what he was doing which was like

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.680
 People posting straight to his railway server or something

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.820
 He's sent him in on Twitter and I've talked with rocks about this a lot. I'm not like talking behind his back

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.880
 His sentiment on Twitter was like why can't there just be an easy thing just give me like a

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.280
 Library that'll just do this for me and there's really not a way to do that

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.440
 Traditionally like to have a library that goes to that extent because it's like back-end stuff

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.480
 It's infrastructure stuff and then you've got the front-end piece

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.400
 It's going to be multiple things you're stringing together to make uploads to s3 work

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:41.840
 But sst actually makes it this I see this future where you could have like an sst

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:50.280
 Construct or like a third-party library somehow the builds with sst and it encapsulates all of that from like your front-end

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:57.440
 Which sst helps with deploying your front-end whether it's astro or solid start these like exotic new things or it's next JS

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.280
 You've got these constructs where it's like you're acknowledging the whole stack

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.840
 Within your application and you've got this opinionated folder structure

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:13.240
 So you create an sst app and you have this place to put infrastructure stuff like functions that need to run

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:20.840
 APIs databases storage whatever like s3 buckets, but then you've got like the ability to drop your front-end there and

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.640
 An interact with those back-end components

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.680
 natively like very easily without managing all the environment variables and all the plumbing and all that stuff

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.600
 So I can imagine a world where you could have these kind of higher-level application components

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.000
 That makes something like multi-part uploads to s3

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.400
 Way more feasible and then rocks could have his wish of like somebody just point me into a thing that I can just install

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.920
 And then it'll just work

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.080
 Right now like multi-part uploads are a huge pain even just normal uploads s3

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.280
 there's like a several steps involved there and you don't just have like a node library that you can install and

00:10:53.280 --> 00:11:00.480
 Suddenly have all that work. So that's my take like and I built out a multi-part upload thing using sst

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.440
 It just feels really good and just it feels like a modern web framework like I said

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:11.440
 But it actually takes you into your AWS account and deploys infrastructure and does all these more like

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.840
 Bespoke things you need to do when you're building things that aren't trivial. Is that accurate?

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:22.360
 Yeah, and I think that fits with the way I've been thinking about things lately. I have this idea where

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:27.960
 Whenever we're building features, I try to think of it as I don't want to make the user leave

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.600
 Their editor. I don't want them to make them leave their language. So

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.400
 If you build like the best let's say we all know AWS console sucks

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:46.240
 Let's say you built like you're the best designer in the world the best front engineers in the world and you built the absolute best AWS console. There is

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:53.880
 It's still not the correct experience because if you are in your editor, you're writing application code and you need to

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.400
 Create a bucket to upload stuff

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:02.400
 The context switch if I'm gonna switch to some UI tool to do that. Yep is doesn't matter how good

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.880
 You've made that UI tool you've already lost the developer experience because they had to do a context switch

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.800
 So for us

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.320
 We know most people are using TypeScript. They have to be using it if they're on the front end

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.880
 So they're likely gonna use it on the back end and we want to make sure you can do everything through TypeScript

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.720
 And if that's a case you're never doing a context switch like doing quote-unquote infrastructure work just feels like

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.520
 the rest of your code and

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:32.920
 The type safety we've provided across infrastructure front-end and back end makes it all feel like one one thing

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:38.060
 So we're kind of hoping we get to a place where it feels like I'm just writing an application. I'm not doing these

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:43.800
 Discretely different tasks. Yeah, it's somebody who does all the parts of the stack

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:50.520
 It's very refreshing to me, but I'm like a kind of a weird maybe use case like I work alone a lot and all that

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.400
 You've got a lot of startups using SSC. I've been in your discord

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:59.920
 That it doesn't seem like there's any has there been a drop in activity and in the discord for those six months

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.260
 It feels very active. They don't seem to have slowed down a bit your customer. Like who's building on SST

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:11.160
 We're so growing really well and you know with 2.0. We've seen a huge jump our focus is definitely still startups

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.280
 we believe in helping people

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:20.600
 Builds like you know, they're trying to build sustainable companies a single product to you know to work on and

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.000
 Obviously that needs to be easy at the beginning

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.600
 But it can't be this thing where they hit a point where they just hate our tooling

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.040
 You need to eject out of it really hardcore. So

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:36.680
 We intentionally accept that our stuff is never going to be the easiest to start with because you need to trade something off

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.240
 To get there you need to trade off longevity. So most of our users are

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.960
 startups or companies or teams that are working together

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.600
 We do have like really large enterprise

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:53.680
 Companies as well and we like to support them as much of the best we can but our focus really is

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.300
 I'm sorry. I'm trying to start a company. It's just me and my co-founder and within a year

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:03.120
 And then there might be a team around this and there's like a very narrow set of things

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.020
 Those people need so it's very easy to optimize for that experience. Yeah, and you're very like

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:15.100
 Practical I would say is the word you thought you've thought through the whole authoring experience in the light of like

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:22.720
 Future maintenance like not a lot of frameworks seem to care as much about how easy is it to keep building on your thing?

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:30.280
 You say like in year two in year three that stands out as well as I work with it like the domain-driven design stuff

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.880
 I mean, it's just stuff that like in the serverless community, especially it's sort of been abandoned

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.280
 It feels like and SST is kind of bringing it back to

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:43.440
 Those principles. Yeah, and these are all just really old ideas, which is what's funny about it

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.480
 Just stuff that's been around forever and has worked forever

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:52.640
 And it's always fun to like deviate away to see if things are different now, but

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.560
 the stuff we have in there is

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.500
 old time tested stuff that the most maintainable apps

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.240
 apps have

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:07.760
 But we try to keep it light like we don't want you to like we never want someone to feel like I'm studying the theory of something

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.320
 And I think that was a lot of what even serverless was like for a while, right?

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.760
 Like I'm gonna become a serverless developer and have these like

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:20.960
 Grand theories about serverless architecture and infrastructure. This is how we think and this is how with what we believe in and

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:27.640
 It becomes like a whole philosophy, and that's kind of why I was saying the other day like the front-end world has a much better relationship with serverless

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.440
 most front-end engineers are

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.240
 Really serverless native like everything they do is so they don't even expect anything different

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:41.640
 They just expect it to be serverless, but they don't think twice about it. It's just a natural instinct to away from them to do things

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:46.980
 Whereas I think the back-end world has been it's always been like this very intentional large step

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:52.280
 Yeah, to doing serverless as opposed to feeling like oh, this is just normal. This is what building applications is like

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.280
 Yeah, you mentioned earlier ejecting - I thought I should point out I think in my

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:01.240
 Examples things I've built with SST. I've had to use something

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.520
 There's something I needed deploy outside of that 3% on AWS

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:09.020
 Like I needed some kind of infrastructure and you could just drop CDK components directly

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:15.720
 Into an SST stack like these are just cloud formation stacks or just CDK stacks at the other day, right?

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.440
 So accurate. Yeah, exactly and that's uh

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.400
 As much as I struggle with the constraints of CDK because it's not my project

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:29.560
 It's AWS's project and you know, sometimes I want them to do things differently. The reason we're still on it is for that

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.600
 long-term maintainability sustainability thing

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:39.160
 We are never going to be able to cover a hundred percent of people's use cases. They're always going to need to do some weird thing

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.160
 that's different and

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.800
 It might it's not even that it's misguided or anything. It's just people have different requirements

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.920
 And being able to drop down into something lower level that still feels pretty similar

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:57.000
 Um, like when using a CDK contract, it's a little bit different and some of this stuff doesn't work as nicely as it does with SST

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.960
 But it's not like you're dropping down to writing yaml all of a sudden right something that you like never seen we're doing something in the console

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:09.480
 Yeah, exactly. So I think that's a lot of the reason we've seen we're able to see especially for I mean, we're not

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.200
 we're still like a new project and

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:18.280
 For something as important as your infrastructure. It's a big decision for people and I think a lot of the reasons

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:24.200
 We've been able to see a good amount of growth is everyone knows that there's an escape hatch of fail safe if

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:29.080
 If they don't like something they can they have the underlying layer they can drop too. So we don't take that lightly

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.920
 We know it's a big reason why

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:38.760
 People are going to try it out and you've got the open next so you deploy next to sites into an AWS account with similar feature

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.800
 Sets as versatile, right? I mean, there's are there still things you guys haven't built out maybe?

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:50.920
 Yeah, so that's an it really interesting project and I think we're getting some signals over the last week that it's working out the way we were hoping

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.080
 the idea behind it was

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.960
 You know, versatile has this really awesome serverless

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.120
 Infrastructure to deploy next year sites. We don't know the full details of it

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.080
 But they can do whatever they want right because it's a black box

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:09.240
 They can use some of AWS. They can mix in cloud flare. They can kind of do whatever set up works well for them

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:15.960
 And if you want to self-host and you want to have a similar serverless setup in your own account or whatever it is

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.120
 It takes the effort of an entire versatile engineering team to

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.640
 To like come up with that architecture and do things correctly

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:29.880
 And there were several like disparate attempts of doing this you can think about like, you know individual open source attempts of

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.480
 Okay. Hey, like here's here's like a way you could do it in your AWS account

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:41.160
 There are other proprietary attempts right like netlify let you deploy next year as to their infrastructure similar to verso

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.400
 Amplify has their own

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.560
 So if it felt to us like everyone was repeating this work

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.640
 Over and over

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.160
 So we try to create okay, let's create like an open attempt at doing this

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.840
 And we're not

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.000
 Is no one on the team is a next year's user

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.960
 So we're in a lot of ways ill-suited to do this like we understand the infrastructure stuff really well

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.720
 We understand front end in general and how to deploy friends in general well

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.720
 But if it comes down to like how should this specific next shas middleware

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.920
 Operate like we're not the people that do that. So that's why we really want an open effort

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:20.120
 We saw enough interest in our community where a lot of people were deploying next shas like next shas experts

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.120
 I'd like to do every little detail of it

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:27.160
 And we really wanted them to contribute and like find bugs and be opinionated on how it should work

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.560
 and over the past week we've been seeing

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.080
 pull requests fixing like really obscure things that

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.040
 We would have probably never figured out

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.480
 Uh, so it's something like this. It's always going to be a little behind

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:45.240
 Vercelle because like you know, they're building actually us their infrastructure is going to match it and they're gonna be a nice lock step there

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.440
 We're always going to be a little behind but if we have a decent amount of eyeballs helping us and looking at it and

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.840
 And helping us stay up to speed

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.920
 We have a really good shot at maintaining parity with a similar

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.080
 Next shas experience on vercelle. It's never going to be the same because they mix in other stuff

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.800
 Like they use cloud player for some things or ourselves a hundred percent AWS and we have the constraints there

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.600
 but

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:12.360
 It's at this point is comparable and I think for most use cases it works effectively the same

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.680
 I wish the whole next shas thing being so complicated deployed didn't taint my like I it's hard for me to want to use next now

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.200
 just because

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.920
 It's so complicated to deploy and I know I'm like probably unique there everyone's still

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.200
 Probably using next JS in mass

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.560
 And deploying to vercelle and I'm sure it's not hurting them any but for me as somebody who's really into

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:39.320
 Like running stuff in my own a business account and building out my own apis and those things

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:44.680
 Uh, yeah, the whole like complicated nature of next JS because you guys have other constructs for like

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.600
 These other frameworks and they're super simple right like deploying an astro site

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.760
 Super simple

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.280
 The next JS not super simple. You have to have a whole open source

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.400
 Like movement to try and keep up with what all the they're doing there. I guess it's good

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.320
 I mean, I guess the features that they provide are cool

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:06.440
 I just wish it wasn't so complicated. Yeah, exactly like if you look at the code for other contracts

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:11.320
 So right now we have an astro contract. We have a remix contract. We have solid start

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.960
 Contract and we have more coming

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.120
 The other three are almost exactly identical and there's almost they're like share

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.480
 Like 90 percent of the infrastructure and there's like very little nuances between them

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.680
 Um, but these other frameworks were built to be very neutral from day one

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.120
 Right, they like in their repos. They have adapters for

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:39.800
 For cloud player for netlify for running in a container. Um, I'm interested to see how these evolve because

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:45.960
 That is a constraint that they're adopting. They're saying we're going to build in a neutral vendor neutral way

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.680
 And maybe for front end that doesn't matter too much

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.640
 But at the end of the day next JS will always provide features that are very difficult for

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.240
 Some of these other providers to other frameworks to do

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:03.560
 And I'm starting to see them kind of break that little like astro has their image component, which you know only works

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:08.040
 Like it doesn't work in cloud player. It only works in like AWS type environments

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.240
 Um, so as an example of these frameworks having to

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.040
 Draw some lines and be a little bit opinionated

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.680
 They're all really good and complete filling frameworks

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:22.120
 Is it is it just about the runtime like they want to use something that's node specific or something and then it has to be deployed

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.080
 To node servers that that's what they yeah, that's one one constraint

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.480
 Uh, but things like next JS is a bunch of like interesting stuff right like they're middleware

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.280
 It's like oh your middleware can run an edge

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.280
 So it can like decide things before it hits your regional function

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.960
 Those are like architectural features that you know coming from like whoever's working on astro

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:48.120
 Their only ability is to say you have a single function and this bunker is going to execute

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.600
 They can't like do complex routing stuff at the

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.320
 like the infrastructure level

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.480
 Um, I don't know how important all that is

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.440
 Again, I don't use next JS so I don't know how like oh, this is a really awesome feature

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.840
 Or this is just like a cool thing that you use once in a while

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.240
 So yeah, I think these frameworks won't be able to do that type of stuff

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.080
 But as a user of these frameworks, it doesn't feel like it's mattered too much

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.600
 I can do everything I need in astro and solid start and all these frameworks

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:19.560
 I haven't felt limited yet by them and whatever framework you're using you can use sst to deploy it into your own AWS account

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.520
 Super cool stuff. I'm a big fan. I've become a big fan. I think those six months

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:30.840
 I needed to see you put in the effort backs and once you did that, I felt solid moving forward with us

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.880
 I mean, that's kind of what I was hoping so

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.520
 Like it would bring on the the people that are slow adopters like me

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:43.320
 Well, uh, it's been I don't know two and a half months since we've done this. Is that right?

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.200
 Yeah

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.320
 It's flown by

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:51.240
 It has like one to hibernation for the one. Yeah, it was just a holiday break. I like to take long long holiday breaks from everything

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.280
 And that's what this was all the way up to president's day. Yeah

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:58.440
 When is that when when's labor day? Is that like June or something?

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.080
 Never keep track like we could if we both are kind of independent like we don't have the the company

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:08.840
 Calendar to remind us of these things. Exactly. Just don't know. Okay. I don't remember how we ended

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.920
 Do we ever have a way we ended a podcast episode or was it always just kind of like awkward goodbyes?

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.440
 I think we were always just like all right. See you Adam. All right. See you next
