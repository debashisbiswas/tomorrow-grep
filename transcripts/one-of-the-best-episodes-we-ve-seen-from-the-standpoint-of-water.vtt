WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
 - Are we talking about this on the pod?

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.260
 This is going on terminal.shop anyway.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.260
 - We're recording.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.060
 - Okay, okay, good, good, good, all right.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.640
 (upbeat music)

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.000
 - What kind of coffee are you drinking?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.500
 - Oh, just a little bit of terminal down shop.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.200
 A little artisan blend actually this morning.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.600
 - Wow, it's a limited edition.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.080
 We're gonna, I totally forgot that we're gonna run out of

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.040
 - Both of our limited editions right now.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.800
 - Yeah, I know.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.040
 - I don't know if you saw it, but we did the cron run this

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.600
 this week with flow. - Right with flow, yeah.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.840
 - Yeah, I'm glad it was only two or three.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.400
 I guess it was, there was three that were out.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.080
 I'm like, okay, I gotta factor that in.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.760
 Sometimes we run out of materials, you know,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.280
 just use the software where there's infinite everything.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.780
 - I just pay more money and it shows up instantly.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.960
 - Yeah, exactly, we kept trying to do intros

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.680
 and it was always so awkward.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.120
 So then we just let Chris out a little.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.240
 - I did see in the last one

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.960
 that Adam accused you of having white face.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.800
 So I did see, at least that was the last one that I watched.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.840
 So I think that was the very first words

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.800
 out of your guys' mouth on the new channel too,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.640
 which was great.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.000
 So I was like, wow, this is super good for the brand.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.160
 Thanks guys.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.160
 - I was taking it back.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.400
 He, you know, Adam's not usually that aggressive.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.080
 He doesn't usually leave me speechless that often, so.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.960
 - Well, when he is that aggressive, it's not on purpose.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 He's like, he's just saying your face looks really bright.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.240
 Like he's a friend, there's no additional connotations.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.240
 - That's also the episode where he said

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.680
 that other thing that we can't repeat.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.040
 - Yeah, I remember, I know, I wasn't gonna,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.880
 I didn't want to accidentally slip up and say it again, you know.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.920
 - He was definitely on a weird headspace.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.240
 - He was getting ready to unplug.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.240
 He was getting ready to unplug.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.080
 - That's true.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.920
 - I guess I should explain that.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.120
 The reason, this is not Adam,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.680
 for everyone listening, this is TDA.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.120
 Adam is on a force vacation.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.600
 I mean, just a normal vacation for the past week,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.440
 but he didn't try unplug.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.280
 - But he was like, guys, if you see me on Slack,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.520
 reprimand me.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.600
 - I have not been doing that.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.680
 I've been messaging him like several times a day

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.240
 with every open code update.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.240
 So I've been doing the exact opposite.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.280
 - I've been using open code.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.880
 I was using it today on stream.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.040
 - Yeah, I saw you were doing Elixir.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.040
 I was like, see, I'm surprised to work.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.440
 - I said, hey, he's in this dark mode,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.120
 and it just changed everything perfectly.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.000
 It was actually great.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.960
 - Was that Elixir?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.240
 Was that more?

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.600
 - Well, it's like, it's inside of Heeks,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.520
 which is their like template string thing

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.560
 for generating like HTML stuff.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.040
 - No, I've never said that out loud.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.920
 Is that how you say it?

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.040
 - I don't know, it's H-E-E-X, right?

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.040
 - I guess that makes sense,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.840
 but it's one of those things that I never said out loud.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.840
 Heeks.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.880
 - I figured it was kind of like mixing like HTML

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.440
 and like Elixir. - E-E-X, yeah.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.400
 - So those in my eyes go E-E-X, but I guess.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.920
 - But there's an H at the beginning.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.400
 You're just silent h-ing it?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.600
 - Well, I love to Elixir by the time they added the H.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.040
 - Okay, oh, you should just be dot E-E-X.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.640
 - I think that's just their general templating language,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.000
 and then the H is the HTML flavor.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.880
 I thought I remember correctly, it's been a while.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.800
 - Okay, I haven't done anything besides,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.960
 I also don't usually put it in the separate file.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.560
 There's like a really nice way to just do like a sigil.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.240
 Be like the daily H, and then you can put it directly

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.640
 in the file, and that's pretty much what I always do,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.120
 although no Elixir experts, so.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.160
 - I'm surprised that it works well with Elixir.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.000
 - It did a lot of good stuff so far,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.320
 it even was like it was kind of paying attention

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.240
 to sending messages in like the app JS side

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.320
 and the like the actual Elixir component,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.680
 'cause like you gotta communicate with them

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.240
 via message passing, right?

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.080
 - Right.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.880
 - And it was actually like keeping track of it

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.480
 between the two and stuff, so I was really impressed.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.720
 I was like, "That's good, that's good."

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.560
 - Nice.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.240
 - Yeah, did it switch to V4, or I don't know if you noticed?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.080
 - No, I think I'm still, I needed to,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.560
 I didn't run an update. - Oh, you did, great.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.480
 Yeah, gotcha, gotcha.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.400
 - But I was gonna try it with V4, but I didn't know,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.520
 I didn't know how fast I was gonna run out of your tokens,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.320
 you know, so I was trying to be.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.600
 (laughing)

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.960
 I didn't see what the pricing,

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.960
 what's the scoop on V4, Dax?

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.000
 - V4 is the exact same price, which is good.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.840
 - Oh, nice.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.360
 - It's a kind of no-brainer upgrade,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.840
 and I was kind of worried it was gonna be,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.800
 you know how like Chachi BT adds new models

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.400
 where they never remove the old ones?

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.240
 - Yeah.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.720
 - So now it's like a never-growing listener

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.040
 you know what to use, so I was worried

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.200
 that Panthropper wasn't gonna do that too,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.320
 but it seems like there's just,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.680
 this is like a one-to-one replacement,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.560
 and there's same pricing,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.600
 it's like become a default in their web app,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.200
 there's like no reason to use the old one.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.120
 I used it a bunch yesterday, I didn't notice any immediate,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.720
 like whoa, this is definitely better,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.160
 but there's some people that do like reviews

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.440
 of these things in a more rigorous way,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.840
 and it seemed pretty good.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.080
 Someone, I don't know if that's true or not,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.320
 but someone said that it stopped

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.720
 in certain comments everywhere, which is a huge deal.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.640
 - No way, anthropic and shambles dude,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.160
 like 25% of their like tokens were comments,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.000
 they're gonna be-

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.840
 - That's true.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.320
 - They're gonna be down in revenue so hard after this.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.640
 - Yeah, the funniest thing about the token-based

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.280
 billing thing is sometimes it just doesn't work,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.600
 you talk to it for like five minutes,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.040
 and it doesn't give you what you want,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.360
 but then you end up paying for it anyway, which is like-

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.720
 - Yes, and it is kind of a weird, like incentive,

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.280
 I mean like they're still incentivized

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.840
 to get the best model, you know what I mean?

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.360
 But they're definitely not incentivized in the same way

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.840
 to make like the most brief model.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.680
 (laughs)

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.520
 Right, you know what I mean?

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.880
 Like they're like, well we have the best one,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.520
 it just has to talk a lot to get there.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.000
 Sorry guys, I don't know what to tell you.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.360
 - Yeah, I mean hopefully the space is competitive enough

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.240
 that they can't like sit on anything like that, but-

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.400
 - Yeah, but it does just seem like it's just a little bit

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.760
 sort of weird in the sense that, like you compare it

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.320
 to like cursor, cursor if they're gonna give you

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.960
 like a flat rate for the month, they're like desperately

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.040
 trying to make sure that they're like pushing down

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.280
 all the token costs as much as possible.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.160
 So it is kind of interesting, but like it's also,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.920
 yeah, it doesn't seem like they have the space

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.800
 to just be like, we'll just let it yap forever

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.640
 and people not like it.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.600
 - The other model, it like cuts both ways, right?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.480
 'Cause the other model is kind of like a gym membership

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.480
 where you hope-

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.080
 - They're hoping you don't use it.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.280
 - Yeah, in a way you're like, we want them to use it

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.360
 but like not too much, yeah.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.840
 - Yeah, only for the first two or three months of the year.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.760
 (laughing)

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.240
 - I can't believe how real of a trope that is.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.560
 Like I, just the first month of the year,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.080
 the gym is just insane.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.720
 And it's crazy that we're all aware of this

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.240
 but everyone just does it anyway.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.720
 - It doesn't stop anybody from being like,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.680
 well, this is my year for the gym.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.760
 Oh, you know, it's like those other guys.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.240
 This is like, this just goes to show engineers are so wrong

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.040
 when they think like the best product is gonna win.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.400
 Like, no, the one that understands people,

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.240
 the best is gonna win.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.480
 If you could make a pop up gym that only existed

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.400
 for three months of the year

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.720
 and then their other nine months of the year,

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.160
 you didn't have to pay rent,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.720
 you would be the richest gym owner of all time.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.560
 - What is that?

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.480
 What is that like Halloween costume store

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.320
 that works this way?

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.160
 - Oh, Spirit.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.960
 Spirit is gonna always be appropriate, exactly.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.320
 Dude, they should be switching.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.160
 You know what I'm saying?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.640
 Like they, 'cause Spirit Halloween does nothing January

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.880
 through June, I think we just found a merger

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.600
 that could really change the game.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.440
 Like, don't publish this episode.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.720
 We need to get straight to it.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.040
 We need to go talk to some VCs really quick about this.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.120
 - That's actually genius.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.960
 - 'Cause they have enough time after Halloween

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.200
 to turn it back into the gym,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.880
 get it all out of the boxes.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.760
 You got three months.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.440
 They can leave one corner of Spirit,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.160
 always set up for the gym.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.000
 You know what I mean?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.840
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.720
 - For the six people that like,

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.520
 actually keep their New Year's resolution

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.920
 and are there like in June.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.920
 (laughing)

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.200
 But then they just like auto,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.800
 it's an auto-scaling gym, dude.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.360
 We're just taking the things with what we've learned

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.600
 from the cloud and bringing it to the physical space.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.200
 - You just get the people that show on January 1st

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.040
 to like move the gym equipment in,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.880
 to set it up.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.560
 That's for the workout for the day, yeah.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.000
 - And you're like,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.080
 well actually what you have to do is starting in December,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.480
 you have to be saying,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.440
 oh, the real way to properly lose weight

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.280
 is real kinds of labor.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.240
 See like machine equipment labor

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.000
 is really not the optimal way.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 You know, so it's like,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.240
 you need real muscles, not like J.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.000
 We don't want just show muscles, right?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.240
 We need actual muscles here.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.080
 J's over there,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.760
 they just have J on the side like doing this,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.000
 but then he can't lift up the couch.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.240
 And they're like, see?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.920
 See guys, you should be moving the couches.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.280
 That's how you get actually strong.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.520
 - It's funny, there was a TV show,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.360
 I can't remember what it was,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.280
 maybe it was shameless or something,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.120
 where that's like a plot point.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.960
 The guy starts a gym training program,

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.600
 but they're just doing like moving work.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.400
 Well, that construction work.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.480
 But like, the thing is--

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.720
 - They're paying him.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.680
 They're paying him, and yeah.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.120
 So he's making money on both sides.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.200
 But like, it's also not stupid

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.760
 'cause the people that do that work

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.520
 are the strongest people I've ever met.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.560
 Like, it's crazy how,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.560
 and they don't, they usually don't look like anything,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.920
 but just doing that stuff every day,

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.080
 like it just makes you a beast.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.200
 - Right, and then they're just like,

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.960
 picking up stuff, no problem.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.800
 Like, you know, like,

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.400
 oh, I need some help moving my couch.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.440
 And they're like, I can do it.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.000
 You're like, isn't it a two-person job?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.840
 Oh, no, I got it.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.560
 It's just like, up on the shoulder.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.760
 - Yeah, it's crazy.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.200
 So I moved, when I moved from New York,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.680
 we hired movers, and when I moved one house over,

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.680
 we hired some, just help with a few things.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.680
 And like, yeah, they like soloed stuff

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680
 where I would just be like,

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.040
 there's no way I could even move that with multiple.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.640
 'Cause it's not just like a strength thing.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.440
 It's like, stuff is just weirdly shaped.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.600
 I guess this is a strength thing.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.440
 But it's like weirdly shaped.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.880
 You can't grab it the right way.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.400
 We have one of those, egg,

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.400
 like we have a Kamado Joe.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.520
 It's one of those like really heavy ceramic egg.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.640
 - Oh, we've seen your, we've seen your steak bricks.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.480
 It's fine.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.160
 We're aware.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.440
 - Yeah, they just like, you like put on--

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.160
 - Don't put the top though on to the fake grass, dude.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.000
 - Yes.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.840
 Oh man.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.280
 I did that twice, you know that.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.120
 That was a second time.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.960
 - Did you get it again?

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.360
 - I did it in the other house.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.600
 - You had fake grass in the other house, too?

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.760
 - I mean, the same landlord owns both houses

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.600
 and whenever he--

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.600
 - Okay, yeah, yeah, he did.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.160
 - Just for the listeners.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.160
 I accidentally put a hot cast iron pan on the ground

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.320
 but my ground is fake grass made of plastic.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.120
 And within like less than a second,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:46.960
 'cause I realized right away

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.560
 and I tried to lift it back up,

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.480
 it like fused to the growling belts of plastic and fused.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.920
 But yeah, I've done this, I've done this twice.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.840
 So it feels extra stupid the second time around.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.320
 - But I mean, have you ever done it

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.480
 where you just grabbed it like with no gloves

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.320
 or have you escaped that fate?

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.160
 Like without another man, I'm saying?

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.920
 - Like by myself? - Yeah, I've touched it

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.680
 by accident, like with my elbow.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.240
 - Dude, 'cause I'm always worried about that.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.040
 Also, are your slacks not just going ham right now, Dex?

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.880
 That's gonna be in the--

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.720
 - I got it, I think it--

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.000
 - Yo, leave that in.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.840
 Chris, leave that in.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.200
 - I got the vacuum in last time.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.360
 Now I got the slack noise of this.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.400
 I'm over here.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.240
 - Yeah, I'm always--

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.000
 Catelyn's been all about cast iron lately

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.240
 and like, you know, we've been doing lots of eggs

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.080
 on the cast iron.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.160
 Now we have like many cast irons and stuff

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.000
 so she can do like little eggs for the kids

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.040
 and all this stuff.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.200
 And I'm always so nervous.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.680
 It's like three hours afterwards.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.020
 Can I touch this?

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.760
 (laughing)

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.400
 I'll get on the oven just in case.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.920
 She's like, that was yesterday.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.880
 You know, like-- (laughing)

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.520
 - Yeah, no, I've definitely, I use a cast iron

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.680
 as my primary, I've used a cast iron as a primary hand

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.080
 for like many years.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.000
 And the first thing I do after cooking

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.520
 is just blast it in the sink.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.640
 'Cause I'm just so paranoid that I'm gonna touch it.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.760
 - You're not supposed to put it in the sink though

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.160
 afterwards, doesn't that mess it up?

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.240
 - Okay, so I've experimented a lot

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.040
 and I think it's a little overstated.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.320
 So I, like you can even use soap.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.720
 Like it's actually not that big of a deal.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.440
 But I also switched to carbon steel.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.160
 I don't know which one you guys have, but uh--

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.000
 - Oh, I don't know.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.880
 - The newer flavor of cast iron is like a carbon steel thing.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.800
 - You're licking it or something?

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.200
 What do you mean flavor?

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.480
 (laughing)

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.840
 - The newer material.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.360
 (laughing)

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.280
 - I'm just like, I'm just eating it.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.460
 - Well, you should, isn't that the whole thing

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.300
 with the cast iron?

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.600
 They like retain the flavor over the year.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.960
 So there's a literal flavor to it too.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.880
 - Yeah.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.400
 - But the carbon steel ones, I think,

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.920
 are definitely a lot more, not a lot less delicate.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.760
 You can--

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.600
 - Yeah, they let you get away with a lot more.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.440
 - Yeah.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.360
 - Yeah, Caitlin just says don't, just don't do anything

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.200
 with them.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.440
 She's like, I've spent a lot of time seasoning these

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.880
 correctly, just don't touch them.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.280
 You know, so I'm like, okay, you got it.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.880
 That seems like a smart plan.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.720
 - Yeah.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.000
 It's crazy that I don't, to be honest,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.520
 it seemed like magic to me because you just like,

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.720
 rub oil on them and then you heat it up

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.880
 and just do that consistently.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.480
 And then like, it becomes extremely non-stick.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.800
 Like, I don't even understand how anything can work.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.640
 - And it's clean?

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.920
 You're like, how can it be clean?

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.080
 Everything else I have to put in the dishwasher.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.920
 That doesn't make sense.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.680
 - Yeah, I know, I know, but yeah, it works.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.920
 But I've been through a few.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.080
 I've definitely messed up some.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.680
 Well, I messed up the one that I stuck to the ground.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.000
 By the way, like imagine a cast iron,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.160
 like you understand how heavy and strong it is?

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.000
 - Yeah.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.280
 - When it fused into the grass

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.160
 and we were trying to pull it off.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.000
 - Yeah.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.800
 - We bent the handle all the way

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.920
 and like warped it all before it came out.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.120
 That's how strong this thing was.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.760
 - That's crazy.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.280
 That's so funny though.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.120
 - That's surprising.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.440
 Yeah, one of the surprising downsides

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.640
 that I think plastic grass that

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.040
 literally nobody will tell you about.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.880
 That's, you're one of a select few.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.520
 It's like, it's just like,

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.560
 I just imagine like, does anyone else ever accidentally

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.440
 get up at the beginning of a stand up show?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.120
 Hey guys, thanks for coming to the idea of Dax.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.800
 Anyone else ever get their cast iron sucked

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.440
 into their fake grass in the back yard?

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.440
 Am I right?

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.280
 Am I right?

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.360
 Just dead silence like crickets.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.040
 - You're joking, but I honestly feel like

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.360
 I can't be the only one.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.600
 Like this must be a common thing.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.200
 - Probably in Miami, I feel like there's a better chance.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.280
 There's a better chance.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.080
 The overlap of people who like making stakes

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.920
 on cast iron and who have fake grass back yard

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.640
 is a lot higher than the average, I would say.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.920
 - Yeah, the fake grass thing is huge here

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.000
 and it's grown on me a little bit, but.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.040
 - It doesn't grow Dax, it literally can't.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.960
 (laughing)

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.800
 - I swear, I think I've seen it grow.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.160
 - I'm like, you're watching.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.040
 - Liz, are we sure this is fake?

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.760
 I swear it's taller.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.160
 - The funniest is when I post videos

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.720
 and people, and I get it like Twitter compression

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.720
 and stuff, they can't exactly tell it's fake.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.680
 They're like, wow, like your grass is amazing.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.280
 What's your secret? - It's so green, dude.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.680
 How are you doing that?

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.240
 - Yeah, that's like, well, I do have a trick.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.240
 - Yeah, yeah, it's this one trick.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.600
 Landscapers, hey, you know, like,

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.040
 that's like I go over to my dad's

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.480
 and his grass is always immaculate, but it's real.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.920
 - Yeah, funny, I was gonna say the exact same thing

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.720
 'cause my dad has gotten super into grass the past.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.960
 We've always, like he's always had people

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.960
 come and take care of it.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.280
 But he's doing, he's been doing it all himself.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.880
 It's been out for the past, like two years.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.320
 And it looks insane.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.120
 And to the point where he's like the consultant

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.920
 for the neighborhood where the neighbors are like,

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.100
 yeah, they're like, okay,

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.320
 help me out with the situation.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.880
 Are you like a grass person?

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.320
 Like, do you manage the grass in your house?

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.720
 - I mean, I'm the one that goes and like

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.300
 does all of the things that need it,

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.160
 but I always told Kaitlyn, like,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.720
 I don't want to be a grass farmer.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.200
 Like, I'm not interested in that.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.000
 My dad makes fun of me 'cause I always told him

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.840
 when I was growing up.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.760
 Like, dad, I will never buy a house with a lawn.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.640
 I will find, like, you know,

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.000
 'cause I always hated doing yard work.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.480
 Surprise, like, who could have guessed

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.440
 the computer guy who likes to sit in his basement?

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.280
 You know?

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.920
 And then he's like, so you bought a house

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.240
 with a bunch of grass and you have a dog now.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.280
 You told me none of these things were gonna happen.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.760
 (laughing)

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.680
 But yeah, so I like, I do this stuff for a grass,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.440
 but it's just like, you know, very, very simple.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.440
 Put out some seed at the beginning of the year,

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.360
 throw some fertilizer

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.760
 and weed killer at some point.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.080
 We're, like, backed up to, like, some woods area,

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.560
 so we have a lot of, like, thistles and other stuff

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.080
 that kind of, like, come up out of the woods every year,

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.480
 so if I don't put anything down,

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.680
 then we get a lot of, like, really pokey thistles

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.880
 on the ground when the kids can't run around.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.720
 But it was, like, it's fine.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.080
 I just put, like, twice in the summer,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.240
 I just put something down on it,

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.200
 and then it's like, oh, it's good, and then it's soft.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.600
 But it doesn't look like my dad's.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.480
 You know, I feel like my dad's looks like I could lay down

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.720
 and, like, take a nap on it,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.800
 and it'd be, like, soft and comfy.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.160
 Mine is not that level.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.760
 - You have, like, a sloping.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.080
 I've seen, like, videos of your backyard.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.920
 Your backyard, like, kind of slopes down, right, yeah.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.520
 - Yeah, so it's, like, I have, like, a, like,

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.680
 it's flat for a little bit after the house,

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.920
 then it slopes down into the woods,

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.080
 and then I got tired of mowing that,

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.400
 so I just, like, left it to grow wild,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.640
 and so far, none of my neighbors have complained,

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.480
 so that's good.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.640
 (laughing)

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.120
 - 'Cause, like, they don't have to look at it?

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:20.960
 - Yeah, well, yeah.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.800
 - Yeah.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.640
 - Yeah, people look at it.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.480
 - No, I mean, I get it.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.840
 - They're doing their yard.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.760
 They're doing their yard, and then mine doesn't look the same,

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.600
 but it's fine.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.400
 Like, where I am, it's like, it goes into the woods,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.000
 so it looks pretty natural, but yeah, it's pretty funny.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.080
 The thing that looks really bad in my backyard right now

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.320
 is we just removed.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.880
 We had, like, a above-ground pool from when we moved in,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.840
 but, like, with a deck, like, built around half of it.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.680
 - Oh, I see.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.720
 - And we took out the pool,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.200
 'cause I don't really like it that much,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.240
 and you don't get as much use in Michigan

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.080
 as you do in Miami.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:51.920
 - Right.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.680
 - You know, like, most of the year,

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.000
 it's just a big circle of ice.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.120
 - Yeah, I mean, the main thing is it's just annoying

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.240
 with, like, little kids, 'cause you don't want your little kids

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.960
 to run around unsupervised in the backyard without the pool.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.880
 Like, it doesn't matter how many gates you put around it,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.320
 I'm like, I can't figure out gates.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.720
 - Yeah, it's still worrying in the back of your head.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.560
 Yeah, we just took an infant CPR class,

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.320
 and they were just, like, describing all the different ways.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.440
 - Yeah.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.440
 - Things can go wrong.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.240
 - Yeah, that's a surefire way to start getting you nervous.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.400
 You're like, oh my goodness.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.520
 There's so many things that could be not right about this.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.360
 But yeah, so we ripped that out,

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.320
 so now we have a, actually the kids love it, though.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.120
 They're gonna be so sad when I change it,

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.720
 'cause underneath the pool was just like sand, you know,

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.840
 'cause they used that to, like, level it and everything.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.120
 So it's a huge sandbox.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.360
 Like, 24 feet, right?

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.240
 Like, diameter, a big circle sandbox.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.520
 And the kids are like, this is awesome.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.240
 They're, like, digging up sand and then, like, throwing in

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.360
 and, like, going in, like, taking rocks from the sand

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.520
 and throwing it off the deck back into the sand.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.760
 And they're, like, this is so cool.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.200
 I'm, like, I hate to tell you guys this,

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.080
 but that is gonna take that away soon.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.400
 I am gonna not, I'm not gonna let the big sand circle

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.960
 stay in the backyard forever.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.760
 - That does sound really awesome.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.600
 Are you guys, like, gonna put something else there

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.960
 or just bring up the space?

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.960
 - Yeah, we're gonna make the, so, like,

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.200
 we have a walkout basement, so the back of the house

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.480
 is two, like, two stores, right?

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.000
 So we have, like, a deck that comes out

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.120
 from, like, the kitchen area.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.440
 And then there's steps down.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.800
 And then that was, like, the deck with the pool.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.000
 So we're just turning that now, like, into a rectangle

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.600
 for, like, a spot to sit and hang out

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.440
 and, like, have another table and other stuff there.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.400
 And then we're gonna put a bunch of, like, gardens

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.600
 and possibly chicken coop.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.720
 - Oh, chicken coop.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.560
 - Back there, too.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.200
 So, yeah, it was, it's very funny.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.760
 There was a video I saw recently where it was this guy

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.320
 talking and he was, like, if your wife says,

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.400
 she's gonna start making sourdough

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.880
 because she doesn't like the chemicals in bread.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.880
 Congrats, you're a farmer now.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.520
 - And, like, it was, like, literally describing

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.000
 my exact last year, where I was, like,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.480
 I'm just gonna start making sourdough.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.560
 And I'm, like, sick.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.400
 Like, that sounds good.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.800
 She's like, cheddar jalapeno sourdough bread sound good?

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.360
 Yes, that sounds amazing.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.680
 Hey, so just throwing it out there.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.280
 What about chickens, you know?

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.960
 (both laughing)

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.280
 - So, it's like, just go to the hardware store

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.840
 and start buying the coop materials.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.320
 You're gonna be building it in no time.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.640
 (both laughing)

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.960
 - That's so funny.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.160
 Yeah, my house had a chicken coop

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.080
 in the, like, where that shed area was.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:24.920
 - Oh, yeah.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.280
 - Yeah, it's, like, it got removed before we moved in,

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.280
 but, yeah, someone had chickens back there.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.440
 I guess, I'm assuming the grass is real back then also.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.000
 - Yeah, you wouldn't want it with fake grass.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.080
 It'll be so gross, so fast.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.760
 - Yeah, yeah, there's a, there's a weirdly,

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.520
 even though mine is a city,

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.480
 there's a lot of people that have chickens.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.840
 - Yeah, it's pretty in right now, pretty in.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.680
 - Yeah.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.880
 - I mean, it's nice, like, so right now though,

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.280
 I mean, I feel like the life hack

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.240
 is we have a bunch of people at our church

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.240
 who are doing chickens, like, we got this friend,

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.080
 they got, like, a hundred.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:55.920
 - Yep, exactly.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.680
 - Like, they're, like, seriously, they were,

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.600
 they're growing, like, crazy.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.520
 Their egg business is growing, like, crazy.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.000
 It's 10xing, you know?

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.480
 Like, this is hockey stick growth.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.400
 They've got over at their house.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.720
 And, like, all the, and so they're like,

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.800
 we have so many eggs.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.640
 Like, here's, you know, you like, a dozen

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.720
 for, like, barely anything.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.720
 I'm like, I mean, this is not so bad.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.360
 I just pick up a, you know, a dozen or two dozen eggs

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.080
 every week at church from them.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.080
 That's simpler than cleaning up the chicken coop.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.160
 I'm just throwing it up there.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.960
 - Yeah, when all those egg prices were going up,

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.280
 there was like this similar, like, underground network

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.920
 that was forming here where Liz's sister was getting eggs

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.120
 from someone that had chickens

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.680
 and then dropping them off.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.680
 Yeah, it was a, but yeah, it's crazy how many they produce.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.920
 Like, you get a lot of eggs from--

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.400
 - Like, almost a nag a day.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.480
 - They do that every day.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.320
 That's crazy.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.360
 - That is crazy, dude.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.200
 - A lot of work.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.720
 - It reminds me, though, I was talking to a buddy of mine.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:56.480
 He's mechanical engineer, very, very buttoned up.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.480
 You know, very straightforward guy about a lot of stuff.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.200
 He likes to do all of his own projects,

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.880
 this kind of thing, right?

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.720
 And he's got, like, five kids.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.760
 You know, he's got a bunch of kids, et cetera.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.680
 And we were having breakfast and I'm cracking up

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.720
 because we were just, we were actually talking about

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.480
 going on the yacht and doing the music video

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.240
 and other stuff like this.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.560
 And like how, you know, you can just like spend money

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.040
 and like make things happen.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.960
 You know, and like sometimes not even that much money.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.800
 Like to do the yacht, it wasn't even that much money.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.280
 Like, compared to going out for dinner

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.560
 at a nice restaurant, right?

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.720
 Like, a bunch of companies are like,

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.920
 yeah, we'll have a whole company out

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.920
 for dinner at a restaurant, whatever.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.080
 So, so we're talking about this and everything.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.360
 And my buddy goes, yeah, I just,

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.280
 I just don't really get it.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.360
 Like, I can never even think of things to spend money on.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.000
 And the rest of the table is like, what?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.560
 You know, like, dude, like, he's like, yeah,

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.280
 I just like, I've got all these projects

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.440
 that I need to do and stuff.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.800
 And we're like, Brian, that's what you can spend money on.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.280
 Dude, your wife would be so happy

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.600
 if like 30 construction dude came in

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.680
 and like finished all your projects in one week.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.040
 You know, like, it just reminds me of the eggs thing.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.400
 I'm like, I can turn money into time.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.760
 And I can do time to money and I can do both.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.160
 And, and, you know, like, I can just buy eggs for $4.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.920
 Oh, but I was cracking up.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.360
 I knew you would like, I can't even imagine like what?

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.280
 I don't even know how to spend money.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.200
 And I'm like, dude, man, I wish I had that problem.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.280
 It sounds nice.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.600
 That is not relatable.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.200
 I just have all this money that I don't know

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.200
 what to do with it.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.040
 Wow.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:34.880
 Well, it wasn't even that.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.480
 It's just like, you know, he works like regular mechanical

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.320
 engineering job.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.200
 He'd just like, you know, just not like,

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.440
 oh, he owns a random plumbing business

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.920
 that actually, you know, secretly does $5 million a year

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.800
 or something like that, like regular mechanical engineer.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.640
 Like, yeah, man, I just can't even think of like,

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.400
 what do people even spend money on?

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.800
 I'm like, oh, that's really funny.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.480
 If you don't have any use for it, like I'm available.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.520
 You can hire me to do anything.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.800
 Yeah, I mean, or just give it to me.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.800
 Like if you're really like, it's so useless.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.720
 That's funny.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.440
 So are you guys, you said you're going to do like a garden

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.040
 also, you said, going to grow like little vegetables?

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.120
 When we lived in Madison before we had kids,

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.240
 I built a pretty big raised bed garden like around,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.400
 we had like just a deck.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.440
 It was probably, I don't know, maybe like 10 feet

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.840
 by 20 feet, something like this.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.720
 I built like a raised bed garden like around most of that.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.680
 And we grew a ton, a ton of stuff,

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.280
 which was really fun, like a bunch of like peppers,

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.320
 like different kinds to like jalapenos as well as like Bell

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.600
 and some like Anaheim and a few other kinds.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.240
 We, you know, did tomatoes.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.440
 All that grows in Michigan.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.280
 That's kind of crazy.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.120
 Yeah, all of it'll grow.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.360
 I mean, you won't be able to grow it in the winter time.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.200
 You know what I'm saying?

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.600
 But like you get, for some of them,

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.920
 like you might need to do a little bit of sprouting

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.560
 like inside beforehand, like especially 'cause you run the risk

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.960
 of like a random like frost happening in May

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.560
 and then like all your plants die, right?

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.440
 You're like, oh, well, that sucks.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.640
 Yeah, I guess I'm done for this year.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.040
 Yeah, I guess we need to either go buy them all now,

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.760
 like in the expensive version of like partially grown

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.600
 or not, but yeah.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.000
 I mean, we also grew like cucumbers, peas, potatoes.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.160
 Potatoes are hilarious to grow.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.560
 Like, so it's super easy way

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.560
 as if you get like a big bucket or something.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.120
 They also make these like little bags that you can do it in.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.520
 You plant the potatoes in that have sprouted.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.920
 You put them like at the bottom

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.680
 and you only fill the bucket up like this high, right?

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.840
 Okay. With dirt.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.680
 And then as the stocks grow taller,

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.320
 you just keep on piling more dirt on and more dirt

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.280
 'cause you eat the root part, right?

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.000
 So then it's like, oh, the place like, bro,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.080
 we got more dirt.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.160
 Time to put some more potatoes in the ground.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.440
 And so like, so then when you're done,

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.640
 you have this huge like bush of like potato shoots,

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.840
 like shooting up at the top,

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.880
 but then all the way down our potatoes.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.280
 And so we want to do it.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.760
 We did it a little bit last year,

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.360
 but we'll do it again sometime.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.640
 It's like, then it's like a dinosaur expedition.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.160
 Dude, you jump out the big bag and you like have your kids,

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.080
 like they're like sifting through and like,

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.520
 I've got a potato, but you can get a ton.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.040
 You can turn one potato into like 20, probably.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.520
 Like seriously, it's crazy.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.280
 - Is that like, like sometimes you have a potato

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.600
 for too long, it like starts to--

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.240
 - Yeah, yeah, you can just bite those mostly.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.080
 - That's basically what that is.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:31.920
 Oh, I see.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.960
 - The only thing you get worried about for like,

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.240
 when you get it from the store and planting them,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.880
 some of them have like some like already pesticides

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.160
 or insecticides on them that like will prevent them

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.760
 from like properly, like all the way sprouting.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.600
 You know what I'm saying?

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.400
 Like they might do like a little bit of sprout,

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.800
 but yeah, like it's crazy too.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.920
 'Cause then if you take your seed potatoes,

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.040
 that you used, you grow a bunch of potatoes,

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.320
 you just have new seed potatoes again.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.280
 You're like, that's magic.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.100
 - It's actually that again,

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.560
 another exponential growth situation.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.400
 - It's exponential growth, that's like--

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.240
 - You played all of those.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.400
 - Dude, that was literally the meme.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.300
 - I know, I think it was tomatoes.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.480
 - So funny for tomatoes, it was crazy up every time.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.880
 Like would you rather have a million dollars

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.480
 or would you rather have 10 tomatoes and he's like,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.760
 number one, a million dollars would stop me from grinding.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.680
 Number two, think about it like this.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.320
 You start growing your tomatoes today.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.480
 Each tomato grows 30 seeds.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.160
 Each seed, you can play it again.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.800
 Before you know it, you've got 10 billion tomatoes.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.920
 (both laughing)

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.760
 - This is so funny.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.000
 - I know, I--

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.480
 - We got that mango tree last year.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.320
 - Oh yeah.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.160
 - And it's still in the pot.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.440
 Like we haven't put it in the ground yet

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.960
 and it's been a year.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.520
 And a couple of months ago, it started flowering

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.040
 and I was like, oh, this is crazy.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.480
 Like we only had this for a year.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.320
 - Yeah.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.480
 - And then they were like probably like 100 to 200

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.680
 and it's a small mango tree.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.960
 It's like, it's got babies still.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.800
 There's like 100 to 200 little tiny little mangoes.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.760
 And I was like, this is crazy that's already happening.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.600
 - Yeah.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:05.040
 - And it's so brutal because over the next couple of weeks,

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.800
 every single one of them either like--

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.800
 - Just fell down.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.080
 - Yeah, the wind knocked it off or like it just dried up

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.080
 and died.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.640
 And now there is one.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.160
 There is one mango.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.680
 Like that's like this size, but like two inches.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.560
 And it's like the lone survivor out of hundreds of these things.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.720
 - Dude, Succo's gonna eat it when you're not looking.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.600
 - He likes mangoes.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.720
 I share mangoes with them all the time.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.720
 So he knows.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.720
 - Oh, it's funny.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.640
 - We had this one flower that would grow in our like,

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.000
 you walk out the front door and then there's like,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.640
 we got a little garden next to the front door.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.520
 Right in front of it, there's this big,

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.080
 like some sort of crazy lily that would grow.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.720
 But it'll always grow kind of late.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.680
 But the problem is the deer always come and eat it

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.600
 in our front yard.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.440
 So like they hang out in the woods and they just walk in.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.920
 They're chill with all the people, dude.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.760
 It's so funny.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.680
 Like when I walk Ember around that night,

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.720
 there's sometimes you just see like five deer.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.560
 They're just walking on the street.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.160
 They're just like casually hanging out in the neighborhood.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.520
 - They're like using the sidewalks.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.880
 - Yeah, literally.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.280
 No, literally I've seen them like on the side

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.320
 was just walking down the street or like hanging out.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.720
 And so they would always eat it.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.160
 One year, I'd like the six that we've lived at this house

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.160
 or something like that.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.760
 One year, I finally see it grow.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.440
 I'm like, wow, that's really pretty.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.480
 That's crazy.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.840
 I'm like, Kayleen, you gotta come see this

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.880
 and we were busy so she didn't see it.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.440
 So she's gonna go look at it tomorrow.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.680
 Ember destroyed it.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.680
 (everyone laughing)

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.400
 She got it up and was like, oh, this one looks fun.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.720
 And she like pulled it out from the root

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.000
 and was like running around with them

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.480
 to put the balls in her mouth and stuff.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.600
 And you're like, that's crazy dog.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.440
 Like, what are you doing?

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.280
 - That's so funny.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.600
 - How is she gonna be with the chickens?

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.440
 - Good, I think.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.040
 Yeah, she's actually really like chill

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.320
 with little animals actually one time.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.240
 It was a little, the thing is I know my dog.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.760
 So I knew it was gonna be fine.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.400
 We have like a bunch of baby birds that always,

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.240
 they like in the underneath our deck,

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.880
 they always make nests and stuff up there.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.240
 And then like, so we always get some baby birds hanging out.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.920
 And one time I was literally streaming

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.200
 and I went out, I had to go take Ember outside

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.280
 to go to the bathroom 'cause I was streaming

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.480
 for a while in that day.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.720
 And so I did like, I just switched to my phone

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.920
 and I was going to go outside.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.920
 One of the baby birds is on the ground.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.400
 And I went outside with Ember.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.440
 And I'm like, I'm gonna let her go say hi to the bird.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.360
 Like I knew it would be fine.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.280
 And it was totally fine.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.480
 She just went up and she's like really gentle with the bird.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.400
 She didn't try and like demolish it or anything.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.160
 She's like super gentle with little animals.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.800
 But chat was like freaking out.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.640
 You know, they're like monk ass spamming like they're freaking out.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.640
 (laughing)

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.800
 - That's so funny.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.560
 - It was like, in retrospect,

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.840
 that could have probably gone bad.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.520
 Like, you know, like, I don't know.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:38.040
 And, but yeah, she's really chill with other animals.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.960
 I think if we like, like we were working on introducing them

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.760
 to her slowly and she got that it was like fun

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.360
 and the kids were hanging out with it

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.560
 with other animals and everything,

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.600
 she would be, she would be good with them.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.520
 So, but there is, there is always the chance

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.560
 where one day she's like, I'm a little hungry.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.240
 (laughing)

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.240
 - Yeah, there is this, I'm forgetting his name now,

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.680
 but he's like, he's on Twitter

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.780
 and he's like part of the AWS community.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.800
 He had a crazy-- - Adam, that's F.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.400
 (laughing)

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.280
 - No, this is a different AWS here.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.360
 - Okay, all right, got it, got it.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.440
 - There are many of them.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.680
 - Adam's the weakest one of all AWS here is.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.360
 Like, everyone always forgets that he's won.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.920
 He forgets that he's won.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.360
 I forget that he's won.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.840
 - Yeah, if the AWS heroes were the Avengers,

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.000
 which one would Adam be?

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.520
 - Not even Hawkeye, like probably--

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.400
 - Like Ant-Man or something useless?

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.160
 - No, probably the new generation of them

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.420
 or literally knows who they are.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:38.000
 - Superhero number 37 was unnamed practically.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.040
 (laughing)

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.240
 - The new generation, that's brutal.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.280
 (laughing)

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.360
 - Wait, this guy, I think he lived somewhere in Texas.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.560
 So he had a pretty big property

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.080
 and he had like a crazy amount of chickens,

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.960
 like 40 or 50, some of them were for eggs.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.000
 You know, it was a pretty big situation.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.160
 And he'd always post videos with these chickens

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.560
 of them like sitting on him and everything.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.040
 It was a fun little thing.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.480
 And one day it was either Foxes or Wolves

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.440
 or something I can't remember.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.360
 They killed all of them except for two.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.680
 - Yang, that's crazy. - Which is really, yeah.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.640
 Imagine going out and there's like 40 dead chickens

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.840
 in your backyard.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.880
 - Wow.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.680
 - Yeah, really crazy.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.040
 I think wolves, it must have been,

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.240
 maybe it was wolves or coyotes.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.840
 'Cause I think I know, I think wolves are the only ones

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.040
 that like just kill for fun

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.160
 where they just kill a bunch of animals

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.000
 and they just leave.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.200
 - That seems much more like a cat-like behavior though

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.200
 than a dog-like behavior.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.240
 - That's true.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.960
 - So I don't know, but I guess it could do wolves.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.000
 - Yeah, that is wild though.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.320
 That would be devastating, dude.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.800
 - The kids would have to see all that stuff.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.920
 - Oh, I don't imagine you're like,

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.080
 "All right, kiddos, go let out."

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.600
 You know, like go open up the cages.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.440
 It's out bad.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.600
 You know, just like, I'm not doing that.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.840
 Like I'm not getting up and doing that.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.160
 Like you guys can go get them started for the day

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.840
 and they walk out and like, "Dad?"

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.960
 There's like 50/50 chance though my son,

00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.960
 he's just like me.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.440
 He would just go out there and like do it

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.840
 and then come back inside and like not notice.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.400
 - Not notice.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.160
 - That's like the same way.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.360
 - Just so locked in, I'm like, "Well, I'll do my task."

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.680
 Like it's totally fine.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.240
 And he just comes back in and he's like,

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.080
 "None of them came out.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:14.920
 It was fine."

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.760
 I'm like, "I don't have them came out to eat."

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.320
 Then none of them came out to eat.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.480
 I'm like, "I don't know.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.680
 Can I play Legos now?"

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.480
 - That's so relatable.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.560
 - Dude, he just got on.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.640
 He just got on doing some Lego stuff by himself

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.480
 and it's crazy.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.440
 So he's like four and a half.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.040
 And I've never seen him sit down

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.280
 for an extended period of time in my entire life.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.760
 Like even like a movie is pushing it.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.120
 Like we usually don't even watch a movie in one go.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.800
 He just likes to get up and run around.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.200
 Or when we finish a movie and it's like

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.680
 if we watch the whole one, he gets up

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.720
 and he just goes back upstairs

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.960
 so it's running around in circles.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.960
 Like he literally like, "I'm not joking."

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.320
 We can hear him upstairs.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.000
 We hear the thump, thump, thump, thump, thump,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.160
 thump, thump, thump of like his steps

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.200
 all around the upstairs.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.280
 And he's just like running around

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.180
 'cause like that was way too long of sitting.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.160
 But his past Saturday, he got a bunch of Legos

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.040
 like throughout the past year.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.280
 And he was finally like, "I wanna do my Legos."

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.560
 Like, "Okay, that sounds good, dude."

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.400
 So he like starts before breakfast, then we eat breakfast,

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.720
 then he goes back to his Legos,

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.480
 then he like skips lunch practically

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.120
 'cause he was like so locked in.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.560
 He just did him the whole day.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.140
 And I was like, "Wow."

00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:20.980
 Dude.

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.320
 And then I was thinking, "He's just like me.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.160
 "I can't wait to get him into programming."

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.240
 (laughing)

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.800
 Except I have to trick him that it's cool and not lame

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.560
 is something that your dad does.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.040
 (laughing)

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.480
 - Yeah, like in hindsight.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.840
 So I remember when I was a kid, at some point,

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.000
 maybe I was like eight or nine.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.840
 - Yeah.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.080
 - I got super into assembling furniture

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.080
 'cause in my head it was just like a big Lego thing.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.640
 I remember like literally for years,

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.480
 whatever my parents got,

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.720
 I think I'd be the one to assemble it.

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.680
 And now I'm a hindsight.

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.440
 I'm like, "Man, my parents are so lucky.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.440
 "I hate doing this."

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.840
 I would kill to have a kid that's like demanding to do it.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:54.920
 - That's so funny.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.240
 And they were probably like, "Oh no, little dad,

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.760
 "you don't need to do it."

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.680
 - Yeah. (laughing)

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.280
 - Oh, mom and dad love to assemble the furniture.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.280
 You should let us do it.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.280
 - No, I got it, dad.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.920
 - Shut up. - I know.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.840
 - Yeah, I remember feeling like so lucky

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.800
 that I got to do it.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.680
 Man, I'm so stupid.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.640
 (laughing)

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.480
 - That's like I'm hoping there's like some outdoor chores

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.920
 that they feel that way about like pulling weeds.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.400
 Ooh, who can get the most weeds, you know, like?

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.480
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.520
 Do they have chores yet or be young too?

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.160
 - They do like some simple ones.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.240
 - Yeah, I mean, like my oldest is four, right?

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:35.000
 So it's like most of the like main chores you want to do.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.320
 We just have to do it again.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.320
 (laughing)

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.960
 - That's right. - It's after he's done.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.960
 - Yeah, it's more for training than actually getting anything done.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.120
 It's a good junior developer.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.600
 - Yeah, so he has like a bunch of like tasks

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.440
 that he's supposed to do.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.280
 And he does like school stuff and things like that.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.240
 But like in terms, and like they're,

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.600
 I guess they are like chores.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.400
 Like he has to do stuff with making his bed

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.240
 and how he does that and putting away his toys

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.080
 and everything.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.160
 Like, and like he helps sometimes with like laundry

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.800
 and stuff like that in terms of folding it.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.600
 But mostly it's like what am I going to do?

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.440
 Have you like wipe something down

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.560
 so we can wipe it down again?

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.400
 But now there's also crumbs on the floor.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.600
 Like, so it's also, I also see a lot of myself and him

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.400
 and I'm like, we can ask him to do that.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.640
 But I have a strong feeling it's not going to go anywhere.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.060
 (laughing)

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.680
 - That's funny.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.880
 - Yeah, but they like to help with a lot of stuff

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.480
 or like do, sometimes they like chop up veggies

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.600
 and stuff like that in the kitchen or things like that.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.880
 You get like the little kids,

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.360
 like the kids version of the knives

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.920
 that are like they're sharp enough to cut like a bean

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.080
 but not really going to cut your finger off, you know,

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:38.920
 like a green bean.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.840
 So yeah, so it's a, it's a mix we'll see probably

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.520
 like once he turns five and we're going to start doing,

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.880
 we've been doing like some homeschooling stuff with him

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.800
 but we'll probably go like a little bit, you know,

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.720
 like in more advanced each year for it.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.920
 I mean, I guess that's kind of the idea for doing school.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.960
 - It's cool. - Yeah, he'll probably,

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.880
 he'll gain a few new responsibilities as he goes older.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.960
 Right now though, it's like when I'm on the lawn,

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.440
 they want to come and push their bubble lawn mower with me.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.240
 So I'm like, okay, I mean, that kind of counts.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.080
 You know what I mean?

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.080
 Like, I'm not going to let you push the real lawn mower.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.800
 You can chop your foot off, you know what I mean?

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.680
 Like, so they just do their bubble mower with me outside

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.400
 or something like that, which is hilarious.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.440
 - Can you, can you read yet?

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.600
 - He can read some, not like he's not going to sit down

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.440
 and read like a whole book

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.240
 but he can sound out quite a few words right now.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.280
 He's like iterating on that for sure.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.920
 Probably like by when he turns five,

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.800
 like he'll be doing pretty good, yeah.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.000
 - Yeah, that's the reason I ask is like,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.400
 I'm into the idea of homeschooling,

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.360
 but then I had this like kind of rational fear that like,

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.280
 what if I'm, what if I do such a bad job

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.600
 of setting them up that they literally can't read?

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.440
 So I'm like--

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.520
 - That one will be pretty obvious.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.640
 Like that one is really easy to judge.

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.480
 Like, I don't remember.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.920
 - Prime got all the way to have roles he is.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.280
 - That's true, that's true.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.880
 But, you know, he at least, you know,

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.800
 give him a little bit of time.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.880
 He can sound it out, okay?

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.720
 Like he'll get there.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.680
 (laughing)

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.080
 That one I feel like that one's really,

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.320
 it'll be super obvious to you if it's like,

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:04.320
 if it's going like well or not in a lot of those directions.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.080
 It's also like, I mean, they don't really expect kids

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.320
 going into kindergarten to be reading already.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.360
 So like if he's reading, you know, you're like,

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.160
 it's fine.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.360
 I also, I always tell Kayleigh,

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.520
 like you don't have to be the world's best teacher for this.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.800
 Like just think of what the like average teachers--

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.360
 - Yeah, and I think about all the time.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.680
 Yeah, you know what I mean?

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.240
 No offense, but like I think you're crushing it.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.520
 (laughing)

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.640
 - Yeah, it's funny 'cause I think about like nowadays

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.040
 where I'm like, okay, I'm gonna go learn a new programming

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.840
 language, something that I like is really foreign.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.600
 Yeah, I've never learned before.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.840
 Like within a year, I'm probably gonna be pretty good at it.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.240
 And I'm like, I'm like used to things at most

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.240
 taking a year to learn.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.680
 And then I think about how it took me 12 years to learn math.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.880
 And I get that my brain had to literally grow,

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.040
 but I'm like, does it really have to take that many years?

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.960
 Like I learned so little

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.520
 compared to how fast other things go.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.360
 - Well, the thing that's crazy to like about

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.080
 just like the general structure of it is like,

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.720
 obviously some kids learn math faster than other kids.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.240
 Doesn't mean anything like besides that they learn math

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.440
 faster, like it's literally unrelated

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.920
 to pretty much anything else.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.680
 But it's crazy 'cause the system is set up that it's like,

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.800
 they can only be effectively like some offset

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.640
 from each other.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.360
 Like, oh, you're one grade ahead.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.640
 Like this is what happened to me, right?

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.240
 I was basically, you know, like started was,

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.520
 and then like started sixth grade.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.600
 And I was like in doing seventh or eighth grade, right?

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.960
 By the time I'm like in ninth grade,

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.040
 I was doing some other ones.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.800
 And then like before I graduated,

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.240
 I was doing some classes at like community college for it,

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.080
 right? - Yeah.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.360
 - But that was still like,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.080
 I was still just some offset from my peers.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:44.920
 That's crazy.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.800
 Clearly I learned math at a faster rate.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.680
 It should be going like this, right?

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.840
 Like any time you have a rate difference

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.520
 between people for something.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.200
 - Yeah, it adds up over the years.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.040
 - Yeah.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.560
 - And you're like, the whole thing.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.600
 So yeah, so that's the thing that I'm like most,

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.680
 probably like most excited for with them

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.320
 is finding out what their things are

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.680
 that they like really like learning

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.720
 that they're like fast at doing, right?

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.440
 And it's not like, oh, well,

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:14.320
 now you're just in geometry instead of algebra one.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.440
 And so you're one year ahead.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.320
 I mean, that's good. Like, I think it's better.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.320
 All things equal to have like some classes

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.040
 where you can go advance.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.200
 Apparently controversial take these days.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.400
 But it is kind of crazy because you're like,

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.200
 surely, like I could have been done with my math major

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.720
 by the time I graduated high school.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.800
 Like, 'cause I got one anyways when I was at Calvin,

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.840
 like for fun, like I just got one as like a side thing

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.800
 'cause I enjoyed math and I was like far.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.760
 But like, I could have been done.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.200
 And most of the time I spend like waiting around in class.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.040
 You know what I'm saying?

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.040
 - Yeah, it's crazy how much waiting in

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.840
 just doing nothing there was.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.080
 I think the school I went to,

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.000
 it's so roughly followed what you're describing,

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.400
 but I think they were pretty good about it

00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.400
 because when I was in ninth grade,

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.880
 I had a classmate that was already taking math classes

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.240
 at Princeton at that point.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.240
 - Oh nice, yeah.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.360
 - And he basically, by the time we graduated,

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.680
 he finished, he basically just needed to get,

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.520
 he ended up going to MIT and he finished his math degree

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.880
 like in his first semester at MIT.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.280
 And it did like a second thing.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.120
 So, I mean, he was one of those like freak of nature

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:24.960
 type of people.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.440
 Like he won some national math contest

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.120
 and got like a medal from George Bush.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.520
 Like, we're just kind of planning to be clear.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.360
 - That never happened to me to be clear stuff.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.280
 - So he had George Bush and math together,

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.080
 but that's a reward if you really get a math

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.720
 like George Bush, you have to meet George Bush.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.400
 If you want, you're like, "Hmm, okay."

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.240
 - Do you know what I did?

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.540
 - Fool me once.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.400
 (laughing)

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.400
 - Oh man, that quote is so good though.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.520
 Don't you miss that, like that era

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.640
 where like every couple of weeks

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.320
 we're just getting a banger like that.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.680
 - I mean, Trump's got some good ones.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.600
 My favorite one's recently from him.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.880
 I don't know if you saw this one, but it's so funny

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.680
 is he's in like the palace or whatever

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.960
 of like one of the, either like the Saudis

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.320
 or Connor or something like that I don't remember.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.760
 And they're taking pictures, right?

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.720
 It's like this huge palace, it's insane, right?

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.080
 And then you hear like the camp,

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.840
 I don't even know, I mean, Trump probably knows

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.680
 the cameras are on everything, the mics can still hear them,

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.880
 but all the cameras are far away,

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.400
 everything's walking away with them, it just goes.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.680
 - Nice house.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.920
 (laughing)

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:30.880
 - I'm just like this, that's so funny.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.720
 - Nice house.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.980
 (laughing)

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.400
 - Oh, like that's an all-time banger dude,

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.960
 that was so funny, like that's insane.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:45.000
 - I think the one that sticks out my head the most

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.320
 is that from the standpoint of water one.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.680
 (laughing)

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.840
 - I don't even know if I told that one.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.680
 (laughing)

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.640
 - I can't remember the exact quote,

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.880
 but it's like during one of those Puerto Rican hurricanes

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.480
 things, he's like, this is one of the wettest hurricanes

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.080
 from the standpoint of water.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.680
 - I'm from the standpoint of water.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.120
 (laughing)

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.400
 - Like how does his brain work this way?

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.400
 - Oh, that's like, that's like, you know dude,

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.280
 like what he says to me like, oh, he's just riffing.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.200
 That's insane.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.800
 - Like he thought of that, like 500 milliseconds

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.640
 before he said it.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.800
 (laughing)

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.160
 - You're like, if I'm president dude, I'm thinking,

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.200
 I don't know, do I really feel like I should be riffing

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.040
 all the time?

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.360
 I feel like I gotta be like a little bit more like,

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.560
 I'm gonna try and make sure I've got my message across.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.520
 I've only got five minutes of air time.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.960
 But it's like, that's so funny.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.440
 He's like, oh, he's just riffing on the idea completely

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.520
 is insane, like hurricanes.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.280
 It's just like, that's all he's got.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.280
 All he's got, right, he's got a big part.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.880
 - 'Cause it hurricanes water, there's a lot of water.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.880
 - There's a big part, they hold it up

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.200
 and it just says, it just says hurricanes, big.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.400
 And he goes, okay, I got it, give me five, boys.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.760
 (laughing)

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.520
 - Yeah, I was saying this the other day,

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.840
 I'm like jealous of people that have such a distinct way

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.800
 of talking that people can like,

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.800
 it's so distinct that people can do impressions.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.240
 I was thinking about this 'cause of all the Uncle Bob video

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.440
 she's been doing, I'm just like, how do you develop this?

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.400
 This is so crazy to be this like specific.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.360
 - That's true, in the bathroom.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.680
 It's been, he's been really keeping it up.

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:16.800
 I've been impressed.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.680
 - I haven't seen them for a week,

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.040
 but I think there's haven't come across my feet.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.520
 - I think he's been doing them just like on Mondays.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.880
 It seems like, 'cause it seems like I've been,

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.520
 I've been getting them only like once a week

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.360
 or something like that.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.360
 So I usually just like them and then don't watch,

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.760
 but I like I want this to show back up in my feet again.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.960
 - Dude, I love, I just love, I just love the thumbnails.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:40.040
 I love the thumbnail and morning bathrobe rant, dipes.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.560
 - And I'm like, yes, I don't know what he's saying,

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.400
 but I'm glad it's in the world, you know.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.280
 - I just wonder if he sounds like that

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.560
 in his normal day to day or if he's like, if it's--

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.640
 - He's playing it up, he's playing it up in that.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.560
 'Cause like we've talked to him, we did a long form.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.400
 - Oh, it's true, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.240
 - Or maybe two long form interviews with him.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:59.920
 I mean, he has like, it's definitely still him

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.600
 like in the, in the bathrobe rant,

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.720
 but he's definitely like playing it up

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.120
 like a little bit for that.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.440
 Like when he talks, he still has that like same kind

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.400
 of humor, it seems to me.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.240
 I mean, I've only talked to him for like two or three hours,

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.080
 you know what I mean?

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.280
 But he still has like that same kind of like joke

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:21.240
 and like when he's like impersonating like, you know,

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.400
 the opposition of something right or whatever,

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.480
 he's still like gonna do those same sort of tropes.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.360
 But yeah, I think it's a little played up for the bathroom.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.680
 I like, he knows, like he knows what he's doing.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:31.720
 Like it's funny, you know?

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:36.280
 - Me and Liz were rewatching the second Avengers movie,

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.120
 the one with Ultron.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.120
 I don't know if you've seen it, but-

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:39.400
 - Age of Ultron, that one?

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.560
 - Yeah.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.840
 - It's been a while, yeah.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.560
 I thought you were gonna say Pirates of the Caribbean,

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.400
 but that's fine too.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.400
 - Yeah, so we're going through that now.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.880
 - Yeah, yeah, tell him why though, Dax, tell him why.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.560
 - Okay, well, me and Liz have been rewatching Pirates of Caribbean

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:55.960
 'cause TJ has called me Dax Barrow several times.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.840
 - Dax Barrow.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.200
 - And I was like, you know, I haven't seen those movies

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.040
 in a really long time.

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.200
 I should have at least rewatching that.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.360
 - They're pretty good though, right?

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.960
 I mean, I feel like they're,

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.160
 they kind of is like one of those things where like,

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.400
 you look back and thought, oh, they're probably cheesy

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.240
 or lame or whatever.

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.520
 It's like, no, they're just earnest.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.360
 - No, it's so pretty good.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.840
 - It's pirate movies, like it's good.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.880
 - Yeah, well, also the,

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:21.280
 some of the technical stuff is actually pretty insane

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.160
 'cause we're watching the Davy Jones one now.

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.000
 - Oh yeah.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.960
 - And he looks great, like a CGI looks great,

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.400
 the acting and like the little mannerisms and takes on like,

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.480
 I can't believe this is like 15 years now.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.920
 - You want to know why?

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:36.000
 It's because they had physical things

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.080
 that they used for the props.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.360
 And because they didn't let stupid executives

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.480
 make all the decisions along the way

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.480
 and they had a vision for the movie, like cars.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.560
 Not just, I mean, the Pirates,

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.840
 but that's a whole category of movies

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:51.960
 I feel like they don't make anymore.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.960
 These like kind of adventure slash,

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.000
 there's like some kind of magic to it too.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.200
 Like like, like, do you remember the mummy movies?

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.200
 - Yeah.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.040
 - Yeah.

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.280
 So I feel like that category and movie like,

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.760
 I don't think they do anymore really.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.240
 - I feel like superhero movies kind of like took the slot.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.080
 - That's true.

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:08.920
 They kind of looked like that.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.280
 - But now Super Mario's are kind of out.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.720
 So maybe we're due for a Pirates resurgence.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.560
 You know what I mean?

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.800
 - Yeah.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.320
 - But they'll probably just make remake

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.240
 of the Pirates of the Caribbean three, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.320
 - Well, did you know there's like six of these movies?

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.640
 I've only ever seen three of them.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.480
 There's so many more than I thought.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.320
 - Wait, there's six?

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.160
 I knew there was three.

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.760
 - No, there's more than three.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.440
 I think it's either five or six.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.400
 There's a, so they already, they already milked it.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.560
 - You gotta know when it's time to stop guys.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.160
 That's the other thing that's part of the reason

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.640
 that the franchise I feel like it's not looked upon

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.200
 with the way that it should be,

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:43.960
 is you gotta cut, you gotta, you gotta be Barry Sanders.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.760
 You know, Barry Sanders, great Detroit lines running back,

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.880
 probably one of the all time greats, played for 10 years,

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.240
 saw that the lines were never gonna win a Super Bowl.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.400
 And so he said, I'm out and he retired.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:58.280
 And everyone thinks, he's the awesome, amazing running back.

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.440
 Yes, everyone needs to learn how to do that

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.320
 with TV shows and movies, because otherwise

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.840
 you get made fun of, you become Brett Favre.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.760
 Right? And it's like, Brevard used to be good,

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.360
 and now they're like, he's the Levi's guy.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.120
 He makes jeans commercials, right?

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.120
 - There's having a LeBron too.

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:11.960
 - Yeah, it is, it is.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.520
 He should have retired too.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:16.240
 - Liz was bringing this up where she's like,

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.000
 'cause with the whole Kanye thing, she was like,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:19.840
 oh, I think--

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.080
 - He's done with anti-Semitism.

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.480
 - I did see that, but like, do you remember that clip

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.240
 where he's like, I'm not gonna say what kind of doctor?

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.840
 - Yeah, yeah, of course.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.680
 Yeah, yeah, of course.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.560
 - And he says, like five, so I'm pretty sure

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.560
 it's gonna go like that.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.400
 - It's gonna come out again tomorrow.

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.840
 (laughing)

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.800
 - But she's like, this is why,

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.920
 maybe this is why celebrity should die young, because--

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.080
 - Dang, Liz.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.440
 - Kanye had died five or 10 years ago, you know?

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.280
 - All time great.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.560
 - Like, she would have been amazing, but now, you know,

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.560
 we gotta witness this.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:54.160
 - Right after he made my favorite albums of his,

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.000
 Jesus's King.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.280
 (laughing)

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.120
 Of course, like--

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.240
 (laughing)

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.840
 - Yeah, I mean, that would have been good timing, I think.

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:03.200
 That was like right before he got too crazy.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.520
 - Yeah, yeah, then he went,

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.920
 hung out with Joel Osteen too much.

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.600
 I won't make, I won't get too controversial here,

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.800
 but yeah, no.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.560
 - Is that literally true?

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.400
 - From an outsider looking in,

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.800
 it felt like-- - Was he like,

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.360
 involved with that whole thing?

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.280
 - Like, he was on stage with him once or twice, at least,

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.680
 like at his church and everything.

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.960
 It literally felt like Kanye was like,

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.560
 all right, I'm trying out Christianity.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.360
 So he Googles like, most popular Christians, right?

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:29.000
 And it's like, top hit, Joel Osteen.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.280
 And you're like, I'm the most popular,

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.640
 he's the most popular, we should probably like collab.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:34.480
 You know?

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.480
 And then he's like, this guy represents everything

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.840
 that's good and right about Christianity.

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.680
 And you're like,

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.120
 (laughing)

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:45.480
 So, yeah, that part was, that was a little devastating

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:49.240
 for those of us who were rooting for his Christian arc.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.840
 'Cause I'm not saved with Osteen and it was like,

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.200
 mm, that's the wrong crowd.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.600
 That's the kind of Copeland bunch

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:55.800
 and all these guys who are like,

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.400
 yeah, of course I have a private jet.

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.880
 How else am I supposed to fly around?

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.120
 - Okay, that guy, I show people

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.080
 that clip of him being interviewed all the time.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.760
 'Cause like-- - He's crazy, dude.

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:08.480
 - His face just looks so evil.

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.680
 And the way he talks, like I cannot believe it.

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.440
 - Like he literally looks demonic.

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:14.800
 It's like actually insane.

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:18.200
 You're like, this is so crazy

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.920
 that people send him money.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.680
 Like a lot of money. - I know, it's like so obvious.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.920
 Like you look at his face. - Yeah, when they could be buying

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.920
 coffee over SSH instead,

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.880
 like at least do something good with your money guys.

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.880
 (laughing)

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.520
 - Yeah, that clip where he's like saying,

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.120
 Tyler's a great guy.

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.480
 He made this jet so cheap for me that I had to buy it.

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.480
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.680
 (laughing)

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.000
 - Yeah. - Yes.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.920
 - But yeah, I think going out on top is,

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.760
 I think it's, I get it, it's hard 'cause

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.600
 by definition, on top is when you feel--

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.480
 - There's still a lot of area under the curve

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.920
 on the way down, you know, that you can still collect, right?

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.520
 So that's part of the difficulty.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.360
 Even if you see that you're all the way at the top, right?

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.640
 Like the down slope is not directly down to zero, right?

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.800
 You still have a lot of area-- - Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.800
 - Yeah. - To collect.

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.480
 Like you still have at least a few,

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.960
 like a few thousand cameo appearances you can make

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:08.800
 or something like that.

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.920
 (laughing)

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.640
 - I always go to cameo thinking like,

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.400
 oh, this is gonna be such a cool thing.

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.080
 I'm gonna think it's something funny to do with it.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.560
 And it's never, it's obviously never anyone cool because--

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.360
 - Right. - Like $200 for--

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.840
 - They're on premium cameo, which is like a talent agency

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:30.120
 that says someone wants $500,000 for you to go do this thing.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.360
 - I can't afford that one, so--

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:32.280
 - Right, yes, exactly.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.360
 But that's why I'm saying all those guys are all,

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.960
 they're all on, they have their talent agent

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.280
 that like manages that for them.

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.600
 They don't need cameo to get them random

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.560
 one off like funny things.

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.360
 But maybe new Airbnb experiences, Dax.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.960
 You can go hang out with Sabrina Carpenter, so, you know?

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.600
 - What is up with Prime always bringing up Sabrina Carpenter?

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.200
 - I think it was literally because he was like,

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.880
 she's really popular and I bet there's some songs

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.720
 that she doesn't have a lot of views on.

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.920
 So I wanna beat some of those with our music video.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.600
 It's like literally-- - But there was that,

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:05.320
 but then I see him bringing her up just in other--

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:09.360
 To me, it sounds like she's like the one celebrity he knows.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.440
 So he just like-- - Oh, you know what that goes to that?

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.880
 - That's probably true as well.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.600
 - It's probably 'cause she has the song Espresso.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.640
 And so he's like, he's trying to do subliminal messaging

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.120
 to trick people into thinking about coffee, right?

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.200
 So he's three steps ahead of us, right here.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.440
 He's 40 chessing us. - I see.

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.120
 He's actually doing something really smart.

00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.680
 - Yes, for once, exactly.

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.840
 Yes, so-- - Let's fake that.

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.800
 (laughing)

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.800
 - No, I think your hypothesis of he's like,

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:37.480
 I don't know any pop singer names.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:42.480
 Like if you asked him, prime name three relevant pop singers.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.920
 I think he would be like Sabrina Carpenter.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.240
 Like that.

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.080
 (laughing)

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.880
 This is probably what would happen.

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.840
 (laughing)

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.120
 I do think you're probably right about that one.

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:55.960
 I think you're probably right.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.240
 There's a good chance.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:00.600
 It's much more about, he doesn't have the vocabulary

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.800
 to express any other singers.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.080
 - It's funny 'cause I feel like teenagers like her

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.280
 or she's like big with much younger people.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.920
 So it's weird to hear him constantly talk about it.

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.960
 - It's probably as kids like the songs.

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:12.800
 - Oh, okay.

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.640
 That's how he's heard of this.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.640
 - That are like, you know, nearly teens, right?

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.640
 So they probably know the song

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.560
 to like, it's playing on Fortnite or something

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.560
 while he's playing with the kids or something, right?

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.720
 So--

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.520
 - It's just, I never hear him talk about music otherwise.

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.360
 - Yeah.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:27.960
 - So in my head, I'm like, oh,

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.920
 this is like the music prime listens to.

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:30.760
 Like he's into Sabrina Carpenter.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.760
 - No prime press listens to like random DJs on the internet

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.920
 and then codes to music.

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.200
 I don't think he listens to music and it's spare time.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.560
 (laughing)

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.800
 It's like exclusively a programming tool.

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.640
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.480
 That makes sense.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.320
 - I'll find out, I'll find out.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.440
 I'm gonna hang out with him next week

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:48.760
 and then we'll all sneak into his like Spotify

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.760
 and then I'll figure out what he's been listening to.

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.040
 - It's gonna be all Sabrina Carpenter,

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:53.040
 why we're just completely wrong now.

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.200
 He's actually a side-heart fan.

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.040
 - It's gonna be, it's gonna be nothing.

00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:00.040
 It's gonna be like A540 Hertz like Donald's brown noise.

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:05.800
 - I guarantee you, Adam's using those though.

00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:06.640
 - I was just thinking that.

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:07.480
 I was just thinking that.

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:09.560
 - Like there's no way, Adam's probably like,

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:14.020
 10 hour A440 Hertz like brown noise.

00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:16.400
 Oh, it's gonna be a good day, boys.

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.240
 (laughing)

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.080
 - It's a banger.

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.640
 - It's a banger.

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:20.460
 - Who's your favorite?

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:22.520
 Who's your A440 Hertz favorite artist?

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:25.840
 Like for me, personally, I'm a big fan of Mr. Brown,

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:26.640
 but what are you like?

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.640
 Oh really, Brown vintage, got it, nice.

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:29.480
 It's like.

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.200
 - Okay, you're saying this?

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.680
 Like you're making this joke, but I'm realizing that

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.280
 this is the exact conversation I heard him

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:37.520
 and being an halving.

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.360
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:39.480
 - And also it's like. - There was only talking

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.320
 like this.

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.400
 - What headphones do you use to listen to your brown noise?

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.840
 (laughing)

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.560
 - Oh, really?

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.400
 - Really?

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.800
 - Yeah, it's like judging each other based

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.640
 on their headphones usage for, oh, a Bose?

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.360
 Yeah, tell me you don't know anything about music

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.680
 without telling me anything about it.

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.040
 (laughing)

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.200
 - Oh man, that's a worse thing,

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.360
 'cause I think the Bose thing is funny,

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.560
 'cause I like the way they sound.

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.400
 - Yeah, me too.

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.640
 - And I like Bose speakers, but I know that it's like,

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.120
 people just are judging you immediately for it.

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.760
 - And audio files, but it feels like one of those things

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.880
 where you know it's like the best norming option,

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.120
 so that's what all of the like

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:17.400
 really professional people hate, right?

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.240
 You know what I'm saying?

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.080
 - Right, yeah.

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.000
 - Right, so they're like, oh, that's just normy.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.360
 I remember when I used to like Bose,

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.280
 that was before I really understood the underground audio scene.

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:29.760
 Mine are handcrafted by Bon Jovi himself, you know,

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.160
 or something like this, or whoever the guy is from Apple,

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.800
 you know, so I know his name's not Bon Jovi,

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.320
 but I can't even joke every time.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.560
 I was really hoping I was gonna trigger David with that,

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:40.840
 but. (laughs)

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.240
 - Yeah, I'm like, this one's probably hits home

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:47.120
 for me particularly, because I have these three speakers,

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.200
 and they're very good.

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.680
 They're really good. - Yeah, they're nice.

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.480
 - Like audio, yeah, you've seen them.

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:54.680
 But like, I go home to my parents' house,

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.640
 and they have these Bose speakers

00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:00.720
 surround sound that wall that they had for 20 years,

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.240
 and they sound better.

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.240
 They just sound better than whatever I have.

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.440
 - Yeah, maybe I like don't have all the extra 10,000 hours

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.000
 of equipment I need to make this thing sound good,

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.080
 but I'm just like, I should've just gone with it.

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.520
 - But that's like, no, it's not fair.

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:16.000
 Every time Adam brings his camera to somewhere,

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.160
 and he turns it on, even if it's the same iPhone,

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:22.120
 it's like, Adam uses the iPhone camera, I look really good.

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.200
 I use the iPhone camera, I look washed out.

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.400
 That doesn't make sense, there's not even settings.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.240
 There's not even setting.

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.680
 I can't even, you know, what's up with that?

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.040
 - It's just a light that he emits from his body.

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.560
 - Yes, that's true.

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:35.840
 - He's blowing. - He's being blowing, yeah.

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.680
 No, that's funny.

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.720
 - Okay, my mom's visiting,

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:39.960
 we gotta go pick her up from the airport,

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.520
 so there's probably pop-offs too.

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.360
 - Okay, that sounds good.

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.560
 I gotta get ready to talk to DHH.

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.360
 - Oh, yes, have fun with that.

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.200
 - I will.

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.880
 All right, bye Dax, bye tomorrow, fans, see you later.

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.640
 Hey, comment that you like me more than Adam.

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:52.480
 Thanks, bye.

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.960
 - That's probably gonna happen.

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:56.540
 (upbeat music)

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.140
 (upbeat music)
