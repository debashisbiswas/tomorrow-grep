WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 It's a great start, I'm just going to be working here while you're done that.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.920
 Okay, you can't hear me, cool, sounds good.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.640
 Oh, hang on, I commend my wrong speaker.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.440
 Casey, I'm so excited that we just did this at the beginning where we're like, can you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.440
 hear me?

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.440
 All right, so I'm miserable right now because it's allergy season and I, you know what,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.440
 give me a second, I need to go take my allergy meds, otherwise I'm going to go crazy.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.480
 Yeah, not only is it allergy season, so I'm allergic to tree pollen, but usually if I

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.600
 just take a pill every night before I go to sleep, I'm okay, but I've been kind of off

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.100
 of it.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.880
 So I don't feel good right now and on top of that, I sit down on my computer today after

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.320
 I rebooted it after an upgrade and everything's in light mode.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.320
 Oh no.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.320
 And it's like driving me nuts.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.440
 Like I can't tell what setting flipped or something updated and like whatever setting

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.480
 I was using isn't recognized.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.400
 So everything's really bright and it's like making my ice squint, which is like triggering

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.480
 my allergies even more.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.320
 So I was having like a miserable morning going crazy.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.320
 Oh man.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.880
 I think everyone can relate with like system, something's wrong with your system, but you

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.560
 don't like want to figure it out or can't figure it out quickly and you just got work

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.560
 to do.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.560
 Yeah, I'm usually okay with that.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 It's just the physical.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.680
 I'm like dealing with it with a physical sensitivity to life.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.680
 Yeah, exactly.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.680
 Yeah.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.680
 Well, that sucks.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.720
 I guess if you want me to talk the whole time, I can just talk.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.720
 You can just nod.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.720
 Yeah.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.640
 That might be better.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.640
 Might be better.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 Now it probably won't.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.000
 I do have a lot to say.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 I do.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 I just have lots of thoughts.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 I feel like this is a big week.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Do you think this is a big week?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.920
 I was thinking that yesterday I was like, Oh, we're never going to talk about tomorrow.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.840
 I struggle with this feeling of like, Am I a person that you can trust like I don't jump

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.840
 on high trains, right?

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.440
 I don't get like overly excited about stuff that I shouldn't do I am I a person that does

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.440
 that?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.280
 You are not a person that doesn't do that.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.640
 I think you're like, I mean, they're just spectrum.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.600
 I think you fall somewhere on it probably the same point that I do.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600
 I don't think.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.080
 Are you excited about stuff?

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.400
 I get excited about stuff, but I don't like I didn't do like the crypto thing.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.360
 I feel like I'm not just like some guy that's like riding every wave.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.360
 Yes.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.360
 Correct.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.360
 You're great.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.360
 Okay.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360
 Yeah.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.360
 I think this one's big.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.600
 I think I think things this week shifted for me like in terms of timelines in terms of

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.680
 like how our job is changing.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.680
 Yeah.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.680
 It was cloud code.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.000
 I mean, cloud code for me, I wasn't going to use cursor.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.280
 I know people have been using these kind of modalities with cursor for a while.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.280
 Yeah.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.480
 Just not going to do that.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.080
 Or maybe we talked about it, maybe I said I would try and I want to try and we talked

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.600
 about other editors that are doing the same thing, but cloud code is the thing you kind

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.000
 of said weeks ago, you were like, it just needs to interact with the file system.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 And that's what it does.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Yeah.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 And it's, it's pretty good.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.500
 What's your take on, you've used it for a bit now.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.040
 I heard you at the beginning, say it was good or you've used it more.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.040
 Do you use it all?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.040
 What are your thoughts?

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.040
 Yeah.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.600
 So it's funny because I don't, I still don't use it that much for code, not on purpose.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.080
 I think it's just like my habits haven't shifted.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.080
 Yeah.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.080
 That's the hard part.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.080
 Right.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.080
 Yeah.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.680
 And when I did try a few times, like I didn't get, I didn't, I didn't land somewhere good

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.680
 with it.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.680
 Right. But that's not really, it's fault.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.920
 It's just a mix of understanding what type of things you go to it for, what type of things

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.400
 you get a sense of like, oh, it's probably just going to get stuck in a loop.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.240
 But obviously the stuff I've been posting about, I've been using it a lot as a client

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.760
 for, um, you know, like all my tools that I would run, which is interesting does, does

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.840
 a given MCP client really matter, like does which MCP client you use this cloud code versus

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.880
 using like cloud desktop, give you any advantages when you're doing the stuff you're doing and

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.440
 maybe tell the audience what you're doing.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.440
 Yes.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.440
 And I don't understand why.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.440
 Okay.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.920
 So obviously this week, I was talking about MCP servers and there's just been these giant

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.920
 threads.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.320
 You mean this last 24 hours?

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.240
 It just like for some reason everyone on Twitter decided that they care about this and it's

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.240
 so weird.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.240
 I figured it out though.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.240
 I figured it out.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.760
 I figured out why this happened this week because it was very confusing for me at first

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.200
 because I was like, I'd heard about MCP for a while, I understood it for a while.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.200
 I knew it was for a while.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.400
 It's like two months ago, right?

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.040
 You sent me the first, when they first announced it, you sent it to me because we were doing

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040
 some stuff.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.240
 I mean, this has been around for.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.240
 It's not brand new.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.240
 Yeah.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.560
 But then for me personally, I was like, I don't use anything that is a client.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.440
 So as much as I'd like to use this stuff, I personally cannot exist and fit to my workflow.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.200
 Then cloud code came out and that unblocked me.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.360
 And that's when I started really looking to it.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.880
 And everyone seemed to and I was just like, there's no way that everybody was waiting

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.880
 for cloud code.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.920
 Like, I know all of you are using cursor, but it turns out that cursor updated their

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:26.000
 MCP support January 23rd to like actually make it like more full featured and like visible.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.240
 And I guess it takes like a roughly a month for people to update.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.320
 And probably the past couple of weeks, everyone might got the update and like saw it and started

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.320
 to set that stuff up.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.520
 So I think it just blew up this week because it got updated in cursor.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.120
 I don't mind the just like, I mean, it's like it is a natural phenomenon that you can't

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.160
 resist that like, sometimes stuff just catches fire and everything you see on your timeline

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.160
 is about that thing.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.160
 Yeah.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160
 That doesn't bother me.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.080
 The only thing that bothers me is the people who like suddenly like have like tutorials

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.720
 or answers and they're not like associated with this stuff at all, like they just ride

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.000
 every trend, I guess.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 They just they need to like.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 So annoying.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.080
 It's like a four thought leader and it's so weird.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.440
 It's always phrased the same way.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.960
 It's like people have been asking me about MCP.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.800
 So who the fuck is asking you literally who in the world has asked you a single question

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.360
 about anything in your whole life, like go up to one person in person and ask them if

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.200
 they have heard about MCP and they will say no, it is on Twitter.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.520
 So okay, you got some Twitter DMS.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.520
 I don't believe.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.520
 Not even.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.520
 Not even.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.520
 Yeah.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.520
 No one is fucking asking you anything.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.520
 You're like, you're not the person anyone goes to when they have a question.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.520
 Okay.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.520
 So yeah.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.800
 So the reason this bothers me is because, well, one at a base level, they actually confuse

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.960
 things more.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.960
 It's so simple.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.040
 They're just plugins for cloud.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.480
 Like it's that's all there is.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480
 There's no like.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.480
 Thank you.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.480
 It's plugins.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.480
 Yes.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.800
 There's no like deep philosophical game changing architectural things.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.800
 It's everything.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.800
 It's absolutely.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.240
 So they inflate it and they also make it so I actually have stuff I want to ask people

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.040
 about and talk about, but like I just don't want to.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.040
 Now I'm like adding to that.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.040
 Yeah.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.040
 You don't want to be associated with.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.040
 Uh huh.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.040
 Yeah.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.040
 Yeah.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.040
 Yeah.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.000
 So just like God damn every time it's like the other side of Twitter that we don't normally

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.040
 see, but it's always people with like a hundred thousand followers and we're just like, who

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.040
 are you?

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.920
 Like why do you have more followers than like the biggest open source people in like the

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920
 real world?

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.680
 So it's just just like that world is like intersecting right now and it's it's very annoying.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.520
 It's very annoying and it's annoying because you see both ends of it like it's the people

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.360
 who have no clue and they're just like, what is this?

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.720
 And then there's the people who have the big extra opinions.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.340
 Then there's the people who are like way too hot right now.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.880
 People are talking about this way too much.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.000
 Somebody like, we need to bring it back down to earth and then it's like the people who

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.280
 are the naysayers and they're like, this is stupid, it doesn't even work.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.120
 Just the whole spectrum of it is so annoying to me, but I don't remember it being like

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.920
 this with something else like this was the most like in one day take over Twitter I've

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.920
 ever seen.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.920
 Yeah.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.920
 It was mind blowing.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.920
 Is that what the future holds for us?

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.240
 I feel like that's not because of MCP it's just because of like us and social media and

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.880
 the feedback loop and we are we are being trained by these things.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.880
 Yeah.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880
 It's so scary.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.320
 That's how it feels like any kind of cycle that in any part of the world anywhere where

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.280
 there's been like a cycle that you're familiar with, it feels like that cycle is way more

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.280
 rapid.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.520
 It's like way it just compresses more and more and more and more and to the point where

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.200
 like we're seeing the full cycle happen within 24 hours where previously would have taken

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.200
 like a couple of weeks.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200
 Don't love it.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.200
 If I'm being honest.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.200
 I know.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:35.440
 It's a it's it's weird, but going back to it, so cloud code unblocked me, which made

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:43.480
 me realize like, Oh, this idea of being able to like create tools that you can just have

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:50.560
 cloud code compose by the way, I think this is the part that's not super obvious.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.560
 It is really good at composing stuff together.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:59.400
 If you give it three tools, it knows how to like run a then see them be three times and

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.400
 go back to it.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.160
 Like it can really compose stuff well.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.760
 So that's a part that I think is easy to underestimate.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.280
 That's the magic and the tools themselves are just stupid.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.840
 They're just like little, little functions to call.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:15.640
 So yeah, my my exploration this past week has been, how do we make it really easy to

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:22.160
 expose internal functions we wrote for our code base through this system so we can do

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.920
 like all the operations operation stuff and we've yeah, we put together a bunch of fun

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.960
 demos stuff that I've actually used already.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.640
 Like I handled some support cases through a little stripe tool.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.640
 Mm hmm.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.640
 I love this.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.640
 Yeah.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.920
 And the alternative before was like way more complicated.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.720
 So I'm more I'm more using the tool calling stuff.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.320
 And that's already like massive for me.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.600
 I'm not using the code stuff as much.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.080
 So I'm trying to lean into the code stuff.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.440
 I'm just trying to like see what it's good at what it's bad at.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:59.360
 I've got like two really mature, not mature, but like code bases that are legacy.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.600
 They're not like green field projects where I'm building a new game and cursor or whatever.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.800
 This is like real actual repos.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.600
 And I don't I don't know where I stand yet.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.680
 Like I don't know what parts are the limitations of the model like cloud three seven and what

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.080
 parts are fundamental limitations with the approach.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.240
 I think what you said about composing tools together.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.320
 If you think of like the internal tools, the internal capabilities that they've built as

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.240
 like their own MCP servers or whatever, it's ability to like find stuff across the code

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.680
 base and kind of string together a plan seems pretty good.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.960
 Like it gets rid of the whole context window problems of like everything having to fit

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.960
 into context.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.240
 It seems I don't know what the mechanism I don't know how it's actually keeping track

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.880
 of its plan and then executing the individual tasks.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.040
 But it seems pretty good at that part.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:57.160
 It's just the actual writing the files that like it's still limited by the actual model

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:03.060
 like three seven just doesn't seem to always make great choices in terms of like actually

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.060
 writing the code.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.680
 But it comes up with pretty good plans and it seems to go through like it can run your

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.640
 tests that can figure out, you know, and work through eventually with like a working test.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.440
 It can work through stuff pretty well.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.480
 I'm impressed with that part of it, the agent side of it, I guess, where it's bringing stuff

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.480
 together.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.720
 It's really cool to see it like run all these bash commands and scripts to accomplish things.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720
 Yeah, it's clever.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.720
 It's clever.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.320
 Like if it hits a roadblock, it'll like find a workaround.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:34.560
 So the demo I was doing yesterday was having it operate the terminal API, but I was running

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.240
 it inside the terminal code base.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.400
 And when I initially saw the tool, I messed it up like I implemented it wrong.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.680
 So it ran into one error, because I said like, okay, get me one of those products from the

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.840
 terminal.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.840
 It tried to do it.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.840
 It got an error.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.880
 And then it was like bucket, I'm just going to query the DB and give you the answer.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.680
 So it just went around and gave you the answer.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.280
 And the other thing that was cool was again, when I was implementing a tool, I implemented

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.280
 it wrong.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.280
 So I had it.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.040
 I was like, okay, use this tool to do whatever it failed.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.320
 Then it went and read the file.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.760
 The tool was in and was like, oh, here's the mistake and it like fixed the tool and then

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.680
 read, which was pretty, pretty wild to see.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.680
 Yeah.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.120
 One of my favorite things that's done so far is it's the kind of stuff that I just, I get

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.880
 so bogged down and will not push through on.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:26.040
 It actually like dives in to dependency code and node modules to figure out how a dependency

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:32.560
 works to then ultimately write the code I'm writing to interact with this dependency.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.960
 Like it watching it do that and watching it traverse into node modules and figure stuff

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.840
 out that I knew there had to be answers, I'd gone on to GitHub, I'd looked through some

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.720
 of the code, I'd looked through issues, open issues, and I never found like an answer to

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.320
 my problem and it figured it out by just inspecting node modules.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.520
 So that's pretty cool stuff like, yeah, that saves you a lot of time.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.520
 Yeah.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.240
 I don't know, like, will the next model is cloud four?

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.120
 When is the model where like, I feel good about the code it writes because I don't always

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.120
 feel good.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.120
 Yeah.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.120
 I don't, I don't know.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.920
 I'm still not super, I'm not banking on the raw power getting that much better.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.200
 I think, and this is the, these are observations that I've seen people make for a while.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:18.360
 They were like, based on the current capabilities of the model, it's actually like, you know,

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:24.120
 one or two years ago, people were saying, um, we actually already have a lot of capability.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.880
 It's just not being like put together in the right package and even if the base model doesn't

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.280
 get better, like we're going to see, you're still going to be able to have like much better

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.280
 outcomes.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.440
 And that's kind of where we are now.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.440
 Okay.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:41.240
 So if we run these things in a loop and have all these tricks that it can do, it effectively

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.060
 makes this base model a lot more useful.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.060
 But yeah, I don't know.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.720
 I don't know how much more we can get from the base model.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.720
 Okay.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.760
 This plan, I think we're like hitting the ceiling of what we can get from this model.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.400
 And I also don't know if it's going to get that much better.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.160
 I think some of the interesting things that I learned this past week was if you look at

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.240
 the approach of how I was writing these tools in the beginning of the week versus the end,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.240
 it's radically different.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:12.200
 So the first thing I went to do was like, I would love to have Claude code be able to

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.600
 operate my AWS accounts, I'm going to ask it like, Hey, that last ECS deployment, like

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.520
 did something go wrong or like, you know, clear out all the files in the ZS3 bucket.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:29.160
 So I went and like pulled the JSON spec for the AWS API, built like all these different

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:35.600
 tools that like, let's Claude query that spec, and then, you know, understand what operations

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.160
 it has, then let's Claude like learn how to build the input for that.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:44.400
 Like I did like a really complex thing to eventually make a fetch call to the API.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:49.520
 And that's how I started then I realized like, man, these tools can just be really sloppy

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.360
 and dumb because it can just like handle anything.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:15:00.680
 So with the, so yesterday, Frank did another demo where he does glob imports, like the

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.240
 whole AWS SDK V2.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:09.280
 And then the tool just takes the service name, the function call, and then like arguments,

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.280
 like three things.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.240
 And Claude already knows it was a TV to it knows what services that there are and knows

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.760
 like what functions there are.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.640
 And we just like dynamically call the function and there's like no structure to it.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:26.040
 There's like this is like a five line tool, maybe, and it effectively drives it well.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.440
 And I'd say something with the stripe API, I did where I was like, first I was like, oh,

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:36.040
 I need to import the stripe SDK and expose each, each, each like method as a tool.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.760
 No, I just, I just ask it for a path and I need to be a method and a body.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.440
 And I just send that to a stripe API.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.960
 And yeah, it gets it right when it gets it wrong.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.600
 It can, as long as the error messages coming back are reasonable, it can kind of be wrong.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.600
 Yeah.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.640
 Like it, it sent a date for something that it was, it sent like the date timestamp in

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.600
 the wrong format, got back the error, realized, fix it.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.600
 Yeah.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.000
 So yeah, just, just like the composable, like that whole like loop is so much better than

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.320
 I think people realize it is.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.960
 Yeah, no, it's, it's exciting.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:15.400
 It's, I know people complain that it's expensive, but I love the idea of like starting a thing,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.680
 giving it permission to do whatever it wants and then going and eating my breakfast and

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.200
 knowing like, I'm kind of still getting stuff done right now, like it may not end up sticking.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.600
 I may have to go back and, you know, correct it or whatever, but like something's happening

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.200
 and before nothing was happening, because I was making breakfast.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.200
 Yeah.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.200
 Yeah.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.200
 Yeah.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:40.040
 For the coding thing, I think, you know, the price is a question, but for the stuff I'm

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.040
 using it for, it's really stupid.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:47.600
 Honestly, I bet like a much dumber model could do all the same stuff that I'm asking it to

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.320
 do because it's just converting these two calls together.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.080
 And I bet it could be super fast because right now it's kind of slow.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:02.480
 Like 95% of the time is it doing AI stuff and then 5% time is like waiting for the responses

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.640
 from the call it's making.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.640
 Yeah.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.800
 So I think a little bit like 20 times faster.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800
 Yeah.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800
 Yeah.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.560
 And I want to see like a version of this with like a dumber model that's optimized to be

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.040
 cheap and really fast, and you can get like pretty insane results.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.040
 Yeah.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.080
 I guess I just saw somebody say the other day that like the bigger the models are getting,

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.080
 the slower they're getting.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.080
 That's inherent.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:29.040
 So that would suck because I think for like things like coding, you do need the big powerful

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.520
 models.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.800
 The cost thing, I don't, I don't think about it at all mostly because I guess I've hired

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.960
 engineers like as a startup founder.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.960
 Yeah.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.960
 Yeah.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.960
 Yeah.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.960
 Relative to what it's doing, it's like a fraction.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.960
 Yeah.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.960
 Things just get cheaper.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.960
 That's what they do.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.960
 Yeah.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.960
 The models have all gotten cheaper over time.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.840
 So this is as bad as my B I would think.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.840
 Yeah.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.680
 Or the models just get a lot better and then it's worth it, but then maybe they're more

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.680
 expensive.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.480
 But yeah, the cost thing, I don't, I haven't really cared and I see people like outright

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.960
 dismissing it because of the cost.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.360
 And I don't know, maybe their experience is something I'm not experiencing, but I know

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.560
 some people like have five pains going and they're using get work tree to like have different

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.080
 branches checked out and they're doing work simultaneously.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.440
 Maybe you could rack up some pretty big bills that way, I guess.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.120
 But yeah, I've only, I mean, I've been doing like a lot of heavy testing.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.320
 This is, I'm working with this stuff and I only spent 25 bucks to like get to the point

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.560
 where I launched something.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.120
 And then yeah, like, you know, I guess I'm not using it for coding.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.120
 I'm sure like goes in longer loops there.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.120
 Yeah.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.240
 I want to get anecdotal on the coding thing real quick because I do hate when people just

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.760
 praise or shoot down something and then there's no examples.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.000
 So I've had like one impressive thing.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.280
 The first thing I had it do really in terms of coding across the stat news code base,

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.520
 which is giant.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.160
 I mean, it's a huge consumer app.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.200
 I mean, consumer code base, whatever.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.360
 It's a huge app.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.360
 It's a huge thing.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.360
 It's big.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.360
 There's lots of code.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.560
 There's lots of files and it made a change to fit.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.520
 It was just a bug fix, but it made a change across three files that were very spread out

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.120
 and it figured out like what it had to do.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.120
 And it was perfect.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.720
 Like I didn't have changed anything, pushed it.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.160
 I mean, tested and everything was good.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.160
 So that was very impressive.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.880
 And I was like, we're going to the moon, everybody.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.560
 This is incredible.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:19.560
 But then like on the downside, there was a case where I wrote like one file and I needed

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.560
 like 20 files like it.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.320
 It's a test file across like testing one resource in an API.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.920
 And then I need to like repeat that.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.360
 Like I wrote it manually.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.480
 I need to now do this for every resource in the API and it literally can't follow my

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.400
 venture, it cannot just do what I did, but apply it, like it will not just follow the

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.400
 pattern.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.400
 It's doing new things.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400
 It's doing its own thing.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.360
 I think all that stuff chocks up to like cloud three seven is being dumb.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:50.280
 And I know a lot of people on Twitter say cloud three sevens dumb or over fit or whatever.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.280
 It's really frustrating.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.000
 Like I feel like that should be a thing that I'll just nail like here's a pattern.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.480
 Now apply it to these other things.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.000
 I just can't get it to do it.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.560
 So I'm writing it manually and that sucks.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.080
 Okay, so I didn't know that people were saying cloud three seven is dumb.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:07.800
 But now that you've said that, I have had a bunch of situations where I'm like, I was

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:13.160
 kind of surprised that like I gave it work that seemed like LM work and it was getting

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.360
 confused.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.360
 Is it worse?

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.800
 Because I saw someone posted more in three five is still better than three seven.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.800
 I was like, I've seen that sentiment as well.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.800
 I don't know.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.560
 I could, I think in cloud code, you can change the model.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.280
 Maybe I could change back to three five and see how it does.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.880
 Maybe with this specific task, it'd be great if something could just pair it.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.840
 It would save me hours and that would be great.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.800
 The other interesting thing is, isn't it funny to contrast the approach of anthropic and

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.800
 open AI?

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.240
 They're like going towards the same goal, but these companies could not feel like any

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240
 more different.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.240
 Any different?

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.240
 Yeah.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.240
 Yeah.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.240
 Yeah.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.240
 Could you explain the open AI approach?

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.240
 Because I just can't, I just can't even listen to them.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.240
 Talk.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.440
 Open AI's approach is so like head in the clouds.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:59.520
 It's like we don't even care about doing anything useful in the near term because our

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:04.280
 goals are so like years out and like there's no point wasting time in the short term thing

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.640
 because we're going to do this much bigger thing, which I don't think is wrong.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.040
 But it can be wrong if you've thought about that concept so much that you're now like

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.040
 doing it on purpose.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.040
 You know what I mean?

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.960
 I feel like there's like everyone knows you got to aim big.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.560
 But because you know you have to aim big, you kind of like do it in an artificial way.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.880
 You know, like kind of points here.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.560
 So that's the thing I get from open AI where it just feels like how much are they just

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.000
 like feeding this narrative, but like not actually doing anything and I can see them

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 like not do it.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 And then on the other hand, like anthropic feels the opposite where they're just like

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.800
 building very useful incremental things.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.920
 They're like, oh, here's a problem you ran into.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.920
 Here's a fix for it.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.920
 Okay.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.920
 We can make this.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.920
 Not code.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.640
 It's like they built this for them and that they're using it.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.640
 It has that feel.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.340
 And then they're also like integrated in, I think cursors main partner, I think is

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.340
 anthropic.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:07.880
 If I understand that correctly, so like again, very practical consumer of this stuff and

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.360
 like trying to solve like really practical problems, like just solving just the next

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.360
 incremental thing.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.680
 I know the way I'm saying it, it makes it sound like obviously the anthropic approach

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.680
 is always better.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.280
 I actually think it can go either way.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.800
 Like you can just go this incremental approach and then someone just lands something that

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.200
 just obsolete's everything you've been doing.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:32.880
 I see that happen, but in this case right now, it feels like their approach makes a

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.440
 lot more sense, especially in such a like frothy market.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:42.520
 Their CEO and every talks, he seems like really low key, you're not like, yeah, like

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.280
 definitely a lot more like.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.600
 The whole man, I cannot stand Sam, I can't stand Sam.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:53.480
 I can't stand him more like every time I look at him now, it's worse and worse all the time.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480
 I just that guy.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.480
 Okay.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.320
 I have a question about this.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.880
 I think he has a bunch of plastic surgery, I think.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.880
 Oh, really?

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.880
 And I'm one of these.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.880
 Maybe that's what it is.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.880
 That's part of what's feeding is.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.720
 Is it his face that's bothering me because something about him is bothering me.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.760
 I mean, it's also his personality and the things he says, so so Liz has this funny thing where

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.680
 she's like, sometimes we intellectualize situations so much.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.240
 And all that's going on is we think someone's ugly.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:25.680
 There's this whole thing with, and she points out like Lena Dunham, who's like this, he created

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:30.000
 this show called Girls, definitely a really kind of like outside of the way she looks.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.040
 She's like, there's reasons people find her annoying or controversial or whatever, but

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.480
 she was just like the subject of endless like people just talking about how much they hate

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.480
 it.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.520
 She's like intellectualizing on top of it, but she's just like kind of ugly, so she's

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.520
 pretty ugly to look at.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.080
 And she's always like, all that's going on here was that she's ugly.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.080
 And that's it.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:54.080
 And if she wasn't ugly, I don't think this like this conversation around her would have

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.080
 inflated that much.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.080
 It's interesting.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:02.160
 Like Sam's face to me looks like I want to punch it, like it's just one of those punchable

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.160
 faces.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.040
 See, I thought that was because of the things he says, but maybe it's not, maybe it's just

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.040
 his face.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.760
 But this brings me to another point.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:17.400
 I am very convinced that there is something with the way people look and their personalities.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.760
 And I can't unsee it, right?

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.920
 Like sometimes you see someone, like you see a random picture of someone and they looked

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:29.360
 like a really nice person and it's impossible to imagine that they're ever like a huge asshole,

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.360
 right?

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.360
 Like they have a nice sweet face, like whatever that means.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.240
 And I'm just like that never happened.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.240
 That literally never happens.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.440
 I never see someone that looks nice and it turns out they're like, they have like a mean

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.440
 aggressive personality.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.960
 Like I just don't see it doesn't happen.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:50.120
 It's like temperament actually shapes your appearance in some way like over time or like

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.120
 manifest.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.960
 And then like, and I feel like you, this has to be a thing because some actors get type

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:02.800
 cast in like mean roles or like childish roles or there's like something, something to it.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.560
 The flip side is like obviously actors that play evil people because they look evil usually

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.120
 are like nice in real life.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.120
 Yeah.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.120
 Right.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.720
 There's some, there's, I feel there's, it's not like totally zero.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.280
 There's like something, there's something there.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.280
 There's something there.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.280
 Huh.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.040
 So Sam looks like a sneaky annoying motherfucker.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.040
 Because he is.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.040
 Yeah.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.960
 And just feeds and it shapes his face and the shape and the world treats him a certain way

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.400
 and that like makes him more a certain way, you know, I feel like there's a little feedback

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.400
 loop.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.400
 Yeah.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.400
 Do people, other people that like him?

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.800
 I don't know how he even like likes himself after the Congress thing, like after the Congressional

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.960
 hearing where he was like, I just do it because I love it, like, I don't have any stock.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.960
 I don't remember.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.000
 And then like all the things he's done since then, like, how can anybody like this guy?

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 How does he sleep at night?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.320
 I just like, does he ever wake up and just be like, I am the absolute like worst version

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.720
 of Silicon Valley CEO, founder guy.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.480
 And was it worth it?

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.480
 Like, I don't know.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:05.240
 Because there's just legions of people that like him, quote unquote, cause their incentivize

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.240
 a suck up to him.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:11.800
 And I feel you're surrounded by people like that to get a sense of how annoying you seem.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.320
 But again, it's, at the end of the day, it might just be arbitrary.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.360
 It might just stem from the fact that he looks a certain way and he doesn't control that.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.360
 Maybe.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.360
 That's true.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:24.040
 Like you're saying, maybe he is an awful, scammy person because of his appearance.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.040
 He doesn't even know.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.440
 Well, treated him like he was and he became, you know, it's like the Zootopia thing.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.440
 Okay.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:35.040
 Well, I do have this thing where I exonerate everybody.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.480
 Something I'm learning about myself, like no matter what you do, I just assume it's part

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.880
 of your story, your circumstances led to that.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.720
 There's nothing you could do about it.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.720
 What is that?

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.240
 That's like a, that's probably like a spiritual belief.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.240
 It's like materialist or something like where you just think everything in the universe

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.640
 is just a product of Adams banging around and doing stuff.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.640
 I don't know.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.640
 Can I even know what I'm saying?

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.640
 I don't know what I'm saying.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.640
 Yeah.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.640
 I mean, that's, that's, I think I believe that too.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.040
 Like everything is just, I don't believe in free will.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.040
 I don't believe in.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.040
 Oh, really?

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.660
 See, I always backtrack when I like explain that I just don't view people as like bad

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.360
 because like they just do things based on how they were raised or how they were whatever.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.160
 And then people like, well, do you believe in free will?

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.160
 I'm like, of course.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.160
 Yeah.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.160
 So no, I do believe in free will.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.160
 So could you explain?

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.640
 You're just leaning hard into no free will.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:28.040
 So I think my position on this is it's not an interesting question in that I don't believe

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.040
 else.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:34.840
 I don't believe in free will, but I do believe that our brains cannot comprehend the concept

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.040
 of no free will.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:43.520
 Oh, you saw the builder society around assuming people have it like at a technical level,

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:50.560
 like, yeah, because a meteor was like one centimeter off from where it would have been

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.840
 otherwise, that's the reason that I have a beard, like, I think things change together

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.840
 like that.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:57.840
 And like my personalities like that.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.840
 And all that stuff.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.840
 Yeah.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.480
 And I don't literally control all that.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.480
 And I think everything is just I need to put it another way.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:09.120
 I think if you knew all the rules of physics and you knew the start point, what things

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.920
 looked like at a certain point, you would know what where things are at any future function.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.840
 It's just a pure function and you make the whole state of the universe and you put it

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.560
 in the function and you get the next state.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:26.160
 I think that's like a reasonable thing to say and like be like, yeah, that is how the

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:31.920
 universe works simultaneously, like practically we had the illusion of free will.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.480
 So we can't really see it that way day to day.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.480
 Yeah.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.960
 It feels like free will.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.400
 It feels like I do something right now that you couldn't there couldn't have been predicted.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.400
 Yep, exactly.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.000
 And so like at the end of the day, we do simultaneously sometimes I think about like I'm kind of like

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.560
 you where I I wouldn't say fully exonerate.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.920
 I think I just hold two things together.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:29:01.680
 Like I'm always like, yes, there is for this person, there was no avoiding the situation.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.920
 They couldn't have been a better person.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.600
 They couldn't have been whatever it wasn't like in their control simultaneously.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:12.440
 Like I still think they there's there's consequences that need to happen, but I will temper how

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.520
 intense I am about that, right?

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.520
 Yeah.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.880
 I'm realizing I'm breaking my own rule because I don't I always thought I've viewed everyone

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.240
 like this, but I don't.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:26.080
 I view like dumb people this way, like if they're dumb, like a dumb person who just kills someone

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:31.080
 because they need to, I don't know, feed their family.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.680
 That person I exonerate and I'm like, they couldn't help it.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.400
 That's just the environment they were in and the circumstances are rendered.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.160
 But someone like Sam Altman, I'm like, nope, that guy, he could have fixed it.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.840
 He could have not been such an asshole.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.480
 But yeah, but like what made him, you know, maybe it was just his face.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.480
 He could have just been face.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.480
 Yeah.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.480
 I don't know.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.320
 I mean, even like intelligence to me, it's just something that you're birth with.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.160
 So and I didn't really control that.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.800
 So yeah, no, it's true.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.240
 Everything just feels out of my control, but at the same time, you know, I'm not like

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.640
 forgive everyone for everything and no rules.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.640
 Yeah.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.640
 Yeah.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.640
 And I'm not saying that either.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.640
 I guess.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.640
 Yeah.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.440
 I'd say people like will cast what I'm saying in that to that extreme.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.440
 Yeah.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.440
 Yeah.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.040
 Like nobody's guilty of anything because we're all just a product of the giant universe

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:18.560
 function churning out new states, like a react component.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.560
 Yeah.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.560
 Exactly.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:26.520
 I do hate that like my brain goes to react when I think of like functions modify, like

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.160
 bring something from state.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.160
 Yeah.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.160
 I hate that.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.160
 But they introduce me to it.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.480
 And the worst part is, uh, is it even a pure function is what?

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.480
 Oh, the universe?

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.480
 No, it's really.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.480
 Oh, man.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.480
 It's funny.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.480
 I don't even like.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:48.200
 You know, when I was saying I had like react brain, it took me a while to switch to solid.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.360
 I implement for open auth.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.880
 I implemented like a really good auth context for solid with like multi account support,

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.120
 like switching all that stuff.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.680
 And I'm like, okay, I got to port this to react.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.160
 I'm just like, I have no idea how to do this.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.320
 Like I just don't understand it anymore starting over with react.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.320
 Yeah.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.560
 I'm going to jump into an L M and have it, have it do it, but it's very good at react.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:16.680
 I would think speaking of, I mean, we brought this up a bunch before, but I got to bring

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.680
 it up again.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.840
 Uh, so you were asking like the MCP clients, like, is there any, doesn't matter which one

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.840
 you use?

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.560
 I actually found that cloud code is better than cloud desktop, even outside of code, you

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.440
 think just this tool calling thing.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.120
 I was getting better results in cloud codes.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:34.320
 I don't know exactly what the details there are now that I think, now that I think about

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.800
 it.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:42.280
 These cloud desktop even, does it have the ability to do the whole agent chaining stuff?

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.720
 Isn't it just like every other chat app where you just send it a prompt and it gives you

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.720
 a response?

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:51.480
 No, I think I saw something about like 3.7 reasoning in it.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.480
 Okay.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.480
 I got it.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.120
 Look, I've just been kind of in a whirlwind this week.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.120
 Yeah.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:01.440
 So I remember I was asking cloud that I attached some AWS tool and I was like, oh, like, you

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:06.940
 know, how much traffic did I get to this end point in the past week?

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.940
 And okay.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:08.940
 It calls a tool.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:09.940
 Get the data back.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.940
 Awesome.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:11.940
 Okay.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:17.040
 Now it starts to build a react app with hard coded data.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.440
 So I'm going to run for a chart.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.840
 Oh, I'm worried.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.840
 Okay.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.320
 This is technically kind of smart because now you have like an unlimited, you have unlimited

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:31.420
 ability to build any UI effectively for whatever the best way that to show this information.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.420
 Mm hmm.

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:37.640
 But man, does that seem like stuff's like a blunt hammer.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.640
 Yeah.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.680
 I think that's what I've heard people saying, but how clawed just it does too much.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.680
 Does too much.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.560
 It doesn't do the simple thing anymore.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.560
 Like 3.7 is just like, I don't know if that's overfitting.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.400
 I don't even know what overfitting would mean with an LLM, but it's like it goes too far

00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.400
 and gets too elaborate and thinks too big when it should do simpler things, which is really

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.400
 annoying.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.520
 It's graduating from being a junior engineer to being a mid-level engineer.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.520
 And that's why it's doing all the complicated stuff.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:13.080
 Oh, it's in that little like transition period where it's in the middle of the bell curve.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.080
 Yeah.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.080
 What's that curve?

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.080
 The mid-wit curves.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.080
 Mid-wit curve.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.080
 Yeah.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.080
 Yeah.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.080
 I don't know.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.880
 I don't know with the, it's so hard to like, this is my first experience with this kind

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:29.440
 of coding where like the cursor experience where it can actually do things and you're

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:34.960
 not just like copy-pasting, one-shotting, like, functions or whatever.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.720
 Like where it's actually modifying my code base while I observe and review the code.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.200
 It's my first experience with that.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.760
 So it's hard to separate like what in, it's also my first experience with Cloud 3.7.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.240
 So like what is 3.7?

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.600
 What is the Cloud code limitations?

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.000
 It's just very hard to suss out.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.800
 I have noticed like Cloud code eventually on a big problem and a big code base where

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.720
 you've been going for a while, you've got a few minutes of computation going, you'll

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:03.520
 start to eventually see that there's like a context limit that the context gets low.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:09.640
 So I guess that's like, it is building up some kind of like file that describes everything

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:12.160
 it's done so far, I guess maybe.

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.800
 And like keeping track of the state just in some text file maybe, but I don't know.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.800
 Is that transparent?

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.080
 No, I think it's literally just what's in, what's it's printing.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:23.160
 Because it prints in really Cloud code, like the inputs and the outputs, it might truncate

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.160
 the output, but that's, that's all it's going off.

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.160
 That's the context.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:33.120
 So using that and it's calls back to the model as the context needed to keep doing the tasks

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.120
 needed.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.120
 Yeah.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.120
 And that's why eventually the context pulls up.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.120
 You have to like summarize it.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.120
 That's why it initially feels like.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.120
 Yeah.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.920
 But that, that, that list, whatever it's printing, like standard out, that doesn't have like

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.240
 contents of your files and stuff in it.

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.240
 It does.

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.240
 It does.

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.240
 It just truncated.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.240
 It just, it just shows you the first.

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.240
 Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.920
 It starts to show you like the first few imports or whatever, the fishy lines of the file.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.920
 Oh, that's right.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.880
 So that file would just be this giant.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.880
 If I inspected that file, it would have all the code for all those files.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.880
 Yeah.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.880
 Okay.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.880
 Yeah.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.280
 I think, I think what would be what might end up happening.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:08.160
 So right now, if you have a well organized file tree, this is great for cloud code because

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:13.160
 it can infer a lot just by doing a list on recursive lists on everything.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.720
 And that can easily fit in context window.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.040
 It can kind of have a sense of everything.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:22.680
 I kind of wonder if there's going to be some kind of thing where like you can put one comment

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:28.520
 at the top of a file and just reads up to that comment so it can get like more information

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.240
 about what is in this file and keep that and the exact and probably fit.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.240
 Yeah.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:39.440
 The approach with all this stuff just seems like give it a shallow view of everything and

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.280
 then let it drill down and then get and then that way you're not like overloading your

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.840
 context right away.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.840
 Yeah.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.440
 So I think that that type of thing works pretty well.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.640
 The thing that we've been thinking about is I think we're going to end up, we don't want

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.640
 to do this.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.480
 I think everything we do, we don't want to do we just have to do.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.320
 I started off so many projects like this being like, I don't want to do this.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.320
 Yeah.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:07.840
 I think we're going to have to build a web based client client.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.840
 Yeah.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.640
 I'm not going to call it an MCP client.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:18.320
 I'm just going to say like something that's embeddable because the best experience for

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:25.080
 the stuff we're working on is we saw this project open control that's easy to find tools

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.800
 import functions from your code base, whatever when it's deployed, you should just be able

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:35.280
 to go to the URL and have a chat box right there and be able to like talk to it and do

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.280
 everything.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.960
 You shouldn't have to like put it into yeah, exactly.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.000
 And then like the clients, you know, you can't just give this to your team.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.680
 You got to like tell them to set up a bunch of stuff first.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:51.280
 So we probably will end up making our own like chat type interface.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.280
 It's funny.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:57.240
 Vercel actually released a template after they called chat versus I don't know.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.640
 So they have like a chat template that does exactly.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.240
 It's exactly what we need.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:05.120
 It's just like a prebuilt thing plugging the client.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.120
 Yeah, exactly.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.120
 It's a plug in.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:12.640
 I don't want to call it a client just like just the front end for it plug in an L M and

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.960
 you can talk to it.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.360
 It can even do tool calls.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.120
 It can even do like custom UI.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.360
 You can like load it with custom UI widgets and it recognizes that the data coming back

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.360
 can pop those.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.720
 It'll like pop that up instead of this text.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.360
 So really good, really well done.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:33.480
 But it's a fucking like app router thing and I can't we can't just like I can't drop that

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.920
 easily into it's not like wait like I can't deploy a whole next JS app.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.360
 You don't want to deploy next JS app into people's database account.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.000
 I mean, you guys have the ability to do that, but yeah, it's like it's such a kill for this.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.520
 So I think we're just going to look at it and like yeah, can you just use the actual front

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:56.200
 end of it, like remove the next JS piece to just like get the yeah, good parts.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:01.040
 I'm sure I think I think the thing they saw for so they did a broad thinking like the

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.800
 terms of what it can do made ways organized.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.480
 I'm assuming is probably going to be correct.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.760
 Maybe a few things I might disagree with, but yeah, we're just going to try to re implement

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:14.720
 it in something that is way more lightweight and portable so that one we can drop it.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.080
 So deploy open control, boom, you have it there, but also in the ST console, we want

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.360
 to be able to drop it in there, preload it with tools so you can like ask it by great

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.360
 of his account.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:31.080
 We even like load the, your state of all your resources into the context, so it can, but

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.920
 you can like understand a lot of resources in your app.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:37.360
 So you can be like, yeah, this is helpful, clear out the bucket for my follow codes and

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.520
 it knows what that is.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.200
 Yeah, invalidate the cash.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.200
 Yeah.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:47.800
 Yeah, we realized we had this like crazy long tail of this thing sucks native as console.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:52.520
 Let's build a better UI for it, an infinite long tail that we would never have made progress

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.520
 on.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.520
 Yeah.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.360
 But this kind of like in one go calls a lot of that.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.360
 So we want to do that.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:05.320
 But then if you think about it, like theoretically every product probably has the same thing where

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.320
 they're like, I don't want to build a UI for every little thing.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:13.560
 I have like a dozen actions that my system can do, just give, I always want to be able

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:18.520
 to embed a chat interface in my app so people can, and my users can like do that.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:27.040
 So I think a embeddable, nice LM chat thing is going to be useful definitely for us, maybe

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.000
 for other people.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.240
 Like every, like if you think about like building a new app now, you would just start

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:37.920
 with the backend, like implement all the functions, database, whatever.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.840
 And V1 of your app could just be this thing.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.840
 Yeah.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.840
 Right.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.840
 You can just call the tools.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.880
 And then over time you can then build like dedicated UI for things that chat doesn't handle

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.880
 well.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.880
 Yeah.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:55.000
 Like the issues tab in the console, like that's, that's a valuable thing to have that AI is

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.160
 not the right interface for it.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.240
 Like a chat interface is not what you want there, like you want to be able to look at

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:05.640
 the list and check them off and see when they last happen, like that's, yeah, their special

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.640
 UI still needed.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.120
 Yeah, like anything that's like tabular, like anything that's like a long list of stuff,

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:14.120
 like it's, they need to like go through and do work on personally, why it's great.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:18.600
 But just like that long tail of stuff that you never get to, yeah, like it seems like

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.160
 this is a good, useful thing.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.160
 Okay.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.160
 You told me not to use our client, but I'm stuck on this because now like I understand

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:32.320
 the MCP server thing, like it's a very simple protocol where you define these tools.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.320
 That makes sense to me.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.360
 The client side though, the more we talk, like the difference in cloud desktop versus

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.120
 cloud code, what you're going to build, I'm just realizing I have no idea how the client

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.120
 side works.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.760
 How does the model decide what tools to use?

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.880
 Is it just part of the context where it passes?

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.880
 Yeah.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.520
 As beginning of the prompt, like here's your list of tools and the definitions, like how

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.520
 does that client work?

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:56.440
 I think that you just want to understand this is actually look at OpenAI instead of

00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:02.040
 anthropic because you realize that this capability has been around forever without these like

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:06.680
 specific, without the specific packaging.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:13.040
 So OpenAI forever, when you send a prompt to their API, you had the option of listing

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:17.640
 a bunch of tools that were available to the LOM.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.880
 And it's almost the exact same form as MCP server.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.920
 It's like an array, the name of the tool, description of what it does, and a JSON schema

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.920
 of the input.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:25.920
 Okay.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.160
 Then the prompt up to their API.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.600
 You lost me a little bit because I didn't know you could do this in OpenAI.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.600
 Yeah.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.600
 Yeah.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.600
 So you can.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.600
 What are the tools?

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.600
 They call it function calling.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.600
 No, there's no tools.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:38.600
 Oh, function calling.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.600
 Yeah.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.600
 So you pass it a list.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.600
 I think I've heard that term.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.640
 So when you send it a prompt, you can also pass it a list of tool definitions.

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:50.680
 In the response, it'll tell you, hey, based off this prompt, you should probably call

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.680
 this tool.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.680
 Got it.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.360
 Then on your end, you call the tool, get the response, then you can send it back up.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.000
 Well, that's not a very good user experience compared to.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.640
 It's identical to what Claude's doing.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.640
 What?

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.200
 From the user, maybe I'm misunderstanding the user versus the actual client.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.200
 The client.

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.200
 This is what the client is doing.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.200
 Well, this is what the client is doing.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.200
 Yeah.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.200
 Yeah.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.200
 So user sends a prompt.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.200
 You send the prompt up.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.200
 It comes back with the tools you need to call.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.680
 The tool gets a response, sends it back up, and it goes back and forth until there's maybe

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.520
 no more tool calls coming back.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.520
 Okay.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:26.840
 And this is like a very dumb version of this type of product.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:33.000
 I'm assuming that there's a lot of tricks that Claude code implements based on the response.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.240
 Maybe they have some hard-coded things that it does differently.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.520
 That's probably where the quality comes out.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.960
 But bare minimum, you can do this with OpenAI, you can do it a list of tools and I'll tell

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.000
 you which one to call based off the prompt.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 Yeah.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 Okay.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.160
 So is OpenAI ever going to just use MCP and standardize?

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:56.760
 I don't know where MCP is going to go, to be honest, because let's say you are like,

00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:05.000
 us, like Terminal, we have a API document with OpenAPI, Alums understand OpenAPI.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.400
 You could just have a system that points to the API.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.880
 But you don't even need the MCP in this case, right?

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.800
 So I don't know where it's going to go.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.600
 So the way we're building, we're building in a way where we have our concept of tools

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:25.200
 and we expose them through MCP, and maybe MCP dies, maybe it goes somewhere, but it's

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:31.160
 just like the flavor that is getting traction right now, but yeah, we'll see.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.120
 But the idea will persist.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.120
 It's just...

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.120
 Yeah.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.560
 I guess the question is like, did we need another layer, right?

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:41.880
 Like if you take like, linear has an API, I think it's a GraphQL API.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.200
 GraphQL APIs are crazy, like, introspectable.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:50.680
 So Claude could have just been like, yeah, add any GraphQL API URL here.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.600
 Don't need any new concepts.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:58.520
 So there are some things you lose, but like, I don't think it just matters for 90% of cases.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.520
 Yeah.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:03.880
 Definitely doesn't matter for all the people that on Twitter are asking about MCPs.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.560
 Just like, doesn't just stop.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:12.540
 The thing that blows my mind is like, why do you need to understand something so much

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.280
 before you just go try it?

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.040
 It's like a smallest thing ever.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.800
 It's like such a small concept.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.800
 Like, why do you need to...

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.240
 It's like, people are reacting like the quantum announcements.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.920
 Like, somebody explained this to me, like, I don't understand, I can't go play with

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.920
 quantum stuff.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:31.080
 I need to explain to me, like, I'm a dummy, but MCP is like, it's just not a thing that

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.960
 should have gotten this much attention on Twitter.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.760
 It's just a weird, weird situation.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:37.760
 It makes no sense.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.760
 Yeah.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.760
 Just go.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.560
 It's just like, it's like a button you hit in the settings.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:46.280
 Like, I just, it's just so weird that people are like, no, I need you to, like, give me

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:51.120
 a friggin' dissertation on this for all, even like consider spending my valuable time opening

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.960
 up the settings page and trying it out.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.960
 Weird times we live in.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.320
 Oh, should we talk about some of the weird things that are going on in the world?

00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.320
 Yeah, like that.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.320
 Before we get off here?

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.320
 Well, like, what do you mean?

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.320
 Now I feel crazy.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.760
 Like, is the world not kind of crazy right now?

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:09.680
 Like, I feel like right now, my world is MCP and nothing else based on Twitter just erased

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.320
 my brain for the last 24 hours and all I, all of my head is MCP.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.320
 Okay, that's true.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.320
 Yeah.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.320
 Twitter did get overtaken.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.400
 But before it was MCP, there's, there's tariffs.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.200
 Oh, the tariffs are really weird.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:28.320
 We're terrafing people, which just seems rude, personally, like there's just, there's some

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:35.900
 pretty crazy, like, shifts in the geopolitical alliances.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:42.840
 It feels like we were on one side and now we're on the other side and I don't know what

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.840
 to think about all of it.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:49.520
 It kind of feels like the outcomes this year or the next two years are all over the place

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.080
 and I don't know what's going to happen.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.040
 I guess the first thing I'll say, and I don't really get into a lot of this stuff because

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.280
 I'm privileged and I don't have to think about politics.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:03.080
 But when I do think about it, isn't there a reason to like have the world be in a pretty

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.280
 good shape and not be like, F you all, America's going to be amazing and you guys are going

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.280
 to burn?

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.160
 Isn't there a reason we've always like, propped up the world because it's good?

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:15.840
 Yeah, I think, I've been thinking about this vaguely for a while and someone finally put

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:21.600
 it into good, actually someone that works to open a AI, I think, put it into these terms.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:30.360
 They were like, oh, I think Trump does not understand positive some interactions and

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:34.800
 like he leaves everything as a zero sum like for someone to win someone has to lose.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.720
 And it's interesting because I have run into really successful business people that have

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:45.800
 businesses that are literally in that type of situation and I think in tech, we're very

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:51.560
 used to being like, if we built something that enables someone else to be 10 times productive

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:56.920
 and we get paid 10% of that and like we like naturally understand that because we're just

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.200
 in the productivity zone, like improving, if you see productivity, whatever.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:05.200
 So it's really hard to be a zero sum thinker because like it's like in your face all the

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:11.160
 time where, you know, everything like both every party can win.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:17.240
 But if you're in the like some kind of like hyper competitive environment with like scarce

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:23.480
 resources, like real estate, for example, a lot of the times and especially when governments

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.320
 involve like whenever there's like government regulation involved and there's government

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.640
 like you need to get approvals and stuff.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:35.120
 A lot of the times the interactions are zero sum and like I knew these people that had a

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:41.880
 massive healthcare business and they operated in like the most like cut throat like totally

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:46.160
 alien way like every interaction they went into it being like, I need to fuck over the

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.680
 other person before they fuck me over.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.680
 Yeah.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.480
 And I don't think they're ultimately, I don't think they're wrong because I think the business

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.780
 they were in that just is what you had to do because there was like a fixed thing and

00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:02.400
 whoever gets most of it like wins, there's no there's no possible way to grow the pie.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.800
 It's just fixed and like it gets divvied up.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:11.560
 And I think most of the if you're not in business at all, and if you're not in maybe

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:16.000
 tech at all, I can see how that's how that's naturally how you see the world.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.680
 It's like if someone is getting money, that means they took it from me.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.800
 And you see this on the left too, like people on the left like obsess over billionaires,

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.360
 like billionaires should be evil like illegal like all that stuff.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.360
 It's the same.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:33.800
 It's like a same flavor of that where they're like, oh, they have a tariff on us.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:39.480
 That means we need to have reciprocal tariffs, which is fine if the goal is to reduce tariffs

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:44.560
 on both sides to zero, right, like if it's like a threat, you're playing hard with them

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.360
 to get them to reduce theirs to zero as well.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.360
 But it doesn't seem to be that.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.800
 It just seems to be like, hey, we can make money if we do this and they're getting away

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.000
 with it and we should be able to get some money out of it too.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.360
 And every single thing it's just been like, how do we get something out of this relationship

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.600
 in a very direct way, you know, I feel like that's kind of what's going on with all that.

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:10.120
 Do you have anxiety over where things are headed?

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.640
 Is World War three about to erupt?

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:12.640
 What's going on?

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:15.640
 I mean, it doesn't feel, I mean, just from the economic point of view, it doesn't feel

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:21.080
 good because I am very like pro things like free trade.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:25.760
 And I really believe like a lot of this stuff enriches us and really indirect second order

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:30.320
 effect ways that it's hard to explain.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:36.320
 And yeah, it doesn't feel good that the world is like looking for alternatives to America.

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:40.280
 You know, like, okay, how can we get by without depending on America as much?

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.560
 How can we, you know, I don't think that leads to a good play.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.360
 And then the people that are more funny about it, Nikita had a funny one where it was like,

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:51.880
 I've got the name he used, it was some like very Midwest name.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:57.840
 He was like, don't you see as soon as Bill something from, I mean, he's Missouri.

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.840
 He's from Missouri.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.720
 Live it out in Missouri, figures out how to make GPUs.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.080
 We're going to be on top all over, how to like smell metal and crap.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:10.960
 Just like we're not, yeah, we've like progressed maybe too much away from some kinds of manufacturing.

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:15.880
 But like we don't want to fucking be making t-shirts like we've, our economy has passed

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:16.880
 that point, right?

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:22.160
 Like we're building stuff that's so complicated that requires physical resources from every

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.640
 corner of the earth to produce.

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.760
 And it is the most highest value thing that we could be doing.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.000
 Other people don't even have the option.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.240
 Like, yeah, other countries don't have the option of building GPUs.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.240
 They just don't.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.240
 It's not an option.

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.240
 We do.

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:39.800
 So we should take advantage of it as opposed to like going back down and being like, how

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:45.520
 do we produce steel like we produce the stuff that steel gets turned into, right?

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.520
 Yeah.

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.520
 Yeah.

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.520
 So I don't know.

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:52.560
 It's, it's, it makes me a weird, I think it reminds me of is there's a classic story

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:59.560
 from, from China, Mao had this whole great leap forward thing, a very similar mentality

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.480
 of being like, we're not doing enough of X.

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:06.360
 So top down, he tried to force certain things to happen.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.240
 They're like, oh, steel is important.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.240
 Top down.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.000
 They make steel every village.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.080
 I needed to produce X amount of steel.

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:19.280
 So people were like melting their cast iron pans and stuff and making steel in their back

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:22.600
 yards because they were the government told them to instead of like farming and doing

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.880
 other stuff that they naturally would have otherwise, all the steel was complete garbage

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.360
 and they had a famine.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:32.320
 So I don't think we're going to go that extreme, but it feels like that's a kind of mindset.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:37.640
 It's like way too basic in our world that's extremely complicated, extremely complicated.

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:38.640
 Yeah.

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.640
 I don't know.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:45.360
 It just, I just, I kind of like missed the days where there weren't big political headlines

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.360
 every day.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.360
 I don't know.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.360
 Yeah.

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.680
 We're all just busy doing pointless things that don't really affect us.

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.280
 It just feels like we're going to be affected now.

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.280
 Yeah.

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:59.960
 And I felt pretty unaffected in the past by who our president was.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.840
 I mean, the reason I don't, I'm not that word yet is my sense on the whole situation

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:08.360
 is new president, lots of optimism whenever there's a new president, lots of leeway to

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.520
 do a bunch of things, but it's always going to be limited, like optimism only lasts for

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.520
 so long.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.640
 But you have like a fixed number of months to get as much fit in as possible without

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:18.640
 too much pushback.

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.640
 Yeah.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.280
 And it's like a feedback loop because then you do even crazier shit than you would have

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:23.440
 normally done.

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:27.680
 And that like depletes optimism even faster, but it feels like we're in that zone.

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:32.240
 I already feel like we're kind of coming out of it where like, like, okay, this is America,

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.600
 like you need to satisfy the corporations.

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.320
 That's, that's how it works.

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:40.320
 If you do stuff that hurts the corporations, like you're not going to be around for super

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.320
 long.

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:46.400
 And if you lose that, it's not, you know, it can only go on like that for, for so long,

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:52.160
 like no one's really been able to escape being liable to them.

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.160
 Okay.

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.320
 So one person can't come in and just burn down our economy.

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:59.560
 Like there is a, there are like adults who enter the room and stop that if it came to

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.560
 that.

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.560
 Yeah.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.560
 Cause there's corporate interest.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.560
 Corporate interests need to follow corporate interests.

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.120
 And I feel like there's so many problems in America from that.

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:11.200
 But at the same time, it's what prevents us from doing stuff that's too stupid because

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.440
 like once you affect the money, then it's like, uh, yeah, stop now.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:19.280
 Yeah, I guess it's separate conversations around like the global economic situation and

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:26.840
 all the tariffs and all that versus like the tensions and the ongoing war and who's side

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:31.240
 who is on and yeah, the civil Russia is really crazy stuff's nuts.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.040
 And like, I don't know, it's just, it's weird to me.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:40.440
 It's just weird to wake up and like suddenly like our president is like friends with Russia,

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.640
 but not with everyone we've always been friends with.

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.640
 What do we do with that?

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.160
 Like, yeah, I don't know.

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.160
 It's not even like good guys and bad guys.

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.560
 I'm not trying to like decide who's good and bad.

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:54.800
 Although I think there's a lot of history that says Putin's pretty bad.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:54:01.760
 But like, aside from human rights and all that stuff, I get that like countries look out

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.760
 for themselves.

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:09.360
 But it's just weird to like have America flip sides and suddenly be like on the side like

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.040
 feels like we're on the side of Russia, right?

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.440
 Am I just dreaming that or I mean, the thing that was really weird was like the defense

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:21.680
 department halting all cyber attack stuff with Russia, like what the fuck?

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.680
 That's like really extreme.

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.680
 Yeah.

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:24.680
 I don't know.

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:26.200
 Who knows what's going on behind the scenes?

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:31.160
 But, uh, yeah, at the end of the day, it's really weird because I'm seeing, um, you know,

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:34.580
 if you're Canadian, you're probably really annoyed right now, right?

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:35.580
 And I see that.

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.320
 They're all like really upset at America and they're like, yeah, we have a lot of stuff.

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:42.520
 I always forget how many friends we have in Canada from a tech standpoint, like, yeah,

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:43.680
 and they're impacted by this.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.280
 And like they didn't do any, they didn't like vote for, they didn't like, this is like

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.920
 an election that's happening in that country.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:49.920
 It's affecting them.

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:50.920
 Yeah.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:56.080
 And I think they understand that it's one guy that's doing this plus all the people that

00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:57.080
 voted for him true.

00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:02.680
 But I wonder like, okay, let's say, you know, eventually his term runs out hopefully, you

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.200
 know, hopefully we don't have to end up with a king.

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.200
 No kidding.

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:10.480
 By the next election, will everyone with a relations like basically reset because it's

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:16.640
 with like, is Canada relationship with the US or with Trump, you know, yeah, didn't their,

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:22.480
 their prime minister kind of, uh, Justin, whatever said, like he kind of made a speech

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:28.920
 or two along the lines of like, I know that the American people aren't making this decision

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:29.920
 that this was.

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:30.920
 Yeah.

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:35.120
 Like if you're a leader of a country, like you, you can't, like you must see it that way.

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.120
 Yeah.

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:39.520
 It's like everyone in America just suddenly became like assholes and wanted to tear up

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:40.520
 your country.

00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.520
 Yeah.

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:42.520
 Yeah.

00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:43.520
 Yeah.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.520
 Exactly.

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:45.520
 So I mean, it has just, because American never really has to think about it.

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:52.360
 We also, it's very, I can see how it's very annoying.

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.920
 It's like an election in another country that has nothing to do with you.

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.200
 And now, now you're, uh, you're impacted.

00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.200
 Mm hmm.

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:01.920
 So yeah, I see people, I see like Canadian, like really upset and annoyed and angry.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.420
 Hi, Chris.

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:04.520
 Just shout out to Chris.

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:07.160
 I hope, I hope you're well in Canada.

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.160
 Yeah.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:12.320
 I better let me know if you need me to smuggle in any equipment.

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.560
 I'm not going to edit that.

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.520
 What do we ship up there?

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.520
 Corn?

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.520
 Like what the fuck do we make?

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.520
 I don't know.

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.520
 Yeah.

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:24.160
 And all the terrorists are like, I actually don't know what Canada and America trade.

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.160
 Like I'm sure there's stuff.

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.160
 You definitely get wood.

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.160
 We definitely get wood.

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.160
 It's funny.

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.160
 I did look this up.

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:34.400
 And I was like, I was so surprised by how stereotypical the results were.

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.320
 It was literally maple syrup.

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.120
 It was literally maple syrup.

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.120
 Just, yeah.

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:47.040
 It was like maple syrup and wood and an oil, obviously it was a big one, but like in your

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:52.040
 head, you picked your Canada, you picked your like mountains trees and like the trees

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:54.680
 have maple syrup, you know, and it's like that's, yeah, that actually is what we're

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:55.680
 importing from.

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:56.680
 Oh, man.

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:57.680
 From Canada.

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.840
 So maple syrup is going to be expensive.

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.080
 I think we're also doing the tariff thing to Mexico, right?

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.080
 I'm using terrified.

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:05.560
 This whole thing, like he just suspended it again yesterday.

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.560
 Oh, he's just kidding.

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:07.560
 I get it.

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:08.560
 I want to post a screenshot.

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:09.560
 Okay.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.000
 So I did do one thing two or three weeks ago.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:21.760
 I opened put options on Nvidia, Tesla and Bitcoin because I know for sure Tesla is getting

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.920
 slammed from every possible direction, like EVs are not selling well.

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:33.040
 They're a million EV makers in international markets like China, like they're being dominated.

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:37.520
 So I know they're hitting, they're probably going to hit something existential at some

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:40.960
 point, which Elon normally is very good at dealing with existential things.

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.300
 But he's pretty distracted right now.

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:44.300
 Yeah.

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:49.240
 So I had a short open on Tesla and I had one on Nvidia, because I'm like, it's the most

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.240
 inflated.

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:53.360
 So if we actually come out here, it's going to get hit the most.

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:58.520
 And the counter two thing on Bitcoin is I think all the pro pro Bitcoin stuff that Trump

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:02.240
 is doing, I think it's going to be like a sell the new type of situation where everyone's

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.520
 like really excited for what he could do.

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.760
 And then once he actually does it, big segment is going to be over and people are going to

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:13.920
 sell whatever. But the thing I was going to post is like a screenshot of the chart of

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:19.480
 my holdings in the past couple of weeks, what one they're doing really well, like the market

00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.480
 is not doing well.

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:26.120
 So those are doing well, but it is the most like jagged up and down that it looks like

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.920
 someone's having a heart attack type of thing because it's like, we're doing tariffs.

00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:33.120
 I was like, okay, actually, no, we're only going to do tariffs on these things.

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.280
 Oh, no, we're doing them again.

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:38.240
 And it's just like, it's a crazy whiplash and the market just has no idea what's going

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.240
 on.

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.240
 Yeah.

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.000
 So I think yesterday he said he delayed them again on Mexico and in whatever and like avocados

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.440
 will still be cheap for a little while.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.160
 I don't know.

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:52.680
 Liz's sister works at a jewelry company and they got calls from their vendors yesterday

00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:56.280
 being like, everything's up 10% now because of this and they had to go figure out how

00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:00.240
 to reprice everything, they're increasing the price of a bunch of stuff, they're like eating

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:04.000
 the costs on stuff. But then it's like, Oh, it turns out it's not going into effects for

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
 another month.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.140
 And it's like, it's just like such a it's crazy whiplash right now.

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:15.160
 So yeah, to me, I will say all this was awesome and worth it.

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:22.740
 If the end result is every country just gives up terrafing the US because of reciprocal threats

00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:28.000
 and we end up with completely near free trade, free trade. Yeah, yeah, that's, that's awesome.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000
 It's good goal.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000
 I don't buy that.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.240
 I don't think that's what's going on because of the zero sum mentality I mentioned earlier.

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:39.400
 We will see kind of sucks and just all the, I don't know, it's like I want to be so excited

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:45.320
 about stuff right now. Like, work is changing, like the potential for tools to make us more

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.520
 productive and all that like it's all so exciting. And then it's like, no, all the distractions

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:53.160
 of, yeah, like is the world ending? I don't know. It's just so loud.

00:59:53.160 --> 01:00:01.840
 It's just like we it really feels like the sense that I feel is past peak America, we're

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:08.560
 aware of it, but then the reaction to it is accelerating the decline simultaneously. We're

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:12.400
 getting propaganda videos every single week from China about some fucking robot. That's

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:17.680
 like, you know, doing some dances and shit. And then, and then it's just like, oh, yeah,

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.620
 like the Chinese, like BYD, whatever the Chinese Tesla is like, oh, they're like outselling

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.280
 Tesla. Like, like, look at their car. This only cost $16,000. We're going to fucking fly

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:32.520
 and shoot lasers. Like, it just it does not a good like it doesn't make you feel good

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:38.440
 about about America. It just it's especially funny for me because I wasn't born here.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:44.640
 And my family like, there was a moment in time where my family was like, we need to make

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:51.360
 it to America. We did establish a life here, like we're able to be successful. And like

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:57.040
 my parents did that to set me up. And like, fuck, am I going to have to do that again?

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.840
 Like we just got here. We just got here. I was supposed to be the, I was supposed to

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.600
 be the kid that's like, Oh, like, you know, my family came here and like set me up and

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.080
 now like, you know, I did all this stuff. Is it going to be my kids? They get to have

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:17.120
 that like moving to like Singapore or something? And they're going to feel like, like, oh,

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:23.960
 my parents, and the funniest thing is, like, Liz's grandparents came over in there, like

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:28.840
 maybe they were like late 40s, 50s, right? When they were older. And they had no idea.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.000
 They were like, I'm gonna spend my whole life in Cuba. And all of a sudden, they're 50.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.400
 And they're like, Oh, shit, I'm like moving to America. And I'm like, what if my kid,

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:39.480
 like, what if I'm 50 and I'm randomly immigrating to a new country? I have to like learn the

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:44.920
 language. Like that could totally happen. Oh, man. That sucks. It's kind of makes you

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:49.400
 feel special, though, like, if we're the generation that sees that, like, the real decline of

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:55.640
 America, I mean, as much as that sucks. I don't know. Kind of unique. Like, how many

01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:00.600
 generations have there been since America was founded in 1700s or whatever? And we're

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:05.280
 the one that feels special, Adam, what are the mail in the coffin?

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.600
 But it's not going to be like that. It's going to be like Europe. It's going to be like infinite

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:16.680
 slow time. Yeah. And I see so many parallels with us in Europe right now. It's like, you

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:22.360
 know, how, you know, how like five years ago, we'd be like, Ha ha, Europe, you suck. Like,

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.760
 look at all the stuff we have. And they'd be like, you don't even need all that stuff.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.720
 Like it's not good to have all that stuff. Yeah. I'm literally seeing that now. Like,

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:34.280
 I think someone from the government was like, like, someone America was like, someone in

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:39.480
 the administration was like, you know, it's not always about being able to buy cheap stuff.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.800
 Like, that's not always like the best thing. I think exactly what all the European people

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:47.320
 are saying. You know, it's like, you know, like, you don't even need that many eggs.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:57.320
 Oh, it's so good. Oh, man. That sucks though. Weird times. I hope I hope this is just a

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:03.960
 temporary thing, of course. But man, we'll see. I guess all the AI stuff is a lot, a lot of

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:10.520
 leading by America. I mean, there's deep seek. But like, yeah, major frontier models are all

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:15.480
 American companies, right? Yeah. Yeah. Like I said, we're still number one of pretty much

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:22.280
 everything. But obviously, like the when you look back in history of things that have declined,

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:31.480
 the decline started like during their best times. Always. It's like, when someone comes to you and

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:36.520
 say, okay, the decline is happening, it seems so ridiculous, because like things are better than

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:40.040
 ever. And you're like, I don't want everything. So it kind of, there is like some precedent for that.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.560
 But yeah, I mean, that's the only thing that bothers me. There's so many people being like,

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:48.760
 no, like, we're like, all the people that are obsessed with talking about this. And they're like,

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.640
 no, we can do it. America can do everything. Like, we don't need help from everyone. Like,

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.880
 you personally aren't doing shit. Like, the reason America is good is because of like,

01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:01.800
 these like really small set of companies and people that like are continuing to push the bar.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:07.960
 It's not any of the people in this conversation. I'm sorry to tell you like, yeah, like, oh,

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:14.680
 we're so great. Yeah, like as a country, but like, not you personally, you know, you suck such a

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:20.840
 DAX response. I can tell the point. There's other point energy to them. All right, I got to get back

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:27.320
 to monitoring my cloud code babies. They need me to feed them.

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:33.320
 You have like a bunch of teamwork sessions that you do with the cloud code thing running,

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:41.160
 spending $100 a minute, $100 a minute. I've already written a little tool for like spinning up a new

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:48.040
 session or a new window in my session, get work tree, check out a branch, like, just kind of like,

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:52.200
 get me into a new context where I can start up some work and then monitor what is get work

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.160
 tree. I hear you say a few times and realize I don't know what that is. It's just the ability

01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:00.840
 to like check out multiple branches on the same file system. Like, so you don't have to get cloned.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:09.240
 It's like, you can use get work tree to like have two branches that you're working on in parallel.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.000
 Like, what does it look like on the file system? Well, it actually like, it's annoying because

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:19.400
 it creates a new folder. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It just creates a new file system, but it shares the same

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:24.680
 get. I see directory. I don't know. I don't know how much better it is than just cloning a bunch.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:28.600
 I guess you could just clone a bunch, but I guess are efficient. Oh, I see, because you can't,

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:34.200
 if you switch branches and it's, you know, I have one tab on one branch and one tab on another branch.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:39.960
 Right. Normally, if you're switching branches, you're sharing a file. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:43.720
 I learned about a new get thing like every day. How, how convoluted is get?

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:49.160
 It's just like so many tools and get that I have not or will not ever use.

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.840
 Yeah, just one of those class situations where like the online primitive so good enables like a

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:57.800
 million things, but those million things were not productized. Well, yeah, spread out all over the

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:03.480
 place. Yeah. Okay, I'll let you get back to your new best friend. Yeah, my new best friend cloud

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:09.000
 code. I broke up with, I don't know who there was nothing before cloud code. That's true. I mean,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.640
 there probably was, but I wasn't using it. All right. Yeah.
