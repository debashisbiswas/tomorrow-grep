00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
 - Let me be the person without any children

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.280
 that give you advice on your kids.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.720
 - That's what parents love is when people without kids.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.040
 - It's just like having a dog.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.460
 It's just the exact same thing.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.040
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.160
 - What minute are we on?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.280
 I was going to reset the recording.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.640
 - I had to start the recording.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.400
 There's three recordings for this episode so far.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.240
 It's a great start.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.480
 - I had so many things I was going to say.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.760
 So much time went by where I was waiting for you

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.360
 to figure that out that I had multiple thoughts

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.200
 that I was going to say to you that overwrote

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.040
 the previous one.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.280
 - Yeah, you didn't queue them up.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.600
 There's no durability in your thoughts, just gone.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.440
 - No, no.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.600
 I did get a nice picture of you that I posted on Twitter,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.680
 which was great.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.280
 Are you kidding me, you've posted a picture of me

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.680
 on Twitter already?

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.040
 What in the world?

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.400
 I'm already being shamed on Twitter.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.320
 Okay, well then I'm just trying to find the picture.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.920
 Did you see the, you saw the prime, you responded.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.200
 Isn't that exactly how prime looks in person,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.800
 like all the time at like an event?

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.160
 - Yeah, like what?

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.700
 Okay, so the picture was prime holding a cup.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.560
 And that seems so simple, like everyone holds a cup.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.240
 - But there's something iconic about it.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.880
 - Yeah, so the way he like, I don't know what it is,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.880
 the way he holds it, it's like, that's exactly unique to him.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.120
 - It's so familiar, like I've seen him in that position

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.880
 so many times and I've not been with him that much.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.400
 - Yeah, and I can even like tell how he's like moving.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.640
 Like he's like, like leading back and forth.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.520
 - Yeah, it's funny.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.800
 And I see the picture of me as me bent over again.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.640
 Awesome, thanks that.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.640
 - Yeah, it's gonna be, it's gonna be so much.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.480
 - I'm hoping to continue this for like years and years and years.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.320
 - Oh, stop.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.400
 (laughing)

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 - Yeah, I should've known better.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.000
 I should've turned off the camera.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 So we had some technical difficulties here,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.320
 but we're going now.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.400
 - I wanted to share some good news.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.080
 - Oh, do please.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.760
 - You know, I got this mango tree like a month ago.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.600
 And ever since I got it, I was pretty convinced

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.840
 that it was gonna die because the moment I got it,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.680
 like some of the leaves are turning gray and like crumbling.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.320
 (laughing)

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.840
 It didn't even look like how plants normally die.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.440
 It just looked like the tree got cursed

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.480
 and it just like dissipating into dust or something.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.400
 And then like a few of them started getting these black spots

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.680
 and I was like, okay, this tree's definitely gonna die.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.840
 And I've been watering, I haven't taken care of it,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.160
 but didn't look like it was gonna go well.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.000
 - Yeah.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.880
 - And I swear to you, I look at this tree every single day.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.800
 I'm pretty sure I looked at it yesterday.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.200
 So this morning I go and I noticed

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.280
 that there are three like little baby branches

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.400
 coming out the top, each with like four leaves on it.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.040
 And each leaf is like an inch long.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.200
 - Wow.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.160
 - So there's new growth, which is a really great sign.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.000
 - Yeah.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.280
 - But I swear this wasn't there yesterday.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.440
 And like, can trees grow that?

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.800
 Is it that I just not noticed?

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.000
 Or can they grow that fast?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.520
 Like, I don't know, that's pretty fast.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.920
 - Yeah, so there's all kinds of interesting stuff

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.760
 about plants that this reminds me of,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.600
 that Casey's told me, 'cause we have a ton of house plants.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.600
 Like when we moved into this house,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.920
 we just bought like tons of house plants.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.800
 And like, there's been studies,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.360
 I mean, you've probably seen the music studies,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.720
 like that they respond to music and that they do certain,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.040
 I don't know, there's some kind of study

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.640
 about like them basically reading our minds

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.640
 and like playing off of our emotional states.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.440
 And if you have like negative thoughts about a plant,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.160
 you can actually like affect its health.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.760
 I swear to you, it's a real study, it sounds so fake.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.560
 You need to look it up, that like your vibes basically

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.000
 can like affect the health of a plant.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.080
 So it makes perfect sense to me that you bought a plant,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.920
 it came into your home, it probably followed you on Twitter

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.200
 and it started withering away.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.760
 It was like, this guy, this guy's evil.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.840
 (laughing)

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.680
 Started dying immediately.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.640
 - That is really great, yeah, I wanna look into that.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.520
 I love stuff like that because there's so many things

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.280
 in the world that fit in that category.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.240
 And it just is a hint that there's like

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.560
 so much more going on that we don't understand.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.400
 - Yes.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.320
 - And a lot of times it feels like there's no

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.920
 potential magic left in the world

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.240
 because like we understand so much

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.040
 and the explanation is usually not magical

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.000
 but then you come across stuff like that and it really.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.160
 - It reminds you how little we actually know.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.040
 Like I feel like there's this world

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.800
 that just we haven't even touched

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.000
 but we don't understand at all.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.440
 - Yeah, it's crazy.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.440
 Liz is very convinced that we underplay the role of smells

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.520
 in like everything.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.280
 He's convinced that when people don't like each other

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.800
 off the bat, there's just like a smell.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.800
 And when people do like each other, it's smell related.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.040
 And then when people like each other

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.760
 and then like, you know, over time

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.160
 like the relationship kind of gets stale,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.000
 it's 'cause we get used to each other's smells.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.840
 So.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.680
 (laughing)

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.520
 - Wow.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.080
 That's quite a theory.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.680
 What about online relationships?

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.520
 I feel like.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.360
 - That's true.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.760
 Maybe we're also weird to each other online

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.160
 'cause we can't smell each other, you know?

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.760
 (laughing)

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.200
 - That's a missing piece.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.040
 (laughing)

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.920
 - It kind of makes sense

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.880
 'cause everywhere it seems like there's a psychic thing

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.560
 going on, it can only be explained through something

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.120
 like smells and it's invisibly transmitting, you know.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.120
 - Yeah.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.400
 - Yeah, interesting.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.040
 I don't have a great sense of smell.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.800
 I don't know what that says about.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.760
 Is that like my emotional intelligence is also bad

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.840
 because I don't have a good smell?

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.040
 - I used to have a really good sense of smell

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.400
 and just deteriorated over the years.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.640
 I think it's like my first sense.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.480
 - Oh yeah.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.840
 - I just can't smell anything.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.920
 - I wonder if there's something to that,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.600
 like if there's an order that your senses,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.440
 I'm sure there is.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.760
 Like an order that your senses typically go,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.120
 like at your age.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.960
 - Yeah.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.280
 - How weird that we're just aging.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.040
 We're just marching towards this like inevitably bad life.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.240
 - I don't wanna talk about this.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.080
 I'm just not gonna.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.920
 - I just hate the idea again.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.920
 Let's not get old.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.760
 Let's just avoid it somehow.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.840
 - Let's talk about Apple.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.000
 You said you wanna talk about Apple.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.840
 - Oh yeah.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.680
 Oh my God.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.800
 Well, there's things to talk about,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.880
 like apparently they launched a new iPad

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.120
 and people are like, it's the first time I've seen people

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.920
 have strong feelings about an Apple product in a while.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.520
 Or just like, it was the ad I guess

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.400
 that people had strong feelings about.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.160
 I don't know, they just reminded me that like,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.480
 Apple's kind of become irrelevant.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.920
 Like we all use Apple stuff, but like in the public discourse,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.360
 I don't remember people talking about Apple in a while,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.960
 at least in our circles.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.400
 And this is like the first time people are really upset

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.840
 that they're like crushing pianos and stuff

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.840
 in this ad that they made.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.680
 - Yeah.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680
 I have a lot of thoughts about the ad,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.720
 but before that, I've been being irrelevant.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.720
 Yeah, it's really funny because that's definitely true

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.480
 on one hand, but I was at my brother's graduation last week

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.440
 and we were sitting in like a big stadium

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.960
 waiting for the students to fill it up.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.800
 - Yeah.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.640
 - And I was looking and I was like,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.680
 wow, there's like hundreds of students here.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.520
 Like they're all sitting in chairs.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.520
 I didn't instruct me that every single one of them

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.560
 has an iPhone and every couple of years

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.960
 they like go into the Apple store

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.000
 and they get a new iPhone and they like sign up for

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.520
 whatever iPhone things there are.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.640
 And it's just seeing that in front of me.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.600
 It's really mind boggling that you could have

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.880
 that level of impact on like every single person

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.280
 in their ad one, probably.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.880
 - Yeah, it's the legacy thing again, almost.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.800
 I mean, not that Apple's like a legacy company

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.400
 'cause they're obviously like very relevant

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.400
 in terms of people's buying habits.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.680
 Like I'm not trying to discount everybody

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.640
 in the US buys iPhones.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.560
 But, and I'm saying in the US, maybe it's everywhere.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.920
 I just, I can't speak for everywhere.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.240
 I only live in the US.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.720
 I guess like, it does feel like most of their success

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.560
 is behind them in the sense that,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.560
 like when was last innovative thing they did?

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.720
 I guess they tried with the Vision Pro.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.560
 But like, until there's some new form factor,

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.640
 it's just hard to see Apple like really blowing my mind.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.960
 Like they've just kind of like,

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.000
 they've done the iterative thing for like a decade now

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.280
 where they just make little improvements.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.340
 It's faster, it's longer battery life, blah, blah, blah.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.320
 And I don't know, I just don't care.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.040
 Like I haven't cared about like an Apple event

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.720
 and I used to follow Apple events.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.280
 I haven't like even watched one in years.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.640
 And I don't know, maybe it's,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.360
 maybe we just live too much on the cutting edge.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.200
 I don't know.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.320
 - I mean, I feel the exact same way.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.960
 I think to give them credit, I would say the AirPods

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.400
 are probably the last one.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.800
 I know it's not as significant as a lot of other things,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.760
 but if you do take a separate.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.720
 - But they are a big part of my day, yeah.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.360
 And like everybody has them, if you just look at AirPods sales

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.280
 on their own, it's like bigger than most companies.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.680
 - Maybe they just set the bar too high.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.960
 And like I'm judging them against their own past success

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.160
 against any other metric.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.040
 Like yeah, they're an amazing company.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.600
 They still just make such good stuff.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.920
 I mean, they're hard way, they're MacBooks.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.280
 Everything is just so good.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.080
 - I think that, I also feel that way,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.240
 I think this is the classic thing

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.880
 where when the founder is gone,

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.240
 there's very few companies that still retain the magic.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.920
 Like I don't know why it would retain the magic.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.280
 Like these things do come down to a few people oftentimes.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.920
 - It's really true.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.200
 - Yeah, so I don't think, if I was betting,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.800
 like yeah, I would say it's behind them,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.120
 but we're not gonna know for sure.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.760
 And so if someone else invents the next big thing

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.360
 that they miss, right?

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.200
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.120
 - But Microsoft missed the iPhone.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.200
 So you know that they are done, yeah.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.680
 - Right, it's interesting.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.400
 Yeah, like, are they done?

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.880
 Yeah, that Microsoft's another case

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.000
 where it's like, I think about the developer community

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.200
 and how much Microsoft has like infiltrated

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.480
 what people do every day in the developer world.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.560
 Like just how much we're tooling.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.120
 Like they built such, it's when a company gets that big

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.520
 and Apple's the same way, like in terms of cash flow

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.640
 and just like amount of war chests

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.680
 that they have from their past success.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.360
 It's like they can't go away for decades.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.280
 - They can't go away, no.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.240
 I mean, and Microsoft,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.960
 the Microsoft developed the things interesting

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.400
 because that's not like that was new.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.400
 They actually owned a huge segment

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.400
 of the developer population for forever.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.560
 And like some of the most-

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.040
 - It's just they finally infiltrated the like-

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.320
 - Yeah, through the Twitter circles.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.560
 - Yeah, but through acquisitions mostly.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.720
 I know they built VS Code.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.920
 But again, VS Code is just an extension

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.840
 of what they've always been good at.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.960
 Visual Studio has always been very good.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.680
 And it's just gonna have flavor of that.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.320
 And they bought GitHub, they bought MPN and TypeScript.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.440
 You have to give them genuine credit for it.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.000
 I think that's also pretty good.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.280
 But again, just like, it's just C#.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.800
 - It's just derivatives of what they already had.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.840
 - Yeah, and if you think of like the 90% of developers

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.280
 quietly building in C# for the last decade,

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.760
 like it's not that surprising.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.600
 But it's just like, they kind of infiltrated

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.960
 the open source community.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.800
 - Yeah.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.720
 - And became cool in the last five years

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.560
 or whatever it's been.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.000
 - Yeah, I would say the big paradigm shifts though,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.280
 were cloud.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.040
 And I think they missed cloud, they were like to that.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.480
 They let a random company that never built stuff

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.320
 for developers win cloud.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.480
 - Which is another conversation.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.520
 How weird is it that Amazon makes most of their profit

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.640
 from AWS?

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.560
 Like the place where we buy everything

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.080
 makes most of their money selling compute.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.960
 - Yeah, it's pretty cool

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.160
 'cause it like subsidizes this crazy growth goal they have

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.680
 of like building this massive logistics business,

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.360
 which you could never do without a crazy amount of money.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.200
 - Yeah.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.320
 - That doesn't make you a lot of money.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.240
 So it's nice that they have this other thing.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.520
 It's, you would have never like predicted

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.600
 or strategized that at all.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.760
 It's like totally random.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.800
 - Right.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.400
 Going back to the Apple commercial.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.000
 So yeah, so Apple put out a commercial

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.080
 where it was one of those, what do you call it?

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.520
 Like a steel press, like a giant press steel.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.360
 - I've never thought of what the name for that is.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.680
 - What the name for that is filled with tools

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.800
 that artists use like instruments and cameras

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.520
 and things like that.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.280
 And then this thing slowly comes down crushes it all

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.120
 kind of in slow motion.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.920
 - It's like the thing that crushes cars, right?

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.280
 Like when they crush cars at the dump or whatever.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.320
 - Yeah, and then at the end you see an iPad

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.520
 and it's like the idea is this iPad can now do all this stuff.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.360
 And then response to it was crazy negative.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.280
 And I will say I was actually surprised

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.880
 at how much I also hated the commercial

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.320
 because I'm not like the most creative person.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.680
 Like I never played instruments.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.200
 Like a lot of those items don't resonate with me.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.040
 - Yeah.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.760
 - But I watched it and I was like, oh yeah, that feels bad.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.960
 And then it got to the part

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.720
 where it like broke the camera lenses.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.400
 And that's what really got me.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.240
 And I realized it's not like I'm like a photographer

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.520
 but like I know about camera lenses

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.720
 because I bought a bunch for my camera.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.680
 And it's like something I have like

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.320
 even just a little bit of context for.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.840
 And I was like, ooh, like I just know how expensive

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.000
 and nice those are.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.160
 And it just felt so like in my core back.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.520
 I didn't like seeing that.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.000
 And then I realized, okay, you know,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.520
 people that have like much deeper connection

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.000
 with these things like they must feel like 100 times worse.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.800
 And I will say as soon as I saw this commercial

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.680
 and as I saw that a lot of people didn't like it,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.320
 I didn't like it.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.520
 I knew somebody out there was gonna have the take of,

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.200
 well, everybody's talking about it.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.920
 So their plan worked.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.120
 Which to me, it's just like the dumbest thing ever

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.920
 because yes, that's definitely a dimension

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.440
 of things that people do.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.520
 But like also people just mess up.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.000
 That's the little thing that happens in the world

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.600
 where people just mess up.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.400
 Giving someone a in their core, like not intellectual

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.040
 dislike of something, giving like a disgust in their core.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.880
 That's not good.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.400
 It doesn't matter if everyone is talking about it.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.600
 Like it's very hard to do something that bad.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.120
 - There is actually bad press.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.640
 It turns out like visceral negative reactions

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.080
 towards your brand, probably not good in the long run.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.520
 It just felt very out of touch with like the current vibes

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.360
 in the world.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.960
 I feel like 10 years ago, maybe the ad would have been different.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.920
 But now it's like, I think there's a return to like

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.880
 things that are good and not just in our screens.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.960
 There's like kind of an aversion to everything

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.520
 just being on our phone or on our devices.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.720
 And like wanting to get back to the good real world stuff.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.320
 So it felt like a slap in the face to that.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.000
 Like they were just very out of touch with that.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.200
 And it's like, it came down to like the wrong ad pitch

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.040
 from the wrong agency.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.480
 Like Apple just like, they chose the wrong ad.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.720
 It's not like a huge deal.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.880
 It's not like this.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.960
 But I think it is kind of like emblematic of the Steve Jobs thing.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.680
 It's like Steve Jobs probably wouldn't have had that ad.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.720
 Like it takes just a few very like in touch people

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.640
 with a certain sense of style and a certain sense of everything

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.120
 that just like make the world go around.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.920
 And you lose that and Apple's just kind of like drifting.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.160
 And maybe that's dramatic, but.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.120
 - Yeah, I mean, you see that with a lot of things.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.240
 Like sometimes you'll see a similar team get together again

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.640
 and create something and it's worse.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.560
 And then you realize, okay, there's like some magic here

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.000
 that like only existed in a certain times.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.520
 And that might just come down to like a few people

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.360
 or a few situations.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.200
 Yeah, the, did you feel bad with watching the commercial?

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.280
 How did you feel about it?

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.160
 - So I've not watched it with the sound on.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.880
 I've just like watched it scrolling through a Twitter feed.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.640
 So maybe I need to watch it like up close.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.960
 I haven't even like clicked on it to make it big.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.480
 So I didn't even know there were camera lenses in it.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.340
 Maybe that would have got me.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.280
 - The piano thing, I would definitely get you.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.920
 - Yeah, some camera lenses.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.320
 - I think like, I didn't have strong feelings.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.800
 I didn't set down and really take the time to watch it.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.760
 So I should reserve my judgment.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.720
 But I think I get why people are upset.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.320
 Like I get the, it just kind of like goes against

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.000
 the current, current vibes in the community I feel like.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.920
 - Yeah, and I think that the other interesting part

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.480
 that I saw, Ryan Florence, I don't know if he saw

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.640
 all of his tweets, they were so funny.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.640
 He was like, I'm so mad that I can't even concentrate

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.120
 right now, but his perspective was-

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.440
 - He said he's laughing at how mad he was.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.920
 - It's a funny situation.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.400
 Well, it's funny 'cause a bunch of people

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.240
 had this reaction and I think Armin also had something

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.400
 similar where Armin described it in a funny way.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.320
 He was like, this iPad is such a negative,

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.320
 there's so many negative emotions associated with it

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.200
 in my house because my kids always want to use it

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.520
 and we always take it away from them.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.440
 It's always just like negative energy and memories

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.440
 around it and they were like, it was like this commercial

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.120
 made the enemy of my house like the hero or something.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.920
 It was something like that and I found that such a funny

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.240
 way to phrase it and I think Ryan Florence is that same

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.840
 thing where he was like, he just constantly has to argue

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.160
 with his kids to go do real things and they're always,

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.520
 you know, it just attached his advice.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.680
 So it just triggered all of this built up resentment

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.720
 and frustration in people.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.080
 - Such a good point that like the main use case for iPads

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.560
 is parents, their kids have an iPad.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.560
 Like literally that's the only reason we have iPads

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.840
 is our boys like they do their screen time on an iPad.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.120
 And that's like if Apple's trying to like replace

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.880
 creative tools with iPads, good luck because it hasn't

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.280
 happened yet, how long has iPad been out?

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.920
 Like 10 years and mostly they're for kids to watch YouTube.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.760
 Like that's the point of iPad.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.200
 - There's no other form factor, there's no over like purpose

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.800
 for that form factor I feel like, then like little tiny

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.440
 hands holding it on the couch, I don't know.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.160
 Here's another thing, and this is also funny because I watched

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.880
 this interview a couple of days ago, there's this guy

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.560
 Jonathan Haidt and he is, I don't know what he is,

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.680
 he's a researcher and but like most researchers

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.920
 are just researchers suck and are stupid.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.680
 But he's a very good researcher.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.500
 - That's such a DAX comment, most researchers are

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.240
 suck and they're stupid.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.660
 - Well most people in any field suck are stupid.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.200
 - Yeah, there's a few that are good, yeah.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.240
 - But researchers are supposed to be smart.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.240
 So I just might have to like, you know like with that comment

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.640
 that they're not actually.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.000
 Anyway, Jonathan Haidt and he wrote a book recently

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 around what seems to get very cliche topic, which is like,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.320
 you know, like phones are ruining everything or like,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.240
 you know, all the problems in the world are because of phones.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.080
 And that's kind of what it seems like on the surface.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.080
 But he is extremely smart and went super deep into this topic.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.160
 I'll post the video later of this interview and he talks

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.640
 so much about like he's like drilled down the exact analysis

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.640
 of like historically when these phones entered kids

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.800
 like childhoods.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.640
 - Yeah.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.080
 - And he talks a lot about what makes,

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.520
 what's important for a childhood and how exactly,

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.920
 very specifically, not just broadly or generically

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.600
 how phones kind of get in the way of that.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.640
 And it was such a good interview and it like really impacted

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.160
 the way I thought about everything and like, you know,

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.600
 when we have kids like how we're going to deal

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.480
 with the whole device thing with them.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.320
 - Oh, yeah.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.160
 How are you going to deal with it?

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.000
 - I need you to help me with your parenting,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.600
 like future parenting skills because you're going to be

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.440
 really good at it.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.760
 - Let me give, let me the person without any children

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.240
 that give you advice.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.080
 - Please.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.280
 - That's what parents love is when people are not kids.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.120
 (laughing)

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.160
 - It's actually having a dog.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.000
 It's nothing.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.840
 It's just the exact same thing.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.320
 (laughing)

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.240
 - How many times have your parents, they trust me

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.440
 when you have kids, it'll be different.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.640
 You won't look at your dog the same.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.720
 Have you heard that like a million times?

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.600
 - Yeah, yeah, I have, but I'm also better than everyone.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.440
 So I don't know.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.280
 - Oh yeah.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.120
 - I'm like, I just like--

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:09.960
 - That's how it was for you.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.280
 - For me, it's going to be totally different.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.280
 (laughing)

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.360
 Anyway, so in going into it, I was like,

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.240
 I know this is an issue and I know we have to be like

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.600
 really thoughtful about this, all of this,

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.160
 but I didn't think it was that big of a deal.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.840
 But now I'm like very much more on the side of,

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.360
 so he basically recommends that no cell phones

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.440
 so they're in high school.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.280
 - Yep.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.760
 - And the whole iPad thing, he just says like,

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.960
 just don't do it.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.880
 - Yeah.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.920
 - And he says the only reason it happens

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.440
 is there's weird social norm.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.040
 Everyone does it, so your kids like,

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.320
 well, they all have it, why can't I?

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.160
 - Yeah.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.600
 - And that's like impossible pressure.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.520
 And it's so funny, it's like a weird trap.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.760
 If a majority of people just randomly were like,

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.600
 we're not going to do this, the problem just goes away.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.560
 And that's why he pointed out.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.880
 They point out like all these like seemingly

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.720
 intractable problems, like mental health issues

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.520
 and like suicide and like all of these crazy things,

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.680
 it's literally, we could actually fix it in a year.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.480
 If like for a year, a majority of people

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.320
 commit it to living.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.240
 So that's kind of what he's pushing.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.200
 He's like, if we all just kind of agree to this,

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.200
 the pressure vanishes.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.960
 So he talks a lot about kids having to play

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.400
 like in person with each other.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.560
 It's different than interacting over the device.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.040
 Also unsupervised play.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:24.920
 And this is how I grew up.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.840
 And this is how a lot of us grew up.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.560
 Like I would hang out with my friends

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.160
 like around the neighborhood almost every day.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.120
 And there weren't adults, like we have to figure stuff out

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.280
 on our own.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.600
 I had some negative experiences, of course,

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.280
 but like they're fine.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.600
 Not everything is, you know, traumatic.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.600
 And so there's that and there's like risk taking

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.640
 like kids need to take risk and like be in situations

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.320
 where, you know, they could get hurt and they like

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.720
 are afraid and they like learn where the boundaries are

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.560
 or things like that.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.400
 - Interesting.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.640
 - And he talks about how the activities

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.720
 that people do on these devices or kids do on these devices

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.680
 replaces a lot of those interactions.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.120
 - And it's fundamental.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.040
 So I can see how I can totally see that.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.880
 I can see how that just takes up several hours

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.400
 that they would otherwise be doing something else.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.560
 And there's only X amount of hours in a day.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.840
 At this point, I'm like, yeah,

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.200
 it is just a weird social trap.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.200
 And I definitely want to try to like just not be part of that.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.520
 - Yeah, yeah, I heard something on,

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.000
 I think it was on Bill Simmons podcast.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.760
 He had this guy on, they talked about like future things,

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.160
 just like studies that are pointing at trends.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.840
 And one of the things was just about,

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.000
 and this has been known for a while,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.880
 but just that teenagers don't hang out anymore.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.120
 Like it's one thing like little kids growing up

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.720
 in the neighborhood, but like teenagers used to always

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.040
 spend time together.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.520
 That's how they socialize before phones.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.080
 Like when we were growing up and now it's just like

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.440
 non-existent that they don't go to each other's houses.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.320
 They don't like everything they do is online

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.800
 which is, yeah, you know, whether it's good or bad,

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.280
 you know that's a very different childhood.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.080
 And it's got to have serious impact.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.680
 - Yeah, the interesting thing he points out,

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.160
 he calls it like a two-faced thing.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.880
 He says in the 90s, this trend of like locking the kids up

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.440
 increased where like kids were kept at home.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.360
 And things that immediately changed then,

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.720
 like there wasn't all these big problems right after that.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.720
 But then the moment smartphones became a normal thing

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.600
 that kids have, the two of those things combined.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.920
 That's when everything triggered.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.000
 So yeah, yeah, I think it just like, you know,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.280
 becomes actually more of a problem.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.520
 - It almost like it feels like we kind of got really lucky.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.120
 I guess I'm five years old.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.800
 - Yeah, I feel the exact same way.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.640
 - Do you feel that way?

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.080
 - I got the whole thing and I was like, wow.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.840
 Like I could have been a totally different person.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.400
 Yeah, I just barely missed it.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.240
 Yeah.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.640
 - Like me specifically, so you're a little younger,

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.320
 but I got a phone, I think my sophomore year of high school,

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.120
 but they were the phones that was literally just like

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.880
 T9, SMS text messages.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.640
 Like there was no iPhone.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.760
 - I never had a smartphone in high school.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.760
 My parents didn't let me get one.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.320
 - Yeah, but I did have the ability to text my friends

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.440
 like my junior and senior year.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.480
 And I feel like that just added to our friendships.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.720
 Like I don't think that took away.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.320
 We weren't like on Snapchat or whatever.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.800
 Like we just like shoot texts as we're headed over

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.920
 to each other's houses and stuff.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.280
 So I feel like it timed out really well for me

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.640
 where like I got to enjoy some of the benefits

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.520
 without a lot of the downsides.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.920
 But yeah, just think like just 10 years difference.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.120
 Like growing up 10 years later

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.640
 and suddenly your whole life is different

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.880
 because of this technology that it's like there's,

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.680
 you realize at some point there's nobody really looking out

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.240
 for you as like a consumer.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.920
 Like nobody really knows what this means for society

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.280
 or for you as an individual.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.960
 And you're just kind of like it's playing out for you.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.960
 I feel like you have thoughts, something like that.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.720
 Like you would have opinions about technology

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.360
 and how it shapes our world and blah, blah, blah.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.200
 And it's just an interesting device or I don't know.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.840
 - I think it's mind blowing how quick this problem happened.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.800
 Like you said, we like just barely missed it

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.920
 by a matter of years of our stuff being impacted

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.280
 by this problem.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.480
 And it's now such like a giant problem

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.920
 and it just invented so quickly.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.200
 And I just can't believe that.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.480
 The other thing that Liz pointed out

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.040
 which is actually kind of crazy is

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.360
 we kind of have to fix it in our generation

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.760
 'cause we're the last people with memories

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.760
 of this other childhood.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.760
 - Yeah, right.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.000
 Oh, that's a great point.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.240
 Yeah, like it's on us and it's affected us too.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.640
 I mean like our adult life is changed because of phones.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.880
 I spend a lot of time on a phone, I wish I didn't.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.720
 - Same.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.840
 - So it's not like we escaped it completely.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.840
 It's just we escaped it during those formative years

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.800
 where I feel like I can't imagine like not having

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.320
 the childhood I had where just the social structure

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.280
 of having friends and spending time together.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.960
 Like if you take all that away, that's got to have impact.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.400
 And yeah, there's whole generations of kids

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.320
 that if we don't change something.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.160
 - Yeah.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.320
 - It's like we're the responsible adults in the room.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.160
 We got to fix it.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.360
 - So in this interview at the end,

00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.000
 he also relates it to a lot of the weird cultural stuff

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.840
 that exists now.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:05.480
 So he says that because kids didn't take risk

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.320
 and that's like a thing that disappeared,

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.120
 they entered college kind of unprepared.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.520
 And if you look at a lot of the discussions

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.800
 on in the past like 10 years,

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.320
 like the type of things that have been happening

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.360
 in college campuses, like we all agree free speech is good,

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.480
 but in a lot of these campuses,

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.320
 there's been things like, like striking people down

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.960
 or like suppressing speech because it would be bad

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.560
 for my mental health or it would like, you know,

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.080
 traumatize me, you know, there's like this weird,

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.800
 like he's a phrase illiberal,

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.160
 which I think is like very accurate,

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.240
 which is like the opposite of what?

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.080
 - Illiberal.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.960
 - Yeah, it's like illiberal to like,

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.260
 try to suppress people in general.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.100
 - Yeah.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.800
 - And he theorizes that this new thing emerged

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.200
 because of, you know, this is all related.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.040
 - Yeah.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.200
 - That there's like this weird fragility.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.920
 So he talks a lot about,

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.440
 the book is about how to raise an anti-fragile child,

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.720
 which I love 'cause anti-fragile's like one of my favorite

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.680
 concepts from the few other books that I've read.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.720
 - Yeah, to lab.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.560
 - Yeah, to lab.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.320
 - Yeah, so he talks about like the fragility

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.320
 and he like links it all together.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.400
 And he also talks about how,

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.400
 so how he's an atheist and the extreme downside of that

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.840
 is not having community and how he has to work extra hard.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.720
 And he points out how people that are religious

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.680
 are generally happier, like on average.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.520
 - Yeah.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.480
 - And a lot of the, you know, kids don't have

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.280
 this exact problem because there's a lot of built-in

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.920
 community stuff that happens.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.880
 - So he ties like a lot, a lot of things together

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.680
 and I found it super interesting.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.520
 - What's the book?

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.360
 What was it called or is it a book or something else?

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.840
 How can I read this or consume it in some way?

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.000
 - It's called, well, I'll link the anxious generation.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.440
 I'll link you to the, it was an interview on the daily show.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.760
 It was like a 20 minute interview.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.720
 Here's a crazy part.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.600
 So I watched it and then I told Liz,

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.160
 hey, you should watch, like I want to show you this thing.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.280
 I think you'll find it really interesting.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.600
 And I described it the same way I said.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.840
 I was like, he's a, I think he's like a sociologist

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.680
 but he's not stupid.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.760
 He's really smart.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.640
 (laughing)

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.320
 - And just insulting an entire profession.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.240
 He's a sociologist, but he's not stupid.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.160
 Like he's actually smart.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.600
 (laughing)

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.480
 - And she goes, oh, is it Jonathan Hate?

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.480
 And I was like, how did you know?

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.320
 - That's amazing.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.760
 - And it's like the most random guess ever

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.840
 because she, so she, Liz used to be a researcher.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:33.840
 It's like, oh really?

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.280
 That's where she started.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.120
 And she like came across as a work

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.280
 very early on and was like really formative for her.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.920
 And he was, he wrote a lot about a completely different topic

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.680
 like 20 years ago and she feels like, like 15 years ago

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.040
 and she feels like it was totally correct and totally accurate.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:48.880
 - Yeah.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.440
 - And just me describing him in this way

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.400
 was enough for her to tie it together.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.760
 - That's amazing.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.280
 I get the, I get the researcher vibes from Liz.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.000
 I've gotten to work with Liz on,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.800
 she's been very heavily involved with Terminal.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.920
 It's been great to have her, her brain.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.440
 And yeah, I see the researcher in that.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.720
 - And to be clear, the reason I insult researchers

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.400
 is because I've learned so much

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.600
 from her explaining what that world is like.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.440
 - Yeah.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.280
 - Plus like my own arrangement.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.120
 - Plus like my own arrangement.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:17.960
 - Yeah.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.800
 - Yeah.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.160
 - There's other stuff to talk about.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.000
 - Is there?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.480
 - I feel like there's something else happening

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.560
 that I wanted to talk about.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.880
 I make notes in my brain like about things later

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.040
 and then I forget, I don't write them down.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.880
 - The writing thing's down is so lame.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.880
 - What's that?

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.200
 That's not, I guess, yeah.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.200
 - Yeah, it's an opposite of notes.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.040
 - Oh, I got something.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:36.880
 I got something.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.000
 This is not a big deal.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.600
 But do you ever like have a thought

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.160
 and you just immediately know like,

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.800
 I'm a person I don't want to be?

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.600
 Like I had the thought the other day,

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600
 I got a haircut.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.160
 And have we ever talked about haircuts on the podcast?

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.520
 I feel like no.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.360
 - Probably not.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.560
 - Because it probably wouldn't come up from me.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:04.440
 - Okay, well, here's the thing about haircuts is,

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.920
 I mean, you've had haircuts in your life.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.720
 You can relate to this.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.040
 - I had a haircut last week.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.360
 - Oh, well, there you go.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.760
 But do you do it yourself or do you like go to a barber?

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.720
 - So I usually shave my head myself,

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.400
 but then sometimes the past couple weeks

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.200
 I've been super busy, so I've been really off of it.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.880
 And when I let my hair group to go too long,

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.600
 like right now it's a little too long.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.320
 It's like a pain they ask me to do it myself.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.360
 So I will just go and get like a really nice--

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.200
 - You go to a barber.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.560
 - Yeah, they like massage my head.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.800
 Like this is like a, yeah, good.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.160
 - Do you talk to your barber?

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.080
 Like do you feel like you have a relationship with your barber?

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.000
 - Okay, so I've always been someone

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.560
 that hates talking to people.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.520
 - Yes, me too.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.320
 - I've always hated going to the barber.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.400
 - Yes, me too.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.280
 Okay, we have the same thought.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.600
 - But that said, at some point in my life

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.760
 I like kind of recognize that this is just like a weakness.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.840
 It's one of those things where it's like

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.120
 some people are extroverted and some people are introverted

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.000
 and they're both good.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.920
 I don't actually agree with that.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.560
 I think it just barely be introverted

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.860
 and being introverted is just a flaw.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.700
 - A flaw.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.040
 - So at some point I was like,

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.640
 I should work on this part of myself.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.940
 So I tried to be better

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.560
 and the barber I kept going to,

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.800
 I was like, I had like a better rhythm with.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.840
 You know, I was like, you know,

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.000
 it was like away from your practice,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.320
 that type of thing.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.520
 But I stopped going.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.280
 So I started shaving my own head.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.840
 And then I went again last week

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.560
 because I thought I'd grow up too long

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.920
 and he was not, he doesn't work there anymore.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.080
 He's not there anymore.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:24.920
 - Oh no.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.760
 - Still got a new person.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.600
 I'm like, okay, great.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.320
 Okay, I can practice this again.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.520
 He doesn't speak English that well.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.040
 - Oh, that's the dream.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.440
 - He would prefer not to talk.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.480
 And my instinct is to not talk.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.240
 So we just didn't talk at all.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.480
 (laughing)

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.120
 - So I'm always like,

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.120
 this has been a thing I hate about getting haircuts.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.320
 I mean, I just, it's a thing I hate to take time

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.240
 out of the week till they go get a haircut.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.240
 But then I extra hate it

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.000
 'cause I just hate that social pressure

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.440
 of like carrying on a conversation with a stranger.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.000
 And I guess like I've gotten my haircut

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.480
 from the same person for two years or something now.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.120
 So it's not a stranger,

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.680
 but like we have nothing in common.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.760
 And it just, I've had barbers in the past

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.200
 where like they're very easy to talk to.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.520
 And it's just kind of like, it's not a pressure.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.920
 But most of the experiences I have,

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.960
 maybe it's a flaw of mine.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.880
 I'm an introvert.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.440
 Most of the experiences are not great

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.280
 where it's like, we don't have like a good rhythm

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.560
 with talking and it's just very forced

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.880
 and it feels awkward to just set there in silence.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.240
 But I just want to set there in silence.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.080
 And the thought I had,

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.120
 tying it back to the beginning when I said,

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.200
 do you ever have a thought?

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.400
 And you're just like, oh man.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.920
 Like I sometimes I have a thought and I think like,

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.320
 I am that tech bro that I don't want to be.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.680
 Like, it's like not wanting to become your father

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.600
 or something, but knowing you will become your father.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.560
 But it's like, for me, it's not wanting to be a tech bro.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.160
 And I had the thought like, man,

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.800
 I wonder if I could just wear airpods.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.440
 Like, could I just listen to podcasts?

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.280
 (laughing)

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.360
 I get my aircraft, would that be awkward?

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.040
 Would he be like, what an idiot?

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.400
 Or would he be like, no, this is nice.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.920
 We don't have to talk now.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.960
 Is that terrible?

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.960
 - I think that zoomed in in a situation,

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.560
 I'm sure of course there's some barbers

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.400
 that are like, I just don't want to talk to the person,

00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.800
 but they feel pressure like they have to.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.000
 And the person feels like,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.440
 and then it's like this awkward thing that nobody wants.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.840
 So I totally see that.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.840
 But if you like step back in like,

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.320
 thinking about like, what is the point of being alive,

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.480
 like that thing feels wrong, right?

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.000
 That's why you feel bad. - Okay, fine.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.760
 - You're being self aware and you feel bad

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.840
 and that's why you don't want to become that person.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.680
 - I know.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.120
 - Here's another funny bit.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.960
 So the barbershop I go to is like,

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.960
 this crazy masculine Miami spot.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.480
 All the barbers are just so cool.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.840
 And they have just like great rhythm with each other.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.800
 And like, it's just, it's like the highest challenge

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.760
 as like an introvert.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.760
 So like go in there.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.200
 They have to don't just so like swaggy and like.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.040
 - Yeah.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.280
 - It's just a, it's a crazy environment.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.960
 So I look at it as like, it gets an opportunity for me to

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.800
 - To work on that area.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.360
 - Practice these things that are useful everywhere.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.560
 I don't know if your spot, necessarily,

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.680
 you can look at it that way.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.040
 - Well, this last time I just went a couple of days ago,

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.160
 I was the only person in there.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.880
 There was no other barbers, it was just me and him.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.880
 It's a giant room.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.560
 And it was kind of awkward like,

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.640
 where are all the people?

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.640
 What happened?

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.480
 But like, is it just Monday afternoon?

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.200
 This is what it looks like at the barbershop.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.640
 What, you said the point of being alive.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.120
 What is the point of being alive, Dax?

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.000
 'Cause it like, is it to be social?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.840
 Is that it?

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.200
 - If you could go and watch a replay of your life,

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.720
 would you feel bad that you wore air pods during?

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.560
 - Yes.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.400
 - Yeah, you would.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.240
 - I would.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.040
 - It would be like, this is convenient, but.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.360
 - I have all this terrible, I hate to even say this out loud,

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.360
 but I have all these thoughts like,

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.800
 oh man, imagine if I could listen to my book

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.640
 while I'm getting my haircut.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.920
 That's like a whole 'nother hour.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.760
 (laughs)

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.600
 It's just so bad.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.440
 - No.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.280
 - I'm such an idiot.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.320
 - I have to say, we all have the same things.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.680
 It's like, we're always trying to figure out a like,

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.680
 multi-task.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.960
 - Yeah, like min-max.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.520
 Like, yeah, the amount of, I don't know,

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.360
 learning and whatever I can do in a day.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.600
 It's so stupid.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.440
 - Yeah.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.560
 It's just like, so I, you know,

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.480
 when I blow bubbles for Zuko in the morning.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.480
 - Yeah, you do that. We haven't talked about that

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480
 on a podcast, have we?

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.680
 - I don't think we've talked about it.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.520
 - No, I talk about it all the time.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.600
 We've talked about it several times.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.600
 - Oh, have we?

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.600
 - I think it's just so surprising every time

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.520
 I bring it up, it just feels like it's the first time

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.360
 that I'm talking about it.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.200
 - I love this.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.040
 Fartier routine, yeah.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.960
 - Anyway, every morning, first thing I do,

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.120
 I go outside and Zuko is super excited

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.320
 'cause he knows what's gonna happen.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.880
 I blow bubbles for him for 10 minutes

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.720
 and he goes crazy, gets super tired.

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:21.080
 I used to just do this normally,

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.920
 but my new habit has been listening to my book.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.760
 - Yeah.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.580
 - Good morning.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.440
 So I listen for just like during my morning routine,

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.040
 including that, and it's fine.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.560
 And, you know, I don't really have a problem with it,

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.880
 even if I step back and look at it.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.480
 Like I, that's like my time to do that.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.760
 I don't really listen to it otherwise,

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.720
 but I'm definitely like connecting with my dog less.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.240
 And like we play again in the evening

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.400
 and that's like more direct

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.760
 and it's like a totally different thing.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.760
 Like I'm actually like--

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.600
 - Yeah.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.040
 - I'm having a completely different experience

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.200
 and that experience is way more valuable

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.000
 than listening to this book.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.360
 So I do recognize that like I'm getting more done

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.560
 and I'm like, you know, double stacking,

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.320
 both of these things that I need to do together,

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.280
 but it's like what's a point kind of?

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.080
 - Yeah, I had the same realization

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.360
 with playing with my three year old.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.640
 When he was little or it just felt like,

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.400
 I mean, like I could listen to stuff, like what's the deal?

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.800
 Like at first it felt a little bad.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.640
 Like I'm listening to a stupid audio book

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.920
 while I'm playing with my three year old.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.760
 And then it was just kind of like became normal.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.160
 But then it, I think as he got a little older,

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.640
 it became more obvious that like,

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.880
 what am I doing in life?

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.080
 Like I'm missing something.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.240
 If I'm spending all my time,

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.160
 but I can possibly spend just like listening

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.920
 to some stupid biography.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.800
 But what's the point?

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.520
 Like why even have kids?

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.440
 Why even have a family?

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.760
 Like I'm not even going to be here.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.680
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.520
 It's just a weird thing.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.280
 Like even just making eye contact more than you normally would.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.640
 It's like a completely different thing.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.880
 Yeah, we all suck.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.720
 - We all suck.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:50.560
 - I'll play this way.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.600
 - Yeah, there's certain things I don't want to be.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.560
 And then I realized how much there's like this draw

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.400
 towards that.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.200
 It's like this inevitable path that I feel like I'm on.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.600
 I guess it's not inevitable though.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.600
 It's conversations like these.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.800
 I can break out of it.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.840
 I can not wear my AirPods at the barber.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.160
 I can start talking to my barber.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.000
 I can try.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.040
 He mostly just talks about movies

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.560
 and I just don't watch movies much.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.640
 It's like that when there's other barbers in the room,

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.760
 they're just constantly talking about

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.280
 like the new movie that came out.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.120
 And I'm like, I just,

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.080
 I have nothing to say here.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.720
 I haven't watched a movie in the theater in like 10 years.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.880
 That's a challenge, right?

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.320
 Like when there's a conversation going on

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.080
 that you can't directly relate to,

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.400
 like how can you still be like an interesting,

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.640
 useful member of that conversation?

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.280
 You know, that's definitely,

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.280
 and there's people that do that extremely well, right?

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.720
 Like you see people that are just very charismatic.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.920
 - I mean, now you've got me viewing

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.880
 like the intro extrovert thing totally differently.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.280
 Like it really is just better to be like personable

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.160
 and somebody people want to be around.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.000
 - Of course.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.320
 - Of course it's better.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.480
 - But I'm an introvert.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.320
 It's like, oh, you're just not very fun to be around.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.160
 - Cool.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.480
 - Enjoy that in life.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:57.400
 - Yeah, it's like the world exists as it is.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.200
 And it goes with people and writing to each other.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.640
 So it's just worse when it's hard for you to do that.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.320
 - That's such a good point.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.600
 Do you do like personality tests?

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.260
 Do you have any opinions on like,

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.920
 any how am I get sucked into this stuff?

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.160
 And I think we've probably talked about it.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.360
 We're coming up on a hundred episodes.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.640
 We've talked about everything at this point.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.800
 It's just gonna be a lot of rehashing.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.160
 If you listen to this podcast, good luck.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.360
 It's just gonna be a lot of the same stuff for the next hundred.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.360
 But like, every time I do a personality test

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.360
 or I'm like, it all made aware of them for a week.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.120
 I'm blown away at like,

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.560
 that we all just fit into these very clean buckets.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.680
 Like that's so, it seems so scientific and truth

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.000
 that like, you can't escape it.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.320
 You are a certain type of person.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.560
 Do you believe in that stuff?

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.640
 Or is it not even believing?

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.480
 I don't know what it is.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.560
 - I think that my experience of personality tests

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:52.560
 is I think I personally am a very obvious stereotype

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.280
 of like a persona.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.640
 And the stereotype has been around for like,

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.000
 years and years and years.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.680
 And it's like, whatever.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.240
 So whenever I take a personality test,

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.080
 it feels like a psychic reading.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.520
 It's like, - Yeah, yeah.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.960
 - Describes weird details that are so crazy accurate.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.960
 - And if you do it with your significant other,

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.880
 it's like, you keep looking at each other like,

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:14.880
 (laughs)

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.720
 - Exactly.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.600
 (laughs)

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.640
 - What did they know?

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:19.480
 - But at the end of the day,

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.680
 they're just horoscopes for slightly smarter people.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.760
 You know, that's really all it is.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.240
 - So is it just a pseudoscience?

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.160
 Like it's not real?

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.800
 - I think there's a lot of value in it.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.800
 Cause like I said, this, this,

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.880
 I am a real stereotype.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.720
 That is a real thing.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.240
 And if you read that, you will understand.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.080
 - Yeah.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.040
 - A lot about me and my behavior.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.840
 And it's impressive that we've been able to like,

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.120
 identify that.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:39.960
 - Yeah.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.000
 - A lot of it though,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.680
 there's definitely a dimension of,

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.760
 it's phrasing away that anyone could read

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.000
 and see it in themselves.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.440
 Even if it's like crazy specific.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.720
 We're just kind of what a horoscope.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.560
 - That's what a horoscope is.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.320
 - People that do horoscopes are psychic readings.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.520
 They kind of do the same thing, right?

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.680
 As it feel really specific,

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.360
 but like secretly be really broad, you know?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.280
 - So I think they're useful.

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.120
 And I think they're real.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:06.920
 It's just that there's other kind of illusion going on too.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.400
 Cause it never includes,

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.440
 you only remember all the stuff that it got, right?

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.680
 You don't think about like--

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.520
 - The stuff that wasn't really--

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.560
 - Like this and that wasn't in there.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.000
 But like you have to be really self aware

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.760
 of exactly what you're like to be looking for that.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.880
 So you just would never find it there.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.720
 - Yeah.

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.560
 - The horoscopes for smarter people,

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.560
 that stuck with me.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.400
 I'll remember that.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.960
 - I gotta find a better way to phrase that.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.040
 Cause I don't actually want to say smarter people.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.640
 I want to say something like horoscopes

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.880
 for people that think they're smart.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.720
 I think that's what I--

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.560
 - I think they're actuals.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.400
 Something like that.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.800
 - I didn't know you were a stereotype.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.640
 You seem very unique.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.320
 I don't know anybody like you.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.120
 At least not your like online persona.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.200
 If you look at, I mean, a lot of people get this result,

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.040
 INTJ.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.840
 I wouldn't be surprised if you're also an INTJ.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.680
 - I'm an INTJ.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.520
 Yeah.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.760
 - Exactly.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.600
 Yeah.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.440
 But if you, I would probably argue

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.440
 if you read the INTJ description,

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.400
 you probably think it applies to you.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.960
 But I think you would probably say,

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:03.680
 I have exaggerated versions of a lot of those traits.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.400
 But I think it tends to like really like stick out for me.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.160
 But yeah, I guess that a lot of people are technically

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.040
 the founder of that bucket.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.280
 - Yeah, okay.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.400
 - I took another test that they make kids in high school take

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.680
 to like figure out their career path.

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.520
 - Oh, what's it called?

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.960
 - Like what good careers?

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.880
 - Yeah, I think I've done this.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.600
 - I forgot, had a name, but I forgot.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.440
 - Yeah.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.280
 - It was a long test.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.640
 It took me like 30 minutes to complete

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.920
 and the result were terrible.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.880
 Like it was just wasn't that good at all.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.000
 It gave me this really complex visualization and like,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.160
 yeah, like I could see like the career path I've chosen

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.880
 that I think is right in there somewhere,

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.920
 but it was like kind of a reach.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.200
 The thing that I told me to do,

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.680
 I forgot what it told me to do directly,

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:48.360
 it was like just not related to what I would want to do ever

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.280
 at all.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:53.280
 - It's kind of like a miracle that anybody has ever

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.960
 like happy with their work,

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.280
 that we end up in stuff that I can feel very fortunate,

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.400
 I guess, that I enjoy what I do.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.160
 Because you think about like high school

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.920
 and like somehow going into adulthood

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.960
 and figuring out a path that makes sense,

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.760
 that you actually make a living doing.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.800
 Like there's no preparing,

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.880
 there's no like aptitude tests or whatever,

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.080
 they're really gonna get you there, right?

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.800
 Like guidance counselors in high school,

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.560
 they don't have any idea what you should do.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.240
 It's kind of funny that that's even a role

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.080
 as I think about it.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.640
 Like to look at a high school kid and be like,

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.240
 you'd be a good construction worker.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.080
 Like who knows?

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:29.920
 What?

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.200
 (laughing)

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.720
 - Is that what guys counselors do?

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.360
 - I don't know, don't they like try and help you

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.320
 like decide what you should study in college

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.240
 so you can decide what you should work on in life?

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.760
 I think college is all made up too, sorry, go ahead.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.960
 - Well, I had, I mean, you know where I went to high school

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.600
 was like this crazy like competitive high school

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.000
 where everybody was like,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.560
 already had a lot of drive around those things.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.720
 The guidance counselors in our school.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.560
 - Yeah, and I went to Willow Springs High School.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.360
 Sorry. (laughing)

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.640
 - The guidance counselors in our school

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.480
 was like, had nothing to add in that dimension.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.520
 They weren't like, most of the kids are like,

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.080
 I already knew I was gonna be a doctor

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:05.920
 by age of three

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.640
 and like they're just being on my trajectory

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.640
 for their whole life.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.540
 - That is not my experience.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.200
 - Yeah, I think for us and guys,

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.920
 we're there to like make sure people didn't kill themselves

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.000
 'cause they were studying too hard.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.440
 Like it was a very different type of role.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.640
 - Yeah, our guys counselors were there

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.880
 to make sure we didn't kill ourselves over meth.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.640
 I think that was the main thing.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.120
 (laughing)

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.360
 Like if you just go to college,

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.160
 that's success, you know, rural Ozarks.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:34.200
 But then like, have we talked about college?

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.360
 - I just think college is the biggest scam ever.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.480
 Is it because I got into tech?

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.200
 Yeah, more and more so, right?

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.640
 Like when I see those charts where like college costs

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.440
 have increased by whatever,

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.880
 it's like they were already really high.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.760
 And the fact that they're outpacing inflation

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.600
 is just such a joke that we keep doing it.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.440
 Like why do people still go to college?

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.640
 I mean, I guess what's the alternative,

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.160
 but like, I don't know, not going to college?

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.120
 That's an alternative.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.560
 - If you don't know what to do,

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.360
 it seems like a safe bet,

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.120
 which is probably at the root of it all,

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.080
 that's what it comes down to.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.720
 It's unclear what you should be doing.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.560
 So you do that.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.720
 - It's such an expensive thing

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.360
 just to like continue to draw out adulthood

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.320
 and try and figure, like to draw out your childhood

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.720
 and delay adulthood is what it feels like.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.480
 - Yeah, going to my brother's graduation was funny

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:19.400
 'cause I'd never had that like prototypical college experience.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.240
 - Yeah.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.560
 - And he like had it like to a tee.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.960
 Like it was like the house he lived in was on

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:28.000
 like this perfect, like big college house

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:28.840
 with a bunch of kids lived.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.520
 But it was nice and it was like really cool street

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.760
 and like walked to campus and it was like, you know,

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:35.600
 exactly what you mentioned.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.000
 - So the classic college life is still alive and well,

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.720
 like it hasn't changed.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.080
 - Yeah, but here's a funny bit.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.520
 So during the graduation, by the way, I hate graduations.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.680
 Everyone hates graduations.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.520
 - Everyone hates it.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.360
 Why do we even do it?

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.180
 - Why do we even do it?

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.020
 - It's the most boring thing ever.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.280
 Everyone is just miserable torture.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.360
 Yeah, the students don't care.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.200
 Nobody likes it.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.040
 - No, nobody cares.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:53.860
 - But anyway, we still do it.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:54.700
 - It's like LinkedIn.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.100
 Let's stop pretending that we care.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.880
 (laughing)

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.960
 - Same thing to something fake.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.040
 I just think I'll link them.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.880
 So they had a speaker and this was a grad,

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.500
 someone who had graduated from the school

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.960
 and like was involved in like alumni board

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.560
 something, something, and they were talking about like,

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.360
 this was Indiana University.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.320
 They were saying things like, when you leave here,

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.960
 like you're not done with IU.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.880
 The IU network is gonna be part of your whole life.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.760
 And there's like a hundred thousand people still,

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.280
 and you're just talking about how every part

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.560
 of your career was gonna be influenced by IU.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.360
 And my brother told me, my brother's reaction was like,

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.440
 what are they talking about?

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:36.080
 And he was saying that someone behind him was like,

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:36.920
 what the hell?

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.160
 Like I don't even have a job.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.760
 (laughing)

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.280
 The IU network hasn't done anything for me.

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.800
 And it's just like totally this fake exaggerated thing.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.200
 But like a lot of it is that, it's like performative.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.320
 And they know it's, they wanna make you believe that

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.440
 if you're a part of this thing, it's gonna impact you forever

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.760
 and it's gonna be serving you forever.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.880
 And that's the way they want you to see it.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.160
 But you know, it's just not true.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.280
 Like nothing can, there's nothing like that

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.600
 that's gonna save you, right?

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.560
 Like just 'cause you went to this school

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:07.240
 isn't gonna like save you from like all the things

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.480
 that can happen in the world and like the competition

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.540
 and the chaos and all that.

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.600
 But they definitely frame it like all of college

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.480
 in schools frame where if you do X, Y, and Z

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.040
 you guarantee this outcome, which is just not true.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.800
 And that's a part that I don't like about that whole system.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.040
 - Yeah, like I guess the alternative to,

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.040
 like I would never want my kids just

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:31.160
 going to college and doing the whole like standard

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.520
 American path 'cause it just feels so doomed.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.440
 But like, can everyone like chart their own path?

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.960
 Is there like, yeah, I know you've talked in the past

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:43.640
 about like we need certain things to just be decided for us

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.600
 and like to have easy paths in certain areas of life.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.360
 Can everybody take the difficult path

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.840
 where they chart their own way?

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.080
 Like I feel like we've done it, like we've definitely

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.680
 had careers where we didn't do the typical thing.

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.560
 But like if most of everyone did that,

00:45:58.560 --> 00:45:59.720
 is that even possible?

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.640
 Kind of like an economy be made up

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.600
 of mostly solopreneuror types?

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.640
 - I have no clue.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.240
 Like it's really confusing.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.800
 I would argue though that--

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.280
 - Let's get Liz researching on that.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.960
 (laughing)

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.560
 - I would argue that it's actually more like that

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.360
 than most people think.

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:21.600
 Like if you look at Liz's entire family,

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.400
 none of them have like corporate jobs

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.760
 'cause they came here as immigrants from Cuba,

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.920
 like they're not gonna land a corporate job.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.720
 So they all just ended up having like random--

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.360
 - Well that was offensive, but continue.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.800
 (laughing)

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.800
 - Let's get out of it.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.600
 No one would ever hire those cubers.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.440
 - Yeah.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.040
 - You've been executives, are you kidding?

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:38.880
 - Sorry.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.840
 - Yeah, so they all just ended up having these

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.000
 like really random careers.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.960
 And a lot of them ended up with small businesses.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.440
 We know one of them ended up with like

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:51.480
 the biggest business business that I've ever seen.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:55.120
 - Yeah, so like the whole family,

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.840
 like just figured out random stuff.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.960
 And that's like a large number of people.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.360
 Like not a single person in her parents' generation,

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.720
 which is like, you know,

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.240
 within the family has like 100 people,

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.280
 had that traditional path.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.320
 And there was like plenty of room for them

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.920
 to figure out all this random stuff.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.600
 - Is that a uniquely immigrant thing?

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.440
 - I think immigrants are,

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.160
 because of just the situation,

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.440
 like they're forced to that.

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.840
 But even what's the idea of like a corporate job?

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.880
 Like when did that show up?

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.520
 Maybe like after World War II is my guess.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:28.000
 Like the idea of like getting a job at a company

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.920
 and like working your way up and like going

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.840
 into the office and following the structures.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.320
 - It seems so fake and dumb to me.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.400
 I'm sorry.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.640
 It's like, I feel like most of our economy

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.080
 is just fluff that doesn't need to exist.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.920
 It's just, it feels like you can get rid of like

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:46.160
 whole giant towers full of people that are doing fake jobs

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.560
 and everything we continue.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.400
 - Like what are they doing?

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.240
 It's like--

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.080
 - What are they doing?

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.560
 - Okay, we have these documents

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.840
 and we need you to like take every third word

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.080
 from this document and put it into this other document

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.440
 so that this other person can do the same thing

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.880
 backwards the other way.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:01.840
 And that's what it seems like.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.040
 How can this, how can we have enough?

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.120
 And that was another thing in the graduation.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.000
 I was like looking at all like these thousands

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.400
 of children effectively.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.840
 And I'm like, someone's going to pay these people

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.680
 to do what?

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:17.280
 Like what, all of these people are about to go?

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.360
 Like what in the world like most of them have jobs?

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.640
 Like why, like why is anyone paying them to do anything?

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.480
 Like--

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.880
 - I think that's where the root of my question comes from

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:30.520
 is like, does there just need to be like this giant middle,

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:34.480
 like 80% of the working class is just like fake jobs

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.560
 because we don't, there's not really enough room

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:41.560
 for everybody to do like creating and creating jobs.

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:45.920
 And like that has to necessarily be a small percentage

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.880
 of the working, I don't know.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.160
 - Do you know what I'm getting at?

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.240
 - I think it's just one of those things

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.680
 that's just beyond human comprehension.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.880
 Like we can understand the scale of the universe

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.680
 and we also can't understand how the hell 300 million people

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:57.520
 have work.

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.880
 (laughing)

00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.720
 - That's just America.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:04.720
 - Yeah, just like doesn't make any sense at all.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.680
 But I don't know.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.680
 I have no answers here.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.520
 It's just like--

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.520
 - I guess we don't need to understand.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.960
 I don't know what I would do with the information

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:11.800
 if I had it.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.800
 It's just like one of those questions

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.720
 that I feel like keeps nagging at me.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.320
 - I know I've brought this up in various forms

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.960
 over the course of the podcast even.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.400
 Like there's just something about the,

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.960
 it ties into the college thing.

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.480
 It ties into the like typical path that someone,

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.440
 maybe it's as apparent.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:30.120
 Maybe I'm just trying to get ahead of like,

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:33.760
 how do I help steer my kids in the right direction?

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.440
 - That's where I think of it about it too.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.960
 It's like, I think ultimately you just want them

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.560
 to be curious and like look for opportunities

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.520
 and follow things.

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.120
 And I think it just as broad as that.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.680
 But yeah, I mean, I think the reality is,

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.720
 I do think a lot more people are in this like,

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:52.000
 doing my own weird thing category than we imagine.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.840
 It's just not in areas that we typically see.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:55.800
 Like I said, I only see it

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.160
 'cause Liz's family's in that category,

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.120
 but it's all sorts of random stuff.

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.800
 Like one person will become a vet.

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.480
 And when you're like a vet, you're,

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.400
 I know that's an official--

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.400
 - You're a small business owner.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.960
 - Yeah, you're like running a small business

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.080
 and like someone else does construction.

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.080
 And someone else, like all of those are like,

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:17.080
 big pool of construction is a huge part of our economy.

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:17.960
 - Yeah.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.440
 - And a lot of that is like this,

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.280
 just doing random stuff thing.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.280
 - Yeah.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.400
 Yeah, so maybe it is much more of the economy

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.400
 than I realized, like small business owners,

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.200
 it's not just like I have a storefront in town

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.160
 and I have a small business.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.960
 Like it's so many different professions

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.720
 or inherently small business owners.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.800
 - Yeah, realtor is doing contract work or whatever.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.800
 - Yeah.

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.200
 Like it's kind of all in that same thing.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.160
 - Yeah, so now as I think about it,

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.320
 like in my area where I'm at,

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.360
 like in the, in Southwest Missouri in the Ozarks,

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.560
 there's not a lot of like corporate jobs.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.520
 Like there's not a lot of like those fake jobs

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.480
 that I can't understand

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.200
 because there's not big corporations here.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.080
 It's like, it mostly is the small business thing.

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.080
 Interesting, maybe it is the way I want it to be.

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.000
 Maybe the world looks more like I'd like it to

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:03.920
 than I realize.

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:07.120
 And I just see stuff played out in pop culture

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.200
 with the like climbing the corporate ladder.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.720
 And I'm like, what is that?

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:14.120
 - Yeah, I definitely, I'm like, yeah, I think that stuff is,

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.560
 just doesn't make any sense to me, but.

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:19.480
 - It's like college and fraternities and corporate ladders.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.000
 Those all are like somehow binded together for me

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.880
 and it just seems so dumb and fake.

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.140
 (laughing)

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:32.240
 - The other thing is, I think a lot of jobs

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.800
 are with the government, so,

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.600
 and like the government's always to kind of like make up jobs.

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.960
 Like a lot of things are just jobs programs in disguise.

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.980
 Like the one we recently had experience with, USPS.

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:44.960
 (laughing)

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.640
 We're dropping off all the terminal packages there.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.360
 It is so wild, like we went.

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.320
 So we had like, how about half of our stuff was UPS,

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.240
 half of our stuff was USPS.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.440
 You go to UPS, they have a process,

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.400
 they're like, leave your stuff here,

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.120
 they get you in and out, they're done.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.480
 You go to USPS and like, nobody knows anything.

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.800
 Like we go there and it's a big post,

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.360
 like big post office in one in town.

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.360
 Is it a big one?

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.120
 There's nobody behind the desk anyway.

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.000
 There's no employees.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.080
 It is a bunch of customers saying around,

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.400
 looking around like, where the hell is anyone.

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.560
 Then finally someone shows up and we're like,

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.720
 okay, we have all these boxes where we put them.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.200
 And she just like, doesn't know.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.320
 And then she's like, go around the back to the loading dock.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.840
 And we're like, okay, we like, go look,

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.480
 there's no, there's no around back loading dock.

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.720
 This is just not a real thing.

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.200
 She's like, made it off.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.560
 And then we go back and then we ended up like,

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:40.520
 leaving it in this random like quarter.

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.440
 And apparently they do get shipped

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.480
 and they get destroyed in the process as well.

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.480
 - What is the deal?

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.680
 I've never seen anything.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:52.680
 I mean, I guess we shipped like several hundred boxes at once.

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.240
 So I guess there's some percentage of those

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.760
 that are going to get, they're going to have a hard time.

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.200
 But it seemed like a large percentage of our boxes

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.680
 just got drop kicked and like torn.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.200
 Some of the boxes were like torn over some of the coffee.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.840
 Like some people, the box was so beat up

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.480
 that the coffee bag fell out during shipping.

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.400
 How is that even possible?

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.320
 Multiple pages.

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.000
 - The thing that cracks me up is the person

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.760
 delivering the last step of that being like,

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:24.000
 yeah, like this is something like a fucked up empty box.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.200
 I'm just kidding.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.520
 - I've never heard that anyway.

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:30.480
 - I don't understand.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.320
 - Oh my God.

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.160
 - It's so bad.

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.160
 - I know that the boxes we got in upon further inspection,

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.200
 the first inspection.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.080
 I mean, we bought them sight unseen.

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.760
 Upon inspection, they're not the thickest boxes.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.720
 Like, okay, they're maybe not ideal for shipping.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:49.800
 But still, I feel like there's some like hatred involved here.

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.440
 This is not just coincidence.

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:55.640
 Somebody, my theory is the UPS man does not like you to X

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.120
 because Zuko was left out one too many times.

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.440
 And they like take all the boxes from your house

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.240
 and they like do something to him first.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.080
 I don't know.

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.920
 - Yeah, it's funny 'cause I can understand crushing.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.720
 Okay, in the process of being transferred,

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.080
 the process gets smushed.

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.160
 I totally get that.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.680
 Why are they shredded?

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.080
 Like, is this kind of like wild animal involved

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:15.360
 in this process?

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.200
 - Can you tell me where you put tape on the boxes?

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.760
 All the pictures of the beat up boxes have tape in places

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.000
 I don't think you put tape.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.840
 It's like the post office put tape on it.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:23.680
 They're like, sorry.

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:24.520
 - That's what I think too.

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:25.600
 I was like, I was like, I was like,

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.560
 that's way too much tape on this.

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.040
 I don't think we use that much.

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.520
 It's a complete mystery.

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.160
 We gotta like ship a camera that's recording or something

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.880
 'cause I like, I need to know what is going on.

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.320
 - Yes, or even just an audio recorder.

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.360
 Like, maybe we'd hear what's going on at the time

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.680
 that most noise, I don't know, it was insane.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:48.520
 - Anyway, USPS just nonsense.

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.200
 - But we're gonna use the thicker boxes

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.800
 or mailers or something.

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:52.720
 We learned that lesson.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.240
 - We learned, mailers I think solve the problem.

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.080
 Like, that's so obvious.

00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:58.440
 Like, yeah, not gonna have an issue with those.

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.680
 - Yeah, it's not quite as nice as a box.

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.040
 It bums me out a little bit,

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:06.000
 but like, I also, the boxes people are getting

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.600
 are bumming me out as well.

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.000
 - If I do think about it though,

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.360
 I actually think opening a mailer is more satisfying to me.

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.040
 Like, ripping the top and then getting the thing.

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:15.160
 I do like that.

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:16.240
 Something about that feels sleek.

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.080
 - Okay.

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:17.920
 - Yeah.

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.560
 - Like, with a box you're always like trying to pull it off

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:21.040
 and the tape is like kind of holding it shut.

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.160
 You know, like it's scissors and all that.

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.000
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.800
 You have to like, slice it open.

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:26.640
 - Yeah.

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.560
 So I think I'm fine with the mailer as well.

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.360
 The mailer looks cool.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.800
 And by cool, we mean matte black.

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.680
 - Matte black, yeah.

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.160
 Matte black is inherently cool.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.000
 It turns out.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.400
 (laughing)

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.560
 - Oh, man.

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.080
 This kind of business is so fun.

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.960
 I'm just having so much fun with the terminal thing.

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.480
 It's a lot of fun.

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:45.720
 - It's so funny.

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:46.760
 And then, you know, going back to it,

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.560
 we're saying, you know, some bad press is just bad press.

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:53.920
 I do think the shredded boxes though were kind of funny.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:54.760
 Like, I think people.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.240
 - Yeah, it's become kind of a funny thing on Twitter at least.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.680
 There's probably people who didn't say anything

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.040
 that were disappointed when their box looked like that.

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:01.880
 (laughing)

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.480
 But like, the ones who were saying it online

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.600
 are been good sports and it's kind of become a meme.

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:06.920
 (laughing)

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.840
 - Because the bags themselves have been fine.

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:10.440
 It's just the box just gets totally destroyed.

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.600
 - The ones that showed up except for the ones

00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.760
 where the bag completely fell out of the box.

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.320
 (laughing)

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.120
 I can't believe that had multiple times.

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.480
 Like, what in the world?

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.400
 (laughing)

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.320
 You know, those people had to feel bad emailing us.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.560
 Like, I think you're gonna believe

00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.400
 that there's literally no copy of this box.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.480
 (laughing)

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.800
 - I am shocked that when I order things online,

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.120
 which I do all the time, that like this never happens.

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:34.960
 Like, you know, like all it's--

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.240
 - Yeah, I've never had a box show up looking like that.

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.240
 And then when we send some boxes,

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:42.240
 this is like suddenly, this is a very common problem.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.080
 (laughing)

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:46.320
 - I guess everyone just goes to this loop and figures it out.

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.760
 - Yeah, yeah, I think the boxes don't even have that like,

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.600
 is it corrugated?

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:51.600
 Is that the word?

00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.720
 Like, I noticed these boxes are just like a--

00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.360
 - It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.880
 - They've got a little like bumpy, wavy thing.

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.440
 Yeah, it does have their pretty lack.

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.920
 - It's just very thin.

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:02.760
 - Very thin.

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.080
 - Okay, I got one of them.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.080
 - Oh, look at you.

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:05.920
 - Like, one of them right there.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.760
 - Oh, this one's small boxes.

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:07.600
 - Yeah, I know.

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.600
 - Collector's item.

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.200
 No one got one.

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.760
 - We should just ship empty boxes to everyone as you go.

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.000
 (laughing)

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.240
 - I think the best part about this business

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.720
 is just the number of ideas.

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.480
 Like, when you get this many people together,

00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.680
 and especially meemers,

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.640
 like you guys are all internet meemers.

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.600
 So you just, you keep having different ideas

00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:29.480
 that just crack me up.

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.240
 And like, our Discord all day is just hilarious ideas.

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.080
 - Yeah.

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:34.680
 - That we won't do half of them, but like,

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.560
 just a lot of fun.

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.560
 - But seriously though,

00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:38.920
 we should print a sticker that just says LOL,

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.320
 and put it in this box.

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.160
 (laughing)

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.600
 And then just ship it to like, 20 people

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.440
 of our existing customers.

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:45.280
 - Yeah, I love it.

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.120
 We have their addresses.

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:48.240
 They can't stop us from shipping things to them.

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.360
 (laughing)

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:51.680
 - It's fun.

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.520
 Oh man.

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.960
 - Good times.

00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.720
 On that note, we got, we got exciting stuff coming.

00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:58.560
 I can't wait.

00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.240
 It's like, it's this period of like,

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.840
 we got a lot of hard work to do again,

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.800
 before we can like, give people things,

00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.480
 and to be excited about.

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.880
 So it sucks that there's gonna be like a period of--

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:09.720
 - Delight.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.640
 - Relative, quiet.

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:12.520
 Yeah, a delay, but like,

00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.880
 we're getting set up in a way that I'm very excited.

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.120
 That's gonna be much better.

00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.800
 - It's gonna be so good.

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:18.640
 It's gonna be so good.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.000
 - It's gonna be so good.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.120
 If you're into coffee,

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.520
 and ordering from SSH apps,

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.440
 which if you're into those things,

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:26.480
 it's only because we invented it.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.120
 But if you're one of those people,

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.240
 just wait, it's gonna get better.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.080
 - I'm excited.

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.400
 - Me too.

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.560
 On that note, it's been an hour.

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.400
 We did it.

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.240
 We made it.

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:37.480
 Ooh, if we end it in six seconds,

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:38.320
 it'll be exactly one hour.

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.160
 Do you wanna try?

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.000
 - Four.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.840
 - Three.

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:41.680
 - Bye.

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:42.520
 - Do you have any more to say?

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.360
 - Yeah.

00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.200
 - Bye.

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.780
 (upbeat music)

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.100
 (upbeat music)
