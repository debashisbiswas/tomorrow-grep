WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 I think it's a very target that makes him like another.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.360
 It's like burped uncontrollably.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.460
 That was awesome.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.760
 So it was funny how I was like, hey, can we start an hour earlier?

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.240
 And you're like, uh, like 15 minutes later, you're like, uh, in 30 minutes.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.480
 And then we ended up, you just psyoped me into us starting at our normal time.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.080
 Oh, I didn't realize you said an hour.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.760
 I didn't realize you meant an hour earlier.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.280
 Well, I think I sent it when you weren't even on discord.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.160
 Like it was before you were even like seeing anything.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.400
 Uh, it actually works out because I was going to have a workout that I would have

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.520
 to leave in the middle of this for, but we pushed it back.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.640
 Not because I wanted to.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.200
 He wanted to.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.080
 So all good.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.280
 There's a ladybug in my life.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.360
 Did you know British people call them ladybirds?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.200
 No, what?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.480
 Why?

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.560
 I think that's true.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.440
 Ladybird is a ladybug.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.280
 Yeah, they call them ladybirds, ladybirds in the United Kingdom.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.880
 There you go.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.400
 Wow.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.080
 That's crazy.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.960
 I know a lot of things that British people say after spending some time with

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.440
 David and Canadian people bash calls, bathrooms, uh, washrooms.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.560
 Wash, yeah, yeah.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.800
 No, Frank and Jade do that too.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.640
 Oh, really?

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.280
 That's so funny.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880
 I guess I don't know what British people call bathrooms.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.320
 It's weird that Canadians are so different when they're so close.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.720
 Yeah.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.240
 I guess it's like the French versus the British.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.760
 It's not a French thing, right?

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.080
 Cause like only part of Canada has a French influence.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.880
 Quebec, the rest of Canada does not.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.840
 I didn't know that.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.360
 Well, what was the rest of Canada?

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.280
 OK, so I mean, historically, maybe all of Canada, their French influence.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.440
 But now Quebec, like that's where people speak French.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.000
 And like, I think technically it's their primary language.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.120
 So all the all the French people were kind of isolated to Quebec.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.800
 I think so.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.920
 That's what Montreal is.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.200
 But like Toronto and Vancouver are just not French at all.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200
 Mm hmm.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.280
 Didn't know this.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.680
 You've ever been to Canada?

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.960
 I never been to Toronto, which is where Frank and Jade are.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.120
 Mm hmm.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.760
 I've never been to Canada.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.120
 I've been in the water.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.440
 I've been in the waters of Canada.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.080
 Does that count?

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.760
 Wait, where have you been outside the country?

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.800
 Of one time I've been out of the country and it was like 10 years ago.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.760
 Casey and I went to Mexico, the Baja Peninsula of Mexico.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.920
 Oh, that's like basically.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.080
 So you haven't left North America.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.920
 No, that's so crazy.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.640
 What's the longest flight you've ever been on?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.640
 We went to Hawaii.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.520
 Hawaii is pretty long.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.920
 OK, so we spent like a week in Maui.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.280
 That was, I don't know, five hours from LA.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.840
 I guess the flight is something like that.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.720
 Wow, never been anywhere.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.400
 I've not very well traveled either.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.240
 But yeah, but you've been to like Europe and such.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.040
 Yeah, that was recent.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.960
 You grew up in India.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.200
 What am I thinking?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.840
 You actually grew up in India or that you like were born in India.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.480
 That you just for some reason you just it seems like.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.840
 I don't know.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.440
 Your parents are from India, but you.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.960
 Yeah, I know.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.760
 I born here.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.280
 I don't know.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.800
 I do.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.800
 I mess that up so much.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.000
 There's like a threshold of when you come to America, like if you come before a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.360
 certain age, you just end up being America, like coming across American.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.320
 And if we go after a certain age, like people know that you're you're foreign.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.040
 Yeah, how are you again?

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.240
 I was like five, five.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.440
 That's crazy.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.520
 Yeah, so you like you have memories of I mean, clearly, I do.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.800
 I remember I very clearly remember a few like really random things on the last day

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.160
 of school before I left.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.000
 It was my last day of school was like my last day of school, a bird pooped on my

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.920
 head. I remember that.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.160
 And I remember the flight we took to America was on Luftanza Airlines, which

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.480
 was really, really nice is German airline.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.560
 I don't know if it's still really nice, but it was really nice back then.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.200
 And well, I guess I'm not sure because I was a small child on the first airplane

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.640
 ever. So maybe I thought everything was nice.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.080
 But I remember they gave me a pack of Legos to build a thing.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.840
 Wow.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.200
 And it dropped one piece and I could never finish it.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.720
 Exactly.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.840
 I couldn't like reach it behind. I just remember the frustration of like not being

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.440
 able to reach it.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.120
 That sounds like a nightmare, actually, like if you craft a nightmare, that's

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.040
 yeah, that's out there.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.480
 But I remember having a good time on the plane.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.880
 And then I remember arriving to America and very shortly after we went to a grocery

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.720
 store and I was just like, what the hell?

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.760
 Like this is so crazy.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.760
 Like the aisle for the ice cream is bigger than any like grocery type store I'd ever

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.080
 been to pretty America.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.360
 I mean, it's I remember going to a grocery store in Mexico and just that feeling

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.560
 of like you when you realize the world is so much bigger than what you've known,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.280
 like that they're that people live completely different lives.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.480
 And like everything you just think is normal is just because you live in one

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.520
 little spot.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.600
 I remember that feeling that overwhelming feeling of like, I don't know

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.720
 anything about the world and this is Mexico.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.480
 It's like like two hours from San Diego, like we're not even talking like the

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.240
 other side of the world.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.480
 Yeah.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.040
 When I went to Europe, I was hoping for that feeling.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.920
 I was like, I want to feel like I'm really similar, different.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.640
 And I did get that somewhat, but it was still like pretty familiar.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.120
 Like obviously lots of was different.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.880
 It's the globalization diluting that feeling is like, is that going to just

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.880
 trend towards less and less feeling like places are different?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.200
 Definitely for like in terms of the Western world, like for sure.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.520
 It's if you go look at a coffee shop anywhere in the Western world,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.320
 it's like the same aesthetic across the board.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.920
 OK, coffee shop vibes.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.000
 You know, imagine you get more of that culture shock if you go to Asia.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.560
 Well, like tea just in Japan right now.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.600
 I'm sure that's a different feeling.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.800
 I really want to go to Japan.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.200
 I want to make that happen too.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.520
 Let's do a terminal event there.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.480
 Oh, that'd be amazing.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.000
 Like everyone in the audience is Japanese and they don't speak English.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.400
 That would be so fun.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.520
 How fun would that be?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.680
 It's like we're trying to communicate with like, I don't know.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.520
 We have to do another meeting.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.800
 It doesn't involve speaking.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.960
 Yeah, exactly.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.040
 We'll be minds.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.960
 We'll just do like a mind show, pantomimes, white faces and all.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.440
 Is that bad for you to put white paint on your face?

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.720
 I I guess not.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.240
 I don't think anyone would be that mad about it.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.240
 Yeah, it's interesting.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.680
 Is it bad that I asked that?

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.440
 No.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.680
 OK, cool.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.000
 It's a bad question.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.040
 Sometimes I just have these intrusive thoughts and they're like questions like

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.880
 that, which is like just trying to understand what is offensive and what is not.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.280
 It's a genuine question of mine.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.920
 Like I just feel like I had a very narrow upbringing.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.240
 Like I've done, I've not experienced a lot of diversity and culture in my life.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.240
 No, here's the thing.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.720
 There's a lot of stuff that is.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.960
 I don't think there's a lot of stuff that is offended, but I think there's always

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.800
 people that will get offended by some stuff.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.000
 So now we all just pretend like stuff is offensive because we know someone out

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.520
 there would get offended by it.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.920
 Most of it is funny.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.360
 This was a fight, not a fight.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.160
 This was a conversation Casey and I had two nights ago, the last time.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.560
 I don't know very recently when I got back from New York about like, I know there's

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.920
 things we disagree on.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.280
 Politically, I hesitate to say politically because I don't know what policies are

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.520
 involved here, more social something.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.360
 Yeah, yeah, more social.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.560
 There are things that we just like she is on one end of a spectrum and I am on

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.120
 the other, we're probably not on the far ends, there's always further on these

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.800
 spectrums, but we are kind of like on either side of a center point and I was

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.000
 trying to like just have healthy conflict and talk through it.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.040
 And I realized I can't even like vocalize what bothers me about.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.480
 I think it's the biases in tech.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:01.560
 I think in tech specifically, we've seen some really just stupid versions of this

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.600
 like this kind of culture of offended by everything.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.040
 I don't know.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.520
 I don't want to offend people by saying that or maybe I do.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:08.920
 I don't know.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.120
 It just feels like tech is maybe like even more so, it's like an exaggeration.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:21.560
 For some reason, our industry latched on to like this very, uh, you can't do that

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.800
 because we all decided that's a thing you can't do or say feels like that's heavy

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.400
 in tech.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.480
 And I think that shades, maybe my opinions of certain things, I don't know.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.840
 Yeah, I don't think it's random that was that it became that way in tech.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.120
 I think tech became one of the cushiest industries for a while.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.920
 And when things get cushy, people get to focus on problems that aren't really

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.040
 problems and kind of make up.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.000
 Yes.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.240
 And you see as the economy got harder, like all that stuff kind of flushed out of tech.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.960
 So yeah, I think it's just a natural thing that happens.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.440
 Like it's weird.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.920
 Like you have such a cushy job and you imagine people are like, oh, yeah,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.360
 I'm just going to like really enjoy this.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:07.120
 But we just need to find like the next problem to work on, even if it's like kind

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.960
 of made up problem.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.840
 Yeah, it's the, is it the hard times create?

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.600
 Yeah, I think it's probably, it's probably related to that.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.800
 Yeah.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.880
 That quote, it definitely feels that way.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.800
 But it's 61 degrees here, which is freezing.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.160
 If you love your jacket yet, are you wearing a sweater?

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.720
 I woke up and my throat is like, just doesn't feel great.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.560
 But this is like actually sick.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.800
 So I might just be getting anything from her.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.240
 But did we all just get COVID in a New York apartment?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.560
 Maybe I have no clue.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.480
 It's funny, like after I got back when we were leaving from New York, I was like,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.040
 I just don't want to be cold anymore.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.720
 Like I don't, I just, I have like no tolerance for at all.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.640
 And I came back and I literally like just stepped outside to like enjoy the heat.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.240
 And now it's cold here again too, because we randomly get like cold fronts

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.920
 every, every now and then.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.640
 And I know for people listening, you're like 61 degrees.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.760
 That's like the perfect weather.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.120
 Yeah, if you like dress for it, but

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.080
 if you like put on pants.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.160
 Yeah, I don't want to put on pants and I don't want to put on.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.520
 I know this about you more so every year.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.800
 Like just having spent some time in New York.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.240
 You really don't want to put on pants.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.640
 Like it's kind of a goal of yours and it's hilarious.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:25.600
 Yeah, so it's like the moment I'm changing my whatever for the weather,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.680
 then it's not good weather anymore.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.840
 That's how I define it.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.200
 Yeah, the weather needs to bend around your needs.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.200
 Is there a place where it never gets even like into the 60s?

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.320
 Worth 70 is like the minimum all year.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.200
 Is there even a place?

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.560
 Probably straight up in the Caribbean, I imagine.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.520
 Yeah.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:47.480
 Yeah, it's going to be closer to the equator than anything in America, right?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.760
 I'll tolerate this because it doesn't get that hot here.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.440
 When it gets really hot, I imagine it gets really hot closer to quit.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.240
 It doesn't get really hot in Miami.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.280
 I guess it's all relative, but for me, it gets more like places in

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.520
 Florida get way hotter than Miami.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.720
 So really, is it just about being on the East Coast?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.200
 Like the Atlantic somehow keeps.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.840
 Yeah, being by the way, like Orlando is like way worse than Miami in the summer.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.840
 Yeah, it's interesting.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.400
 I know this about Orlando having like been there a few times.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.640
 I can remember it being miserable hot in the middle of summer when we went there.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.480
 We had someone we worked with in Orlando.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.520
 The fact that Disney World is plopped right in this like miserable place

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.280
 from a weather standpoint is just hilarious.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.480
 Cause like people travel from all over the world to go to Disney World.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.080
 And if they could have just picked a place that was nice all year round, like think

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.800
 of all the like additional joy families would have had.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.400
 It's just kind of like collective joy over decades.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.680
 You're just not supposed to go there in the summer, I think.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.040
 Yeah, I guess like is the park.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.480
 I bet the park's just way less busy summer vacation.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.120
 Summer break.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.680
 That's the thing.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.720
 Kids are off school.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.640
 I'm sure they're super busy and it's just disgusting.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.040
 They've got those like missed machines where like you just walk through cold mist

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.560
 because it's so miserable.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.440
 Oh man, there's a, there's like a place at me.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.280
 And when we, let's go out a night to like, you know, go out and like dance or whatever.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.440
 There's a place that we go.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.160
 Wait, wait, wait, slow that, slow that down.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.360
 When you go out to go, you go out and dance.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.320
 Yeah, I haven't done it in a while, but you know, it's something to occasionally.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.440
 This is so interesting.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.080
 I just have never done that before, but I'm now very curious about that life.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.600
 I don't think you live somewhere where that's even an option.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.560
 They do a lot of square dancing where I live.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.360
 They have dance.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.400
 Yeah, it's just very like country.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.320
 Yeah, no, for us, it's not that.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:37.200
 Um, so it's just, it's this really cool place that is kind of, it's like mostly outdoor.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.240
 It's like, it's like a building, but it's like pretty outdoor.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.640
 Um, but obviously as it goes on, there's a lot of people they are moving around.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.440
 It gets really hot.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:51.760
 Uh, and recently, not recently made in the past year or two, they installed these.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:59.120
 Like pipes or like these, yeah, these, these pipes all over the dance floor.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.480
 And they blast out nitrogen, like every 10 minutes or so.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.520
 It's like blast the cook, the, that blast the crowd with nitrogen.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.520
 And it feels so good.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.400
 Nitrogen is like super cold.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.280
 It's like liquid, you know, liquid nitrogen, like, yeah.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:18.440
 Yeah.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.160
 So they have like a tank of that.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.040
 And then like, you can't see anything.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.880
 Like the whole dance, like it's covered in like complete white fog.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.160
 You can only see like right in front of you.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.520
 And it feels so good.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.240
 Hmm.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.080
 Um, I was like, whoever thought this is a genius.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.640
 Like that's super interesting.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.520
 Actually, it's not bad to breathe in a ton of nitrogen.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.520
 I guess that's like 70% of our atmosphere, I guess.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:39.560
 Yeah.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.080
 So I guess it wouldn't be.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.800
 And it feels great.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.960
 So that's what we do to solve the.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.560
 That's how you cool down when you're on the dance floor.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.160
 I have so many questions about dance, but I'm not going to right now.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.800
 Uh, there's things to talk about.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:56.640
 There's like, uh, our, our first love, AWS, so many new headlines.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.280
 I keep seeing stuff.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.640
 And I want to ask you like how much of this stuff creates new use cases,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.280
 like things that are possible that weren't.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.160
 Uh, so there's that to talk about.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.400
 Uh, we should probably talk a little about terminal stuff, just New York.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.680
 Just got back from New York.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.920
 Uh, we could talk about, uh, psychology, because I have all kinds of things.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.400
 I want to say about psychology.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.680
 And I know you're going to just, I roll me to death and I don't care.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.120
 I don't even care.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.240
 I'm going to do it anyway.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.400
 Uh, I just listened to part of the first episode of AWS FM, where you came on.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.160
 I just want to like hear our first interactions.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.000
 It's so funny.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.040
 It was like October of 21, somebody just asked me, I think in New York asked me

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.040
 how long we had known each other.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.400
 And I didn't know exactly.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.240
 I looked it up.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.280
 Might put a little clip from that in the episode.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:40.680
 Who knows?

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.120
 We'll see.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.360
 Yeah.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.600
 I mean, I mean, let's just telling you guys that she remembers my first meeting

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.280
 with Frank and Jay, because I was like doing it.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:48.720
 Yeah.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.640
 And she like, it was just funny how formal.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.600
 You guys were dressed up.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.600
 Yeah.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.760
 Not dressed up.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:00.080
 Well, I had to wear clothes, which isn't the case anymore.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:00.640
 Yeah.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.800
 Um, yeah, it is funny to have like actual recordings from.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.880
 Yeah.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.720
 Okay.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.120
 Let's talk about the AWS of what have you heard?

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.720
 Yes.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.600
 Uh, okay.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.480
 So I know there's a ton of cloud front stuff.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.880
 How much?

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.400
 Yeah.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.000
 I think most of it I don't care about, but I want to talk about it and make sure I

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.240
 shouldn't care and there's like not reasons I should start caring.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.240
 So there's that.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.840
 I know, uh, like Lambda got no 22.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.440
 There's some like other kind of periphery things that, and there's

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.760
 probably things I haven't even heard at all that you could tell me.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.760
 Uh, so wherever you want to start, what about event driven, active

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.960
 director domain joined with Amazon event bridge?

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.960
 Oh my God.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:37.480
 No.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.320
 Are you serious?

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.440
 Oh, there is one I want to talk about.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:40.800
 Yeah.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.720
 I didn't know any of that was, uh, I do want to talk about, uh, on the cloud

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.480
 front side, you can like send cloud front logs to cloudwatch now, which is

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.280
 so hilarious that that like how many years into AWS and it's like, oh, you

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.200
 know, that service that's got all the logs in it.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.200
 You can finally send your cloud front logs to it.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.560
 It's crazy that this is like finally a thing.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.840
 You don't have to build all this infrastructure.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.000
 I was kind of confused.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.320
 Like, what did you have to do before I get dumped it into S3 bucket?

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.280
 That's literally it.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.000
 And now not only can you send them straight to cloudwatch, you can also, uh,

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.920
 have them sent to S3 in parquet format. So like we have a big data lake.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.720
 It's that means you can just like pump your cloudwatch stuff in ready to consume.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.720
 That's, that's like huge for me.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.840
 Just like quality of life.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.720
 We, you've seen what we built to do, like, to just like do some basic web

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.920
 analytics on our stuff.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.280
 It's like this crazy kinesis stuff that we had to build out.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.520
 And now we can just like click a button in cloud front or add it to, I guess

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.160
 it's not in cloud formation yet, but you guys maybe could get it sooner.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.560
 Cause it, it is in the API is obviously some maybe SST could enable that.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.720
 We were talking about building a provider that just can just make

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.160
 AWS calls through SST.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.920
 So we're just like wrap any API.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.480
 Oh, we need a sort of way to put the trickle down all the, uh, the downstream things.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.000
 Yeah.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.840
 Like that's getting native.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.480
 It's a K that has to get into terraform.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.360
 Then it's getting to plume me.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.000
 Then we get it.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.760
 So that'd be cool.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.480
 Yeah.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.640
 The cloud front updates, uh, it's funny.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.760
 If you like in our team chat, they're just me posting and all caps being like, yo,

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.280
 look at this.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:17.120
 Like a bunch of times because it is a few things here that actually the one cloud

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:24.160
 front throwing it thing is now you can specify a cloud front, um, function to

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.200
 change the origin of requests is going to this.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.640
 Yeah.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.880
 This solves so many problems for us that I can remember.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.640
 Like all I know, all I can remember is like every couple of weeks were like, man,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.920
 it'd be so much easier if we could do that.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.680
 Or like, well, yeah, cause you just had to create all these stupid behaviors.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.520
 And then there's behavior limits and all this.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.120
 I remember all these issues and now we can just do that in a cloud front function.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.280
 I didn't even see that headline.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:47.760
 Yeah.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.840
 So I think I don't see the point of creating any.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.920
 Origins at all anymore in cloud front, um, cause you can just read a single default

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.800
 origin source.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.160
 Yeah.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.600
 And then so, well, wait, wait, wait, wait, you mean behaviors?

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.680
 Cause you still have to have the origins, right?

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.440
 No, you can redirect to any origin, but you create, you have to configure the origin

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.640
 first and then you can send like an redirect to any URL.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.920
 Oh, any URL interesting.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.160
 So you don't have to define the origins in the first place.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:15.720
 Yeah.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.440
 I think you'd still define the origins if you want some of like the

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.680
 destination and all that stuff, but, um, yeah.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.440
 So we're like, so the cloud front workers, the cloud front workers also as a KV

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.680
 door for sorry.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.320
 Yeah.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.520
 That was a wild background, right?

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.680
 The cloud front functions.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.400
 I never used it, but if you pair these two things,

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.880
 together, you can just build your own, because what we've always wanted was we

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.520
 want the ability to just build our own router.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.360
 We want a lot of the cloud front letter.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:42.920
 Yes.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:43.600
 Yeah.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.680
 And the KV store we can, we can put in values like here's a lot of static assets.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.000
 Yeah.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.120
 So if it matches that, we can redirect to the S3 origin.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.000
 You know, all that we could do for our show that we have to like create a behavior

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.360
 for each file and there's a limit of 25 and all that.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.760
 Like all that I think can go away.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:08.640
 Um, we can build like, uh, so we have like a router component in SST where you can

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.280
 like create one CDN and then mount like different paths different places.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.880
 That was also limited in a lot of ways now.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.800
 Like this thing makes it so we can have basically unlimited pads.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:26.280
 Um, the other big one was, uh, like immutable deploys.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:33.080
 So each deploy, we can keep the static assets around, um, in the S3 bucket.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.040
 I mean, you can keep maybe even like do a function version.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:44.360
 And then depending on like, if you get a normal request, you redirect to you,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.800
 like forward to the latest origin, but you can like easily like roll back or do

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.800
 preview environments or do all that stuff with a single cloud front.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.360
 You don't have, it's like, you don't have to use the blue green stuff, which was

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.880
 kind of a pain, or is it the blue green stuff?

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.440
 Depending.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.160
 It helps some of that.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.680
 But I think our issue right now is people that did like PR environments,

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:08.360
 you had to do, um, deploy a new crowd platform distribution for each, each

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.560
 PR, which is kind of, oh, that's very slow.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.840
 Now you can share one and you can do like a sub domain thing.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:18.360
 So you can say like PR number, dot dev, dot my compute.com.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.640
 And then this cloud front function can see what sub demands for and then

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.240
 directed to the right, uh, function behind the scenes, the right

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.400
 S3 bucket behind the scenes.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.000
 Yeah, it just allows for, and it's probably got bigger less.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.040
 Cause like I said, we'd like constantly are like, we don't have enough control.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:34.640
 We don't have control.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.160
 And now we do.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.360
 So we can build all kinds of interesting things.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.160
 I think, yeah, I saw a cloud front.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:46.440
 You can put like point at VPC resources now, like as an origin, which is cool.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:51.120
 We had to do some stupid stuff with like API gateway in between, like our

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.080
 private stuff and cloud front.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.320
 So now we could kind of do it.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.400
 That if we wanted, I saw the GRPC thing.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.760
 I don't know if I would use that.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.760
 What, is that like, it's like web sockets?

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.360
 What is that?

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:02.920
 I don't even know.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.240
 I'm kind of confused about that because I'm like, I can't remember if I

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.800
 thought GRPC was like a TCP protocol and not an HTTP one.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.400
 I thought it was like a Google created thing.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.680
 Did I make that up?

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.480
 Yes, it is, but it's, it's an RPC protocol that can go over different

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.240
 transports, like you can go over a TCP.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.480
 I think you can go over HTTP too.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.720
 So I don't, I just didn't understand why it wasn't possible before.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.520
 Oh, I see.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.400
 Uh, I didn't fully understand that.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.080
 One of those like they gave us support for something we thought we already

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.960
 had or didn't realize we didn't have.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.240
 Yeah.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:40.360
 The other funny thing is, uh, AWS Aurora serverless.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.360
 You two now scale zero, uh, just funny.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.520
 Cause like we put in all this work in supporting, uh, RDS because.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.040
 Yeah, the minimal costs for Aurora, for dev environments, which is like way too high.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.240
 Now it scales to zero.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.840
 So it's like, but it's still the data API, right?

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.160
 So it's still all those issues.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.040
 Yeah.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.240
 Cause we, we got rid of needing the data API entirely.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.440
 Cause we have, Oh, even with Aurora serverless.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:05.680
 Yeah.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:05.960
 Yeah.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.160
 Because we have that tunnel thing now built in.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.720
 So you can just, I don't know if you saw this, but, uh, so you can just, you're

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.600
 just connecting to it through, oh, I guess you could just use like normal

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.680
 postgres connections to Aurora serverless.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.160
 It doesn't require the data API.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.920
 For some reason I thought it didn't require a API API.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.240
 So.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:29.080
 Our new component for RDS postgres, it just lets you turn on data proxy.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.320
 I think this is called the connection.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:30.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.240
 Proxy.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.080
 That's what we use.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:32.360
 Yeah.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.040
 First time you see it.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.880
 So we have like a proxy true field and also this is actually good now.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.760
 Like for the dev environment case, it was already good for like, we use it in

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.880
 production, but like, this is actually a good thing.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.920
 If, for instance, you were teaching a course and you had a bunch of students that

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.120
 needed a cheap server server serverless database.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:51.440
 Yeah.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.800
 Well, I mean, the reason we switched to non Aurora is it's in the free tier.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:01.160
 So if you just put SST AWS postgres, that's like a free tier thing.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:01.760
 Yeah.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.600
 Um, but now this thing scales to zero.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.640
 It's like, you know, decent option.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.440
 And our tunnel fixes all the need for the data API.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.040
 Like just doing normal connection.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.240
 We like, yeah, yeah, we send the traffic through through our tunnel.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.040
 So, uh, so those are two like.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.160
 Really big ones, the Aurora scaling is zero is a little confusing for me.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.920
 Um, it seems like teams competing agents, each other.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.640
 Oh, yeah, for reasons that we won't talk about it.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:29.920
 Yeah.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.480
 We can't share it yet, but I'm sure we'll be able to talk about it in a few weeks.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:33.720
 Yeah.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.800
 It's also like, it's almost like too late.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:42.200
 It just feels kind of like we've all figured out ways around the problems now.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.280
 And it's kind of like, it's what you're describing that you've already kind of

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.200
 like built all this stuff for RDS and it's like, well, now it's too painful to go back.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.320
 I mean, I, I use serverless V2.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.120
 Like we use it as that means and I'm not going to stop using it.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.000
 And this won't really affect us cause we just, you won't go to zero.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.720
 Yeah.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.640
 And like it doesn't, it's a drop in the bucket.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.360
 If we do spin up dev environments, it's just, it's like a drop in the bucket for a bill.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.720
 So we don't care.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.040
 Yeah.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.600
 So I think we always intended to have an Aurora component.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.720
 So this probably just motivates us to go and report all this stuff in it.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.520
 Yeah, so those are two big ones.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:24.120
 The other thing was S3 zone one reports a pens to files.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:29.280
 OK, which seems like really random and niche.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.920
 It kind of is random and niche, but it's, it's like, it's kind of like, you don't

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.960
 need to do anything on like an EBS or an EFS volume anymore.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:42.280
 Like you can just use S3 for like these cases where you're just like logging stuff,

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.600
 high traffic stuff.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.640
 I think of like what prime always builds.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.440
 He's always building these systems that are like a pinning to huge log files.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.960
 And I feel like you could use S3 now instead of needing to have like local

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.040
 storage, attach your compute, right?

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:55.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.560
 So even the thing we built over the weekend, I was saving the snapshots.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.760
 I was saving the events that came through to S3 because that's using easy database.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.640
 But now I've just append it.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.240
 But that said, this is not really meant for general purpose use because it's in

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.960
 express one S3, one zone, whatever the name is.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.000
 Yeah, the one zone acts, which is like basically loses some redundancy.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 You lose some nines of which really only makes sense for like analytic.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.120
 Like I think this is this is so targeted at all these people building databases

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:37.280
 on top of S3, like a Clickhouse, for example, or like any of like the, like

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.400
 a company warp stream, they built on top of S3.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.800
 So I think it helps those and kind of optimize a little bit for it.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.600
 It's not limited.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:49.160
 Like it's so constrained to some degree, but I think it does help some of those

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:49.760
 use cases.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.240
 Yeah.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.240
 People building databases on top of S3.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.800
 Uh, I think we're just going to see more and more of that.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.480
 It's kind of a way to build a serverless database really easily.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.320
 If you build on top of S3, uh, obviously a lot of costs and performance implications,

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.240
 but for some things, it kind of does make sense.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:05.440
 All right.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.760
 Let's, uh, let's take a quick break.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.040
 And you want to talk about terminal YP while you pee?

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.920
 Yeah, I got to pee.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.000
 That's why we're taking a hike.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.640
 I just, I just talk about terminal by myself.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.520
 Like I don't understand what you mean.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.360
 Uh, I mean, like talk about like, like do an ad, like a terminal coffee.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:20.880
 I see.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.560
 I just got to see.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:21.920
 Okay.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.400
 I'll be right back.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:32.200
 All right.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.600
 Now a word from our sponsors, uh, terminal, it's kind of confusing with

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:42.000
 terminal is if you guys saw over this past week, we did a live family feud event,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.440
 but don't forget we are a coffee company.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.200
 We're a very traditional coffee company.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:53.200
 We just do things that typical coffee companies do, uh, like selling coffee

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:59.800
 over SSH or playing family feud in New York with a bunch of developers for

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.200
 live audience, you know, just typical coffee company things.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.040
 Uh, so if you want to buy some and support us, open up your terminal and type

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:12.680
 in SSH terminal.shop, you know, get a really cool coffee buying experience.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.400
 Uh, we're even putting out a monthly box.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.880
 We call it our cron box.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.240
 It shows up every month.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:25.080
 Uh, and some months you'll get custom blends, funny bags.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.920
 It's just going to be a good time if you want to support us would suggest

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.840
 subscribing to our monthly cron box, uh, the first one will probably go out in

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.000
 the next month or so.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.880
 Uh, we have a lot of exciting ideas for that.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.840
 That's our ad.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.880
 Okay.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.960
 Waiting for him to be done peeing Amazon investing another four billion in

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.680
 anthropic.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.120
 I'm assuming that's all in like credits.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.800
 How much did they invested before that?

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.440
 It's kind of crazy.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.560
 Four billion, I think a lot, but I don't really remember.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.480
 That's, uh, that's a lot of money.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:03.240
 Four billion dollars, what's funny is this announcement is anthropic names, AWS.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.480
 It's primary training partner.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.280
 And we'll use AWS trainium.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:11.560
 I think AWS trainium was like one of the worst names ever by then.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.920
 It just makes the whole announcement sound so corny.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.200
 We use AWS trainium.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:21.280
 Sounds like a board, like a board game, maybe cranium.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.880
 Yeah, sounds like that.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.920
 Okay.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.440
 Yeah, just rhymes with the board game, whatever.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:31.320
 Uh, is that all the big AWS announcements we want to talk about?

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.760
 There's a lot, there's a lot of little things.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.160
 It's not even reinvent yet.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.160
 This is just pre-invent.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.600
 So I am hopeful for like some big ones, like, I don't know.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.280
 I, maybe they could make, I feel like they're, they're making good strides,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.760
 despite all of the focus on AI and all of their outgoing communication.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.280
 Yes.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.560
 I feel like the, the product teams still exist, still working on the products that

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:51.920
 matter.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.360
 Not the, it doesn't matter at all. It's just like they've way over corrected and

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.320
 trying to catch up or whatever.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:02.480
 I, I am hopeful, like some of this stuff, like the router and cloud front that you

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.000
 can now build at SST.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.560
 I feel like the missing piece to like make cloud flare less necessary and some

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.280
 kind of hybrid stack is just the waff, like accessibility.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.480
 If they could just make the story around like protecting your endpoints

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.200
 better and cheaper, then it's looking real good, right?

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.320
 I mean, I know there's like cloud flares, whole business that they started with.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.760
 But yeah, I just don't know how good the AWS WAF is.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.560
 Like I just, it's so invisible.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.280
 And like I'm like, I set it up.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.560
 Like what is it doing?

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.760
 Is it where it's hard to tell?

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.480
 The other thing is, I do think they made some improvements to that because

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.000
 cloud front integrates with the WAF properly.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.440
 And now that it can connect to like your private AOB and stuff,

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.240
 like that kind of expands, like as long as you put, as long as you put cloud front

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.000
 in front of it, you basically effectively get the WAF.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.600
 Yeah.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.280
 I mean, there's like, I guess there's two things on the protection front.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.240
 There's like shield, which is very invisible.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.000
 It's just like we shield stuff, take our word for it.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 And then you can pay $3,000 a month to get like shield advanced or whatever it's

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.520
 called and you get it like a direct.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.480
 Well, it's basically like you have like this direct line and like immediate

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.760
 support in the event of a DDoS attack.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.200
 It's, it's just like the white glove version.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.280
 It's just there's some new tools.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.800
 And then you get a bunch of credits toward WAF, which is the more hands-on thing

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.840
 that isn't invisible as much where you configure rules.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.280
 And there's all this like ability to configure rules, how you want to manage

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:43.720
 blocking things that you know, you want to block, but it's expensive.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.120
 It's like a lot of people don't want to use it because that feels like critical.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.880
 Yeah, it's like doubles your cloud front costs.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.360
 Basically, I think that's the simplest way to describe it.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.640
 Like it just, it's just pretty expensive.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:02.200
 So yeah, I mean, most of our costs is that news that used to be, but our database

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.960
 cost was by far our most costs now as we've continued to grow it.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.960
 Like our cloud front and WAF costs are a huge, huge chunk of our bill.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.840
 So that the other thing I would love to see is some kind of.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:22.080
 Largely impacting thing on Lambda, specifically on.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:26.400
 Like efficiency, I also just burped.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.240
 What's going on?

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.240
 Yeah, what's going on?

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:33.720
 Something we ate three days ago, like you're talking like how

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:38.480
 Cloudflare like doesn't bill you if they're not actually like fertile requests.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.880
 They'll only do CPU time.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.480
 So that's one option.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.240
 And that feels like way too much of a departure with how Lambda works.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.440
 I think that would be obviously insane.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:53.720
 If Lambda announces CPU billing, that's like so crazy.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:59.000
 Like that just totally changes the economics of it for everyone in a very, very large way.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.480
 But even just the function concurrency thing would be a good one, which I think fits more

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.160
 with their model.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.240
 It seems like they are working towards that.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.880
 I don't know if they're going to announce it.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.680
 Could you say more about function concurrency with me?

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:21.040
 Yeah, so if you have a Lambda function that gets a request and it makes, let's say it

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:25.920
 makes a call to Dynamo, and a Dynamo call takes, let's say 100 milliseconds, in those

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.880
 100 milliseconds, it probably could have handled another request off that same instance.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:37.680
 So right now, a single Lambda instance, like a container, it can only handle one invocation

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.680
 at a time.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:44.120
 This would let them let it handle multiple and you're trading off the isolation for probably

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.680
 a giant improvement in performance and efficiency.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.320
 So your bill would be a lot lower because you would have fewer concurrent invocations

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.840
 going on.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:58.720
 So yeah, a lot of people complain that languages like go, even Node.js are like super optimized

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.000
 for doing concurrent work.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.200
 And when you put them in a Lambda, they just don't do concurrent work because it only

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:09.840
 can handle a request at a time, which is fine for async events because those can be bashed.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.360
 But for serving API requests, like, yeah, you just can't do anything there.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.360
 Yeah.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.840
 So I would love to see that.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:25.840
 Yeah, I was pulling up some actual bills to just make sure I was speaking from current

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.080
 knowledge about what matters.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:33.120
 Our Lambda bill is just not very much, but I don't know how much it would matter to me

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:37.400
 if they made big improvements to the pricing around Lambda.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.400
 I mean, I don't know how much we would care.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.000
 Not that we're the only type of use case.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.920
 I think it's less about because you're already in the Lambda mindset.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:56.240
 I think it's more around the point at which a container becomes more cost efficient with

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.640
 massively shift if that's a case.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:05.040
 So it just makes more sense for a lot more workloads to be on it.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:11.040
 So anyone that's at that threshold, it now covers a whole new set of people.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.040
 Yeah.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.040
 Yeah.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.040
 Gotcha.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.040
 Yeah.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.040
 We spend more on WAFT.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.040
 This is just interesting.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.040
 We spend more on WAFT than we do on Lambda.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.040
 That's really crazy.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.040
 Lambda is our highest bill.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.040
 Oh, really?

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.040
 Interesting.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.240
 I mean, I was wrong.

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.880
 Our database is still way more expensive than our cloud front.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:32.800
 I mean, our cloud front is our second biggest cost, but our RDS costs are like three times

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.440
 the next closest cost, which is cloud front.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.120
 So yeah, databases are expensive.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.120
 Turns out.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.120
 Yeah.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.120
 Yeah.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.120
 That's all the AWS.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.120
 Yeah.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.120
 So how much more?

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.680
 Because we're in advance not till first week of December, I think, or maybe second week

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.680
 of December.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.680
 Yeah.

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.680
 We got a couple, we got a couple of weeks.

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.680
 Yeah.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.680
 Yeah.

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:58.920
 So we can make one big, like wish list, like, what is the number one thing we'd like to

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.920
 see?

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.920
 And then we can like talk after we admit.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.920
 Like, did it happen?

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.440
 Did any of it happen?

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.040
 I'm like, it's so weird.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:11.640
 I feel like it's, they like solve all the things that we have this new WebSocket service,

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.920
 which is actually very good, the absent event thing.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:18.760
 This cloud front problem solves like another major point at this point.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.760
 Like ours.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.480
 One of the things that we're not going to talk about, but yeah, there's one of the

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:29.360
 things, like SSC, are we limited by this stuff?

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.360
 I don't think so.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.360
 It doesn't feel like it.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.400
 I still think the one thing on the AWS stack, like the one thing that's like the Achilles

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.280
 heel for at least for, I've worked in the consumer web space is just the, I still feel

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.840
 like putting cloud player in front of your endpoints is necessary in 2024.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.840
 Yeah.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:51.040
 Unless, unless you've got enough of a bill that like you don't care to eat the cost, but

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.480
 even it's still just better than like configuring WAF.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.000
 I feel like it's just, it does stuff by default that's just better.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.720
 And I, we've seen it like with our auth endpoint, like I know if SSC auth could just like bake

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:09.040
 in a nice prevention mechanism for people just spamming your endpoint, that would be a great

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.960
 thing you guys could add that it's just kind of like not a thing you can add to a default

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.560
 thing right now in AWS.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.640
 I think the reality is putting cloud player in front is just going to be kind of required

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.040
 based on how the internet has evolved.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.280
 And I guess that's fine.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.440
 It's not even like, I used to feel really weird about mixing AWS and other resources,

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.400
 but it's just kind of where we live and it's, I'm accepting it more and more.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:36.880
 And with, as a TV three, like we put a lot of effort in making the DNS part like adapter

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.880
 based.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.760
 So even if you're creating an AWS component for that, when you specify the custom domain,

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.440
 you can specify your DNS adapter and that can just be cloud player.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.440
 Yeah.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.680
 And for example, just use, it was for everything and then just use a DNS adapter there.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.120
 So that cloud floor is handling.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.120
 Yeah.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.400
 That's when we do a terminal.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.040
 And I was going to move our, I was just, while I was in New York, I was like this little

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.040
 thing that's been bothering me.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.040
 I wanted to move our domains all into like our cloud player count or something, just a terminal

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.040
 owned account.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.680
 And it doesn't support a lot of the TLDs.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.680
 That was a bummer.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.680
 Yeah.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:13.320
 As a registrar, I would just flesh all that out because we've got the dot SH domain is

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.480
 that why dot shop isn't supported.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.360
 I couldn't move our main terminal dot shop.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.360
 Oh, man.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.360
 Oh, okay.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.360
 Oh, okay.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.360
 And maybe not does that SH.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.200
 I just stopped once that shop wasn't supported.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.200
 I stopped looking.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.200
 Let's see if they support dot pizza.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.200
 Yes.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.200
 Okay.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:33.200
 So I feel like I never feel bad talking about like ideas or plans about terminal stuff on

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.200
 our podcast.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.200
 Because it is like a subset.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.520
 It's a very small subset of people who are aware of terminal is like our audience on

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.520
 here.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.160
 So it just feels like, congratulations, you listened to our podcast, you get to learn

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.320
 some like secret sauce.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.160
 I would love, love.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.160
 This is not me telling the audience.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:52.640
 It's just me telling you, like, I would love to sell like a $10,000 pizza, but like prime

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.640
 delivers or whatever.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.600
 I just think that's hilarious and it'd be so fun and we could get a sponsor to do the

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.600
 box or whatever.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.560
 I just think it'd be so fun.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.000
 $10,000 pizza.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.080
 We will deliver it to you.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.720
 It'll be frozen and we'll make it at your house.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.280
 We'll put it in the microwave for you.

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.400
 It would just be funny to like have him literally carry it.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.400
 Like, yeah.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.840
 Just like the video, the YouTube video would be the real winner from this whole thing is

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.000
 like just prime getting on a plane holding a pizza and like his headphones on and then

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.800
 like all the way, the journey of like taking this to someone's house and then cooking it

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.800
 for them.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.800
 Oh, man.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800
 Yeah.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.720
 Like he would, he'd have to get one of those, you know, those pizza delivery, like the insulated

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.120
 pizza delivery box things.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.120
 Yeah.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.120
 Yeah.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.120
 Put the box inside.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.120
 Yeah.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.040
 I'd love that like when he lands in this person's city, he gets in like an Uber and somehow

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.440
 we have like a pizza delivery thing that can go on top like a terminal thing, pizza delivery

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.440
 sign.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.320
 Like I would just love this whole thing would just be so fun.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.320
 Yeah.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.960
 I don't even know if it's would make money.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.080
 It would just be like we might spend the whole budget just doing stupid stuff with it.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.080
 Yeah.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.080
 Kind of the terminal way.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.080
 Yeah.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.080
 Always get to zero.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.080
 Although we did make money in New York.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.200
 Let's talk about New York that we just got back.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.200
 What is terminal?

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.200
 What are we doing?

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.200
 I love it.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.200
 I don't know what we're doing.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.400
 Well, while you were gone, I explained we're just a very straightforward coffee company doing

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.400
 normal coffee company.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:18.040
 We got to see the roastery, that was cool.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.040
 Montherst so great.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.040
 I just love that whole family.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.840
 I just want to like hang out with them now.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.840
 They're really cool.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.840
 They're hustlers.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.840
 Mm hmm.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.560
 Is there anything you want to say about New York?

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.560
 I don't know.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.560
 We haven't really like headed.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:36.040
 Well, I think it went super well like yeah, like that that like everybody was laughing

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.040
 the whole time.

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.800
 Like I was I couldn't tell if I was laughing just because I was involved in it, but like

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.640
 my stomach was like sore.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.640
 You were sweating.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.640
 You were busy.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.640
 Yeah.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.880
 Was it sore from anxiety or laughter?

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.200
 Because no, I was just laughing the whole time.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.160
 It was just really funny and I realized like I missed a lot of the jokes because I was

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:58.040
 like working on stuff because I watched some clips afterward and I didn't remember that

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.040
 stuff happening.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.040
 But it seemed like it went really well.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.200
 Here's like a weird thing though.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:08.200
 We were looking at the check-in list and we sold 310 tickets and about 200 people came.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.920
 But like 100 people bought tickets and then showed up.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.480
 I mean, they you never know like they don't live in the area, but they thought I'm going

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.200
 to buy a ticket because it's 30 bucks and like maybe there's something else people that

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.160
 buy tickets will get out of the deal.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.160
 I could see that.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:27.400
 Yeah, which reinforces the point that we always have to charge because people just claim spots

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.240
 and not even when we charge people do that.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.560
 So yeah, it's not that we need like that we're really hoping to make a lot of money off ticket

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.560
 sales.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.680
 It's kind of like a barrier there.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:44.000
 We didn't spend all the money we brought in, which is called a profit.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.520
 We actually turned the profit.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:53.560
 This is like the first business and maybe ever is the first time I've ever turned the

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.560
 profit.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:59.240
 This is the first thing especially this early.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.240
 We should.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.240
 We'll find a way to spend it.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.540
 We'll spend on the next thing.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.940
 We'll deliver some pizzas.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.880
 Yeah, so yeah, it just went really well.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.280
 I'm excited about doing it again.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:15.480
 The funny thing is, is like obviously for the next time we do the same thing, we'll polish

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.820
 some of the tech, but I'm like, I don't want to polish it too much because a lot of the

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.160
 funniness was firm.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.160
 Yeah.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.400
 It's like, do I really want to fix the math?

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.400
 Right.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.400
 Yeah.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.120
 That's kind of one of the funny things.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.120
 Yeah.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.120
 It's like part of the lower down.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:35.080
 I think some of the stuff that was unnecessary, that was extra stressful, but yeah, just fix

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:41.040
 the stuff that created pain for you, not necessarily stuff that like makes the production value

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.040
 better.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.040
 Who cares?

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.680
 I think it is what it is and it's fun, but just like make it not so stressful for you.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.680
 That would be the goal.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.680
 I think, right?

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.680
 Yeah.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.680
 It was cool.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.160
 How many opportunities there ended up being to like mess with the scoreboard live?

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.840
 Like I have to do that a lot, which is, which is pretty fun.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.840
 Yeah, that's funny.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:02.240
 So the people that don't watch it, we would do stuff like if someone said an answer that

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.040
 was so ridiculous, we would just very blatantly add it to the board where like we would just

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.200
 show up with another answer and then we'd reveal it and it would be really pissed off.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:15.520
 A lot of the times I would replace an answer with something someone said right before we

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.520
 revealed it.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:21.080
 So yeah, just a lot of those little jokes was ended up working out really well.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.080
 Yeah.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.480
 I'd like, before the next one, I'd like me and David, because I don't have much now.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:32.880
 Like I feel like I did my part in terms of building the apps that needed to be built.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.920
 There's probably things that could be fixed, but I'd like David and I to get like a day

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.960
 to just like do your admin panel and make it better and easier to work with and nicer

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.960
 looking.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:47.000
 I know it doesn't matter, but like, well, it's kind of look nice if we do it, but like

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.400
 just make it more ergonomic, faster for you to do what you need to do.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.160
 I don't know where it's not just about a big green buttons.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.160
 I feel like we can make it a little more useful.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.920
 That's funny, the buttons were fine.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.920
 The buttons were great.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.840
 It was just there's more of the other stuff like editing the actors.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.760
 Yeah, just like the typing and like, I bet you didn't spend much time like trying to

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:11.040
 get the tabbing to be real smooth and in the right order and all that.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.040
 So we have to do that.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.200
 We have to make our like our audience app really good.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.200
 Yeah.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.200
 It needs some work.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.200
 Yeah.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.680
 And make it so that Twitch can use it, like logging with Twitch and use it.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.720
 So yeah, it'll be fun.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.720
 We'll do it again.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.360
 We'll invest in other few days into.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.360
 Yeah.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.560
 So if your company is interested in sponsoring the next one, please reach out.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.560
 Please reach out.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:36.280
 I bet we have some people listening that have the ability to make those kind of decisions.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.440
 So we'll upload it to YouTube and we'll probably get a bunch of views.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.400
 And yeah, I think overall it just got a pretty large amount of reach.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:48.000
 And next time we have a lot of ideas on how to like maybe even 10x that reach.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 So.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 Mm hmm.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.180
 And then improve like the way we put shine on sponsors, the sponsor impact.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:01.560
 I think there's ways we can do things even there that are better, more, more enticing.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:02.560
 Yeah.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.560
 Okay.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.560
 So that was terminal.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.560
 Now you want to talk about your psychology.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:06.560
 I do.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.560
 Actually really badly.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:08.560
 Can you tell?

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.560
 Go ahead.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.520
 I'm just, I'm very excited.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:16.800
 I want to talk about this because I think the main feeling I have right now is like, how

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.440
 did I not know this stuff?

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.720
 How did I not even know these were a thing?

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:25.160
 And it's not horoscopes, like this is actual science and psychology.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.720
 Oh, wait, I can't say it's science.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.420
 You'll just be like, you just love science and it's not, it's not science, but I believe

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.420
 it's real.

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.160
 What's not science?

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.160
 Technology?

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:40.600
 The science of psychology is not science on whole is you're like broad stroke.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.600
 Yeah.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.600
 Like really?

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.600
 Yeah.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.600
 I don't think it's science.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.600
 What about like.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.600
 Wait a minute.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:51.200
 All of my assumptions, uh, what about like neuroscientists?

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.200
 That's science.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.040
 Why is that the word science in it?

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.200
 What?

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.200
 Why does it have the word science in it?

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.360
 Like if it was science, it wouldn't have to have the word science in it.

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:06.320
 Yeah, we're not out here like physics science, but there is physics involved our brains have

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.320
 electricity.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.320
 I don't know.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.320
 No, no, no.

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.320
 Okay.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.320
 Yes.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.320
 Obviously neuroscience is like probably science.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.320
 Okay.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.320
 That is probably science.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.320
 Thank you, Dax.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.760
 And now step back.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.640
 They were all screaming into the top of the floor.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:27.040
 I just, I just don't believe that you can apply science to complex systems and like

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.040
 yeah.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.040
 Okay.

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.280
 Psychology and human behavior is like pinnacle of complex systems.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.280
 Yeah.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.280
 We have talked about this before.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.240
 I forgot you have like this whole thesis that psychology is fake.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.240
 Damn it.

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.240
 This is going to be a really hard conversation.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:44.080
 I just think we need to perceive it differently than stuff like physics, which has.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.080
 Okay.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.080
 Yeah.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:51.540
 Physics is kind of science being applied to complex things and there's like actual evidence

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.540
 that we don't know.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:57.000
 We're talking about physics either, like the world doesn't even know how to like comprehend

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.240
 quantum physics.

00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.240
 It's complicated things.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.240
 Yes.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.240
 Like we do.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.240
 Yeah.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.240
 Quantum physics might be in the complex category.

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.240
 Yes.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.480
 Well, it's like we thought we had physics figured out with classical physics and then we realized,

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.880
 oh, actually, it's way more complicated and complex and we don't actually understand

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.880
 anything.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.160
 No, I don't think so.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.760
 But we just say this about science broadly.

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.800
 I feel like what I'm trying to get at is maybe this is just science.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.840
 No, no, no, no.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:26.480
 Most of science deals with very complicated situations that are not complex as in if you

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.120
 scale them up, they don't get more crazy.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.120
 Okay.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:38.560
 So if you understand the rules of basic kinematics, like a ball rolling down a hill or like, you

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:43.720
 know, hitting each other and have momentum transfers, if you scale that up to a billion

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:48.520
 balls, the rules don't get, oh, and are a billion times more complicated.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.520
 Right.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:54.420
 It's just, it's more complicated, but sorry, because it doesn't get more complex.

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.440
 It's more complicated because there's more locations to do.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.440
 Yeah.

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.440
 But it's still the same fundamental laws and they work.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.440
 Yeah.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.440
 Yeah.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.480
 Like you could just add more and more computers to do more and more of those.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.480
 The vaccinations.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.480
 Yeah.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.480
 Yeah.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.480
 Yeah.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.600
 So whereas, and it's something like economics, you understand the behavior of a single human

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:16.840
 in their incentives, you had a billion humans now, like none of those rules, like are remotely

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.680
 how much more predicting what's going to happen.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:19.680
 Yes.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.680
 Okay.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.920
 And I feel that way about psychology as well.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.440
 So that, okay, that makes sense.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:29.880
 I'm not saying that studying psychology, understanding things isn't useful and like discover, you

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.040
 can discover a lot of truth that way.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:36.400
 I just think mentally when you separate it from a type of answers that science can give

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.400
 us.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.400
 Well, let me ask you this then.

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:42.040
 I'm just trying to follow your logic here.

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:48.800
 If you're dealing with a single person and their singular past and behaviors that might

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:53.760
 have resulted from that past, is that not the single ball hitting the other ball in this

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.760
 situation?

00:47:54.760 --> 00:48:00.160
 No, I don't think so because even that is like an extraordinary complex thing.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:05.200
 Like ultimately all of your, if you like really think about it, all of your psychology.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.720
 There's billions of interactions in your life.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.800
 And like it just sells in your brain interacting with each other in billions of ways.

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:18.160
 Like a lot of psychology is like, it should, it's all technically biological, right?

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:23.000
 Like it's just a result of chemicals, chemical interactions happening, but that's just high

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.800
 complexity that you get really crazy behavior.

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.800
 Yeah.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:32.200
 So I think it's just very hard to like get scientific answers from it.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.200
 I got it.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:38.000
 So I guess now I realize I don't need to defend it as science because that doesn't do anything

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 for me.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.620
 I just, I want to separate like it's, it'll be really helpful.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:43.620
 Like that's my point.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.620
 Yeah.

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:48.600
 I want to separate the psychology stuff from like horoscopes.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:55.580
 It's like there is a spectrum here where non science things get more and more detached from

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:56.580
 actual reality.

00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.520
 Do you agree with that?

00:48:58.520 --> 00:48:59.520
 Yeah.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.520
 But similarly, horoscopes can also be helpful.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:02.520
 Yes.

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.520
 Yeah.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.520
 I don't know.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.520
 I'm so confused.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.120
 I'm saying there's no, there's no reason to separate this from horoscopes.

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:13.440
 Like they, they can, they can also not be scientific, but also somehow be helpful, you

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.440
 know?

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.440
 I guess.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.440
 Yeah.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:17.440
 No, I, I see that.

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.440
 But now I just, everything I say, I feel like it's like I'm being all woo-woo and you're

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.440
 just like, uh-huh.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.440
 No, that's good.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:26.080
 That's my, that's the opposite point I'm making.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:32.480
 I'm saying that these things aren't scientific, but it doesn't have to be scientific for

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.080
 it to be useful or helpful.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.800
 I think we tried to, we, we basically think everything helpful, scientific, and we try

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:44.400
 to shove everything into the scientific bucket, it just is awkward and like leads to weird

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.400
 things.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:49.960
 I think it's literally okay to be like, this is very abstract and it is like woo-woo, but

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.000
 it helps me understand stuff about me in my life, whatever.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 Like that's.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 What?

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 Yeah.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.880
 Why I'm very sensitive right now to like this being perceived as just, I mean, horoscopes.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:05.560
 And I don't know why I'm putting down the horoscope people, but there's something, something

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.240
 about this.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:13.720
 I have a feeling that I can't put words to because of my very scientific, psychological

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:14.720
 understanding.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:21.000
 Like, yes, obviously is the literal position of the planets impacting your life.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 Probably not.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 Right.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.840
 So like it's not, it's not that there's some difference and I don't know what it is.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:31.440
 There's some difference in my mind between yes, that idea that like when you were, the

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:37.560
 day you were born somehow like influences all of your personality and all this, there's

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:44.480
 some separation between that and like looking at thousands of people and they're like very

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:50.760
 specific past actual things that happened and saying, oh, you fit into this very clearly

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:57.140
 defined archetype and it's because of XYZ things that happen to you that you're more likely

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.640
 to be this way in these certain settings.

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:04.120
 I feel like that is, that's not, maybe it's not science, but it is grounded in something.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.760
 It's not people just like making shit up.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:12.000
 My only point is, is if you, with horoscopes, if you ignore the astrology part of it and

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.080
 just read the horoscope itself, it's actually exactly what you're describing.

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.640
 Whoever looked the horoscope as a result of understanding.

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.680
 It's the same way about like Myers-Briggs and personality tests on whole too.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.680
 Yeah, exactly.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:27.720
 It's just like understanding all the patterns and things that exist and horoscopes like

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:32.520
 use that to their advantage to like phrasing in a way that are, or to identify patterns

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.520
 that are common so that people can like, oh yeah, that does describe me or I do relate

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.520
 to that.

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:43.040
 You're right, like there's a spectrum and horoscopes are more towards one end.

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.720
 It's just, you know, like I can kind of see the value in everything.

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:56.840
 Yeah, how do you view mental health and therapy and I guess like all of these concepts?

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.880
 Beautiful tools, copium.

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:02.960
 I think like everything, they're definitely useful.

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.400
 I think as a society, we've maybe over rotated on some of this stuff.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:12.880
 Like the reality is, is like like every other field, 95% of therapists are not very good

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:19.200
 and 5% are very good, but you know, there's like all this content out there about therapy

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:24.640
 and like we use, this is one of Liz's theories we should have her on, do her little theory

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:25.640
 segment.

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.640
 Yes.

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:33.520
 She talks about how much like therapy speak has just dominated vocabulary.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.240
 We watch a bunch of reality shows and it's like blatantly obvious.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:40.000
 Like people, when they talk to each other, they're just using like therapy speak.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.420
 Like words they learned in therapy or like therapy related media and content and it's

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:48.800
 like they don't really even know what they're saying.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:54.800
 There's kind of like using these phrases that are like accepted as this is the way you should

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.400
 describe these certain situations.

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.400
 So yeah.

00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:03.000
 And she always points out like it's not sexy like it's like it just makes things like less

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:10.560
 and less like it just makes things like more and more like dorky and just becoming a less

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.560
 sexy society.

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.560
 Okay.

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.560
 That's fair.

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.760
 Well, now I'm going to be very self-conscious about every word I say from here on out.

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.880
 No, but like I said, this is like I'm describing.

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:20.880
 I'm okay.

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.880
 It's something.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:22.880
 I don't have an extreme view.

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:27.880
 I'm just saying there is this very real dynamic, but you know, it's not like the underlying

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.560
 thing is totally garbage.

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:33.340
 I think you are probably more okay with those things than I am.

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:39.600
 I have a problem with like pseudoscience and with, I mean, we've talked about it on this

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:44.480
 podcast that I am very like I overweight science and its impact in my life.

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.840
 Because science is your new religion.

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:46.840
 Yeah.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:47.840
 Yeah.

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:53.680
 Basically, I'm a Scientologist and Tom Cruise is my favorite actor and that other guy that

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:57.040
 was in Greece or something, those guys, they're the best.

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.200
 I wish I could meet them.

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.200
 I don't know.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:03.240
 I'm just, no, I'm not a Scientologist.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.240
 Okay.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.200
 Well, I'm going to say some things that now I'm self-conscious about not because I think

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:11.280
 you don't view them positively, but because I don't view them positively and now they're

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.840
 being associated with those things and other things.

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.800
 Anyway, this all traces back to my childhood.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.200
 Let's start at the beginning.

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:23.760
 No, I'm going to say some things that are very real that are like I know these are facts

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:30.080
 and now I know other people also have these same facts in their life.

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.080
 Okay.

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:37.720
 So facts about me, I okay, in a highly emotional situation where there's someone I care about

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:43.160
 that I have a relationship with and they're emotional, I have no emotion.

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:47.600
 In fact, the fact that they have emotion and the fact that they're expressing negative

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:53.480
 emotions like sadness or grief or anger, that actually suppresses any feeling.

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:57.680
 This is not like I read this in a book, this is like I have always known, I have this thing

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:02.480
 where I turn into like a deer in the headlights, like a vegetable, like I am literally not

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:09.080
 a human being for those moments when someone is expressing strong feelings in my presence

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:15.000
 or towards me, I become this like completely unemotional being.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 Now I know that's a thing, like other people experience that as well and this is, I think

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.240
 this is the broader point.

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:29.180
 It's not about having terms or needing like someone to tell me what's wrong with me and

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:30.380
 how I can be better.

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:35.760
 It's about knowing that there are other people, this is not I am not a snowflake and there

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.880
 are other people who experience life like I do and some of the things that I'm not getting

00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:44.520
 in life that I could get like deeper relationships are attainable.

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:48.520
 There's like a path that other people like me have walked down.

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.520
 That's it.

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.520
 That's what I want.

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:56.720
 And I think the fact that I ended up in the place I am in life in this very specific job

00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:03.840
 doing had pretty good success and career like that is also tied into a lot of these things.

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:07.120
 And that's why I like to talk about a podcast like this where I think there are other people

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:10.760
 listening to this podcast who are also like me and have some of the similar struggles and

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:15.480
 they've had a lack of emotional connection with people and had a hard time building relationships

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:16.480
 over their life.

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.120
 I would hope they would hear something like this and they would also find out they're

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.120
 not alone.

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.120
 They're not the only person.

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.080
 They could also have these things in life that I just thought were kind of off limits

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.080
 to me.

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:30.000
 I just thought I wasn't capable of having some of these things or I've always said things

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.600
 like I'm just not a romantic.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.280
 I'm not someone who values relationship.

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.760
 I don't think those are actual facts that can't be changed.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.760
 That's all.

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.760
 That's it.

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.240
 I didn't even say any psychological terms.

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.240
 Look at me.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.240
 Dismissive avoidant.

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.240
 I want to say it all.

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.240
 I want to attach it now.

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.240
 Sorry.

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:50.880
 Now, just in case somebody can hear those words in the Google, but this relates to your childhood

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:57.520
 because you probably were in a situation where you need to be like the neutral person.

00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.760
 Is that how that works?

00:56:58.760 --> 00:56:59.760
 Yeah.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:05.520
 So the explanations and I'm still very early in learning these things, and I want to be

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.440
 sensitive because I don't know if my parents listened to the podcast.

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:13.800
 I don't want to like this is not about them, but it basically means like the type of person

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:18.200
 that I am on this front, like in terms of my emotional health, I'm a dismissive avoidant

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:19.720
 attachment style.

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:20.720
 Do is that what you want?

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.640
 Everyone else just heard Leo or whatever.

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:27.600
 I'm a Scorpio, but if you go down the rabbit hole a little bit and you read about that

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:35.840
 type, it basically says that as a kid, I learned through adaptation that it wasn't valuable

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.000
 to express negative emotions.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.640
 So basically, I only express positive emotions, all negative emotions.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:46.480
 Not only do I not express them, my brain has this ability to like shove them in places

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.600
 without my knowledge.

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.040
 It's like completely subconscious that basically as a child, I learned nothing good comes from

00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.800
 expressing negative emotions.

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:58.800
 And that does play into my parents and how they, my role in our family and how they treated

00:57:58.800 --> 00:57:59.800
 me.

00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:03.680
 Basically, I learned like to be sad, outwardly or to be angry or frustrated or any of these

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:06.560
 negative emotions, it doesn't do good things for me.

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.320
 Like I get bad things out of that.

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.680
 So why not just only show positive emotions?

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.560
 That's basically how I was formed, I think.

00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.560
 I see.

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:20.100
 So I, I Google dismissive, avoidant attachment and I got a little Gemini answer in Google.

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:21.100
 Are you kidding?

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:22.100
 Oh, Jim?

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:23.100
 I think you're talking horoscopes.

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.100
 I was like, wait, what?

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.100
 I don't know.

00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:27.960
 But the Google AI thing, there's nine, nine bullet points.

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.680
 I would say you mentioned eight of the bullet points.

00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.680
 Oh, really?

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:32.680
 bullet point.

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:33.680
 You didn't mention.

00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.680
 Hang on.

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:35.680
 I'm good at it.

00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:37.920
 It's that you are prone to affairs.

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.520
 I, so I am not prone to affairs.

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.520
 I want to go on record.

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:42.560
 I'm a very loyal person, actually.

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.560
 Uh, what's this?

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:46.520
 I'm looking at the sum traits of this noise.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.520
 Emotional distance.

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.520
 Yes.

00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:49.520
 Difficulty with intimacy.

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.520
 Double.

00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:51.520
 Yes.

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.520
 Self-reliance.

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.520
 1000%.

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:54.520
 That's the thing I'm learning about myself.

00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.640
 I don't build relationships very well because I don't need them.

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:02.440
 And I, in fact, like I have figured out a way to just be completely emotionally regulated

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.440
 in life by myself.

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:06.120
 And this is why I've always felt like I could just be alone for the rest of my life and

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:09.160
 there'd not be any other humans in the world and I'd be totally fine.

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.200
 Is this related to how you rewrote all of David's toe and?

00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.200
 Probably.

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:14.200
 Yes.

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.920
 I've always said I'm terrible at working with others.

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.120
 I, I think it's all related.

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.120
 I don't know.

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.640
 Like, uh, secretive behavior?

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:21.640
 Yes.

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.640
 Check.

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:23.640
 Uh, conflict avoidance.

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.200
 Oh my God.

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.800
 Am I conflict avoidant?

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.200
 You know these things are true about me, right?

00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.200
 This isn't just a horoscope.

00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.200
 Yeah.

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:32.440
 Like this is actual facts about me as a person.

00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.000
 No, it is just like a horoscope.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000
 What are you not understanding about this?

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.440
 I, cause I don't value horoscopes or I look down on them and I need to work on it.

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:43.800
 I got to figure out how to accept that they're also a tool that people can use.

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:49.360
 Cause I, a horoscope is exactly, they've identified patterns and they are surfacing those patterns.

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.360
 Okay.

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:51.360
 So, so that's true.

00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:54.440
 Like they really just like tied this to real patterns of people.

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:59.640
 And then the whole star thing was just like, it'd be fun if we like use stars as a metaphor

00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.640
 or something.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.920
 If the patterns didn't resonate, like they just, this whole thing wouldn't work.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.240
 So why did they involve like the position of the stars?

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.240
 That's where they lose me.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.240
 I don't know.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.240
 Yes.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.720
 I don't think the position of the stars literally true.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:16.240
 I think it's a historical artifact, but it's just one of those things where like, there's

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:23.400
 a lot of things that are old that have really silly things associated with them, like the

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.240
 position of the stars and all that.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:31.400
 But it doesn't mean that where they got to is completely dumb.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:36.680
 So, okay, so you're saying the people who write, the people who write the horoscopes.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.160
 I don't know who those people are, horoscob gurfers.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:46.240
 The people who write horoscopes, they, you're saying actually are looking at like the types

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:51.160
 of people, like when they write a horoscope, they're not just like making every lineup.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:56.440
 It's like they think about an actual person and they describe these traits that are cohesive.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440
 Right?

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:03.920
 I think they're like following a scientific method, I'm saying that somehow they are arriving

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:09.800
 at the same place without doing this academic process, because if you read, if you read horoscopes,

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.800
 they'd sound like this.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.760
 They sound exactly like this and they maybe add a bunch of mystical writing to it because

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.120
 they attach the stars, but.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:24.400
 So this is not a problem of psychology being lumped in with pseudoscience.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.800
 It's a problem of me viewing pseudoscience the wrong way.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.200
 I should view it through the same lens that horoscopes aren't bad.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.200
 They're not all made up.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:37.200
 Anything that old, it's like really hard for not to have value because it survives all

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.200
 the way to.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.200
 Yes.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.200
 That's a good point.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.480
 And it's hard to do that without it being somewhat correct.

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:48.040
 And the other thing is you're looking at the bottom, what are both these things doing?

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.840
 There's describing various human behavior.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.560
 They're both doing that.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.160
 It's coming through a similar process.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.000
 You've changed my view on horoscopes.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.920
 I actually see what you're saying.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.360
 You're saying all these things are just tools, and they all are describing human behavior.

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.360
 And that could be very helpful for people.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.360
 Yeah.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.360
 And like they.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.360
 Defined other people.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.360
 Yeah.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:13.040
 So for you to like absorb all this, you have to like one be in a place where you are ready

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:19.120
 to think about it and receive it to have to come into a format that for you based off

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.480
 of like who you are was delivered in a format that you could like believe and accept.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.480
 Yeah.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.480
 Right.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.360
 For other people, like I guess the format needs to have come in like this more spiritual

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.360
 mystic way.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.320
 And that's why people are in horoscopes.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.840
 It's so interesting.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.600
 Like I literally need it to be science so that I can accept it.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.200
 Like I want psychology to be a science so that I can like it now, it checks my box of

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.680
 like, I will allow science to influence me and my behavior.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.320
 I won't allow other things.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.320
 Yeah.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.320
 And that's fine.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.640
 Like it's just as arbitrary for the people that need it in like this more spiritual format.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.640
 Okay.

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.120
 This helped me a ton because now I don't feel so self conscious.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:04.120
 I like I really, I have a problem with like pseudoscience and I need to move past that.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.280
 I have a problem with spirituality and that goes all the way back to I could go down many

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.280
 bunny trails here.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.280
 Yeah.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.280
 Rabbit trail rabbit holes.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.280
 What is the phrase?

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.280
 I messed that one up constantly.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.040
 People who've listened to me on the internet for like the last few years have heard me say

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:21.320
 bunny rabbit trail like a hundred times and I never I stumble around it every single time.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.360
 I'm like rabbit hole down a path with rabbits.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.360
 I don't know.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:30.160
 I've done that so many times it's ridiculous.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:34.920
 The other thing to that kind of maybe helps understand this kind of thing at least for

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:40.480
 me is when I really understood this is there's like this grandma wisdom type of thing like

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.160
 you know like they say stuff that doesn't really make sense but it's like ends up being

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.720
 correct.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:52.040
 There's just so many examples of certain foods that cultures eat that they've been eating

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:59.120
 for hundreds of years and it turns out the specific ingredients like would be poisonous

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.240
 if they weren't paired with this other ingredient.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.240
 Wow.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.160
 And you're like there's no way they like did some kind of test and like understood the

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.440
 chemicals and like intentionally neutralize it.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:15.040
 There's just this like emergent wisdom encoded in this is what you eat and it turns out it's

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:18.360
 the perfect balance of all the nutrients you need and like you know all the all these

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.360
 different things.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.640
 So yeah it's like someone didn't sit there and like analyze it and say this is why we're

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.640
 doing it but somehow we're still doing the right thing.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:28.640
 Interesting.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:32.920
 It's like it's like we see the animals all the time too like animals like just naturally

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:38.240
 have all this like these instincts that do certain things that are like correct we understand

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.840
 why they're doing it like a cat licks itself to clean itself.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.880
 I would understand like it's good to be clean like it avoids disease and all these things

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.600
 but they don't understand that they're just doing it.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.600
 Yeah.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:55.160
 There's a lot of life that is correct without it actually making having to make any sense

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.480
 or needing to know why.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:00.800
 I guess I have a question for you I'm doing like I'm going on this new journey because

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.200
 I do feel like there's things in life that I'm lacking or that I'm just missing out on

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:10.000
 things I could really enjoy but and the people around me that I care about could enjoy that

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.920
 I've just not tapped into yet it's like this areas of growth do you think about like areas

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.520
 you want to grow into in life or do you feel like is it more?

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:19.520
 Yeah.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:20.520
 Go ahead.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.800
 Just give me your philosophy on this because I do feel like you're just kind of like you're

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:26.200
 just like good you're just like good with where you're at you're just good with you

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:30.720
 don't have this like pressure to like self-improve or whatever and I want to know how and and

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.720
 why.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:37.160
 No I think it's it's not like a I don't think that in itself is a goal I think.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.520
 I was talking about looking maybe the last podcast when we're together in person I can't

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:45.480
 remember when we talked about this I told like when I was like in my like 26 or 27 I just

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:51.000
 I felt I physically felt my brain finished developing and at that point I was like okay

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:58.440
 like a lot of my bad habits like went down a lot I'm pretty like happy with the way I

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:06.200
 do things and perceive things so I just wasn't speaking that much yeah anymore like everything

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.800
 felt like correct also like I got into a relationship that was like you know correct

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:17.260
 for me and all that having around that same time so yeah I just haven't thought about myself

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.160
 as much.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:22.240
 I think Liz probably went through something similar to like around that same age she

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:28.160
 was a lot more figuring that stuff out and I would say in the last like three years or

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:33.440
 so two to three years she's been a lot more like okay it's all figured out I'm happy with

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:38.520
 who I've become and like you know it's there so it's just like I think eventually everyone

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.960
 hopefully everyone eventually like hits that point and the goal is into like I need to

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:49.000
 become someone that doesn't care about improving it's more that you improve you like fix the

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.800
 things that you're worried about and kind of naturally stop thinking about them.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.160
 I'm trying to internalize all that with my situation for you maybe it's just a little

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.160
 later.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:02.640
 Yeah no I mean there was like an acute situation that like I mean when my marriage was on the

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:07.040
 brink of collapse it's like a wake-up call that like things aren't healthy there's still

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:10.120
 like areas of life that aren't what they should be.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.120
 Yeah it's easy to ignore.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:16.120
 Yeah so I think that was probably the bigger impetus for me but it has me so excited about

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:21.160
 this whole area of life that I don't know I was never excited about before and I could

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:26.320
 I could have easily coasted through the rest of my life in the state I am I'm pretty happy

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:32.740
 with who I am or just our life last 15 years since I kind of like lump you always say the

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:36.920
 last 10 years that you've used arch and kneel them and whatever for me it's the 15 years

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:41.800
 that I've been married as my whole adulthood like I left my parents house into me and Casey's

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:47.720
 first home so like the last 15 years is my life and it could have gone on for another

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:51.920
 30 and I don't think like that would have been a horrible life it's just I feel like I would

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:56.480
 have been missing I would have looked back and realized and there were things I could

01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:01.680
 have had that I just thought I couldn't and I'm optimistic now that I could have them anyway

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:07.600
 anyway that's all I'm done talking about psychology and

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:14.440
 Scientology and all the ologies astrology maybe you should get into astrology maybe you should

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.440
 go hard the other way.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.760
 Now you have me thinking so there is this part of me too that thinks I've always said I'm

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:27.400
 just not a spiritual person I think I mix spirituality and emotional things for reasons

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:34.160
 I won't dive into I think like in my life spirituality and emotional manipulation were

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:41.640
 highly entangled I'll say that much and I think I've just shut off both things from

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:46.560
 my life entirely and said I don't need those things I would rather not have those things

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:52.480
 I have this part of me that really wants to like have a spiritual side of my life like

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:55.120
 there's something about that too that's very intriguing to me right now I'm kind of like

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.600
 trying to tackle like just depth of relationship and feeling like I can actually have real

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:04.440
 connection with people that's not what it's always been for me which is like very transactional

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:08.480
 and like unemotional that's the thing right now I'm thinking about but there's this like

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:14.120
 future Adam in like my 50s or something that I want to like try out some religions or something

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:20.720
 I don't know I want to like have some semblance of a spiritual life that feels like I explored

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:25.960
 that and I at least gave it a shot does that make sense yeah not like I need it I don't

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:31.880
 feel like I need it right now but I want to like note with it I don't want it I don't

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.840
 know I want to like give it a shot give it a real college try I think I don't think you're

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.440
 gonna conclude I don't think I would be really surprised if you include like oh I don't need

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:50.480
 it at all I think what you find is what you imagined would fit on the category of spirituality

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:58.200
 actually ends up being a lot broader than than you imagined like it does not it does

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:04.400
 not do anything with religion it's just like it's more is opening your mind to perceiving

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:10.720
 situations not just in like a singular way like the thing we just talked about like there's

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.680
 hard scientific ways to understand situations and then there's like this other way of understanding

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:23.040
 situations that also is like totally valid and ends up in the correct place like being

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:28.520
 more open to that and like liking and appreciating those explanations as well like I would bucket

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:33.240
 that as yes yeah I shouldn't have said religion I do think like it'd be fun to like dabble

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:37.760
 in some religious I don't know some reason that they help you appreciate this because

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:42.560
 a lot of times religions are literally wrong like they're literally not true like you can

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:47.600
 like you take it literally like there's mm-hmm it's like very easy to like dismiss it but

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:53.360
 then you also have this weird contradiction where somehow it's still a useful thing yeah

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.920
 right I think like just understanding that contradiction and being I just helps you appreciate

01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:02.680
 like something I don't know what that thing is but in my head that's like what this spirituality

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:07.480
 thing is the fact that I appreciate this thing that I can't really explain that yet the way

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:13.040
 I view it right now is like we joke about the science thing I really have kind of like

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:19.320
 put myself into a naturalist worldview I think like a very humanistic like everything is

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:24.200
 concrete and can be explained I think I've put myself into that worldview as like a way

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:29.960
 to resist other worldviews that I was once a part of I think I think that's what I really

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:36.740
 want to try and like explore is not being this sort of naturalist to like that's how

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:41.440
 I view spirituality is like the other side of that coin where there's anything else than

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:47.100
 just what I can touch and feel and taste and whatever yeah deep we went from like cloud

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:55.080
 front to like all this other stuff whatever I don't care I'm not going to apologize thanks

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.560
 for listening to our podcast it's weird I don't know what it is yet but I think this is why

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.840
 people like it I hope so because it is what it is and people keep listening so I guess

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:08.840
 yeah I guess they don't hate it or they would stop listening oh man I know what our sponsors

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:17.920
 are going to be someday it's gonna be like better help and next JS some weird combination

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.200
 yeah that's so funny well I think those that's not where combination I think if you're using

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:32.400
 next JS you also need better help right it back all right you said which we need to there's

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:36.120
 one thing I want to say before we get off but did you have something about next JS probably

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:43.320
 oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no okay man's

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:48.360
 a little thing since I got on my flight my first flight home because I always have to

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:53.880
 connect I sat on the plane so I just know exactly when it first happened I sat on the

01:12:53.880 --> 01:13:01.360
 plane in my right pinky went numb and it has been numb since and I cannot understand why

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:05.720
 I have one finger that is numb that's weird and I know exactly when it happened like I

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.160
 know so I can like trace it back and say like what happened right leading up to that what

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.520
 happened for the days leading up to that like what is the thing that would cause my pinky

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:19.320
 to go numb I don't understand I don't know but my my index finger my my right hand right

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:27.760
 here I got I was in high school playing something I remember getting hit in a weird way and

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.120
 whenever I would stretch out my arm like this this area of my index finger would just be

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:36.960
 numb and it was like that for like five years it like improved by like what like like half

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.200
 a percent every single day it took like five years for the properly go with I can still

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:45.320
 like kind of insane like kind of feel a little bit but yeah I guess I will say it's not my

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.120
 whole pinky like I could get more specific I do think it's just part like it's almost

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:55.240
 like one quarter of my pinky but it is such a weird sensation and I don't love it use

01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:01.760
 it to your advantage well like what get pierced what do you mean I guess I guess I don't know

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:09.520
 like okay I'll look into that I'll see what I can do with a numb pinky I remember what

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:14.560
 I wanted to ask about you're talking about potentially moving that's on the podcast now

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:20.640
 all right it is not to be so literal just you're you're imagining what it would be like to

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:25.720
 potentially move not saying you're gonna do that but yeah not saying I yeah okay well

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:30.120
 here's what I'll say having just spent a few days with you guys in New York I'm increasingly

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:36.600
 like realizing this is my shot at having friends in life and I just wish so badly that

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:43.000
 we all lived in the same place like I wish we got to like do everything together not everything

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.600
 that sounds so dumb just like see each other every week and then like when we have a dumb

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:53.400
 idea just make it that week or make it next week like I just that is such a amazing dream

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.520
 to imagine and then I realized like I could have friends here like we could figure it out

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.360
 we could find people and like but it just feels like the internet gave us this chance

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.960
 to like meet people that we really could be friends with because we have so much so many

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:11.600
 reasons to be friends and it would be so fun if we just all our families were close and

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:23.680
 we all knew each other and I don't know how okay I'm not gonna say that no I mean me let's

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:27.080
 talk about it all the time I think she straight up said she's realizing the only thing that

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:33.480
 matters is being close to friends and she's like that should just be the number one priority

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:38.600
 and we should figure out yes I remember saying that on the podcast I forgot we talked about

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.760
 this that Liz that phrase that is a phrase that I didn't remember Liz saying that every

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.520
 that you told me was said that but that is a feeling I've had is like what else matters

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:53.360
 like who cares in like 50 years and I go look back and be like I'm so glad I whatever maintained

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:59.080
 some stable life like no I'm gonna wish like I had spent more time with friends and that's

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:03.280
 the thing that I it's an impossible week we've talked about it's impossible like we're all

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.560
 settled we all have our lives we all have reasons that it just doesn't make sense but

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:13.360
 man I just wish there's some way and maybe it is just like short term it's like we spend

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:19.040
 a week or two weeks together every quarter and like that's that's it but that's better

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:25.280
 than nothing I don't know yeah I mean that's that's what we have now it's just like we imagine

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.840
 what would be like if because we know people that are like in a very fortunate situation

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.320
 where they're like really close friends with their neighbor or like yeah and just like

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:38.320
 in the same neighborhood and that just like totally changes so much it's like the friends

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:43.320
 TV show just like yeah exactly it's just hanging out just not gonna you just show up and it's

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.620
 just like normal and this is maybe a little bit different for you but both me and Liz

01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:52.480
 had the situation at some point so it's not like theoretical we remember having it and

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:58.960
 then just it's gone it's just gone the sudden hmm and it feels like we don't know what the

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:03.720
 hell we're doing if we're not optimizing to bring that back like yeah it feels like what

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:12.140
 else matters yeah so I mean we haven't we don't know how we're gonna solve it but it's clear

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:18.100
 that making decisions based off of that is a good way to make decisions I think that's

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:22.320
 kind of yeah as far as we've got it feels like it should be weighted yeah should be weighted

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:29.520
 heavily and same and and this is something Casey and I've been talking about so yeah and

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:33.800
 I really got to find out the roster of people to listen to his podcast not that I don't want

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:37.120
 to be a different person based on who's listening but I just want to know like there's some

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.520
 conversations I would want to have before I go too deep on this conversation on the podcast

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.520
 it's not that I don't want people to know things it's that I would want to talk to them

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:50.720
 before I said thank you anyway whoops Chris could you cut that out this is weird moment

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:54.960
 when like something is set on here and I'm like I actually might want that out but I can't

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.120
 say would you cut that out because then it's just like a joke because it's gonna stay in

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:02.680
 there I guess I can just talk to him afterward but I'm fine we knew he didn't cross any lines

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:10.180
 here this is fine okay how do we land this plane the same way we do always which is bye

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:12.240
 yeah see ya thanks for talking bye.
