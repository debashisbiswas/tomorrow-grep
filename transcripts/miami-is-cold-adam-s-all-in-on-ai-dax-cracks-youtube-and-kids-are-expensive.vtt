WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.300
 I knew it. I knew I love them so much. Oh my god. I'm not even kidding. No one would know to ask that question, but I need to ask that question because I know you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.120
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.080
 - It's been a while.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.280
 - When was your last recording?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.080
 Was it more than two weeks ago?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.920
 - Two weeks?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.200
 Yeah, we didn't have two episodes.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.800
 Does that mean it's been three weeks or two weeks?

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.960
 I don't know.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.920
 Haven't talked to you since last year.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.040
 That joke never gets old.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.040
 It's always good. - It's not true.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.760
 We talked yesterday.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.960
 - Damn it. - We got a recurring meeting yesterday.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.800
 - We did.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.200
 We had a recurring meeting.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.640
 I'm actually super excited about this recurring meeting.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.080
 I feel like it makes Terminal more real.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.880
 It gives us all a little more.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.560
 Like I feel more motivated after the call yesterday.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.400
 - Yeah, it's true.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.800
 - We're all on the same page.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.200
 We got stuff we want to do.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.040
 It feels good.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.160
 I think the recurring meeting's good.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.080
 As much as I hate meetings.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.800
 - Yeah, I'll allow it in this case.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.640
 There's mitigating circumstances

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.440
 that mitigate my hate of meetings, so.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.000
 - What are the mitigating circumstances?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.840
 I'm not smart enough.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.600
 - It's like not anyone's primary thing.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.320
 So it's easy for it to flip.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.160
 - Yeah, do you think we'll actually

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.280
 have the meeting every week,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.080
 or is it gonna be like seldom?

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.160
 - No, I think we'll have it every week.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.800
 I don't think everyone has to make it every week, but.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.920
 - Sure, yeah.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.880
 - Yeah.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.960
 For example, I didn't make it yesterday.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.060
 - Yeah, for example.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120
 (laughing)

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.320
 That wasn't frustrating at all.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.960
 I don't know if you realize how important you are

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.600
 to those meetings because there are lots of ideas, Dax.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.280
 Lots of ideas that are coming in.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.680
 Everyone has ideas.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.120
 We need someone to say, here's what we're gonna do.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.440
 (laughing)

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.280
 - Yeah, I know.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.200
 I saw you guys in the call and I was like,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.720
 I'm gonna come, I'm gonna join here.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.040
 And they're just gonna, it's just gonna be like,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.000
 in some place that I don't even, I can't even imagine.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.760
 - What is the TV show?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.080
 Is it community when the guy walks in with the pizza box

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.160
 and everything's on fire?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.080
 - Yeah, it was that situation.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.760
 I wished we weren't on the call yet until you were on.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.960
 (laughing)

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.920
 - I'm not throwing shade at any of our team members.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.240
 It's just, without you, we're kind of the Wild West.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.720
 We would do a lot of things.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.240
 I don't know if they'd be in any direction at all,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.200
 but we would blow with the wind.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.720
 - We're gonna talk a lot of terminal stuff today,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.200
 just for what it's worth.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.480
 Sorry podcast listeners, this is as much tactical

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.480
 as it is content at this point today after a few weeks.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.240
 We didn't even plan on taking a break.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.800
 I don't even know if we talked about like,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.120
 hey, let's just take a break.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.160
 I think it just kind of happened.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.640
 - Yeah, my productivity wasn't great.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.440
 It wasn't at zero because I do like the two weeks

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.800
 where everything is kind of quiet,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.800
 'cause I could do a bunch of stuff without,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.200
 like every day I wake up and the first thing I do

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.600
 is go through our support channel.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.280
 And I don't like doing that.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.720
 So it's just this like, every day starts off on a negative.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.080
 In a lot of ways, it's just like hard to get started.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.440
 And those two weeks, you know, it's not like,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.320
 I know there's not much going on,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.200
 and no one's gonna like interrupt me

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200
 in the middle of the day and stuff.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.360
 So it's a special two weeks every year,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.680
 but I wasn't that productive either.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.000
 - Yeah, I could tell you were kind of like,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.320
 just chilling, taking a little time.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.040
 But between, it's not doing the podcast,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.480
 not talking for that reason.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.520
 And just like, I mean, everyone's pretty quiet

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.480
 during those two weeks.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.960
 But that just kind of reminds me of why I hate

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.600
 those two weeks and vacations and summer.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.720
 And anytime when I'm working and other people aren't,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.120
 I love when I'm not working and other people are,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.960
 that's fine.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.920
 It's just when it's the other way around.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.920
 It's very frustrating.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.360
 - Yeah, I could sense it.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.200
 - Yeah, so maybe before we get into a bunch of terminal stuff,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.040
 how you been?

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.400
 - How are things? We really haven't talked much.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.160
 - I'm gonna talk about the weather.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.240
 That's what I'm gonna do.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.960
 - Oh my God, Dax, no one cares about your 54 degree days

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.800
 in Miami.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.800
 Like, that's the warmest day I've had here in a month

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.400
 if I had a 54 degree day.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.040
 - Okay, I wake up and I walk outside

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.320
 in my underwear and it's 50 degrees.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.000
 And that is not a good feeling.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.080
 Okay, so then I walk back inside and I'm like,

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.880
 okay, let me like put on clothes, I guess.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.720
 - I guess.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.080
 - So anyways, I'm like, what do I even wear?

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.000
 It's like, oh, I guess I have to wear it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.800
 I'm wearing this like, I don't even know what to call it.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.800
 I don't even remember what these clothes are called anymore.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.240
 - They're called pants, Dax.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.080
 Those are pants.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.920
 - I'm talking about that.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.840
 Well, yeah, it's pants.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.320
 Yeah, put on pants.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.400
 And then this is like, is this a sweater?

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.520
 - Looks like a sweater, yeah.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.360
 - It's a sweatshirt?

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.200
 Maybe it's a sweatshirt.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.360
 - A sweatshirt, yes.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.720
 Okay, I'm not so good at this either.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.520
 - A sweatshirt, go outside,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.600
 'cause you don't have to blow bubbles for Zuko.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.320
 And my feet are freezing 'cause I don't wanna put on shoes.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.160
 And then like, my plastic grass is very cold.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.320
 (laughing)

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.160
 - Plastic grass.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.400
 - So that's very uncomfortable, okay, whatever.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.400
 Then I come inside, start my day.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.560
 I'm sitting in my room.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.720
 I don't have a heater in my house.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.720
 - Oh, yeah, in Miami, I guess you wouldn't.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.000
 - It's, actually, I think I might have a heater.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.520
 I just don't, I've never tried.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.200
 I don't know where it is.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.480
 More of the butts are.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.280
 I think if I turned up my temperature,

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.280
 I think the heater would kick on, actually, but I don't know.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.240
 It's weird to use a heater.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.120
 So now I'm sitting here.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.600
 And I've always said this problem where my hands

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.440
 get really cold, like my hands are just,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.600
 this blood just does not make it to my extremities.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.080
 There's something called like rain nods or something.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.200
 - Oh, I don't have a condition, but when I work,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.720
 like typing at my computer, and then I go like upstairs

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.440
 and I like pick up my boy or something,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.840
 he's like, ah, your hands are so cold.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.120
 Like my hands do get very cold, yeah.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.840
 - Yeah, so right now my hands are ice cold.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.680
 - Yeah.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.840
 - But that's what I'm dealing with.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.440
 And it's really sad for me.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.280
 It's probably the most tragic thing going on in the world

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.400
 right now, whether related.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.240
 - Oh my word.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.720
 - Dex, it's 26 degrees here right now.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.840
 I just looked at my watch.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.360
 Low of 12.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.280
 Would you die?

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.840
 Would you just fall over and die?

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.680
 I mean, you're from New York.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.840
 - I would just die.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.960
 It's just, the resistance wears quickly.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.800
 Like whatever.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.720
 - Yeah, the acclimation thing is so interesting.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.600
 Like if I went outside and it was 50 something degrees

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.800
 right now, I could be on my underwear

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.960
 and it'd be perfectly fine.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.560
 - You'd be wearing shorts, yeah, I remember that.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.240
 - Yeah, it would sound amazing.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.240
 - This is gonna last two weeks.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.640
 I have to deal with this for two whole weeks.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.960
 I don't know if we warm again.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.320
 - That's the period of winter you have there in Miami,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.400
 two weeks.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.720
 - This is, first couple weeks in January, so it was like this.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.080
 - This is the best time to be in Southern Florida,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.920
 in my opinion.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.440
 I don't wanna be there in May or June, any of the summer.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.600
 - No, that's better.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.160
 - This time of year, when you can be outside on Christmas

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.960
 and it's not that bad, that's nice.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.160
 I guess I'm always coming from a visiting standpoint.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.760
 So it feels nice, but if you live there,

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.840
 I guess it's just so cold.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.640
 - I mean, if you're okay risking death from freezing,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.960
 yeah, I guess you, I guess that's fine.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.600
 - Oh, that's funny, okay.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.720
 Well, no one can relate with you.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.560
 - That's how I've been.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.600
 - So, now I'm glad you're surviving.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.520
 You're difficult weather there in Miami.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.360
 - Not hurricanes, that's not difficult.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.200
 54 degrees.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.200
 - No, hurricanes are easy.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.680
 Literally no, hurricane is not a problem at all.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.600
 (laughs)

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.200
 We have fortresses here that are impenetrable.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.200
 We're good.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.040
 - Yeah.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.680
 - Okay, but here's another detail.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.400
 So I got kicked out of the kitchen,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.600
 'cause you know, I've been making two steaks

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600
 every single day.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.040
 - Yeah.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.520
 - We don't have a hood, like a range.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.360
 - A range.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.440
 - So I've just been blasting smoke into my kitchen

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.120
 for like three months, and it's just been covering

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.960
 everything with like a thin layer of something.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.440
 I don't know, I don't know what.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.560
 But I kicked out of the kitchen.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.720
 So now I have an outdoor setup.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.800
 I got a propane tank and a burner outside.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.840
 - Oh, no, you have to go outside in the cold.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.360
 - So now I have to cook out steaks.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.960
 - And like I have to put my hands over,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.080
 I put my hand over the firewall,

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.000
 'cause it's to stay warm.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.200
 - Oh, guys, I'm really struggling right here.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.960
 - That's the hardest anyone's ever struggled ever.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.800
 - Probably.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.640
 - Yeah, I have to do that to eat my rib eyes.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.720
 So take your advice.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.520
 - Yeah, you have so many tweets about meat.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.360
 It's crazy.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.840
 Just how many of your tweets are like,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.600
 here's a picture of Wagyu or whatever.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.840
 It's just, it's like your whole timeline.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.720
 I mean, you tweet a lot.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.600
 So it's a small percentage of your tweets, but.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.200
 - Yeah, it's, I'm literally, I like ration myself.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.000
 I want to tweet even more about meat.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.640
 I want to tweet about it like twice a day,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.920
 but I never check myself like twice a week.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.160
 - Just an alt account.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.480
 - Yeah. - That's just meat.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.320
 - Yeah.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.160
 - There just needs to be circles.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.560
 Remember, what was the, when like Google came out

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.120
 with a social media thing, and I remember,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.960
 do you remember that?

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.800
 Like this just, I just like.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.880
 - Who was that called again?

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.240
 - Google one, or what was it?

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.040
 There was like a whole like media frenzy,

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.040
 and we all felt it in there.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:36.880
 It was like Y2K.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.080
 It felt like Google's gonna take over.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.640
 Facebook isn't gonna be the dominant social media anymore.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.480
 It's gonna be Google.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.320
 - Google plus.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.840
 - Google plus, which now is probably a different product.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.360
 That sounds like an actual product, I don't know.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.920
 You know what I mean?

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.760
 - Yeah.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.040
 - Do you remember that feeling when that was coming out

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.880
 that it was like.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.920
 - I never felt like it was gonna be,

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.000
 I never felt anything about it.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.840
 - Oh really?

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.240
 - It just felt like this random thing.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.680
 - I remember feeling like this is gonna take over

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.560
 and Facebook's gonna be left in the dust,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.520
 and they had this concept of circles.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.080
 And like you said, all your different, yeah.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.200
 And it kind of makes sense.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.480
 Like you have different friends for different reasons,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.480
 and maybe they care about this,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.940
 and the other group cares about that,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.720
 and you don't wanna share everything with everybody.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.560
 I don't know.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.480
 It kind of makes sense, but in practice,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.040
 I don't think it does it.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.920
 Nobody wants to manage that kind of stuff.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.000
 - Yeah, how have you been?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.180
 - I've been good.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.960
 Okay, I got a little obsessed with the thing I'm working on,

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.720
 and that's dominated some of my thoughts for,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.960
 well it was like the Christmas break.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.640
 It was kind of like your period of not doing much.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.240
 I took a week off the Christmas week,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.840
 and by taking it off, I mean I took it off

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.440
 from my normal work, and I got obsessed

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.440
 with this little project, and it's stupid,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.560
 and it's fun.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.760
 And yeah, it's literally unbelievable.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.320
 Okay, we can't talk about it yet,

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.840
 but I do not even understand how Adam is doing this thing.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.760
 It's like, it's so weird and crazy,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.560
 and I'm like looking at it and using it,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.800
 and I'm just like, I don't understand

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.280
 how this is even possible or how it works.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.240
 - It's made possible by two facts

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.560
 that again, can't really say,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.880
 man, we have too many secrets around here.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.360
 - We just, I just thought.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.520
 And this isn't even gonna come out for months, probably,

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.920
 because we're gonna wait, and we got other stuff to do,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.640
 but yeah, there's two little known facts.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.600
 Two facts I didn't know about that make this possible.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.360
 And then yeah, it just opens up all kinds of possibilities

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.880
 once you know those two facts.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.880
 So stay tuned to terminal dumbness.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.320
 There will be something dumb at some point.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.680
 Well, there'll be a lot of dumb things between now and then.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.520
 - I think this might top coffee over SSH.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.640
 This might top it.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.280
 - Spoiler, it may be another way to buy coffee.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.120
 - Yeah, this might top it.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.240
 - Even dumber.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.320
 - Yeah, anyway, other than that, been good.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.640
 Ace is back in school, so my oldest is back to school.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.160
 We hired a nanny, and then she was like, nevermind.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.920
 After a week, Archie fell in love with her.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.080
 - Aw, that's sad.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.880
 - Like literally told her every day she left.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.120
 Like, I love you, bye.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.360
 And like, every day, when is she coming?

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.200
 When is she coming?

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.240
 And then turns out, she doesn't wanna be a nanny.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.160
 So it was her first try being a nanny.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.320
 And I think she just got bored playing all day.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.560
 Literally, we just wanted her to play with our youngest

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.840
 'cause he just needs constant, like, companionship.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.120
 And it means nobody gets anything done around here.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.480
 And she was basically like, it's such an easy job.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.800
 I even feel bad taking money for it.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.720
 He's the sweetest, it's too easy.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.800
 Sorry, I don't wanna do it.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800
 I'm like, whoa.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.480
 What? (laughing)

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.040
 Okay, so we're trying to find another nanny.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.240
 We have one starting on Monday.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.040
 We'll see how that one goes.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.040
 - Okay, so I have a bunch of questions about this

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.120
 because I don't know if you saw AJ posted a tweet

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.240
 'cause he's looking for daycare for his new baby.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.600
 That's like, probably six months older or so now.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.040
 And in Boston, which is like probably,

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.880
 I think he was saying is maybe the most expensive place

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.840
 in the world for daycare.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.680
 It's like $200 a month.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.520
 - Wow.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.080
 - That's for daycare where you like leave them

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.880
 with a bunch of, you know,

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.920
 it's not like an individual person is taking care of it.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.000
 - Yeah, I can hire a full-time nanny for that here.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.240
 - Yeah, so I was gonna ask, like, so I'm like, what?

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.560
 Right, I was like, I should probably look into this

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.320
 and understand these costs, not that.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.160
 - Yeah.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.360
 - Like I think you're just, you're just stuck paying for it.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.720
 There's like no, there's no really a way to wiggle out of it.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.600
 But yeah, I had the same thought.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.320
 I was like, that seems like you just have a full-time person.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.680
 - Yeah. - And the person that you hired,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.960
 like, are they considered full-time

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.840
 or is it like a part-time thing?

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.640
 - Like, I mean, these nannies are,

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.440
 most of them are open to both.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.320
 They prefer full-time, so.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.360
 - Yeah, but in your situation specifically,

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.200
 is that, is it a full-time thing?

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.520
 - Yeah, we're trying to get somebody for just like 30 hours.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.080
 We weren't trying to do 40.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.320
 And the two people we've talked to have been fine with that,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.320
 like 30 versus 40.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.680
 - Like six hours a day.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.600
 That what that comes out to.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.200
 - Something like that, yeah.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.240
 I think that's right.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.560
 - Yeah, yeah, five days, six hours, yeah, that's right.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.320
 It would just make a huge difference in our life

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.880
 because then Casey could actually have any time

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.520
 where she wanted to do something she wanted to do,

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.440
 or just even like, we just get so behind on house stuff,

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.840
 chore stuff that needs to be done.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.960
 Archie's kind of a special needs-ish child.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.400
 He needs a lot of something.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.000
 And we know we're not just crazy,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.320
 and he's not just spoiled or whatever,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.160
 because we've had another child,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.920
 and he wasn't like this at all.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.440
 Yeah, we don't know.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.800
 It's something we're gonna figure it out at some point,

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.520
 but we'll see if Nanny to take two works.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.280
 - Is this like a minimum wage job?

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.600
 Is it like, I'm trying to understand what-

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.280
 - Yeah, I don't know what minimum wage is,

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.880
 but it's around here anyway in Missouri.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.720
 It's like $15 to $20 an hour for Nanny.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.680
 That's what we're seeing.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.240
 - That sounds too crazy.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.120
 - It's not nuts, yeah.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.920
 The first one we had was like in her mid 20s.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.040
 This next one is 17.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.800
 She just graduated high school,

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.440
 and she doesn't wanna go to college,

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.920
 and she wants to be a Nanny.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.480
 So, and she's actually like-

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.240
 - It's been a lot of high school babysitting, like a lot.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.280
 So, I don't know, we'll see.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.040
 It'd be cool if we could have something for a few years

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.840
 that we knew it wasn't gonna get married

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.920
 and have babies and then leave us.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.000
 'Cause we had an assistant, Hayley,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.680
 who helps with this podcast.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.520
 Hi, Hayley, she is amazing.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.440
 Hayley's the best, and then she had a baby.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.480
 Congratulations, Hayley, I hate you.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.280
 Now she's having your second baby.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.640
 So, that's the thing.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.440
 You find somebody you really love, and they're great,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.120
 and they fit in your home, and everybody loves them,

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.360
 and then life events, you know?

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.280
 Just kind of the nature of-

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.880
 - But what about going to the opposite extreme?

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.640
 Get someone that's like 65?

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.080
 - So, that's another thing we've talked about.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.200
 Like, can we just hire and have like another grandma if we pay

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.560
 to come here?

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.440
 That could be interesting too.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.680
 We, I don't know if we've had a lot of people apply

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.680
 that were older.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.520
 - Older?

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.640
 - Yeah, most of them have been younger.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.160
 Maybe that's just a geographic thing,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.760
 maybe in this area, I don't know.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.480
 It does seem like there's gotta be a bunch of women out there,

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.520
 men I get, probably women.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.920
 We would probably prefer older women, I don't know.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.480
 Is that okay to say?

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.600
 - No, it's fine.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.760
 - Okay, yeah, it's fine.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.960
 I prefer it'd be a woman, so there.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.800
 Whatever.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.880
 - No manis.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.040
 - No manis, like, there has to be older women

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.280
 that don't have grandkids or their own,

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.000
 or their grandkids live far away,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.440
 and they're like, "Man, I wish I could just gram all day."

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.800
 That's probably a thing too.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.640
 We'll see.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.600
 Hey, if you live in the Ozarks,

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.000
 specifically close to Springfield, Missouri,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.160
 and you would like to nanny for our adorable

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.640
 little five-year-old boy.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.480
 Just take me out.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.800
 - And you're an older woman.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.840
 - Yeah, older woman or?

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.840
 - The same to this podcast.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.800
 - You're really anybody.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.840
 If you listen to this podcast,

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.400
 that's a pretty quick filter that I'm gonna hire you, so.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.880
 'Cause I'm an narcissist and I want anyone in the home

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.000
 to know that I have a great podcast.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.560
 (laughing)

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.680
 - So they're basically in the house all day,

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.040
 or they're like taking him out to my or how's it?

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.840
 - Mostly in the house all day, yeah.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.360
 I guess we haven't really sent,

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.000
 we haven't put either of our boys in the car

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.520
 with other people very much, like grandparents,

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.760
 but that's about it.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.720
 Ooh, that's scary.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.280
 Ooh, yeah, oh man.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.120
 My oldest is gonna be driving in like five years.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.360
 Ooh, what is that gonna feel like?

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.880
 I get it, I get all the tropes about like crying

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.000
 as they pull out of the driveway,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.640
 'cause that's terrifying to think of my kid.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.320
 I mean, he's 10 now, so I guess it would be terrifying

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.200
 if he was driving right now, but yeah, we'll see.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.600
 - Yeah, I get it.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.400
 Yeah, so yeah, we were talking about this too,

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.640
 and it's, yeah, we have some options

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.760
 because we have a lot of family.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.920
 - Must be nice.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.800
 And, but like, you know, we have this whole thing

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.600
 where this is very unsure how confident she is

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.240
 in taking that option.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.680
 Yeah, yeah, and then there's like,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.200
 and I don't know if this is, I don't know where you are,

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.480
 is populated enough for this to be a thing,

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.840
 but there's a type of nanny you're talking about,

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.280
 then there's like more professional ones

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.120
 that are like trained in certain ways.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.840
 So people, and obviously there's like a price difference there.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.840
 - Yeah, sure.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.760
 - And then there's like the local daycare

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.560
 which we can walk to, which to me sounds fun,

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.520
 especially when the kid is like not an infant,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.600
 'cause there's like other kids and stuff.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.880
 But yeah, again, how expensive is it?

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.560
 Is it full, is there like a weightless, like all that stuff?

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.600
 People, we will talk about how impossible it is.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.480
 And in New York, this was like so crazy.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.360
 All this stuff was just like so crazy,

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.400
 so impossible, like so difficult.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.400
 - Yeah, for, I guess for our situation,

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.160
 he's just a year away from, he probably goes

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.200
 to school in August.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.800
 We think he's gonna enjoy school.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.720
 - Yeah, short term thing.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.280
 - Yeah, it's really not long that we would need it

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.680
 unless he waits to you, 'cause he could technically,

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.520
 he wouldn't have to be in school

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.060
 until the following August.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.920
 So it's possible we need it for a couple of years,

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.760
 but we'll see.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.920
 - Yeah, the other option that exists here,

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.000
 which again, I don't know how maybe this is an everywhere thing,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.040
 but if you look up daycares on Google Maps in Miami,

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.560
 you'll just come across just like normal looking houses

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.560
 because it's pretty normal for like one person

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.720
 in the neighborhood just to like kind of start a business

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.360
 where they just take a bunch of kids

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.440
 and just be like, they'll have like five or six kids

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.640
 at a time and it's just at their house

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.720
 and it's like, you know, on a big street.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.560
 And obviously it's probably more affordable then.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.960
 - Yeah.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.800
 - Some of the other options.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.560
 - Yeah, I guess we haven't looked at daycares.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.080
 I mean, we're just both home.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.040
 So it'd feel weird to like take a kid.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.920
 - It's nice that that's what I was saying, Liz.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.240
 I was like, I feel better if they're just,

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.920
 again, assuming they're not old enough

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.840
 where like they would even interact with other kids,

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.360
 especially when they're like in fence or whatever.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.200
 - Right.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.760
 - As like, it feels better if someone's at her house

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.280
 versus us dropping them off some more orange.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.800
 - Yeah, and it's crazy that the cost isn't that different.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.480
 - Well, I guess I'm comparing Missouri and Boston.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.040
 So maybe very different.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:55.880
 I don't know.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.560
 Okay, that's enough about nannying and babies and kids

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.880
 and all those things.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.840
 Let's talk terminal.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.520
 'Cause I have so many thoughts and questions.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.800
 And by the way, this show is sponsored by terminal.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.880
 Fire coffee.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.240
 No, subscribe to cron.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.280
 No, become a cron member.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.120
 We're going to make cron.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:18.160
 It's a membership, it's exclusive club.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.640
 You're going to have so many benefits

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.560
 if you become a member of terminal, cron.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.600
 Max, tell them what they're going to get.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.120
 (laughing)

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.200
 - You know, it's so crazy that we don't even want

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.720
 to talk about it to anyone besides our cron members.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.880
 So we have a lot of really weird, crazy ideas.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.480
 We need to pull people to do it with.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.280
 So yeah, like if you're a cron member as boy,

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.200
 we're going to, that's the first place we're going to go

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.040
 for that stuff.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:43.880
 So if you want to support us,

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.960
 if you want to help us do some of the weird stuff we do,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.840
 please subscribe.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.000
 And we're going to keep saying every episode.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.120
 And the way you do that, we're going to say it every episode.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.360
 You can just SSH terminal.shop.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.120
 So go into our SSH store and you can become a member

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.860
 from in there, just buy cron.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.560
 There you go.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.480
 So the thoughts I have about terminal,

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.880
 I haven't that call yesterday.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.520
 And Began, BeganBot has been joining just like in our slack,

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.600
 he's in calls, he's a wealth of ideas.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.840
 He had the idea that nerds sniped me

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.620
 into this obsession I currently have.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.600
 So he's got all kinds of wacky ideas.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.680
 Love BeganBot.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.080
 Just being on that call, I realized like,

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.360
 there's kind of this like,

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.560
 we got the left brain, right brain thing going at terminal.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.720
 I feel like me, you and David could execute

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.000
 and build anything and build it really well.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.520
 Like we're very like precise,

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.440
 and we make really high quality things that we make.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.520
 And then prime, teach and Began are like our crazy cousins.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.560
 And they have the most wild ideas.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.720
 And they could just like, run with some stuff.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.160
 I feel like they should be able to just run

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.800
 with like a lot of Began's ideas around

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.000
 like what digital membership could look like for cron.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.240
 Like, I wanna like unlock them

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.240
 and let us keep building the very normal looking coffee company

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.680
 that's high quality, a great experience buying our coffee.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.720
 Not that we don't overlap and that there's not like,

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.720
 cross pollination happening.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.200
 But I wanna feel like they can like,

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.680
 do stuff without us having to be a bottleneck to their stuff.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.560
 Does that make sense?

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.600
 - Yeah, yeah, I gotcha.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.640
 And I think the way I always look at this stuff is,

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.160
 I feel like companies always

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.400
 fall into these like two distinct phases

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.360
 where there's an initial phase,

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.400
 where you have all these crazy ideas that you wanna do,

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.960
 but you just can't do them in this initial phase.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.800
 - Yeah.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.800
 - Then you hit some kind of milestone

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.600
 where then you can now start doing a lot of things

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.160
 that was kind of the point

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.320
 of even starting the company in the first place.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.360
 But that like sometimes takes like years

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.280
 and sometimes companies like never even get there.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.680
 So to me, I feel like we're like in that initial phase,

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.720
 I don't think we're far from being out of it,

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.400
 but it's gonna feel uncomfortable

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.600
 whenever we have these like really exciting things

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.880
 because we don't really have a mechanism to,

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.640
 there's like so much foundation to lay

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.720
 before we can do that.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.560
 - Yeah, that explains the way I feel a lot, I think.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.720
 'Cause we do have so many ideas

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.160
 and it just feels like

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.600
 because it's everybody's kind of side thing,

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.480
 it feels like we're always gonna have more good ideas

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.600
 than we have bandwidth to execute on them.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.760
 We were saying maybe there's just this phase we're in

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.280
 and eventually we get into a phase

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.520
 where more of these kind of things that we dream up

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.760
 and wanna do actually happen.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.440
 - Yeah, yeah, I don't think we're that far from it.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.040
 There's just some stuff that we need to set up

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.680
 and it's funny to think like it's always easier to forget

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.960
 'cause we're always focusing the next thing

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.840
 and we like forget of all the things

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.200
 that have added up already.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.040
 - Yeah.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.960
 - Like we don't think at all about our

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.000
 crafty purchases at all right now.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.840
 - Yeah, it just happens.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.360
 - It's like totally, that used to be something

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.160
 that was like such a focus and every single week

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.400
 we were like trying to make that happen

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.480
 and now we like don't even think about it at all.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.800
 So I think eventually some of the stuff we're working on now

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.280
 will get there and then we'll have more leverage

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.760
 to do some of these bigger things.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.600
 - Yeah.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.440
 - It's gonna be uncomfortable, it's over there.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.960
 - But did what I said, does it make any sense to you?

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.680
 - Yeah, that makes a little sense.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.160
 Yeah, I think the way you described

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.800
 just like the leanings of the people makes sense

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.280
 and people, yeah, I think not being able to make the stuff

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.120
 they want to make happen is not good.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.000
 - Yeah, it's like, like I would never do,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.560
 like I'm thinking from like a marketing standpoint

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.280
 and just like creating content and putting stuff out there.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.800
 - I would never do anything like what those three would do.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.000
 It's just not in me, I'm like very perfectionisty

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.360
 and like everything's very polished

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.080
 and I want to do things like a certain way.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.720
 But like they're like fire from the hip, crazy ideas

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.240
 and like some of them not even a lot of effort

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.520
 but they really resonate with the people who like terminal.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.200
 I feel like that has to come from them

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.400
 and how do we allow them to go direct?

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.480
 How do they not like, I don't know,

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.480
 have to like run stuff through the company or something?

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.040
 Like, does that make sense?

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.200
 I feel like there's like a disconnect

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.920
 where they can't just do those things

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.920
 and I don't know what it is.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.000
 - So like I think what you're describing is the idea is born

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.640
 and then nothing ever happens after.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.800
 And part of that is because maybe they like literally

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.880
 can't make it happen, that's half of it.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.960
 But I think the other half is actually just a little bit

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.480
 of a, I don't know what the right word here is but

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.440
 it's the same dynamic where everybody in the planet,

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.640
 everybody, but every engineer in the planet has ideas

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.160
 for like sad projects or whatever.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.600
 And like such a small fraction of people get it to happen

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.120
 because it's very easy to underestimate

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.680
 like all this other invisible stuff around these things

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.800
 that you need to do.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.600
 And then when you start doing it,

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.000
 you're like suddenly become aware of it

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.760
 and then your motivation just

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.360
 or you get distracted or it goes away.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.320
 So yeah, like that muscle I think is just a little weaker

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.520
 with them 'cause that they just,

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.680
 this is like not something that they've done a lot.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.800
 - So there's this perfect example

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.720
 where one of them had an idea for if we're late,

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:23.440
 like we can't ship our first CRON membership box

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.480
 on February 1st and we have to March 1st,

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.680
 we could just send a blank shipment that has like a node

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.280
 in it that's like project delayed.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.360
 It's kind of funny like programmer humor.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.840
 And that idea just sounds like, yeah, let's just do that.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.120
 But it's like when you start thinking about,

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.200
 okay, how would we do that?

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.180
 The actual logistics of that are kind of a pain in the ass.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.680
 And like there's actual steps that have to happen

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.680
 to make that happen.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.880
 It's not just like, oh, okay, yeah,

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.320
 that's just to like buys this time thing.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.920
 Like no, that's actually a thing now we'd have to do.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.120
 What does that note look like?

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:51.960
 Is it printed?

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.800
 Is it written?

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.760
 How are we getting all that set up for Maher?

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.640
 How big of a box?

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.960
 What are we, are we putting in an envelope?

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.200
 What are we doing?

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.480
 Like there's so many questions still

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.640
 that like an idea like that can sound so easy

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.960
 and like this is a thing we can do

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.960
 because we're not going to have the hard thing ready.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.720
 But even that is like a whole bunch of work

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.920
 and it's kind of a hard thing.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.760
 And it just comes down to like for a high performing team

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.200
 everyone has to understand everything.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.840
 There's like just no way around that.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:25.120
 So if you don't like really know how the details

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.360
 of what it looks like from having an idea

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.920
 to like making it happen, you just don't have it.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.440
 You just like don't build up the sense around that.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.280
 - Yeah.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:39.080
 So I think those three have the desire and the bandwidth

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.800
 to like execute on these things.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.360
 Do we just need to help coach and guide them

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.560
 towards taking those steps?

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.400
 Maybe that's it?

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.240
 - Yeah, I would say so.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.680
 I haven't thought about this at all.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.160
 So I haven't like, I haven't like been able,

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.200
 I haven't like done anything to help that.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.080
 - Yeah, use your big brain.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.960
 Do that thing where you just stare at the wall and think

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.680
 and maybe come up with some answers on this.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.560
 One unlock us to do more of the crazy things.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.640
 - I love two minds.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.600
 So one is what I just described.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.760
 Like the best team, every single person does everything.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.520
 Like they just not do everything.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.640
 And that's just always going to be the best.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.560
 But it's not realistic to take any group of people

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.720
 and have that situation come out

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.080
 because we have some advantages.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.560
 It's not like there's some upsides

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.800
 to the different people on the team

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.320
 that like are very specific.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.640
 And the thing I'm describing is not very specific.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.320
 It's a very general way of doing things.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.840
 So the other part of me thinks, okay,

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.960
 like maybe we need to build a way to make it

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.320
 so they don't explicitly don't need to like know anything,

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.240
 you know, anything else about the process.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.560
 So yeah, I'm not sure.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.080
 Like I just need to think about and understand.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.080
 - Yeah, like, I guess I've been thought about it too much.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.520
 But yeah, if we just get better

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.440
 at some of the common logistical stuff

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.440
 that always happens whenever we do something

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.760
 and it's just kind of like something that's not,

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.240
 isn't it like going from zero every single time?

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.080
 - Yeah.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:15.040
 - Then it's possible that like they don't even need to know much

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.880
 and it's kind of all enabled.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.720
 - Yeah.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.520
 - The other thing is like literally if we just have,

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.680
 if we just make enough money to hire one person,

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.320
 that is like basically full time,

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.320
 that kind of just serves as like the solution

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.840
 to a lot of this stuff.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.840
 - Okay, like it's not just stuff we send to people

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.920
 who buy stuff.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.920
 It's like just our social and content properties.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.160
 Like that could all just be blown out so much more than it is.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.120
 And I feel like they have that skill.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.840
 So that would be great.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.400
 - Yeah.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.240
 Yeah.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.080
 Yeah.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.880
 There's a bunch of stuff, but I think ultimately

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.680
 like you're identifying a problem correctly.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.640
 I just don't know exactly what to do about this.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.480
 - What the solutions are.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.320
 - Yeah.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.160
 Okay, that's fair.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.680
 - Totally fair.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.840
 Yeah, there's just a lot of stuff on the terminal front now

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.040
 with the coffee business that I care about.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.600
 I feel like toward the end of last year,

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.720
 it was like terminal is an events company.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.240
 And after our last event,

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.920
 it's like very excited about doing these events.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.680
 And that was just a lot of fun.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.440
 And now I kind of think like in January,

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.760
 I'm just feeling like we got a lot of stuff we could do

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.040
 to make the whole like we're an e-commerce business thing

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:29.880
 more real.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.600
 And yeah, I guess I'm excited about that again.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.880
 I don't know about events.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.080
 - Yeah, I mean, that has to be the foundational thing

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.400
 'cause that's the only thing that is available

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.320
 that we can like, like I said,

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.120
 we don't even think about our week to week coffee sales anymore.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:46.960
 - Yeah, it just happens.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.800
 It's kind of nice.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.000
 - Yeah, whereas an events thing

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.040
 is never gonna really get there.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:52.880
 - Yeah.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.960
 - Yeah, we just haven't like tapped.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.200
 There's like so much untapped stuff here.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.040
 - Oh man, we should do it.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.560
 - Another little teaser for those who haven't become

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.200
 a CRON member, if you're listening to this podcast

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.840
 and you're not a CRON member, how dare you?

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.920
 - What are you even doing?

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.080
 - What are you even doing with your life?

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.520
 If you're not a CRON member,

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.520
 just a little teaser that the first bag has been designed.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.520
 It's hopefully gonna go out February 1st.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.160
 And it's amazing.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.960
 It's hilarious and amazing.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.720
 And David is incredible.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.000
 Like art won't be the best designer ever.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.680
 David is just the best.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.200
 - It's so funny 'cause when we were describing the idea

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.200
 during the meeting,

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.560
 yeah, I had like an image of it in my head.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.700
 And then like an hour later,

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.360
 David designed it and posted it.

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.320
 And I was just laughing 'cause I was like,

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.400
 this looks like nothing like what I imagined.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.240
 - That's so good.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.040
 - It's like a thousand times better than anything

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:41.880
 I could even comprehend it.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.360
 - So it was an hour after the meeting,

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.840
 he posted the artwork.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.760
 And during the meeting, when we're describing the idea,

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.120
 he's having like Google and look up what we're talking about

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.400
 'cause he's never heard of this.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.640
 We went from not knowing this was a thing in programmer land

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.360
 to like designing this amazing bag

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.320
 that represents the idea so well in an hour.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.160
 It was impressive.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.640
 - That's so funny.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.480
 - Yeah.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.040
 Okay, so that's terminal.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.520
 Anything else about terminal?

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.600
 Should I throw something else, but I can't remember.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.400
 - No, I think that's it.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.240
 - That's it?

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.080
 - That's it.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.080
 Okay, what else we're gonna talk about?

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.240
 What's been going on in tech?

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.640
 You wanna talk about technology?

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.800
 - I was gonna tell you some,

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.840
 I've been doing a lot more YouTube.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840
 - How do you have?

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.040
 I've seen some of your YouTube.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.080
 - Yeah, so we've been, that's like,

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.840
 it's a bunch of stuff with like the actual,

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.640
 like I see itself has gone to a good place.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.920
 So now like we're reallocating effort to

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.760
 - Marketing.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.960
 - The YouTube side, yeah.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.160
 And it's kind of funny.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:47.040
 I'm like, all right, this is gonna sound really arrogant.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.080
 So prepare yourself.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.920
 - Dax.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.840
 (laughing)

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.000
 - No one is surprised.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.360
 Okay, I'm like, we're gonna do YouTube seriously.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.400
 Let's try to like max out what we can get out of it.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.680
 I looked at a bunch of other company YouTube

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.960
 trying to like figure out like, okay, what's the bar?

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.640
 Like what's possible?

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:10.040
 Looking at other like tech individual YouTubers

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.320
 in our space, that's looking at their numbers.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.120
 And I was like, okay, let's set some goals for ourselves.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:21.120
 Let's get to a place where for like a educational type video

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.240
 we put out get 10,000 views in a week.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.200
 That's like, from what I saw is like,

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.440
 that seems like a decent goal.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.320
 Everyone always talks about how hard YouTube is

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:35.080
 and even getting there would probably be pretty difficult.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.200
 The first video we did got 25,000 in two days.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:44.200
 And I'm kind of like looking at this and I'm like,

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.680
 so I started watching a lot more YouTube in the past month.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.840
 Not like in our space, just like in general.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.960
 I've been trying to like reduce,

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.840
 I would like reallocate like what I'm watching

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.600
 and doing more YouTube so I understand it better.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.600
 And I like, and I see a bunch of people that I like

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.160
 and I watched her stuff and it is so, so much better

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.200
 from every like micro, like the obviously production quality,

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.600
 but also like every single word they say in the video

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.560
 was like perfect.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.560
 Whereas for me, I feel like 30% of the words

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.000
 in my video were correct and like, you know.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.400
 It's like, I'm definitely right at the beginning.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.000
 But like, it's already doing better

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.680
 than what everyone kind of makes it out to be.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.320
 I feel like your tubers are always like,

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:29.400
 this is so hard, like it's so hard to be a YouTuber

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.680
 and get views and like, it's just such a grime.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.800
 But there's like talking about stuff and like,

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.520
 okay, maybe I just had one lucky video

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.880
 and like the rest are gonna suck, but like I've made two cents

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.040
 and they've all crossed that initial goal

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.840
 that I thought was gonna take us a year to get to.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.120
 So I say, it just feels a little bit like--

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.000
 - This is too easy.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.880
 - No, I'm like, I'm more commenting about like the attitude

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.160
 from the YouTubers of being like--

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.280
 - Oh, I see.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.520
 - I kind of wonder like, are you just making it

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.960
 so you have less competition?

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.760
 'Cause like, everyone talks about it.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.120
 A lot of people are like, oh, I'm kind of interested

00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.360
 in this, but it sounds really hard.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.160
 - It's like gatekeeping, is that what that's called?

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.280
 - I don't know if that's what it is, but it might be

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.200
 subconscious, but I'm like, I don't know.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.800
 - Well, yeah, I wonder like your case.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.440
 Do you chalk that up to like, people are hungry

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.000
 for more SST information?

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.920
 Or are you positioning the videos just broadly

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.600
 to like developers and teaching like,

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.160
 what is your sort of like positioning of the videos?

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.720
 - Yeah, so we see two gaps.

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:31.280
 So one gap is within the AWS space, they're just--

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.120
 - Yeah.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.600
 - So for example, we made a Aurora verse RDS video.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.880
 So I searched up on YouTube.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.180
 Okay, Aurora verse RDS.

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:39.080
 Classic question that like everyone using

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.440
 AWS has, like what the hell do you need to do?

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:46.440
 One video that I thought was kind of okay, like okay.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.600
 Everything else was like just nonsense.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.440
 - Yeah.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.560
 - So there was really just one result for that.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.280
 So we're like, okay, they're pretty crazy.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.800
 There just isn't a lot of stuff in this space.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.640
 - Yeah.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.400
 - So when we make videos like that,

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.000
 and we have a lot of, we have infinite ideas there

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.840
 'cause there's just so much stuff we can do,

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.600
 we don't expect those to go that big

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:10.080
 because we're focusing on some audience.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.680
 But to be fair, we have like,

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.840
 it's not like we're starting from zero.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.880
 Like we have a community that like, you know,

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.720
 we'll drive stuff there.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.640
 But you know, most of the views are that from there

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.120
 are coming from like 80 plus percent of the views

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.880
 on those videos are coming from people discovering it

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.880
 from within YouTube.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.240
 So we're not driving them from Twitter or anywhere else.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.320
 - So they're coming from Twitter.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.160
 Yeah, sure.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.000
 - Yeah.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.600
 And then, but then I also, we make a bunch of those

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.560
 and I'm like, the ratio that roughly have is

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.320
 for every four of those I make,

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.080
 then I'll make one of these other kind of videos,

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.840
 which is trying to come up with stuff

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.920
 that's as broad as possible.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.800
 So the first video I made was just on Go.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.160
 I was just like talking about my friends around Go.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.000
 - That's when I was thinking of that, yeah.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.840
 - And that one did like, I would say that one did probably

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.040
 like two or three times better than our AWS stuff,

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.800
 which makes sense, it's a bigger audience.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.120
 - Yeah.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.520
 - And when I made that video, I was watching it.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.360
 I was excited for the idea, then I made it

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.960
 and I was like, man, like this isn't that good.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.920
 And I was kind of like, not super excited

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:04.760
 about putting it out.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.360
 But then, like I said, it did pretty well compared

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.640
 to what I'm seeing out there.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.640
 - Yeah.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.120
 - Like in my head, 50,000 views was like,

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.720
 if you're gonna get 50,000 views on a video,

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.480
 you're like super legit to the point where you can get

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.560
 a response, like it's like, yeah, like a big deal.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.720
 But I feel like we're maybe a year away from that.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.840
 It doesn't feel like unattainable.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.160
 - So it's weird to me, you've talked about

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.880
 this AWS content gap.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.960
 It's weird to me that like AWS is that much more niche

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.680
 than Go, because like everybody uses AWS.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:39.160
 I feel like for there to be so little

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.680
 in terms of content out there in the third party world,

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.160
 like AWS puts out a ton of stuff,

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.040
 but like YouTubers that just do AWS stuff.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:49.080
 There's not that many and like tons and tons of people

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:49.920
 use AWS.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.800
 AWS is the thing that's the most common.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.680
 That more people use and don't talk about,

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.880
 it's so weird to me.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.960
 Like why on Twitter is there so little discourse

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.840
 about AWS when like you go to, I remember being at TwitchCon

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.240
 and TwitchCon is like the most opposite,

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.920
 even though Amazon owns Twitch.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.720
 It's like the most opposite thing to AWS I can imagine.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.560
 And we're sitting around,

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.360
 they're all the developer streamers at TwitchCon

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.360
 and we're talking about AWS

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.800
 'cause they'll work places where they use AWS.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.120
 And it's just wild to me.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.200
 - Yeah, I think what we've, what I found is

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.160
 I don't know how to position these videos

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.840
 so that they're stuff that a broad audience

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.160
 would actually try to watch.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.960
 So the Aurora versus RDS one.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.840
 So that was me experimenting with,

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:32.840
 okay, let me just like hardcore do like a very explicit,

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.200
 this is an AWS video.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.360
 Obviously like you might even find it from searching

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.480
 about this topic.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:42.920
 But I feel like not that many people,

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.440
 even if video is good, just not that many people

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.240
 are even gonna like go watch that.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.520
 I don't know why it just doesn't,

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.160
 I can see how it doesn't feel like appealing.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.000
 - Yeah.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.280
 - Whereas I can definitely explain some AWS stuff

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.360
 in a much broader way where a lot of people do watch

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.280
 and like the AWS part is almost like a Trojan horse

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.420
 to like explain this bigger topic.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.400
 So yeah, I don't know, I just think there's not a lot of,

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.680
 it's very common, but I think there's not a lot of like

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.200
 interest in people trying to spend their like educational

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.120
 hours on that.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.560
 - So interesting.

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.360
 Yeah, it's like, is it not, it's not sexy?

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.040
 Like if I wanna learn something about developer,

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.680
 yeah, like I wanna learn some new language.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.480
 I wanna learn about Zig 'cause I got some time now,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.200
 I got an hour and I wanna watch something.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.360
 Like watching like how to choose between RDS and Aurora

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.400
 versus like I'm gonna learn a new language

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.000
 is definitely less appealing, I guess.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.600
 - Yeah, but I also think you're right in that

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:40.760
 it is a giant population and I feel like once we crack

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.240
 something, like those videos might end up being much bigger.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.080
 - Yeah.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.160
 - Like there's no reason why they shouldn't be that time

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.000
 is bigger.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.080
 - Yeah, I'm glad you brought this up.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.400
 This is actually a thing I forgot that I wanted to talk

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.840
 about when we were talking about terminal,

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:56.520
 which is I got a message this morning from Bash

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.760
 who is working, she works for Charm, right?

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.240
 On the Charm CLI, she's in our terminal Discord

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:09.240
 and she wanted to show how to fix a bug in our shop

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.640
 and she's like, well, I can't get it running

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.000
 'cause I don't have SST set up.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.880
 And I've just generally when like, we've open source

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.120
 or repo, I want to have the open source community

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.200
 feel like they can come in and do stuff.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.960
 We have so much stuff we'd like to do in the shop

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.120
 if we could have other people doing stuff for free.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.520
 That sounds amazing.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.720
 But how do we make it so that it's like super simple?

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:38.720
 Maybe it is just like more, making a more clear set

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.880
 of steps if you don't want to run the whole back in.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.440
 Maybe just people who want to work on the front end,

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.120
 that's like a happy path where they don't have to do

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.200
 anything with SST.

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.480
 But like more broadly, do you think there's like

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.760
 still just some kind of gap?

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.800
 'Cause SST is super easy to get running

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.600
 and it's super simple, but it's just,

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.000
 is it lack of familiarity?

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.520
 - No, the issue here is they don't have an X story,

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.440
 AWS account, that's actually the problem.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.240
 - It's the AWS account dependency.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.720
 Can we make, I had this idea, I had that thought

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.600
 and I had this idea, can we just have like an AWS

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.920
 sandbox account that we make available

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.440
 to people who want to do open source contributions?

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:16.120
 - If they're just working on the SSH app,

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.880
 that requires two variables.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.200
 So, SST Shell is really nice,

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.560
 'cause we don't have to like think about it,

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.280
 but they could also, we could just say like,

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:28.080
 make a .n file with pointed to like the dev API server

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.520
 and the dev auth server or whatever,

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.360
 whatever it needs.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.760
 I've got two with the two R and they just go run it.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.400
 - With just node or whatever?

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.960
 - No, they can just call, they can just do go run.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.840
 - Oh, go run, the SSH store, sorry,

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.680
 that's what we're talking about.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.400
 - Yeah, sorry, yeah, yeah, go the language run it, yeah.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.160
 - Yeah, okay.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.360
 So, but what if they do want to work on the whole project,

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.960
 but having people set up a new AWS account

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.520
 or if they've never had an AWS account,

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:57.320
 that whole process, just so that they could contribute

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.600
 to our thing, is it possible that we just give people access

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.040
 to our AWS account, is that a terrible idea?

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.680
 - Yeah, it is terrible idea.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.600
 - Okay, well, I mean, that literal thing is--

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.360
 - Not like they can log into the console,

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.840
 but just like some limited permissions

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.120
 that they can like interact and use.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.160
 - I mean, we think about this as C all the time

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:22.160
 because it's like a new user, general new user problem.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.200
 Like someone wants to try it as a C, but then,

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.400
 but they don't have any of this set up

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.800
 but they don't have any of this account.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.760
 There's like a whole set of things there.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.800
 Yeah, I mean, there's something to think about.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:36.080
 Like, I think there's a way where we can make them,

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.400
 'cause if you think about the components,

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.960
 like we could make it run all locally without--

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.720
 - I wondered if that's exactly where I was headed

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.360
 in my mind was like, what if you just had

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.280
 a little bun served that was like your router?

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.000
 And what if you just had local versions of all this stuff?

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.760
 - I mean, if we care about this,

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.640
 we can rework our architecture to like optimize

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.480
 for this a little bit.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.200
 So if we're radiant, I did do that.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:04.520
 I'm not using, I'm using like almost no AWS specific services.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.640
 Like it's just a container for the backend.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.640
 So it can run like very simply locally.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.360
 Like even if it's SSD dev, like that's just

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.680
 bringing up local commands for the most part.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.520
 - Yeah.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.920
 - So yeah, we can like, if there's something we care about,

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.760
 we can rework it.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.560
 I even built, there's nothing I've been working on

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:26.600
 as well, we're kind of over over the break a little bit

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.840
 is our next open library, open event.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:35.200
 But this is like a durable workflow async events thing

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.480
 that just depends on your database.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.920
 Like if we start using that kind of stuff,

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.000
 then like, yeah, there's no dependency on

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.800
 some of these more AWS specific things.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.680
 - Yeah, I'm trying to think about our current terminal

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.880
 architecture.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.880
 Is it, it's a router with a bunch of Lambda function URLs

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.720
 for the API?

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.560
 - Yeah, I know.

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.960
 So we can just swap that to a container.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.580
 - Yeah, it could just be a container.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.080
 And then we can just run it locally with Docker

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.760
 and everybody's happy.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.560
 - Not even with Docker, just run it just--

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.680
 - But our database, oh, database plan scale.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.120
 - You'd have to bring up MySQL locally.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.320
 - Yeah. - Okay, bring up MySQL locally, yeah.

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.320
 - So I want to understand better,

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.160
 like what, I don't expect anyone to work on a backend.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.160
 - I don't either, I guess.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.080
 But like, it'd be, yeah.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:18.920
 I guess maybe not.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.160
 Yeah, maybe the use case is just,

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.280
 I want people to be able to come in

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.400
 and work on our front ends.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.720
 We have a few of them.

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.320
 And add features. - Yeah, that's a creation.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.200
 We just need to make that a little bit easier.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.880
 It shouldn't require too much rework.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.360
 - Yeah.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.640
 Okay, yeah, I don't want to do a big thing,

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.240
 a big effort just to support a use case nobody has.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.520
 I don't, yeah, I can't imagine somebody

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.600
 wanting to change our API.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.600
 And it's being like, yes, merge that P on it.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.680
 (laughing)

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.120
 It sounds far-fetched.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.160
 - And if they're, if they have something

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.760
 that they do want to do like that,

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.120
 they should be good enough to submit a PR

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.000
 without ever having running the app.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.760
 - Just side unseen, just first try.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.600
 I don't need to debug.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.320
 - If you can't do that, like it's unlikely your PR

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.400
 would have ever been good enough for us to merge.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.400
 - Good point.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.760
 Oh, I want to talk about AI coding assistants,

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.360
 because something switched for me over the Christmas break

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:11.160
 where I decided I'm going to use these things way, way more.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.680
 And maybe you've been using them this much,

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.520
 but like hit the cloud limits every day,

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.960
 twice a day kind of thing.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.520
 And like just using, I don't know,

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.400
 do all the, do just like 01 pro have this idea of projects

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.040
 where you can just drop a bunch of files

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:24.880
 as context.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.720
 - That could be, did add projects.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.560
 Yeah.

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.400
 - Okay.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.240
 - Remember when I switched to cloud,

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.840
 that was like right when they added the projects feature.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.200
 And then it was huge deal.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.360
 - So that thing is important for me

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:39.360
 because my workflow is to drop like all my current files

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.760
 I'm working on all the context that needs into the project.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.960
 And then I just ask questions in the project

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.000
 to like make improvements.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:47.840
 - Yep.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:51.400
 I do that with all of our database schemas

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.240
 'cause then I can just ask it for like,

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.120
 anytime we need to like have an analytics question,

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.240
 I can be like, oh, how many users did XYZ things?

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.240
 And it just puts out a single query.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.080
 - Nice.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.200
 And it gives you SQL queries?

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.040
 - Yeah.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.440
 - Yeah, I actually just give it the drizzle definition.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.440
 So it like can understand all that.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.280
 - And it figures it out from there.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.760
 Yeah, it's actually kind of incredible

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.080
 some of the things it can do.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.520
 But then also it's kind of incredible

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.160
 how bad it can be sometimes.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.920
 Like you can get it stuck in a loop,

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.760
 especially if you have one long conversation

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.240
 and you keep going and keep going.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.640
 Where it tries like 15 times to fix a problem

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.760
 and it just never does it.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.200
 Like I just keep going 'cause it's funny

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.200
 and I wanna see like, will it never figure this out?

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.480
 You definitely have to figure out like when to leverage it

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.280
 and when not to because it's,

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.760
 I haven't figured out the like what problems

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.360
 are just not good for it.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.480
 And what ones it can nail and do them so quickly.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:37.800
 I don't know if you have any secret sauce there,

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.600
 but like the process of exploring, leveraging it way more.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.760
 The workflow is kind of clunky.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.760
 Like copy pastes of around.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.800
 - That's what I wanna talk about.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:49.720
 So there's, so I have a few thoughts about this.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:54.320
 So one, someone linked me to a CLI tool called Glimpse.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.120
 It was made by someone on Twitter.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.200
 I forgot it wasn't, and he works on DINGBOARD.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.280
 It's a simple CLI where you just do Glimpse

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:09.000
 and then a folder and then it will scan all the files

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.360
 and organize and like understand the file tree,

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.360
 everything and just put something in your clipboard

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.600
 that you can paste right to any LOM.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.960
 And then you can ask your question.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.360
 So to like tell the LOM like, here's a file structure.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.360
 Like here's each file and like it makes sure

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.800
 that it'll like cap it if you're like

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.280
 exceeding the token amount and stuff.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.560
 So that's like one thing to help smooth that out a little.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:34.120
 But here's actually what I think should exist.

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:38.000
 There is a file system API in the browser.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.280
 So instead of us like having to like upload files

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.480
 to this project's concept,

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.320
 I should just be able to share a folder.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.160
 - Yes.

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.440
 - They give permissions for this app to access this folder.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.440
 So it can read and write to it.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.440
 That way when I'm asking the LOM like,

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.440
 hey fix x, y, z things,

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.320
 it can just write those changes to the file

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.320
 and I can go back in my editor and it's right there.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.080
 It's not like going through git or anything.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:04.920
 - No, right.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.760
 - So I think that's like a really cool workflow that I actually.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.520
 - What were you saying about the browser though?

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.720
 What, how the browser coming up like?

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.840
 - Oh, you're saying like if you're using,

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.880
 you're using cloud in the browser is what you mean like.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.720
 - Yeah, like the--

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.560
 - I gotcha.

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.960
 - There is an API in the browser

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.000
 for a user to share a folder.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:22.840
 - A folder?

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.200
 - Yes, with an app.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.480
 - Yeah, the app could read the contents of the folder.

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:30.880
 So it can like use that and like load context in x, y, z,

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.720
 whatever.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.120
 - Yeah, where you can just ask questions,

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.520
 it can write directly to buffers and then, or to files

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.800
 and then you don't have to have this whole back

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.480
 and forth copy paste job.

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.480
 - That would smooth out the convenience of time.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.320
 - Oh, it'd be amazing.

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.560
 - Yeah, I did see one app that had that.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.120
 That was, it says with all these things,

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.720
 it's just like they build this giant solution

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.280
 for like the company they want to build

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.080
 and all of it is like roughly wrong,

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.680
 but then they'll have like one feature where they like

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.000
 really nailed it and nobody else has.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.240
 And so I saw that in one of these products.

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:08.240
 - So I'm really excited about this idea of like this workflow

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.880
 of like I'm an engineer, I'm in charge,

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:16.240
 but I'm leveraging LLMs to like think about my code base

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.480
 and make improvements, add new features, fix bugs.

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.560
 There's also the Devin thing, which is exciting too.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.880
 Like I'm excited about--

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.680
 - I churn from Devin.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.600
 - Oh, just tried really hard to make it work.

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.280
 - So I thought this could be like both,

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.880
 it could be like they both live on and like these agents

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.920
 are kind of doing these agent workflows and submitting PRs.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.880
 That's an interesting input output for me.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.880
 Like it's not stuff I'm actively working on,

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.640
 it's like out of band.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.000
 I thought that could coexist,

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.760
 but I'm more excited about this idea that like,

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:46.960
 I want to improve, yes, the workflow aspects

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.280
 of what seems like a very powerful mental model

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.560
 where the LOM has awareness of your code base

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.200
 and its improving files or suggesting changes.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.640
 So yeah, I feel, it's got to get better

00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:58.720
 and I don't want to use cursor.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.680
 Everyone is like, that's what they're doing with cursor.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.360
 But like, I don't want to change my IDE just to have this.

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.320
 It needs to be able to work with any LLM

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.280
 and it needs to be able to work

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.760
 within my text editing workflow.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.120
 - That's why I think, so that's what's great about Devin.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:14.200
 So I think about those two different approaches.

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:18.640
 There is Devin, which is I think if I was to build

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.360
 a company in this space, like I think that's a right thing

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:25.400
 to try to go for because Devin is basically saying,

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.440
 you don't need to change anything about anything

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:29.360
 that you're doing.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.160
 - Yeah, we're trying to build something

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.120
 that looks like a human.

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:35.360
 So if you already set up to collaborate with another human,

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.200
 this can work for you.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.360
 None of your workflow changes like they submit a PR.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.720
 And the second thing is it's unsupervised.

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:41.860
 So you give it a task and it's supposed to come back

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.920
 hours later, you're not going back and forth with it

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.280
 every like 30 seconds like you are today.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.400
 But I think that's great.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:52.320
 The reason I turn from it is the results just aren't

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:57.320
 good enough where it still feels like I have to watch it

00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.040
 and give feedback very, very frequently.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.600
 So I think the raw power just isn't there.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.400
 But in terms of the shape of the product,

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.120
 I think it's really great.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.160
 - Then you think that can coexist like in the long run

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.680
 when that improves, you think that is a use case,

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.400
 but you also have this like supercharged

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:15.320
 local development workflow?

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:18.320
 - Well, I think if that exists that throws into questions.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:22.640
 So much because that thing is scalable.

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.920
 Like you can spin up a thousand of them if you want.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.560
 The other thing we're talking about today,

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.640
 which is more like help me as an individual be more efficient.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.880
 Like, yeah, you can like improve that,

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.880
 but you can't horizontally scale that

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.760
 because it's still depending on you, the person.

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:38.840
 - Yeah, sure.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.840
 - So I think if Devin crossed that bar,

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:42.720
 it's like high bar potentially impossible.

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.520
 So like they might not ever cross it,

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.320
 which is why there's this other class of bets,

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:50.400
 which is let's just make this augment like the human.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:55.080
 And I feel like this category is like

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.880
 the product execution here is like horrible.

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:58.720
 This is what you're saying.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.280
 It's like so clunky.

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:04.760
 They make you massively shift your workflow.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.840
 - The fact that I'm still doing it,

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.000
 even though it's that clunky though,

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.640
 speaks to like this needs to exist.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.480
 - The potential.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.440
 Yeah. - Yeah, exactly.

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.400
 So like, yeah, just make it so,

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.800
 that's why I'm excited about going to the file system

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.320
 'cause that is a true common thing that exists across the board.

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:25.320
 So like, I would like to see something like bolt or,

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.960
 there's no more looking against it, lovable.

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.560
 I think it's called.

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.400
 - What are these?

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.240
 I've never heard of these.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.000
 - It's like, you've tried V zero, I'm assuming.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:33.960
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.720
 - So Claude is like a general purpose LM,

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.320
 whereas these are like more focused around code.

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.520
 So theoretically, the product experience around the LM

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:46.160
 should be like better than using a general purpose thing like Claude.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.000
 - Yeah.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.040
 - But what they're lacking is they just,

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.080
 because it's not this unsupervised thing,

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.680
 I'm like needing to go back and forth with it,

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.080
 which is the point,

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.640
 you need to make that back and forth process like very seamless

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.200
 and they don't for some reason do that.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.400
 - Yeah, so okay, that just reminded me

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:05.000
 there is a third workflow thing that AI is doing for us.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.040
 And that's the like, I mean, it's the co-pilot.

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.360
 What do we use?

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.200
 - Okay, it's super maven.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.480
 - Super maven, I use that as well

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:12.800
 'cause I do whatever you do.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.240
 And then somebody has been recommending,

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.720
 where is that tweet?

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:21.040
 I'm on Twitter as we speak, hang on.

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:21.880
 Here we go.

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:24.040
 A bunch of local models people have recommended

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.680
 for like that are tailor made for programming,

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:32.120
 things like, I'm gonna find it, I swear.

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:37.040
 Deepseak and there's another one somebody said Quinn 2.5.

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:40.200
 So there's these models that are like specifically

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:46.000
 better co-pilot models, I guess, the open source models.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.200
 That's like a whole nother class.

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.800
 It's like line by line.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:52.480
 I want AI to just predict my next characters.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.800
 But then there's like this claud projects

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.920
 like broader context on the whole code base,

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.400
 rewriting whole files, refactoring across files.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.680
 There's that thing.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.560
 And then there's the like, agentic,

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.640
 Devin maybe never exists thing.

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:10.680
 It's interesting how AI within programming is like many things.

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.440
 Yeah, yeah, there's so many different ways you can go for it.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:18.040
 Yeah, Devin's like the big bet and the rest are like incremental.

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.120
 Yeah, I mean, is Devin like the we don't have a job

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.880
 if it does work, like who cares,

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.160
 we're not gonna even be around?

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.440
 I don't, I don't know.

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.600
 I don't know if it's that crazy,

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:29.200
 but it definitely extremely disruptive.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.040
 Yeah.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.960
 And we kind of rethink what our jobs are.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:34.800
 Yeah.

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:35.640
 In that case.

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.840
 Well, I really liked the idea

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.400
 of this supercharged version of programming.

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.600
 And just, it allows you to do things

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.760
 that I wouldn't try to do.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:43.600
 Exactly.

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:46.200
 It allows me to take on tasks I wouldn't even try to do on my own.

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.280
 'Cause I don't have enough context.

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.800
 I've not dabbled in that thing enough.

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.120
 I don't know the high level,

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.600
 like how you can go about solving that kind of problem.

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:55.200
 I just feel so brave to go out and do big crazy,

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.560
 stupid stuff.

00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:59.080
 And it's because claud can give me a first pass.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.800
 That's like amazing.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.360
 It's, it's incredible what it can do.

00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:04.000
 And you can like,

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.800
 you can like create a course for yourself effectively

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.600
 like get up to speed on any like obscure thing.

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.400
 Like as I, I mean, I say,

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.360
 I think it like just massively lowers a risk

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.880
 around attempting any feature.

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.240
 And it's so clear that the ST multiplexer

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:23.240
 and ST tunnel both are like really useful good features

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.720
 that are like maybe core of ST now.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.000
 Neither would have existed pre-LM.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.520
 Just would we wouldn't have even tried it.

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.280
 It would have felt like too weird or crazy of an idea

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.800
 to take a risk on.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.080
 Yeah, because we would have felt like

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.480
 I would probably wouldn't have been able to put it off.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:41.120
 Yeah, it does away with that question of like,

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.000
 am I able to do that?

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.600
 Like, is this something I should try and take on?

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.360
 I should just leverage something else.

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.280
 Like, no, I feel like I can take on anything

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:50.280
 because it'll help me fill in the gaps quickly.

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:52.600
 Yeah, open auth also kind of falls in this category

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:55.840
 because previous iterations of it,

00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:00.360
 I always hit a wall of like very obscure questions of,

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.080
 it'll always be something like,

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.400
 why should I not use a JWT for the refresh token

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.680
 or like why can't I use an identity token for authorization?

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.840
 It was like very specific

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.000
 and nobody has like clearly spelled it out,

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 but interrogating in LN.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.960
 I was able to like really understand a bunch of things

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:17.280
 that were kind of eluding me for years.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.600
 And the other thing is like, yeah, if I sat down

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.200
 and I'm like, the next two weeks of my life,

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:25.880
 I'm just gonna like master auth

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.040
 or whatever I'm gonna understand, respect.

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.800
 I'm sure I would have been able to do it.

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.680
 But this let me like kind of casually acquire that experience,

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.960
 that like knowledge while working on other stuff.

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.480
 Just like here and there.

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:36.680
 And eventually I hit a tipping point

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.360
 where I was like, okay, now I like fully get it

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.160
 and I can go do it.

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.480
 Yeah, there's a very exciting world

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:46.240
 where an individual developer is doing things

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.200
 not possible before.

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:52.320
 Like I used to feel that way about some of the like

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.000
 AWS managed infrastructure stuff.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.400
 I mean, really what SSC is doing.

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.240
 And I still feel like it allows smaller teams

00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.320
 to do things that used to be really painful.

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.680
 This is just like a different version of that.

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:07.880
 And it builds on top of that, even like you can,

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.440
 you can still do all those things.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.440
 But now you can like take on really weird tasks

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.640
 that I can't talk about because it's a secret.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.800
 I like rebuilt so many things

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:20.240
 for this very stupid, specific environment

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.440
 that I'm building this.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.440
 I've rebuilt so many like open source projects

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.360
 in like 30 minutes that like work for this particular case.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.920
 It's really, it's interesting things

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.680
 that I never would have tried to do.

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:35.720
 And like, yeah, yeah, I just can't talk about it yet.

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.920
 It's so stupid that I can't talk about it.

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.920
 This feels similar to, I remember like earlier in my career,

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:45.520
 my process for learning a new thing.

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.720
 I can remember this very clearly.

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.320
 I was like, I need to use Rabbit MQ.

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.760
 I need to learn Rabbit MQ.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.680
 So my approach was I would just keep Googling

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:57.040
 until I acquired like 10 to 15 articles

00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.280
 that like roughly covered everything I had a question about.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.400
 And it was like this process. - You got like tabs open.

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.680
 That's what I do. - Yeah, you know,

00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.840
 process that took a bunch of whatever.

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.800
 And then I realized like, I'm just building a shitty book

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.960
 whereas if I just buy the Rabbit MQ book,

00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:14.320
 like the Rabbit MQ book and just read it,

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:16.360
 that's just someone that pre-compiled

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.160
 all of that stuff for me.

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.960
 And then since then whenever I had like,

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.800
 when I was definitely going into like a new thing,

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.000
 I would just buy the book on it and just read the whole thing.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.680
 And I could skip this whole,

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:29.000
 let me like kind of scrounge around for the information.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.040
 And I feel like LMs are kind of similar in that

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.560
 you can just ask it about a topic

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.160
 and it just like pre-researches everything for it.

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:39.400
 You don't have to like go like look up all this stuff.

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.800
 Like when I was working on multiplexer like,

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.520
 you know, what are all the different ANSI codes that exist?

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:45.640
 And like what are the common ones

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.200
 and what are the ones that are special about the term?

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.960
 Like I would have to expect someone to have like

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:52.360
 documented that exact question,

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.680
 but you know, Adam could just pull that up for me on demand.

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.120
 - It just creates a bridge so much better

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.240
 than like traditional Google page indexing.

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.680
 It creates a bridge from like the actual world

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.520
 and everything that's been done so far

00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:07.600
 to your brain and what your context is.

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.920
 Like it creates this amazing map

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.520
 that like is so hyper specific to what you're doing

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.120
 and where you're at.

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.280
 Whereas like Google, you'd have to go from like,

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.160
 yeah, like you said like 15 different sources

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.880
 of information and you're trying to cobble it all together

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.360
 in your head and make it all make sense for your context.

00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:26.560
 The LMs bridges that gap so nicely.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:29.720
 And even going back like I would even say

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.800
 that multiplexer thing was the first thing I did

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.000
 that was so heavily L-unassisted

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.320
 that I didn't even do it right.

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.160
 Like I was still using some of my old habits

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:41.720
 of being like, I gotta find a library

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:44.720
 that someone implemented that kind of has what I want.

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:45.840
 And I'll go from there.

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.760
 And that's what the current multiplexer is.

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.480
 It's something I found that's like kind of working.

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:53.680
 And then I use LMs to like add all the stuff that I needed.

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:57.360
 But looking back, I should have just gave up that first thing.

00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.200
 I should have been like,

00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.600
 I can just implement this from scratch

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:02.640
 because the LMs would have made it really easy.

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.200
 Yeah, my ordering was all wrong.

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.960
 Like I tried to find it.

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.920
 Then I use LMs to help me like understand

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.600
 what this kind of thing even does.

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.320
 And I liked it and I filled in the gaps.

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:15.400
 But I could have just had an LMs explain to me everything

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.760
 about how terminal stuff works up front

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.760
 then implemented it and then I would have been in a better place.

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.520
 And it's probably what I'll do for a V2 of it.

00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:25.600
 Yeah, how weird if you would have like told us a year ago

00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:30.280
 that we'd be seeing so much time building like terminal things,

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:35.440
 like just how much like we've had to like build Tuis

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:38.840
 and like environments that run Tuis.

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.720
 I mean, you're doing like the next layer down.

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:44.720
 It's just wild how much our careers are weird right now.

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.280
 We're not building React apps.

00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.840
 I struggle with this because I like,

00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:53.600
 I can't tell if I'm just heavily in some weird bias

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.560
 because I'm looking at a bunch of things

00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.720
 and I'm like, wow, like a Tuis just like,

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.720
 there's so many things that could be a Tuian and aren't

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.960
 and it would be such a good compelling experience.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.280
 But I can't tell if it's a bias or not.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.080
 But I'll give you an example of this.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.600
 So someone tweeted yesterday just try as a T.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:16.200
 Wow, it's so great except it sucks

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:19.080
 that I have to like go set secrets one by one

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.440
 and like it's such an annoying process.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.280
 And I agree.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.120
 It is like a very unknown thing.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.040
 When you add a new secret, you have to like do

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.000
 or you make a new stage and you have like five secrets

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.160
 to think it's like a pain in the ass.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.400
 And obviously I'm like, yeah, SST secrets should just open

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.760
 a Tuis that just shows you all the secrets

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.880
 and then it helps you type it in and like makes it very easy.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.200
 And that would be a fantastic experience.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.520
 But like, am I just being biased?

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.960
 So like doing everything from the terminal

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.960
 or like is this truly a good experience?

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.040
 And it like composes so well, right?

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.520
 Like we have that standalone SST secret UI

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.360
 that's just for setting secrets.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.040
 And then SST dev, that just becomes a tab that's already--

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.840
 Oh, in your SST dev, yeah.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.160
 And you're made, what's it called thing?

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.040
 Multiplexer, yeah.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.440
 Multiplexer, yeah.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.160
 So like every feature can be, it's like it can be

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:11.120
 a pure CLI command, SST secrets set X, Y.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.880
 Or it can then be a Tuis, or it can be embedded

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.080
 in SST dev.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.720
 And I'm like, this feels so compelling to me.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.720
 And to me, I'm like, once I have that kind of thing,

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.560
 I'm never going to want to use something else.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.800
 At the same time, I tweeted the other day

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.000
 that pissed off everyone.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.800
 And if you saw that, people got so mad at this.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.520
 I was like-- Oh, I didn't see what was it.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.960
 It makes me sad that people use a VS Code terminal.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.440
 And oh, I saw that tweet.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.080
 I swear, the reason I posted that

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.640
 is because when people use SST dev in the VS Code terminal,

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.280
 there's a whole set of things that are buggy and don't work.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.520
 So for me, I'm just like, man, it sucks

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.520
 that they don't get the full, nice experience out of it.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.000
 And people, I would say, understandably interpreted it

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.360
 as you suck for using the VS Code terminal,

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.520
 which is fine interpreted that way.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.240
 But then the number of comments I got

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.760
 replied being super pissed is the part where I'm like,

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.760
 you're just an idiot.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.480
 You can't really-- it went so far a way

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.600
 to get to really be bothered by this.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.240
 So on that hand-- and a lot of people

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.760
 were replied being like, I don't get it.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:14.080
 That's just where you start your program.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.560
 Why would I-- so then I explained,

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.400
 my issue is that it's not that, like,

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.280
 integrate terminal in your data makes a lot of sense.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.160
 I get it.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.200
 I just wish it was better.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.600
 And they're like, what do you mean better?

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.400
 How could it be better?

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.360
 All I do is run basic commands there.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.000
 I run npm start or whatever it is.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.440
 Or it's just where you do git commit.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.480
 So yeah, part of me wonders, am I just making this up?

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.040
 Or is it that if I built good experiences,

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.440
 then people would be like, more people would actually use it.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.760
 I can't tell which way.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:45.640
 Yeah, but--

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.520
 But that reminds me that Ghosty came out.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.720
 And now I'm realizing it became the thing of the day.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.840
 Everybody's talking about how awesome it is.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.360
 And I realized so many people don't really take advantage of it.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.360
 Or they're not really-- they're like, yeah, this is cool.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.680
 But like you said, if they're just running git commit in it,

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.160
 then, like--

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.200
 Yeah, it's like, what's it like?

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:06.880
 Who cares?

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.600
 They want to be part of using--

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.800
 Yeah, like they want to be part of using the cool new thing.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.760
 But it's like, they're not really benefiting that much

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.040
 if they don't use the terminal much.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.320
 And I'm not saying developers have to use the terminal a lot.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:22.400
 I feel like it made my job a lot more fun getting

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.160
 into that kind of stuff last few years.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.800
 Whereas before, I would just made changes in VS code

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.080
 and get committed.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.360
 I think in the last few years, I've dove more into the--

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.800
 like, programming is fun, but I need more hobbies.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.240
 And that the terminal kind of became that, I guess.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.400
 I mean, I just don't really--

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.520
 when people-- the thing I can feel confident about is,

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:49.020
 at the end of the day, you have to bring up your back in

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:50.360
 and you have to bring up your front end.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.040
 Like that, I would say, like, at minimum,

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.880
 you're dealing with that if you're

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.320
 like a typical web developer.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.280
 Yeah.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.600
 That means you need two things.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.120
 Like, even if you're using VS code,

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.600
 you need like two tabs or two, whatever.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.520
 And to me, I feel like that is maybe the good sign

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:12.520
 that this stuff is useful, because I think anyone

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:16.080
 can understand how a multiplexer makes that nicer.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:16.580
 Yeah.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.200
 And once you have multiplexer, you

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.480
 can see how adding more things in there makes it nicer.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:21.280
 You can see how--

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.440
 bring up everything at once makes it nicer.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.640
 Oh, I love the SSC Dev experience.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.760
 I mean, I've gotten so used to it now.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.280
 And then Aaron's been doing his thing,

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.680
 which is like the exact same thing.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.960
 And he's done a really good job.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.560
 I don't know if you've seen this stuff he's worked on.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.280
 Oh, is it?

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.520
 It's like the same thing as SSC Dev.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.520
 Co-load.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.020
 Solo?

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:38.520
 Solo?

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.640
 Oh, Aaron Francis.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.720
 I'm not going to lie.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.440
 I was like trying to figure out who you were talking about.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.280
 There's a lot of errors.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.120
 I love you, Aaron.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:44.620
 Yeah.

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:45.880
 No, there's just so many errands.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.400
 Yeah.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.680
 It's not related to the key built.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.000
 It's totally independently running

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.320
 across the exact same problem.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.680
 And landed on very similar solutions.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.520
 And his implementation is very good.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.040
 We're probably going to steal a bunch of ideas.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.240
 Tell me what it is really quick, because I think I saw him

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.000
 mention it, but I think I missed the announcement

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.200
 or something, so I don't know what it is, actually.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.520
 It's the same thing as SSC Dev.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:05.880
 Just for the Laravel world.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.080
 So it understands your Laravel app brings up your front end

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.120
 Laravel.

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.320
 It'll put your logs in a separate tab.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:16.080
 He has a really cool feature, which I think I'm going to steal.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.560
 He has something called dump in PHP.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.040
 It's effectively like a special log command.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.200
 It's like you use it only when you're debugging.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.920
 He pulls those out into its own tab.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:28.420
 Nice.

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:30.680
 So I was like, oh, it would be cool if I like--

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:33.800
 if you did console log something,

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.760
 it wouldn't show up in the main functions tab in SC Dev,

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:37.600
 because that's like a mess.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.120
 It got pulled out into a separate tab.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.920
 So if you're debugging something,

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:44.680
 you can see a less noisy tab with just your debug statements.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.960
 That sounds nice.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:50.320
 He also made it a horizontal thing at the top, which I considered

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.240
 at first, but I was like, well, you're going to run out of space.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.680
 But then he made it scrollable.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.000
 I'm like, oh, that's actually perfect.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.320
 Like tabs, you mean like horizontal?

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.860
 Yeah.

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.080
 Now, what did he actually make?

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.720
 I'm so dumb when it comes to this stuff.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:06.840
 It's like a multiplexer like you made?

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:07.600
 It's a multiplexer.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.160
 Yeah.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.440
 It's like a specialized T-mux.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.800
 That's all-- that's what SC Dev is.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.280
 That's what zero is.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.840
 That's what-- sorry, that's what solo is.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.600
 And that's what-- and a Turbo Pack also has the same thing.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.560
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.400
 OK.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.800
 I was a contributor to Turbo Pack way back in the day.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.520
 Oh, wow.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.880
 Back in my next day of stage, you know?

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.520
 That was going.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.720
 I guess that was my first exposure to going.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:30.240
 I had written--

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.360
 I'm not going anymore.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.480
 It's not on Rust.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.640
 Oh, well, of course.

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.600
 But that's a whole nother conversation.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.920
 I actually-- not going to lie.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.440
 I don't know what's going on with Rust right now.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.880
 I think Prime-- I heard you guys talking

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.120
 about it on call yesterday.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:44.600
 Like, Prime did something, and now Rust is a main topic.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.040
 Again, I haven't even caught it.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.640
 I actually was going to post about this today.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:50.280
 So Prime made a-- it was funny.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.480
 I remember there was like this week where he was like--

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.920
 should I just like write this in Rust?

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.240
 Or should I just kind of go back to writing Rust for this thing?

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.080
 And then I went in the chat with the convincing to do it.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.080
 So he was like, fine, I'm going to do it.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.160
 And then day later, he made a video of being like,

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.800
 I'm done with Rust.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.840
 And I watched the video.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:11.440
 And you know, it was like a really good, reasonable video.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.160
 It wasn't like, Rust sucks.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.000
 You shouldn't use it.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.720
 It was just like-- he's used it a bunch.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.600
 He's been in that phase where he loved it.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.120
 He's been in the phase where he like was really enamored

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.040
 by some of the ideas about it.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.560
 And now he's in the phase where he feels like, you know,

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.200
 it's just really, really, really, really heavy

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.600
 for what he's getting out of it.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.520
 And he's just like not super happy with where it actually

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.040
 ends up practically.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.520
 I think it's very reasonable.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:41.240
 And like, he's like, I just want something simpler

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.480
 that is still low level, that feels better.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.560
 And he's like, I'm just not having fun writing this anymore.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.640
 It's like, the parts that I enjoy it

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.480
 don't make up for the parts that are painful.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.360
 But I was like, this is very like reasonable.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:56.080
 And I was like also my same feelings around Rust,

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:59.080
 which is why I don't really use it for anything anymore.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.720
 But like, people got really mad about it.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.800
 And like, people are like just saying, like, I saw the reason

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.960
 I was thinking about it is I saw a comment being like,

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.240
 he doesn't understand Rust.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.240
 That's why he's saying this.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.240
 Like, he doesn't understand it.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.240
 He's not really a Rust user.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.160
 I'm just like, no, the stuff he brought up

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.720
 is like, you can't get to there unless you've like been

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.560
 through the whole journey.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.760
 So clearly, like, he does.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.960
 But yeah, people are upset for whatever reason.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.720
 Is it like prime?

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:25.480
 I like prime.

01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:26.080
 He's a friend.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.000
 He's a co-founder.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.120
 Is it bias that I have this memory?

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.200
 Did he not like, is he not like a huge reason

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.800
 Rust became the zeitgeist?

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.840
 Like all the like, trendiness, he was so obsessed.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.960
 Well, that's a point where I found it annoying.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.600
 Like I literally found it annoying.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.680
 And I was like, when people talk about Rust being

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.680
 this like, cool thing that people use

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:47.840
 and it's mostly like streamers,

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.560
 that was mostly prime, right?

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:50.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.320
 I didn't know if there's people before prime

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.320
 that I don't even know about,

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.560
 but like, like, showing Rust and making it cool.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:09:00.160
 But I feel like he brought, he give it and he take it the way.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.920
 He, he brought Rust into prominence.

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.680
 And then he said, you know what?

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.840
 Not that he brought it into prominence.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:06.600
 That sounds wrong.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.760
 Like, I'm sure lots of people use Rust for lots

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.640
 of great reasons and they ship stuff on satellites

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.600
 and doing whatever they're doing.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.840
 He definitely created a lot of interest.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.400
 The Twitter interest.

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.760
 Like the people we hang out with,

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.440
 the YouTube and Twitter and like,

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.840
 very online community got very obsessed with Rust.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.200
 And that was a lot of primes doing.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.680
 And then, yeah, and we're sure that there's like genuine cases

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.400
 where someone wouldn't have heard about it,

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.240
 if not for that.

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.280
 And they ended up using it in a very good situation.

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.920
 Like, I think about my years with Elixir

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.840
 that were so formative to like me understanding

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.440
 distributed systems and like just so much impact,

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.760
 like functional part of a bunch of stuff that impacted me.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.040
 And it was because it just showed up on Hacker News

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.800
 like three times in one week.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.000
 And I was like, okay, now I have to look into it.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.720
 So I'm sure that definitely happened.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.560
 Interesting.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.400
 This one's been long.

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.240
 Have we gone a long time?

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.080
 I can't really read the numbers.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:52.920
 They're so small.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:53.920
 It's been 12th.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.760
 Oh, wait.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.800
 We've been off for two weeks.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.680
 We got like, you know, let's just make this time.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.920
 Let's make it three hours.

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:02.040
 Cause it's been three weeks.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.280
 We're going to make up for the other two episodes.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.160
 I got nothing going on.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.000
 Let's do it.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:06.920
 I'm just kidding.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.920
 That's what's going on with that.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.240
 And he's like looking into Zig now.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.000
 And I've been looking into Zig a bunch too,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.560
 just coincidentally in the past couple of months.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:18.120
 And yeah, I think the one thing you can make fun of prime before,

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:22.200
 which everyone should focus on is he falls in love

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.920
 very quickly and gets everyone,

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.000
 tells everyone that they should fall in love too.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:28.840
 Yeah.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.760
 And then he like maybe falls out of love.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.000
 Yeah, it's the, it's what's that cycle?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.560
 The hype cycle chart.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.760
 It's like, yeah, exactly.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:37.880
 He does that very fast.

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:39.920
 Well, TJ made a really funny meme today.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.720
 He used that Grim Reaper meme.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.800
 He won't wear it like he goes into each thing.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:44.640
 Yeah.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.160
 He's prime like killing each language with his love for it.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.480
 And an eventual hate for it.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.520
 Yeah.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.240
 Hopefully, Zig can withstand the prime train.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.080
 Yeah, we'll see.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:55.840
 Yeah, we'll see.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.040
 Okay.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.240
 Well, you have to pee.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.880
 And that's, it's the new year, but I still have.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.560
 So I know first because you told me

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.520
 that you peed right before we started.

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.360
 Yes.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.160
 So you literally have to pee.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.680
 It's been one hour and more frequently.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:13.280
 You understand me going an hour and 13 minutes is like long.

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.880
 Like IP every 30 minutes in the morning after I've had coffee.

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.880
 It's IP this morning when I woke up.

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.920
 That's it, I probably have like a prostate issue or something.

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:22.800
 And it's been like five hours.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.280
 And I won't pee probably for the rest of the day.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.800
 Oh my goodness, I get up every 30 minutes to an hour.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:28.400
 Yeah.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.200
 Well, not the second half of the day.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.240
 It's like something cools off.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.600
 Maybe I just stopped drinking so much water or the caffeine.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.840
 I don't know, something happens.

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.600
 And then like second half of the day, I don't pee much.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.600
 First half of the day though.

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.920
 Well, you're in just a lot of pee.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.400
 Just peeing everywhere.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.880
 Oh, yeah, sure.

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:46.080
 Because I totally stand when I pee like a normal US adult man.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.000
 I don't think I said, I don't care for whatever.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.240
 Is it, is it, are your toilet seats heated?

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.280
 They are.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:54.760
 I knew it.

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.640
 I knew it so much.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.960
 Oh my God.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:58.840
 I'm not even kidding.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:02.560
 No one would know to ask that question, but I need to ask that question because I know you.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:06.200
 I think my toilet seats are one of my favorite possessions.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.920
 Like sitting on my toilet seat is such a moment of joy every single time.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.280
 Because it's like every single time I forget.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.880
 And it's cold right now in Missouri.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.040
 It's like 20 degrees.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.240
 And I'm going to the bathroom.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.480
 I just got to pee and I sit to pee like a normal European male.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:24.440
 And as I'm getting ready to sit down, it's like, oh yeah, the toilet seat is heated.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.040
 Oh, I love it so much.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.480
 It's the best feeling.

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.480
 I recommend them.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.920
 Yeah, so my toilet seats are never cold except for this week.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.320
 So this week I have cold toilet seats.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.680
 Yeah, that's 50 degree toilet seat.

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:36.640
 You just buy one, man.

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:37.720
 They're the best.

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.120
 Mine's, it's Toto.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:39.680
 It's so good.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:41.960
 Frank was taught me to buy a heater for my room.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.760
 And I'm like, I don't think it's worth, I don't want to like some like random ass

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.320
 heaters in my room for like, just get like a, just get like a big GPU rig and start

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.160
 like doing local, old limb stuff and it'll be heating everything up, right?

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.160
 There you go.

01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:01.400
 I, I just really want, I want like just a heat lamp over my keyboard, so my, my hands

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.400
 are just keep your hands.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.400
 Yeah, that would be good.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.520
 I actually did have like a desk mat that was heated.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.800
 My wife got me once trying to solve the hand thing.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.960
 I don't know if it solved it or not.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:09.960
 I guess not.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.760
 But they should make keyboards that are hot.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.560
 Oh, the keyboard should be hot.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.120
 Of course.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.120
 Of course.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.120
 Great point.

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:19.120
 Yeah.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.120
 Okay.

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.120
 I really can't see.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.120
 All right.

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.120
 All right.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.120
 See ya.

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.120
 See ya.

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:25.120
 See ya.
