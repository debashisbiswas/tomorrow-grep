00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 You're gonna love our guests coming up. It's got a great interview coming up. Excellent guest,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.800
 really top notch. I'm just gonna say that so that can be in there. Chris knows what to do with it.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.240
 I just got back from like a I went outside. I went and saw someone in person. I was very

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.360
 confused when you were telling me about that because you were like, someone hit me up and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.720
 wanted to meet up and I'm like a nixa in Missouri. They did that. No, it's a friend. But okay, so

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.480
 can you believe that I'm old enough to have been failing out of college 17 years ago? I haven't

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.520
 seen this person in 17 years. That's like a whole adult. I still don't think the math works. I know

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.160
 you probably did the math run somewhere because that seems impossible. No, it's possible.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.920
 2005 or wait, was that? Did I do the math run? Did I do the math run tonight?

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:21.520
 Five, fifteen? No, 18 years ago. Yeah. Wow. That's insane actually. It's 2023. That's when

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.160
 you were a freshman? Yeah, in college. Wow. I worked at the Geek Squad at Best Buy and this

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.920
 person worked with me at the Geek Squad. His name is Roger. Hi, Roger. He might listen to our

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.840
 podcast now because he knows we have a podcast because of course when I see someone they're like,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.840
 how's life been? I'm like, I have a podcast. And then they never ask to hang out again.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.600
 Yeah, right. Oh, you have a podcast. Okay. Well, actually got to be somewhere. I had coffee if

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.120
 you can't tell. There's no amount of such instance in the world that could calm me down right now

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.720
 because I have so much caffeine in me. Did you like hanging out with a real human being outside of

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.960
 your house? It was nice. I mean, I was checking threads all the time. But like, other than that,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.040
 oh, I'm just kidding. Oh my goodness. No, it was really, it was nice. Go ahead. I didn't say,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.720
 well, that's a topic for the day, obviously. It really is. Yeah. For the day. Maybe not tomorrow,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.600
 but today at least. Okay, tell me what you really think because you're online personas like everything

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 socks and like, what do you really think? Yeah, basically. Okay. Well, hang on. So a little bit

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.920
 of context because people might be listening to this episode later. Threads came out yesterday,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.040
 which is a new Twitter clone from, I guess they say it's an Instagram app. So from Instagram slash

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.040
 Facebook slash meta from made up from made up, whatever they call themselves. It's exactly like

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.880
 Twitter, except I guess there's no except it's exactly like Twitter. It's exactly like Twitter.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.640
 Yeah, I actually want to hear your thoughts first. I don't want to go first. Yes.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.320
 So thoughts, one, Twitter's been around a long time. How, how is the, the threads app so nice?

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.520
 And it's like, it makes it so obvious how the Twitter UX, even just like the mobile app on iOS,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.560
 it's just so like not nice. I don't feel good when I use it. So they nailed that part where like,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.520
 everything about it just feels more polished. But like when I hit, when I send a tweet or whatever

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.840
 they're called, it just works. I don't have to like go to the thing where I'm like, send anyway,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.680
 maybe that's my own problem. Maybe you can turn that off. I don't know. But like all the little

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.480
 animations and like you press buttons and they vibrate and everything just feels good. That's

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.560
 my first impression. I don't know if that's enough. That's funny because I just posted almost the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.520
 exact opposite. Oh, really? Because okay, so I definitely agree from a UX point of view. It's

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.640
 much better. There's like not all this like clutter with, you know how if you like open a tweet on

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.240
 Twitter, it's like a full analytics dashboard below the tweet. It's like views likes. Yeah,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.400
 there's so much stuff. Yeah. It's like there's like three rows of stuff there.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.680
 So there's definitely a lot of clutter on Twitter. But I was using both the app side by side. And I

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.720
 actually, I expected the threads have to be like super polished and snappy feeling. But at least for

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.000
 me, I'm using the iOS. I don't know if there's an Android app, but it's the iOS app. Everything

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.440
 was slower, like refreshing for new tweets was slower. Really tweets was slower, even sending a

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.480
 tweet. So these aren't I'm not going to say all these are performance issues. I think they're a mix

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.200
 of some things are like literally a little bit slower and other things. They're not doing tricks

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.720
 that make it feel faster. Because I've noticed like when you send when you're like create a post on

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.320
 threads, there's actually a little spinner where it's like sending. Yeah, it's not send immediately.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.960
 It's yeah. Why did they do that? They could have just made it look like it did, right? Yeah. So on

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.480
 Twitter, when I post it, it looks like it worked right away, even though it maybe it takes like a

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.400
 long time is in the background, I have no idea. So there's a few small things like that where I'm

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:02.560
 like, actually, I think that Twitter one is faster, or like feel snappier. But I think it's hard to

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.560
 tell. Because I guess there's two dimensions, there's like the shitty UX of Twitter. And then

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.720
 is it the actual like what it actually performs like? I think the Twitter, I'm surprised. I thought

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.880
 threads would be like super snappy and like really know what it looks like. They have no legacy. It's

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.280
 like a it's a new to new app. So there's no like, I can't believe we have the opposite take care. I

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.520
 really felt like the app feels better. Maybe it's because on Twitter, I have the thing

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.680
 with Twitter blue or whatever where when you send a tweet, there's a window where you can undo.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.240
 I hate that. I hate it so much. All the things you can turn it off. I thought I did, but it still

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.440
 does it. Yeah, all the Twitter blue features are like negative features that like make everything

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.600
 worse. Yeah, they're worse. Yeah. So okay, so I have more thoughts. The UX, I thought felt really nice.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.520
 I like that like when you're on the feed, you can just tap the profile picture and add the person.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.880
 That's been really great. Oh, yes. The UX is fantastic across the board. Yes.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.080
 The the follow button on the feed is great. My other thought is like, at first, it's like,

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.080
 how is another Twitter clone? Are we ever really going to all switch? But then it's like when you

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.120
 think about meta and Instagram having a billion users and you think about Twitter never even getting

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.160
 there and how many bots are on Twitter, it's like is the audience just so much bigger potentially

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.640
 that it makes it makes sense to be there because there's more people to connect with. I don't know.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.440
 That's my thoughts. Yeah, I think it's definitely of obviously they have the best shot because,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.880
 you know, they just have this giant ability to get like, you know, millions of people to sign up

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.600
 very easily. Yeah, I don't know. Like I said, I think this one's the best chance of anything.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.160
 And it feels that way, especially I think they did a few early things right. I actually think this

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.240
 whole like invite approach that everyone just takes by default is actually a negative thing for

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.720
 stuff like this. Oh, for sure. Because I think it creates just fake hype. And it also like kills

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.080
 momentum at the same time. If you remember, like Clubhouse was kind of like that. And then like

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.960
 Blue Sky also did the same thing. So I feel like actually the whole like mindset around like

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.000
 create exclusivity within, but I feel like that's kind of like a dated thing. I don't think that

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.160
 really makes sense anymore. Do they do it for that reason? I don't want to interrupt you. But also,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.160
 do they do it for the hype? Or do they do it because they can't handle an immediate load?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.000
 Yeah, I think I think there's both. But for some things, there's definitely like people do

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.880
 definitely think about the hype. I think that's definitely an aspect. I mean, the, I think like

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.920
 Clubhouse one was not for like scales. I remember Clubhouse is very much like you feel bad that

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.440
 you're not in here and everyone's hanging out having a good time. Like the FOMO thing like like

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.480
 Abercrombie and Fitch or something. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, what? Hollister. I don't know. Those clothing

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.840
 companies that like make you feel bad when you go in the store. They do. You didn't do that in

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.400
 high school? I don't know. But I don't know. They make you feel bad when you feel bad about yourself.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.240
 Like look at all these amazing people and on the pictures. And it's like, I wish I were one of

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.960
 those amazing people. You didn't feel that way. Definitely. Interesting. I think we were talking

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.080
 about, plus they had like the people staying outside the store that were like, yeah, there were

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.520
 jerks. They were literally like trying to be jerks to you. They were training them. Yeah, exactly.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.760
 Okay. Yeah, exactly. It's like that. So, so I think they did that right. Because now it's just like,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.120
 yes, everyone's in there overnight. And it feels super special moment. Yep. I actually am wondering,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.800
 and the other thing is it feels, and this is a pro and a con. So it, it felt, and this is what,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:13.440
 like all the other apps failed at. Blue Sky, whatever, you would go in and a few of the people you know

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.960
 be there and feel kind of exclusive. But it would feel totally dead because there would be like no

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.560
 activity. Because you know, if you only know 20 people there, how much content can they possibly

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.720
 put posting? So the pro on threads is they very intentionally made sure the app felt alive.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.080
 That's why yesterday I felt like, oh, they get so alive that everyone's using it. Like, you know,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.880
 it feels like it's actually going to go somewhere. That's a pro because all other apps feel dead.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:43.040
 But the con is they did it by filling your fee with garbage. I think my, my feed is all just like

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.320
 really random stuff that I do not want to see. Hey, you're not the only person that said that.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.800
 I've seen a lot of people say like, the feed is just, it's not the people I'm following.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.920
 That's not the case for me. Maybe I just followed a lot more people. But all I see is stuff from

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.480
 people I'm following. It feels like tech Twitter pretty instantly. Oh, wow. Not like when I first

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.040
 opened the app, obviously, it was just like random. Yeah. But I pretty quickly, after I followed, I don't

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.240
 know, 20, 30 people, I feel like that's mostly what I'm seeing. I think for me, it feels like

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:16.560
 their algorithm has no idea what to show me. So they're giving me like the stuff that works

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:23.840
 well on average. And it's just like, it's like a ton of like random celebrity gossip slash like

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:31.200
 like Instagram influencer, like there's traps type stuff. Just like, just stuff that I like

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.560
 never consume it. It was actually kind of interesting for me to see because I'm like, oh, this is like

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.160
 what the average person does on social media, the type of stuff they talk about, etc. Yeah.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.800
 I'm like constantly refreshing because I'm like looking for like the one out of 10 posts that are

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.240
 from someone that I know. Really? It's so bizarre. I feel like we've had complete opposite experiences.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.960
 Yeah, it's interesting. Maybe I need to follow more people that might be it. Well, now I gotta

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.600
 know how many people you're following. And I just got to open the threads app because I've hit the

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:06.080
 threads app like 100 times in the last 12 hours. Why is it so like, are we all just starving for

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.560
 something else? It's just like the first day of school thing, you know, it just feels like, yeah,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.520
 it's just like it just feels good when we're all doing something together. I know you're not a big

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.520
 pop culture person, but I think I always go back to which I don't think will ever happen again was

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.280
 when Game of Thrones was airing. And literally every single person, every single week was doing

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:31.440
 the exact same thing. And we had this like shared topic with literally almost everyone that we

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.160
 can just talk about. It's like the weather. It's like the thing we're all talking about on Twitter

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.240
 right now. Yeah, exactly. Threads, which is funny. It's like this weird moment. Is it just going to

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.040
 fade though? Do you have any like, I don't know, is it even interesting to talk about this anymore?

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.240
 Like, will this one make it like, does it matter? Is it just like it may or may not? Who cares?

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:57.520
 Yeah, I have no idea. I think they really need to introduce, I think because of my experience,

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:05.280
 like, I'm like really craving a less wide algorithm, like, yeah, I actually think that Twitter,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.960
 I'm people have different experiences with this too. But with the way that I use Twitter,

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:14.560
 the Twitter for you tab, which is algorithmic feed works fantastic for me. I like mostly

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.840
 see stuff from people I know. And then I see interesting stuff from people adjacent. And I think,

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.960
 yeah, that's like the level of discovery I want right now. Like, I mean, if I just open it right now,

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:34.480
 yeah, like scrolling down, I like the first 20 or so posts before I see like someone that I

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:39.040
 recognize talking about something in my bubble. So I have no idea how many people you're following.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.520
 You don't even see that. I didn't realize it's not visible. I don't see anywhere where it says

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.760
 how many people someone follows. Just how many people follow. They're following 54.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.280
 How do you know that? So if I opened it up and go to the following tab,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.000
 it like says it in really small following tabs. There's a following hit followers,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.640
 and then you can switch it to following. Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm following 64.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.960
 Okay. So it's like, I don't know. I don't know what it is then similar. Interesting.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.800
 Oh, I forgot to say I hate threads because you have more followers than me. I can't live in a world

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.960
 where you have more social influence than me. It just hurts me to my core.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:21.200
 Yeah, I got to make sure I stay ahead. I got it. I got you on this one.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.080
 I just I just replied to one of your things. Like, why are people following you? Seriously,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.520
 why are people following? Because they love me, Adam. They love me more than they love you.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.440
 When we start at the same time, there's this is a perfect measure of

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:37.760
 more. If we were starting at the same time, you would blow me out of the water. Oh, man.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.520
 You actually have a consistent personality, even if it's being a jerk to people.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:50.160
 Ever since I've established that, it's only been good. Like, I feel like it's only been positive

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.680
 because now I can say whatever I want and no one like takes it personally. Yeah, I feel like you

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.280
 are living your best life. Like, you've got this freedom, but I don't feel like I have.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.560
 Definitely recommend it to everyone. Establish early that you're going to be mean,

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.360
 and I know when it's a promise. I can't even think of stuff though. I try to like,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.000
 think of mean replies just to channel my inner DAX. I can't. I just, it's not just give me your

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.200
 password for a week. Can we do that? I see people notice.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.160
 Can we please? Can I tweet on yours too? That's funny. Yeah, we can just switch and see.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.240
 That would be so fun. Well, now everyone that listens is going to know. Yeah, but that's okay.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.560
 That's okay. What was I going to say? I think maybe the other, because I don't know what the

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:34.080
 algorithm takes into account. Like, because for me, it's possible it might be looking at

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:42.640
 my Instagram network, seeing the people that my Instagram network follows, and then showing me

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:49.280
 that stuff, because I can't really explain this stuff otherwise. I don't have, it's a brand new

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.720
 Instagram account for me. That's what it is. I don't have anything for it to pull from there.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.880
 So it's just going off who I follow on threads. Yeah, I have like, interesting. I have like 50

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.640
 Instagram people that I follow, and they're all just like really old friends from high school.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.040
 So yeah, so I do actually have a private Instagram account where I've got like a little bit of

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.680
 like family friends connections. And I bet on that one, if I had started with that one,

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.160
 I would have a weird feed right now, because it's from like 15 years ago. And I was a very

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.520
 different person. Yeah, maybe I should have started fresh. I just don't like fragmenting stuff, but

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:27.040
 I will. Why do I feel so guilty, like mentioning threads on Twitter? I feel like there's just a

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.720
 group of people that are like, we're not leaving Twitter and they get so hostile, but like we can

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.160
 be on both. Can I be on both until I'm not on one? Are there people being hostile? Not hostile,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.040
 but just it's it's kind of like the trope of like, okay, just like you left for Mastodon. I didn't

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:47.120
 leave for Mastodon. I didn't leave for Mastodon. I did try blue sky a little bit. Nice. I left after

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.720
 like two days. Yep. And I'm gonna try threads for a little bit. Yeah. I mean, the last thing is,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.600
 obviously, they have way more momentum than everyone else, but they still have the fundamental problem

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.520
 of are the people typically creating the content? Are they able to make the shift over? So one,

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.880
 they might not want to, because they already have a big audience and wherever they are,

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:13.200
 you might not have it in that place. Two, even if you want to, living in both worlds is like

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:19.120
 such a pain, because your only options are post the same thing on both, which feels like really fake.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.560
 I don't like I don't really want to do that. Or come up with twice an amount of content.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.720
 Yeah. I'm honestly feeling a little overwhelmed this morning because just speaking specifically

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:37.280
 to the podcast, a little meta commentary here. Oh, meta. It like just thinking about posting

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.120
 like when we have a new episode, it's like, okay, we should probably we're posting the episodes

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.800
 to YouTube now. And then like, we should do some shorts off the YouTube video. And then we should

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.680
 do like, we got to tweet it. And now do we have to thread it? And then like, we should put on reels,

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:55.520
 I guess, and the TikTok. It literally, there's like eight places we probably should put stuff.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.400
 So people see it. It's just overwhelming though. You'd have to have a full time, like someone doing

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.000
 it full time to stay on top of all of it. Yeah, exactly. Or more than one person.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.440
 Yeah. And that's just, that's just like posting the same content across both and like,

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.720
 trying to like genuinely make different kinds of things. So it's like, Oh, I have a good thing.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.040
 I want to post, do I post it on Twitter? Because I want a lot of people to see it. Or do I like

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.840
 invest it into threads? Because I'm trying to like, do something there. It just sucks to be split in

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:26.720
 this way. So I feel like unless it feels like a lot of creators able to figure that out and move

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.000
 over and grow on threads, I don't really see it switching over. Because ultimately, all social

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.080
 networks are the same, like 99% of the content comes from a small percent of people. And that's

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.160
 the people you have to win over. And that's there's like, no, no one's really, it's like really hard

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.920
 to do that. Very difficult. So that's threads next topic. Let's talk about something else.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:54.000
 Yeah, anything else, please. I wonder, here's one thing. I just got out of this coffee with Roger.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.520
 It was a good time. And I realized halfway through that it devolved into a therapy session,

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.160
 where he was giving me therapy. Why do I do that with every single person? What is wrong with me?

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.960
 Well, like, what were you telling him about? That's the thing. I always like, no matter who I'm talking

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:14.000
 to, haven't spoken to in 17 years, or I talk to you every day, like you, I devolve into the same

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.280
 topics, which is like, life is hard. It's hard to have a family in 2023. What is there a reason I

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:27.600
 keep jumping to that? I don't know. I think it's like, I don't know if I easy to talk about because

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.960
 it's like the most relevant thing in your life. Okay, it's just easy. I'm just socially, I think

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.280
 I'm socially anxious. Talk about the weather. Do you feel like you're socially anxious? Talk

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.680
 about the weather. Do you feel like like when you talk with people that you don't talk with a lot,

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.600
 do you feel kind of like anxious inside? Like, yes, and you immediately jump to stuff you shouldn't

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.560
 probably talk about? That's not my reaction to it. But yes, I'm like, fundamentally,

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:55.040
 I'm an introvert, even though I've like, trained myself to like, same, get better at not being,

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.440
 like, not letting that limit me in a bunch of ways. Yep. But in my core, I'm always going to feel,

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.160
 and everyone feels uncomfortable. But I feel like I feel more uncomfortable than the average person.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.800
 Yes. So I definitely feel that. But I genuinely love, like, I love interacting with people.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:14.240
 Me too. I just, it drains me and I do feel like I just want to be in my office alone for a while.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:20.880
 It takes me a while before I really feel natural with someone, like, like, hang out with them a

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.520
 bunch of times before I like, can start to really be myself. Otherwise, I feel like I'm like thinking

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.920
 about everything too much. How you're coming off and what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah, just like,

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.680
 I mean, I feel like my brain just goes blank. I don't know what to say. And like, I'm not as

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.560
 quick as I normally am. And it just, yeah, it just feels a little different. Here's a funny story,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.840
 though. So I read this book. I mean, we've all read it, I think, how to win friends and influence

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.680
 people. Obviously, one of the classics, have you read it? I've got it in my audible. I've never

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.920
 listened to a classic. It's like, everyone's listened to it. The summary of it is it's basically just

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:02.000
 a bunch of stuff you probably already know. But what's interesting about the book is the author

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.640
 has very specific examples of people doing certain things and what crazy outcomes

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:12.320
 came out of doing very simple things. So they're talking about how to interact with people and

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.960
 how to make everyone feel good when they have an interaction with you. And it's really basic stuff,

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.640
 like really pay attention to what they're saying, like, ask some questions about things,

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.720
 like with different ways to relate to people. So I wrote this book. So it was very top of mind.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:30.640
 And I was like, okay, whenever I go out, I'm going to try to keep this in mind, like, practice it.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:37.840
 And the weekend that I was reading the book, Liz's sister, this is before me and Liz were dating,

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.880
 she came to town for Liz's birthday. So we did like a birthday dinner. So I hung out with

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.600
 Liz's sister for the first time. And we were spending a lot of time together throughout the night.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:53.200
 And I was just using, I was hitting every single bullet point in the book. And I was like, wow,

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.720
 like, okay, this is working. And then I can do all this. And it was a funny thing for me.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.360
 This is working.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.480
 Yeah. And then, you know, I went home and I didn't think much of it. And then next week,

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.200
 Liz messaged me and got it. She was like, wow, Dax, like Marion, her sister, and then Marion,

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.920
 she's like, Marion, like really liked you. She like really, she had like such great things to say,

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.720
 like she like, whatever way to tell me that, you know, she had a really great time hanging out with

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:21.280
 me. And I was like, okay, I have to have something to confess. So then I told her, like, I just used

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.480
 all these tricks on her. And Marion actually just found it really funny. Like it wasn't,

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:30.400
 which is like a fun situation. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, that stuff works. And it is health wise.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.920
 It's one of those things that they're all obvious, but are easy to forget. So sometimes I like refresh

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.080
 my memory on, on the things in it. Yeah. Have you used any of them on me? No, I don't think so.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.280
 To some degree, some of that has been embedded in my head. But if you like, if you literally

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.160
 read it, like the next week of your life, just gonna be like, especially good socially, it's like a

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.600
 mat, it's like a trick, because you just have all this fresh in your head. But then like, you

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.360
 know, you forget about it over time. Yeah, for a minute there, I started just like, imagine,

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.840
 imagining like our entire relationship is a lie. And you just like made me like you somehow by

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.080
 using a bunch of mind tricks. That was a fun little rabbit hole in my brain went down. Like,

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:11.680
 did that just sucker me into being his friend? Yeah. Well, it's not. Yeah, I guess they are tricks.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.800
 It's funny, though, in the the Liz and Marion situation, because they're very close. And Liz

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.120
 always says like, yeah, if Marion didn't have a good impression of you, like, I don't think

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.000
 he would have ever like me and Liz would have ever like gotten together like that.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.320
 Oh, wow. So that was very influential. Yeah, I know. Thank God for that book.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:34.720
 Huh. Got it. You're married now because of it. Oh, yeah. Wow. I'm gonna listen to one of my 10

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.640
 books. I'm already married, but when you're when you're 10 bucks. Oh, that reminds me Liz is

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:46.320
 Liz is coming on next week. And that's a good segue to say like, hey, if you listen to this

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:53.520
 podcast and you would like us to have somebody on, well, we would love your ideas. We're soliciting

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.280
 guest ideas. I don't know if we are. We probably already have a lot of ideas. I just thought we

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.680
 could ask the audience who they'd like to hear from. Yeah, I'm there. Also, if you're listening,

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.560
 you should give us a review. I hear that's important. Would you please review the podcast? No, I'd

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.680
 never really ask for that. And I feel like 30 some in, you know, we should probably ask. Yes,

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.200
 please do review it. Unless it's going to be a bad review. If it's going to be a bad review,

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.400
 yeah, we don't want your bad feedback. Yeah. Yeah, we already we already know all the bad

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.920
 things about it. So don't tell us. Yeah. And everyone else does too. So you don't need to

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.920
 inform them either. Right. We have some maybe that's why we don't have any reviews. So we have a few

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:31.520
 people scheduled. So Liz is I'm gonna I'm gonna do a thing with listening on Monday. I talked to

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:36.000
 the linear co founder and he's down to come on. I'm really excited about that one because I like

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.800
 incessantly talk about linear all the time. It's like the foundation of the way I think about all

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.960
 software right now. Yep. And I'm always like mentioning them on Twitter and I wonder if they

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:51.520
 funded annoying, but yeah, I'm excited to have him on and talk about one, the history of the company

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:57.680
 because it's going to be because like they built yet another project management tool. So I kind of

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:04.960
 want to know like, yeah, they picked the least unique idea ever. But they just focused on execute.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.440
 So I want to hear about that. And too, I want to hear about like the type of stuff they care about

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.960
 in terms of building a web app because my whole thing and we thought about the bunch where I feel

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:18.240
 the stuff that I was the tech community care about overall is kind of irrelevant. And hearing from

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.960
 someone that's executed on a really good product and like what they actually care about. Yeah,

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.040
 I think we just don't hear from that as much. Something said for that one. So I feel like linear

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.600
 is like the gold standard in the community. Everyone just knows it's like this amazing app that was

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:37.520
 executed so perfectly. But I feel like as a founder, is he kind of low key on purpose? I didn't know

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.680
 who the linear founder was the whole company is super low key. Like, you know, yeah, I don't know

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.200
 anybody that works at labor. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's a probably pretty small, I guess. Yeah, they

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:52.960
 are very small. They're definitely a unicorn valuation, I think. Yeah, I mean, well, explanation

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.720
 is they're just like way too successful to give a shit about anything else someday. I want to be

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.480
 so successful. I don't care about anything else. Yeah, that's that's my theory. But yeah, they're

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.760
 very low key, but I would love for them to be a little less low key because yeah, anything they

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.080
 say shouldn't have a lot of influence. They know how to build apps. I think I should get to interview

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.680
 Liz. I think that should be a thing. You're not going to be objective. I was asking Liz, like,

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.800
 would it be funny? I just would go by what's funny. It would be funnier if I did it or

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:27.440
 funnier if Adam did it. I'm just teasing. But did she say me? You're so needy. You have your own

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:36.400
 wife. Go be needy with her. I am very needy with my life. I don't know what we'll talk about it

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.600
 because I think yeah, maybe we can even do one of each. But she had a it's funny. I don't know if

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:48.480
 you saw. I don't know if you saw me says yesterday. She said, oh, yeah, listen to that podcast where

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.800
 you and Adam talked about being a founder and what it's like. It was good, but you guys didn't

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:59.760
 talk about anything important. I was like, well, okay, you want to come on. And you can you can

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:05.040
 talk about the stuff that really matters. That's amazing. Have you ever been in a stage in your

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.000
 career where you hate when everyone's on vacation, like all your teammates, like you're just so

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.920
 excited about work every day that when people start like ducking out for the summer, you're just

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.920
 like frustrated because you just want to be doing stuff with them. Have you ever had that? I definitely

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.680
 had that. Yes. And some early status. Yeah, for sure. Because like my work is a big part of my social

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.040
 life. So when it slows down, like around the holidays, yeah, I mean, yeah, holiday. Same thing.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:34.960
 Yeah, I used to hate hate the like the December or Christmas New Year holiday because

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:41.760
 everyone would just be gone. I don't have a big family. So it's not like I was doing like a bunch

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:48.080
 of family things for weeks. And I would just be like by myself for like two or three weeks.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.800
 And then we'll create isolating my work friends and my like normal friends like everyone would

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:59.600
 just be gone away. Yep. And that sucked. But now I get to hang out with Liz's family who's like

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.800
 very stimulating. So I don't mind anymore. But there's period of time where I was like,

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.440
 I hate it. I hate vacation time. Yeah, how do you I mean, this is just three people.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.360
 How do you guys do like time off? Like do you guys make each other take time off?

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.800
 Do you take off normal amounts of time less more? No, we're super toxic. So nobody takes

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.720
 off. Never take off. We have our Sunday meetings. Like we have like the worst people in the world.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.240
 Oh, we have Sunday meetings. We're very kind. We're kind of the most toxic for a culture possible.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.600
 Well, at least it's just the three of you. You're not like putting that on other people.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.960
 I love second people being a force people and three toxic workers. I mean,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.920
 okay. When people talk about this stuff, that's how I feel. They're like, you can like force people

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.880
 until like feeling bad. And so I think was what do we do? So I mean, everyone's gonna kind of

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:49.920
 different situations like Frank has two kids. So he's he works a lot and he's always juggling

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.520
 his kid stuff. So they don't like really take a lot of time off off because it's just like

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:58.400
 a lot with like, you know, take your kids from them. They're very small. So they're not really

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:04.400
 at that stage with taking vacations. Jay will do trips, but he it's kind of funny because like

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:09.760
 I'll have no idea he's somewhere else. And then I'll randomly have a meeting or we'll have like

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.960
 a call and he'll have a different background and I'll be like, Oh yeah, I've been in Mexico City for

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:20.640
 the past week and just like, it has no impact. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can't do I get nothing done if

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.680
 I'm not in my office. I can't like travel and work. Yeah. I always take a laptop and I'm like,

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.760
 I'm gonna get something done. No, I just can't. No, yeah. It's impossible. I only get worked on

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.720
 my desk and I've been that way for so long. I'm not going to change that. I don't care. I don't

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.160
 care what people say. I don't care about that. No mad thing. I don't get working in coffee shops.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.520
 It doesn't make any sense. Like, why do you want to work somewhere where you have more cramped

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.320
 and you have a worse setup? Not for me. Yeah, not for me. And I've seen this circulating a little

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:50.400
 bit on Twitter, like that everybody buys Macbooks and docks them most of the time. It is kind of dumb.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:56.160
 Like Mac Minis, Mac Studio, they're super powerful. Yeah, exactly. You don't have to deal with all the

00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.240
 people will say, Oh, but you can just take the laptop if you need to. But like, again, I get nothing

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.040
 done. I think people just like the optionality. They're like, well, what if I want to go whatever,

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.920
 even if 99% time don't take advantage of it. But yeah, you know, just commit to something,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.680
 commit to working at your desk. Yeah, commit to getting nothing done off your desk.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:20.560
 I don't think enough people like invest in their, their like home work setup or just like offices.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.800
 I feel like I've gone really over the top with my office. But like, I feel like there's a happy

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:30.240
 medium between people that like work on their bed with a laptop and like, I don't know, we all

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:35.760
 make pretty good money in tech. Not all. Okay. That was, that was not true. People in the US

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:42.800
 make a lot of money in tech. So I feel like since spending like 0.5% of that on a home office

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.360
 that you really like to be in, I love having a space. And so we've got the room next door is my

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.560
 wife's office. We're making it kind of we did mine and now we're doing hers. Just having a space in

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.480
 your house. It's kind of like your little sanctuary. It's nice. Yeah, no, it's really important. And

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:01.520
 you can like build it up over time. I've never felt bad about investing in that stuff because

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:07.600
 literally all my money physically comes out of the space. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It feels like a good

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:13.360
 investment. I hate using like ROI. It feels like there's a good ROI on investing in my office.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.600
 Now, like, yeah, people like have like shitty chairs, they sit on and it's like, it's,

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.440
 you spend so much time there. It's like, you can break it down by the number of hours. It's like,

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.720
 it's like pennies that you're spending on it. But yeah, and just build up over time. Like,

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:29.920
 my setup has been built up over over so many, so many years and it's super nice now. Everything

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.240
 just feels like a downgrade if I work anywhere else. Okay, you're going to love our guests coming

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:50.400
 up. Excellent guest. Really top notch. Okay, so we got milky coming on. But before milky comes on,

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:56.160
 I do wish I was anonymous. I wish I had gone the primogen route and like, or the milky route and

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.960
 just used a pseudonym. Do you wish that? Yeah, I do. It feels like it's too late, but is it not?

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.440
 Maybe it's not too late. Okay, it's too late. It's too late. I thought about this too. And I

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:12.240
 kind of wish I did that. I like initially started to, but when I first joined SST, but it felt really,

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:18.160
 and I just felt kind of awkward that I was like anonymous, but like, like talking about a company.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.000
 I think it makes it like in hindsight now, like actually wouldn't have been weird, but I think

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.240
 we were just kind of overthinking it. Yeah, it's a, I guess it is a little different for you with

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:32.400
 SST. Like, but I just, I see these people who are like completely anonymous, like don't even have

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.680
 pictures of them. Like, who's that AJ guy that made that card app? It's like this very mysterious

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.240
 figure that nobody knows who he is. The car. And he like has this whole, it's like a whole like

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:47.760
 indie hacker kind of, but it's pretty successful. I think like website builder. And he's like hired

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:52.000
 people. It's like grown enough that, but he's completely anonymous. Nobody knows who he is.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.640
 That's kind of nice. And Twitter, he's just AJ. And it's like some like cartoon avatar thing.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:02.000
 I'm jealous. Yeah. And then do you ever think about like just making a second

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.600
 social presence that's completely anonymous? And no one would know it was you. You know what I mean?

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.600
 Like you could completely, well, they'd know from you because they'd be all these like derogatory

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.800
 underscore tweets. They'd be like, that's Dax for sure. Nobody else is such a joke. Sorry,

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.880
 I keep hammering home that that's like your online persona. But you kind of like keep, keep,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.200
 keep doing it. I want to really establish it. It just feeds you. It just feeds on anyone else.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.040
 Like you're just getting in on it. You know, I want to like, I want it to be very clearly my zone.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.760
 I can't think of anybody else that's as like abrasive as you on Twitter.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.560
 Can you? I can't think of anybody. I think you got it to yourself.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.760
 Awesome. I love it.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:39.280
 So when we trade, when we do the trade thing, where you take over my Twitter and I take over

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.480
 years, just don't get, just don't say anything that's going to get me in real big trouble.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.480
 Okay. I feel like we need to lay some ground rules here.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.680
 You could like do some things that would be damaging to me.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.280
 I'm not participating in those ground rules.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.280
 It's got to be completely open for any.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.640
 I'm going to get you on a percent canceled.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.280
 Oh, you will.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.160
 It's going to be so easy.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.320
 Well, yeah. Anybody could get anybody canceled if they had control of their social accounts.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.520
 Like it would not take very long. Like two tweets max.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.960
 No, but it's got to be believable.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.360
 Yeah, that's the second tweet is this is not a joke. Like say whatever.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.160
 And then is milky still coming?

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.200
 I think milky's coming.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.400
 The anonymous milky.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.520
 He's updating Chrome.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:21.680
 Oh, yeah. Rivers that you have to use Chrome.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.800
 That's a that's a funny.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.400
 That's like how you have to you have to deploy what ACM certs and USC Swan or whatever.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.800
 It's like weird arbitrary restrictions, the whole thing or cloud front.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.040
 What is it? Cloud front SSL certs? I don't know.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.640
 Yeah, everything that's a global service is control point isn't USC one.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.000
 So you have to deploy it.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.400
 Yeah.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:46.320
 And USC Swan man, the cross region stuff is really really causing some nightmares for me.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.160
 Oh, do do tell while we wait on the mysterious milky.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.960
 It's just it's a tweet that I posted other day.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.160
 Regions is a great idea because it gives you control over isolation.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:00.720
 Like you have very strong control over what runs in what region and it's good.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.440
 That's like how you get reliability. If you have seven to regions,

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.600
 you know that there's very little dependency between the two.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:12.400
 But I hate that all the IAC tooling to like spin stuff up in the correct way,

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:18.400
 like CloudFormation CDK, whatever those also follow region restrictions.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.480
 Like CloudFormation can only spin up stuff in its own region.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.720
 And I'm like, and that doesn't make sense to me because like that

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.240
 should represent your app and all of your infrastructure,

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.880
 which might go across one or many other regions.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.560
 Yeah, which is how Terraform works.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.120
 Like whenever I bring up this topic, people are always like, that's impossible.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:33.600
 Like that one.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.280
 But this is just how Terraform works.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.240
 Terraform lets you corn itself across many regions.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.160
 Millions of companies.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.760
 I don't have what their number is like at massive scale is being used.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.560
 And it's completely fine.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:50.240
 And like in the AWS version, you have always weird hacks where if you're deploying something

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.160
 in US, he's two and you need an ACM certificate.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.120
 They like spin up a temporary lambda to then like spin it up in the other

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.920
 region and they like pretend like it's in the same region.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.280
 It's just like such a mess.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.160
 Yep.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:06.640
 And yeah, it is not great.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.480
 And with that fascinating topic.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.040
 With that.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:15.680
 We went from the dumbest, driest topic ever to milky's here.

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.440
 Take a break from posting on threads.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.200
 Yeah, dude, I went off last night.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.160
 I was like, I was posting every 30 seconds.

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.760
 I didn't have no filter.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.560
 I had no filter.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.840
 Like, you know, nobody's here yet.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.120
 Like might have told you the great because I was talking at him earlier.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.960
 Like my feet were just complete trade garbage.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.760
 What's your feed like?

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.200
 Is it garbage or is it good?

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.880
 No, it's garbage.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.560
 It's like I get frustrated.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.760
 Like I see trash a lot.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.560
 I'm like, broad.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.400
 I just got enough on Twitter.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.400
 Like I talked to this not enough.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.800
 I don't want to see him on the new platform, you know.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.440
 So I'm just like, I'm trying to avoid him.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.640
 And it's just like a bunch of stuff.

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.440
 Yeah, that's like real shit.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.640
 So I'm just like, yeah.

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.800
 Did you have an existing Instagram account, milky?

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.520
 Like was it?

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.880
 Were you on Instagram before this?

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:59.840
 I have a personal account, but I do not tie any personal stuff to milky.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.360
 I would you guys were talking about earlier?

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:05.040
 Like the separation between, yeah, I have a personal account.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.040
 And I was like, there is not a chance in hell.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.960
 I'm gonna let any of these people know anything about my life.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.520
 So your name is not milky.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.720
 I just learned this today.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.480
 Yeah, my so my name is Alan.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.440
 Oh, you don't have to tell us.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.480
 Hey, whoa.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.160
 Are you okay with that being out there?

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:20.400
 Yeah.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.760
 Because I mean, we have a lot of this.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.640
 Like a lot.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:27.280
 That's why Alex mocks.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.200
 I can't believe your name is not milky.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.240
 It's blowing my mind.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.280
 I think my name is dope.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:31.920
 Oh, I love it.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.480
 It's cool.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:32.720
 Yeah.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.280
 Short names.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.320
 Huh.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.200
 You're okay.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.320
 You're the second person that's come on with that exact background.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.760
 Did you steal that from teach?

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.960
 Do I steal it from teach?

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.720
 No, I just stole it from me, man.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.120
 I was.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:47.040
 There's no teach for context.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.360
 Teach used a picture of milky's background.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.360
 Like he's on a green screen.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.840
 So he came on the podcast with the milky background.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.840
 Yeah, he did the same thing when he was on a,

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.480
 I think it was like another podcast.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.160
 And he just keeps using my background.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:00.800
 And I'm like.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.200
 And he doesn't even tell me.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.400
 I literally had to see it.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.360
 Like, I just see the like the podcast release.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.960
 I just see teach using my background.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.080
 Dude, he's about to steal your identity.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.360
 Maybe you shouldn't give him it.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.160
 He just needed your name.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.120
 That was the last step.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.320
 He's got everything else.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.560
 Yeah, he got he got the aesthetics and everything.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.280
 So yeah.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.160
 Ooh, the pour over.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.200
 Look at that Kim X.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.240
 I even know these things.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.640
 The thing with the copy link is funny.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.440
 Because now I can go look at people's Instagrams.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.120
 And it's just funny as hell because I feel like the,

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.360
 I think in Instagram, you like curate a vibe.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.360
 So you're always posting like the best pictures.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.920
 So you have like, I think people have like a cooler vibe

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.360
 than what they actually are.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.800
 But I know these idiots from Twitter.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.320
 So when I look at some Instagram,

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.160
 like this juxtaposition is so funny.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.920
 Because like all their friends,

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.960
 they're like super cool.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.520
 But I know what they really like is,

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.880
 they're real stuff from down on Twitter.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.080
 Dude, it's so funny.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.480
 I see so many people who didn't want to go the route

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.720
 of like restarting a new Instagram account.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.200
 And so their names are like the ultimate high school.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:06.960
 But like on Twitter, he's like that tech dude one seven seven.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.800
 And I'm just like, bro, it's like,

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.120
 there's too much of a cross pollination occurring.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.120
 I'd say people's identities from 10 years ago

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.240
 are showing up again.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.920
 So the thing they were into back then.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.280
 Dude, like even Theo,

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.160
 like his Instagram is like fully skateboard.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.000
 So it's like fake in Bigfoot.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.640
 And then on Twitter, it's all like Theo.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.200
 So I'm just like, okay, this is going to be interesting.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.000
 You're just knowing him.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.280
 I know that the lack of it matching up is is frustrating.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.160
 Oh, I'm driving out of here.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.440
 So I'm like wondering, yeah.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.440
 Yeah, I'm wondering what his plan is there.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.240
 Let's move on to your address and like where do you work.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.920
 And yeah, social and should I repeat,

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.360
 my social insurance number two?

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.320
 Social insurance.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.080
 Is that some Canadian shit?

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.960
 My bad, it is. I thought you were in America.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.560
 We just had July 4th.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.280
 Man, come on.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.560
 Wait, are you actually from Canada?

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.480
 Yeah, I'm from, I'm a two-time immigrant, bro.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.560
 Oh, you've moved to the US?

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.360
 You live in the US now?

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.760
 Yeah, immigrate to Canada and then I immigrate to

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.320
 the United States of America, baby.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.160
 Baby, where did you migrate from?

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.560
 You went to Canada from where?

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.360
 Russia.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.000
 Russia?

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.080
 Like you born in Russia.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.040
 Hell yeah.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.400
 Wow, how long did you live there?

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.400
 For like four or five years.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.080
 Do you remember anything about Russia?

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.280
 Is it like cold, a lot of vodka at four, four years, five years?

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.800
 Yeah, all of that.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.200
 I'm, my parents are still very, very,

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.600
 like I grew up in a very Russian household extremely.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.400
 Like my parents are like, don't like, you know,

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.280
 they didn't really adapt too much to the Canadian-

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.240
 Westernized society.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.240
 Yeah, I suppose, but we've been here for a long time.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.120
 But yeah, so I, do I remember Russia itself?

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.160
 Sometimes I've been a minute since I visited,

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.320
 like first year university, so I haven't been there much,

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.200
 but like culturally, like I grew up very, very Russian.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.440
 And then how old were you when you moved from Canada to the US?

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.640
 This is last year, dude.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.040
 I should.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.880
 Really?

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.360
 Wow.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.960
 Wait, do you live?

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.640
 I don't want, you don't have to like tell us exactly,

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.640
 but you live in California, like Twitch stuff?

00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.760
 No, I live in Seattle.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.320
 I moved, so yeah, I grew up in Toronto,

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.320
 then I went to Vancouver,

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.760
 and then from Vancouver, I went to Seattle,

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.280
 because it was like a three-hour drive.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:07.760
 Oh, that's close, yeah.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.880
 It's gonna be pretty seamless.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.200
 Exactly.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.840
 Oh, you grew up in Toronto, like the other two.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.560
 Yeah.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.000
 Toronto's best to see they're in Toronto right now.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.480
 Oh, awesome.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.440
 Yeah, Toronto's beautiful.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.560
 I love Toronto.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.440
 The food there is absolutely beautiful,

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.040
 and like the people are great.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.280
 It's cold as hell, but it's awesome.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.160
 Is it even that cold?

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.080
 Because whenever I would, because when I was in New York,

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.280
 whenever I would check the weather,

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.600
 it was like two degrees different from New York.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.720
 No, it gets cold, man.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.840
 Like Toronto definitely gets really cold.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.120
 Like the winners are, I mean last, like last two years,

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.920
 having that cold, global warming may be like,

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.560
 like hell yeah, Toronto's gonna be a paradise

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.200
 in a couple of years.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.640
 Yeah, do we're gonna get those beaches up?

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.200
 But yeah, no, I remember like I went to school

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.720
 a little bit north, like university,

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.840
 like a little bit north of Toronto,

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.880
 and like we get like,

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.400
 I don't know what it is in American units,

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.160
 but negative 40 degrees Celsius, which is very cold.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.160
 I think it's still negative 40 degrees Fahrenheit, actually.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.440
 I think it sounds like a lot.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.640
 Can somebody calculate that?

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.160
 Yeah, I think it's actually the same.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.120
 It's the same in Fahrenheit, yeah.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:03.520
 Oh, really?

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.080
 The same in Fahrenheit.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.520
 Whoa, how's that work?

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.320
 I don't want to think about it.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.680
 It's too complicated.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.640
 That's so crazy.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.720
 It doesn't math like that in like 15 years.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.320
 Yeah, we're programmers, we don't do math.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.080
 We don't need that.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.600
 Have we mentioned that Melky works at Twitch?

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.920
 I feel like we should mention that Melky works at Twitch.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.800
 Yeah, he's got a wrench.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.800
 He goes, he's got the wrench in chat.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:24.160
 This is before like I met any of you two,

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.600
 like that, Adam, but like,

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.600
 so I started shooting way before I worked at Twitch,

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.160
 and I was just like some random dude

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.200
 just shooting that prime like,

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.320
 that was essentially like the story,

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.520
 like I'm just like me,

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.680
 and he kept rating me, and like that was it.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.600
 And then somehow I got a job at Twitch.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.880
 So it was such a cool thing

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.560
 that I just became this random like,

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:46.480
 bro, making like shitty apps to actually getting the wrench.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.080
 And everyone's like, how like,

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.680
 I remember the memes that came out of it.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.680
 It's like, yo, if Melky can get a job at Twitch,

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.800
 like damn, like.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.520
 Were you always a software engineer?

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.200
 Nah, I almost felt,

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.760
 so I went through school for mechanical engineering,

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.080
 and like, I hated it, it paid like marbles

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.600
 and like crumbs from a cracker,

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.480
 and I was like, nah, this is not, this can't be it, dude.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.320
 I remember one discussion I had,

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.720
 and it was like, I was talking to this dude,

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.280
 I was doing a co-op in a mechanical engineering company,

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.280
 and he's like, oh, like, you know,

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.800
 if you work really hard in 10 years,

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.880
 you'll be making like, you know, 100k.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.040
 And I'm there like 19 years old,

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:28.320
 and I'm like, in 10 years, only be making 100k.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.000
 I'm like, there's, there's no way.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.840
 Like, I can't, I can't do that.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.680
 And I was saying like, that's, you know,

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.560
 that's a great amount of money,

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.560
 but I just wanted to be a little bit more aggressive

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.080
 to hit that goal, I think.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.920
 And last year or last semester,

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.480
 I just stopped, like, I just graduated,

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.080
 and then I didn't do anything,

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.440
 and I just programmed.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.120
 I just learned, I went straight into machine learning

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.880
 because I didn't have enough time

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.240
 to get into like a proper back end or front end job

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.640
 because I had to pay off my student loans,

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.600
 I had to pay rent, like, I had to move quick.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.080
 So I was like, what's the hottest field right now?

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.280
 That was machine learning.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.560
 So before I could even write,

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.640
 like, a class, like, object-oriented programming,

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.840
 I knew how to create a new network.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.720
 And I just went deep into, like, that's all I did.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.680
 I just went deep into that, and that was it.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.200
 That's how I got where I am today.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.240
 - You went straight to Twitch?

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.240
 - I went straight to a startup

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.640
 that hired me as the lead ML engineer,

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.960
 and I was like, this is such a bad idea.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.480
 Like, like, I was like, guys, like, this is like,

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.280
 are you sure?

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.120
 Like, I was so open in the interview,

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.720
 I was like, I just graduated,

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.360
 no work experience, like, I'm like,

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.520
 I'm gonna be kind of making it up as I go.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.880
 And I know we like that, you know,

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.240
 you bring this element to the game.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.080
 And I was like, okay, okay.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.200
 But yeah, that startup got acquired.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.400
 So then I moved to Twitch.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.480
 - They didn't get acquired by Twitch, did they?

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.000
 - No, no, they got acquired by,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.240
 like, a company older than the printing press.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:48.880
 - Is it IBM?

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.200
 - Whoa, I swear to God, I swear to God.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.200
 That's not even, I'm not even memeing, bro.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.960
 Like, they were known for some shit

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.080
 they did with the printing press.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.400
 (laughing)

00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.920
 - That's so random.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.320
 I know, the company's older than Canada.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.720
 And that was like a sign I'm getting at it.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.120
 (laughing)

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.320
 - Oh, so did you do the whole like,

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.920
 like, fang interview thing?

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.440
 Like, do you do a, do you interview at Twitch?

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.320
 Or do you interview at Amazon?

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:14.960
 How's that work?

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:20.640
 - So I got hard at Twitch at the end of 2021.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.800
 And at that time, it was still very like Twitch-esque.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.400
 So I went to like a Twitch loop,

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.760
 but it was like, it's pretty much like,

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.720
 like a, it's like a derivative of the Amazon loop.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.040
 You know, they may not be as strict on certain things

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.440
 and they may allow like, you know,

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.520
 maybe not as strict on like tech stuff.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.200
 And like if your personality shines more,

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.160
 they'll hire you.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.960
 Nowadays though, it's way more influence on the Amazon loop.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.360
 Like it's, it's pretty much a one-to-one

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.200
 to what an Amazon interview would look like.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.320
 - The leadership principles and-

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.160
 - Yes.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.000
 - Yes, exactly.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.720
 Exactly. We play co-op, all that stuff.

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.720
 - What is your, what does your day-to-day look like at Twitch?

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.480
 Like, what are you, you're an ML guy, right?

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.560
 Your data or something?

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.480
 - No, so I'm, so I am an, so my title at Twitch

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.560
 is ML infrastructure engineer.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.240
 And I'm a tech lead for my team,

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.680
 which is called the personalization team.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.160
 And what we try to do is use,

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.360
 we try to create services on Twitch using ML

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.280
 that personalize a personal experience.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.080
 So obviously it's like recommendations,

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.000
 like things that you see, and also a branch of that,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.640
 that just kind of dropped in our lap was like fraud.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.040
 So we, everything to do with fraud, we battle it.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.560
 So it's kind of like, we try to personalize experience

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.240
 and we do a lot of fraud prevention stuff.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:33.120
 And so me particularly, like my bread and butter

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.760
 is like creating new services and putting them out there.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.240
 Like I'm not really like, once the service gets made,

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.280
 I kind of roll off and I let someone else maintain it.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.680
 And like, I kind of like facilitate

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.160
 the maintenance of it, I suppose.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.640
 But my specialty is like, okay, we have this idea.

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:50.160
 So I created the, like the TDD, the design document,

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.160
 and then I implement it.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.000
 So I get like a team.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:52.840
 - Oh man.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:55.920
 - I get people to execute kind of my architecture

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.760
 and then I kind of just launch on production.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.440
 And I do that like, so every quarter,

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.760
 it's like one big project.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.720
 And we keep kind of going in and doing it.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.320
 - That is my dream job.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.600
 I want to just start stuff and not have to finish you.

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.840
 Like that's my dream in life.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.440
 I mean, kind of, but I don't get paid to do that.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.040
 - You do whatever you want.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.640
 - But like I don't get, like I would love to just be able

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.280
 to be like starting new things that live on,

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.040
 not like new things that just die

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.000
 and then I wasted my time.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.880
 - The coolest service I own and I use that term very loosely

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:30.240
 'cause like now it's under my control and it is my service

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.080
 but it's called, it's the,

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.720
 you know what someone gives you guys a gift?

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.240
 And it's like, let's say someone gives you like 20 gifts.

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.520
 - Hang on, Dax, has anyone ever given you a gift?

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.680
 Do you know what that is on Twitch?

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.880
 - I hope not.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.360
 - Are you aware that I'm my leaderboard, Adam?

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.000
 You give me 37 gifts right there.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 - I forgot.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:48.840
 Sorry.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.680
 - Okay, sorry.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.520
 Continue.

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.760
 - I was so mad when I saw all you guys

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.760
 give Dax subs.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.840
 I was trying to stop that.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.200
 I was like, you'll stop.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.040
 - Stop giving me stuff.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.520
 - You're telling me if he was going harder

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.840
 every time he said that.

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.120
 - Dude, I don't learn my lesson.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.040
 I do the same with trash.

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.240
 I'm like, guys, stop giving trash subs

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.080
 and people keep doing it.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:04.920
 I just leave.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.920
 I'm like, this is always back.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:06.920
 - It's upsetting.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.760
 - Yeah.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.600
 - It's upsetting.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.440
 Especially when it's trash, it's upsetting.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.360
 - It's so upsetting.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.040
 But yeah, so whenever there's like a large amount of gifts

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.760
 or like anything over 10 or 20, whatever,

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.800
 it's always like who gets those gifts, right?

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.480
 And like, it's pretty easy to think like,

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.440
 oh, just be people in chat or, you know, whatever.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.480
 But really like the purpose of the gifting system

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.560
 is to actually get a gift.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.720
 And then we want that person to convert

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.840
 to being a sub themself, right?

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.200
 So it's not all about hitting it

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.360
 to the person's talk the most in your chat that day

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.720
 or the person who's come up and said something funny.

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.480
 It's like, we try to actually use ML

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.640
 to determine who are the best candidates

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.120
 to convert themselves.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.480
 - Yeah, most of them don't, just in my experience.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.800
 (laughing)

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.600
 - It's doing a terrible job, Melky.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.240
 (laughing)

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.240
 - Keep working on it 'cause it's got them.

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.720
 (laughing)

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.560
 - Do you guys like build all your own stuff

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.800
 or do you like leverage all the Amazon's verses

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.200
 and things like that for ML?

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.880
 - No, we don't do any Amazon.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:05.200
 Like the only stuff we use Amazon is like,

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.240
 obviously there's a suite called Amazon Builder Tools,

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.960
 which is like their internal tooling

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.400
 for like their pipeline systems

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.760
 and like their internal like compiler and all that stuff.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.120
 But in terms of like their ML stuff,

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.320
 now we don't do anything like that.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:21.360
 We just kind of, you know, build our own stuff in house

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.160
 and like use existing systems and stuff like that.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:23.920
 - Do they like, why don't you guys

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.560
 integrate deeper or do they not care?

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:26.400
 - Yeah, they do, they do.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.640
 They want Amazon influence, especially do you remember

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.120
 that big, do you guys there?

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.000
 When we got that big leak, the Twitch leak

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.360
 like all of our source code.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.440
 - What, no, the source code?

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.280
 - We didn't hear about that.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.120
 - Did I hear about this?

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:39.960
 I don't think so.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:40.800
 Source code?

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.640
 - Okay, so this, yeah.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.880
 So all of Twitch source code leaked

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:46.220
 at the end of 2021, all of it.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.400
 Like there was a massive, massive leak.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.320
 Yeah, yeah, it was bad.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.560
 It was, it was really bad.

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.800
 So every code, every commit was, I don't get hub

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.080
 and like it was a whole scramble to like get it out of it.

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.200
 You can imagine, right?

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.640
 But ever since then, there's been a more,

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.640
 you know, a change in thought by leadership

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.720
 that we want to get more Amazon tech

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.120
 to avoid any tech down in the future.

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:08.960
 - Interesting.

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.760
 - Why does that avoid it in the future?

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.280
 'Cause Amazon stuff is more locked down.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.280
 - Yeah, more locked down.

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.320
 There's a little bit more provision.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.080
 There's a little bit more steps to, you know,

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.480
 get things in production.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.280
 - There's definitely a lot of more steps.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.960
 Like, do you use like code commit?

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.360
 Like the actual like get replacement or get hub replacement?

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.200
 - Yeah.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:27.040
 - Oh man.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.120
 - So if it leaked on there, no one would know

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.360
 'cause nobody goes to code commit.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.640
 - This is the, this is the reason I,

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.960
 oh, look at that.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:34.800
 - Oh, this is.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.640
 - How old is it?

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:36.960
 - How old is he now?

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.780
 - 11 weeks.

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.880
 - This is the new junior my team.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.240
 - You know, what's the dog's name?

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.360
 Dax, you know this dog?

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.200
 - Yeah.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.040
 - That's his Dax.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.040
 - You just act like you have a relationship.

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.600
 Like how, oh, how old is the dog now?

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.000
 - I know his title is Prince of Darkness,

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.400
 but I forgot the first part of it.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.800
 - Yeah, it's honeydew Prince of Darkness mocks.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.440
 - Honeydew Prince of Darkness.

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.960
 - You're really good at naming things.

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:55.840
 Melky.

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:56.680
 - Thank you.

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:58.240
 - Honeydew Prince of Darkness.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.200
 - Yeah, I wanted to go,

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:03.080
 Honeydew Prince of Darkness Mohammed mocks, but wow.

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:05.740
 That wasn't, I got lucky with the Prince of Darkness.

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:06.640
 I didn't want to push my rock.

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.680
 (laughing)

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.680
 - They approved it.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.840
 They approve the Prince of Darkness.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:11.680
 - Yeah.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.600
 - As long as insurance too, it's literally like,

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.040
 his legal name is Prince of Darkness.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:16.880
 All his legal dog is out there.

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:17.720
 - Wow.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.560
 - That's funny.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.400
 - That's amazing.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.280
 - Yeah, my dog has like a legal passport.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.600
 It's funny, though.

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.200
 - Dogs can get passports?

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.680
 - There's like a canine passport.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.880
 Yeah.

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.200
 - They have to have it to travel?

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.240
 - I think I've told you about this before,

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.200
 but I'm gonna say it again.

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.960
 So he was born in Serbia.

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:32.800
 - I knew that.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.780
 - And they brought him over here when it was a puppy,

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:39.240
 but European airlines don't fly doablements.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.840
 So it's like, it's like a policy.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:41.680
 - Oh yeah, tell me this.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.520
 - Oh yeah.

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.360
 - The racist.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.760
 - The racist European airlines.

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.360
 - I didn't know your dog is from Serbia.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.600
 - Where is?

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:49.840
 - He's like kind of Russian.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:50.920
 - Is that close to Russia?

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:51.760
 - Yeah.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:52.600
 - Yeah, nearby.

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.760
 - I know that 'cause of golden nine, double seven.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.560
 Like, isn't that like something's in Serbia?

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.560
 No, it's Siberia.

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:58.400
 Sorry, continue.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.840
 (laughing)

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.360
 - All right, it's only the other side.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:06.040
 So they, he has a passport, but it's like a fake passport

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.360
 'cause it has a different breed name

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.080
 and it has a Manchester Terrier,

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.320
 which is, when there are puppies, governments, I'm sorry.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.760
 - She should be leaking this information.

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.600
 - Imagine.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.000
 - The cops are coming to my house and take Zuko.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:17.840
 - Yeah.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.760
 - It's like, hey, we've heard,

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.120
 can you check his passport for a second?

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.320
 'Cause I'm pretty sure this is fucking golden right here.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.480
 (laughing)

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.320
 - Yeah.

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.560
 So it says Manchester Terrier and as puppies,

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.400
 they look the same,

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.560
 but Manchester Terriers are like 30 pound dogs as adults.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.920
 But as puppies, they look like this.

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.200
 I'm sorry, he's got like a fake.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.760
 He's got a Serbian passport with like,

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.120
 a doctored breed information on there.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.320
 - Wow.

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.680
 It's like one of those pictures that's like six, four

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.680
 and like little league.

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.000
 (laughing)

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.120
 - Let's see that Berkshire Terrier.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:46.960
 - Yeah.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.280
 (laughing)

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.120
 - I'm 13-year-old.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:49.960
 - Exactly.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.800
 - Yeah.

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.640
 - They breed like a little poodle.

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:54.160
 Then Zuko shows up with giant Dilberman.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.000
 - Yeah, what's up?

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:55.840
 (laughing)

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:56.680
 Is there a problem?

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.800
 - It's like, you know, we were talking about that

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.240
 'cause me and Liz are like,

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.000
 always toying with the idea of getting a second dog.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.200
 And we can't get another Dilberman

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:09.200
 because it would just be ridiculous,

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.680
 like two giant dogs in her house

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.040
 and like on her bed and all that.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:12.880
 - Yeah.

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.720
 - But we want to get a Dilberman.

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:14.560
 It looks like a Dilberman.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.400
 So we're thinking about,

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.600
 we're talking about getting a Dachshund

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.840
 potentially 'cause they got the same girls.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.680
 (laughing)

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.520
 - That's a bad.

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.320
 - Yeah, Dachshunds are the best.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.160
 - I think it's so funny.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.000
 - I think it's a dynamic.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:24.840
 It seems like a cartoon.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.840
 Like it's started like a Disney movie or something.

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:30.320
 Like a big Dilberman and a little like Dachshund.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.680
 But I highly recommend.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:32.560
 There's stubborn men.

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.760
 - Tell me more about Dachshunds.

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:34.600
 What's her personality like?

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.520
 I don't know anything.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.000
 - Yeah, I'm a huge Dachshund fan.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 My favorite animal is the long-haired Dachshund.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:40.920
 Like this guy.

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.960
 Yeah, so I think Dachshunds,

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.400
 I told you like my family dog,

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.920
 the one I grew up with was,

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.200
 he was an 18-year-old long-haired Dachshund

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.400
 who passed away in October,

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.360
 but 18 years old,

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:52.760
 like this guy was like the man,

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.320
 you know, the alpha, the alpha.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.120
 (laughing)

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:57.120
 But their personality,

00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:59.480
 like they're super stubborn.

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.480
 - They eat a lot.

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.840
 They can be dicks, man.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.680
 I don't want that.

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.520
 (laughing)

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.280
 They can be dicks for sure.

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.960
 I mean, little dogs in general,

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.480
 little dogs are kind of more high-strong.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.320
 - Yeah.

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.480
 - Yeah, they are.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.320
 But dude, I don't know.

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.640
 They're an incredible companion

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.000
 and like they'll always have your back.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.160
 Like this morning,

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.760
 me and Honeydoo fought the back and cleaner

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.400
 and he was waiting with me the whole time.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:24.600
 He wasn't like me and him.

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.000
 It was like me and him are doing this

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 and we beat the beat of the vacuum I was for.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.160
 - Dude, those little dogs.

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.000
 Yeah, whenever there's a big dog and a little dog

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:32.840
 in the same house,

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.080
 the little dogs always want us in charge.

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.080
 But if we get a small one,

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.480
 we know that's what it goes gonna be.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.320
 - Oh yeah.

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.360
 - Number two, not number one.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.360
 - Dude, you make Zuko look so hard

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.080
 with the vest, the chain, the kijutake of him.

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.600
 I think of this guy's like a mafia like boss,

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.160
 just like smoking cigars and shit.

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.840
 - That's the whole purpose we have him.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.240
 We need to make sure that people just think

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:55.000
 he's scary as fucking no one like messes with their house.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.280
 So it's all fake.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.120
 It's all fake.

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:57.960
 It's a persona.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:58.800
 He's not--

00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.640
 - The grass is fake.

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.960
 - The dogs are fake.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.780
 (laughing)

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:03.120
 - Yeah.

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.160
 - Yeah, he's, he's starting to get a little bit more,

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.600
 turning a little bit more into a guard dog,

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.520
 like kind of like watching around

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.440
 and like barking at people outside and things like that.

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:15.720
 But he's like so gentle and like,

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:17.440
 I don't even, if someone attacked me to be honest,

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:18.880
 I don't know if he would really do anything.

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.960
 I think he would like be overwhelmed emotionally.

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.520
 I don't know if he's gonna kick him and do anything.

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.200
 But on pictures, like yeah, we gotta scare people away.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.320
 - Do you think you could take him on like a 1v1?

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:30.560
 - I can take like wrestle him.

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.000
 - Just like, yeah, 1v1, you guys like locked into like,

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:33.900
 a U of C ring.

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.360
 - I mean, we wrestle a lot.

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:38.920
 We wrestle a lot and when he starts to get really amped up,

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.200
 yeah, it's like, it's like too much.

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.720
 He's got so many sharp points.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.040
 He's got his like teeth and he's like,

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:45.040
 claws are super sharp.

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.560
 He's got like a little doo claw thing on that side.

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.840
 That's when it like comes in out of nowhere.

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.360
 And then, I got like scratches all over my body

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:54.080
 from wrestling him, so definitely could not take him.

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.520
 - Yeah, I have, again, honey doo is, you know,

00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:02.800
 comparable to Zooto, it's similar size, yeah, look at this stuff.

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:03.560
 But yeah, he bites and I have like,

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.240
 bite marks all over my arm, just scratched up everywhere.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.320
 It's crazy, so.

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.160
 - The puppy teeth are so sharp.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.960
 - They are, they are, this guy just loves biting.

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.120
 He only has two moods.

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.240
 It's a cuddle, which is this one, or biting.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.000
 There's nothing in between.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.680
 - Yeah, so go have that face too.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:24.000
 But yeah, he's like, he's like kind of becoming an adult now.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.240
 He's like pretty chill and just hanging out

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.080
 most of the time.

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:27.920
 - He should get a kid.

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:28.840
 I mean, you should have a kid.

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.920
 - We have kids.

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.840
 - He's got a kid right there on his lap,

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.360
 and mine is looking at the rocks.

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.600
 - I'm saying like, I used to have a dog

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.920
 and we have all the pictures, like we dressed them up.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.920
 The whole thing, you're very into your dog.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.360
 But then you have a kid,

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:43.120
 and you don't think about dogs anymore.

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.560
 I'm not saying your dogs aren't important.

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.400
 I'm just saying, you should try having,

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.880
 and also you just said they were expensive.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:48.800
 You should have a kid.

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:49.720
 - You'll learn.

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.480
 - I'm gonna have a kid after Dax has a kid.

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.800
 That's like the age lineage thing.

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.680
 So like, you have to do it, and then I'm like, I'm back.

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.560
 All of you guys have them, you know, like trash, prom, Adam.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.520
 You guys all have kids already, so.

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.360
 - There definitely is an order, and I do feel like I'm next.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:06.280
 I'm definitely next.

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:07.680
 - I mean, the ages match up.

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.240
 - Yeah, I'm like in that group of,

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.520
 like they call it the old man group.

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.360
 I'm like in that group.

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.040
 I don't have kids, so I'm definitely next.

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:19.800
 And then one day, these guys, I'm picturing like,

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.320
 all of the people on Twitter, like having children.

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.000
 I'm like, imagine like Theo, having children,

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.440
 I'm just like, what the hell is that gonna be like?

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.400
 (laughing)

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.560
 - I hope I'm not still on it when that happens.

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.960
 I hope I'm like, I've retired from the game at that point,

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:34.800
 you know?

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.280
 - No, I wanna see a world where we're all just talking

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:40.480
 about our kids, and it's like, I just can't imagine at all.

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.360
 - Making contact content, our kids are just like,

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.840
 (laughing)

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.880
 - Are your kids already like that, Adam?

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.120
 - They don't know, they don't know what I do.

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.280
 I mean, they don't have any idea.

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.480
 My son, my eight-year-old, has been coming in the office

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.680
 and doing his homework, like his schoolwork,

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.000
 we're homeschooling him.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.560
 So he like sets in the corner and does his little workbook,

00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:00.080
 and he's just now at eight, started asking questions.

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.400
 Like, what exactly is it that I'm doing in here?

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.600
 He really likes my office, it's a fun place to be,

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.920
 but like, he's never really put thought into,

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.920
 like, I'm actually working in here.

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.520
 So no, not to the point where he has any idea

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.080
 that I like, turn on a camera and talk to people.

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.520
 - We're talking about like, kids knowing what you do,

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.760
 like, do you have friends or like your close friends?

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:21.920
 Not like, you're obviously like your Twitter community,

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.320
 whatever, obviously they know what you guys do,

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.880
 but do you actually like, friends, friends know

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.840
 that you guys are like content creators

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.680
 on like Twitch or Twitter or YouTube, whatever?

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.120
 - I don't know, I mean, they definitely must come across

00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:33.280
 some of this stuff.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.040
 I don't really know what they make of it.

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.400
 I think a lot of them find it funny,

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.080
 'cause it's like obviously when you know someone,

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.040
 like you've known them forever,

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.600
 and like suddenly they have like,

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.120
 this different thing that they're doing.

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:42.960
 It's definitely fine.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.320
 So my close close friends, a lot of them are engineers,

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:47.720
 so they're like, in our circle.

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.440
 So they obviously know and they get it,

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.920
 but the transition has been funny for everyone,

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.840
 I think, to witness.

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.880
 - Yeah, I've got, I mean, like my closest friends,

00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:58.720
 I've maybe had like two friends.

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.080
 Like, I'm not looking for-- - You had two friends.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.400
 I was a plastic. - I was a plastic.

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.520
 - And we're here with you.

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:04.720
 It's me and Dax, they're rich here.

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.480
 - No, like, to friends that aren't in tech,

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.840
 the closest ones definitely know what I do.

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:11.200
 I don't know if they like consume any of it,

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.920
 they probably don't, but like my neighbors,

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.960
 like the people around me physically,

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.040
 'cause even my friends aren't really here,

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.480
 they have no idea what I do.

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:21.520
 Like, I would never try to explain.

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.080
 Like, I try and explain that I'm a program.

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.640
 Like, I write software, but I would never say like,

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:28.280
 and then I do it on Twitch and I show other people

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:30.080
 that I write software like, that's just never happening.

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.600
 - The funniest for me is still Liz's friends.

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.960
 When they come over and they like, walk by my office

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:37.280
 and they're like, what the fuck?

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.120
 Like, what is all that shit in there?

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:42.200
 Like, they do not understand at all,

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.560
 even like my normal job, just being like a software engineer,

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.120
 that I think they get that vaguely.

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.280
 But then this stuff, it just doesn't,

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.960
 it's just like, they just don't even comprehend it as a thing.

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:52.880
 It just seems super weird to me.

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:55.120
 - Yeah, I'm super, super embarrassed every time,

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.440
 like the cleaners are here and they clean in my office.

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.280
 And I just know they're think, they never say anything,

00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.360
 but I just know what they're thinking.

00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:03.560
 Like, that's so embarrassing when your private seniors

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.000
 come to me and share it.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.840
 - I just mean, like, a lot of people have their house clean.

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.280
 That's not like too ugly, is it?

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:14.640
 - Use a plural, do you use a plural?

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:15.560
 So for me--

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:17.320
 - Well, 'cause different people work at the company.

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.920
 - I have a cleaner that comes, like I have a cleaning lady

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:20.760
 that comes.

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.360
 - Yeah, one person is cleaning, but there's a rotation.

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:24.880
 Different people, you know?

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.400
 - I pictured, we didn't say cleaners,

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.960
 I immediately pictured like a van with a bunch of people

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.800
 in all white, like with all this gear.

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:31.640
 - Well, I laugh, yeah.

00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.440
 - And they're like, that's the number line.

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:34.280
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.040
 - I'm surprised you don't have that, to be honest.

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:36.880
 - Does that exist?

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:37.720
 'Cause it sounds kind of nice.

00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:40.440
 I mean, to be honest, if you lived in like a real place

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:43.040
 and not in Ozark, then Ozark's not real.

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.680
 - You probably go in even crazier.

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:45.560
 I feel like there's--

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.800
 - I wouldn't be able to afford it.

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.240
 Like if I lived in a real place,

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:52.920
 my senior tech money salary would not cover any of this.

00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.520
 It's just, I live in a very cheap place.

00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.760
 So I have a nice house, you know?

00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.720
 That's the trick.

00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.560
 Just gotta live in the middle.

00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.880
 - I think you are definitely bottlenecked by,

00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.760
 you definitely have desires that you're bottlenecked by,

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:05.480
 'cause I know you want this private chef concept

00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:06.320
 and you just can't find someone.

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:07.160
 - Yeah, I would love that.

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.840
 Yeah, it's hard.

00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:09.680
 - Yeah.

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.520
 - It's very tough.

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.520
 We're limited here and I don't know.

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:13.840
 I've got people to do my lawn.

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.040
 I've got people that water my plants

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.200
 and I've got people that clean my house.

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.200
 I've been able to find those people.

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.040
 - Nice.

00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.600
 - But if anybody knows a private chef in the Ozarks,

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.560
 I would love a recommendation.

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:23.560
 'Cause that's the one area.

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.560
 We spend so much of our life.

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.360
 Maybe when you have kids, maybe that's the thing.

00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:28.120
 When you have kids, half your life

00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:30.680
 is just preparing, eating and cleaning up food.

00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.280
 That's like basically your whole life.

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.600
 So if we could just automate that,

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.840
 that's the last frontier.

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:35.840
 - Just give them a soil end.

00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.120
 - Oh my God.

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.440
 It's so funny 'cause you actually did the soil end thing.

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.000
 - So I love now doing the soil end thing.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:42.840
 - You did the soil.

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.480
 You told me it fell out of your backpack.

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:45.320
 What was it doing in there?

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.560
 - I hide around 'cause sometimes I would have for breakfast

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.200
 and sometimes I'll be in between the meals

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.360
 and your hungry soil end.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.520
 I wasn't like replacing all my meals with soil end.

00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:55.360
 - Okay.

00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.360
 - Melki, do you even know what soil end is?

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.200
 Is that like--

00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.040
 - No, I don't know.

00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:58.880
 - He doesn't even know?

00:59:58.880 --> 00:59:59.720
 - He doesn't even know.

00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.320
 - That's like old millennials.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.160
 Yeah.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.960
 - I don't know what that is.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.000
 I just eat meat, man.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.840
 - That's like--

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.200
 - I love your pictures.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.160
 - It was like, you're like a Ken Wheeler in training

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.920
 with the meat pictures.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.080
 - Yeah, I've said this before.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.040
 Ken Wheeler is like my final evolution.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.640
 Like, I can already see what I'm going to be.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.480
 So--

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.320
 - I mean, it looks great.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.920
 - Soil end was like, can you explain it

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.360
 to actually you're a consumer of soil end.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.400
 - I mean, it's just like a protein drink,

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.400
 but it was marketed in this like very like tech bro way

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.800
 where it was like, it's made from genetically modified algae

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.000
 and the bottle was like completely white and all minimal

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.120
 and it was like a bunch of like tech people

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.840
 or just like drinking it for every single meal

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.560
 and like, shitting like a brick of poop.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.560
 It wasn't good.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.200
 - You don't have to waste time thinking

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.560
 about nutrition anymore.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.240
 Don't waste anymore seconds of your life.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.960
 - People that are so busy and so focused on programming.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.760
 They can't make decisions like--

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.080
 - You can't make fun of it, Dax.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.640
 You consumed it.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.400
 You fell for it.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.520
 - I didn't fall for it.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.600
 - God damn it.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.280
 I regret telling you that story.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.800
 I regret telling you the story.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.160
 The story I told out about it, I fell.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.320
 I was on my electric longboard, okay?

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.280
 Check number one.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.600
 (laughing)

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.640
 - Dude, okay, this is great.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.480
 - It's a really good story.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:16.080
 - I was in New York and I was riding everywhere.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.120
 I hit a pothole and I fell

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.600
 and I was also wearing a backpack.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.600
 Check number two.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.440
 - Herschel.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.280
 - And then that my-- - By the way,

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.120
 a Herschel backpack, exactly.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.960
 'Cause this was 2015. - Of course.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.880
 - My backpack opened and my MacBook flew out

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.360
 and two bottles of soil went flew out.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.680
 And this fucking macho construction guy saw

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.520
 and he helped me up and he like bandaged me

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.600
 and I just felt like such a loser.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.440
 (laughing)

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.320
 This could be a scene in Silicon Valley like that.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.480
 (laughing)

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.480
 - He's like, "He's going too up."

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.080
 He's like, "I got you."

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:53.920
 - It's not good.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.160
 - Melky, thank you so much for coming.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.120
 This was so good.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.280
 I think it's really good to just have people in chat

01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.120
 that just pop in.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:01:59.960
 - This is fun.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.040
 - Yeah, thank you guys for just being so open to it.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:02.880
 - We were struggling.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.720
 I'll be honest.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.560
 - We were. - We were not happy.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.400
 We had nothing to talk about.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.400
 - I didn't really want to talk to each other today, so.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.640
 - Yeah, we just kind of don't like it.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.480
 - Yeah, talking more.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.960
 - Yeah, we literally talk just on this like four,

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.400
 three or four hours every week.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.400
 - I guess it is just here.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.120
 Yeah, we don't like do calls that we don't record.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.080
 - I'm happy about it.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:19.920
 It's just kidding.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.800
 Sometimes it's hard to come up with some talk about it.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.120
 - Well, I'm more happy about it.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.080
 I'm the most happy about our relationship, so.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.200
 - You guys have a dope podcast.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.200
 I'm glad to be a part of it for a little bit.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.040
 - Yeah. - This is also--

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.560
 - Thanks, milky, whose name isn't milky,

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.240
 that we won't say the name of again.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.960
 - Milky. - Just milky.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.800
 - We're going to end it.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:37.720
 - All right. - See ya.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.120
 - It's been good, see ya next.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.700
 (upbeat music)

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:56.160
 - All right, do I like, do I just leave?

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.400
 Like is it-- - Yeah, I think that's,

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.920
 this is the part we haven't nailed yet.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.460
 We haven't nailed the landing.

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:02.600
 We're not so good at exiting, we just kind of say bye.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.440
 - Bye.
