WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 Hey, give me exactly I'm I'm finishing up a tweet. No, you're good always time for tweets. I'm gonna read your tweet right as you tweet it

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.120
 Okay, I can't figure this one out. Let's just start. Okay, I need to let it sit a little bit about that tweet simmer

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:47.840
 Well now I'm doing what a what a false start now. Are you writing a tweet? I'm not running a tweet. I'm writing a cloud prompt

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.320
 One second

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.680
 We're abandoning both both things. It's fine. Claude isn't running while we're talking and it's okay. I'm fine

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.640
 I've moved on. I've coped. I have it. It's gonna bother me the entire podcast

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.920
 Could have these prompts are running for 10 minutes. It's okay, man. I am right now. I'm eating this

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.720
 keto

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.100
 protein

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.720
 Mmm, and it is so good. Like I'm like, how is this not how is it not non keto? Yeah

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.040
 Like I just don't I forgot what keto is hang on. Let's break this down. What would it not have if it's keto?

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.480
 It wouldn't have many carbs, so it wouldn't be sweetened with sugar

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.560
 so it's definitely sweet and there's like chocolate chunks in it that are sweet, but

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.240
 It must be like a monk fruit thing, but usually I can still taste the difference

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.480
 Like it still tastes a little off, but it's really good. Yeah, it's crazy. I'm really good at the artificial sweetener stuff

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.700
 I've noticed this and also gotten really good at the non grain stuff like chickpea flour and all these other like alt alt flowers that aren't

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.720
 We base. Yeah. Yeah, the food science is improving. This just looks like a booty

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.800
 I mean, I'm not gonna say it's the best brownie I've ever had but I'm like really liking it and it's a giant brownie

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.080
 It says keto protein brownies. I don't like one room with the protein is wrote everything's protein now

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.040
 We have protein oats. We just got protein oats like there's somehow modifying the oats to have more protein

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.800
 Or they're like breeding them to have more protein. It's not like it has protein pattern

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.960
 It's just oats, but they have more protein. Okay, so I started using a mail plan. Like I've been getting food delivered

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:31.480
 Three times a week. Mm-hmm. And is it like a male one or like a local? No, I found someone local found something local

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.840
 Yeah, it's still like roughly the same as something

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.240
 large scales factor, but because it's local. It's like I imagine a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.760
 Like better. Yeah, they taste better. We had one when we were in Florida like a Naples, sorta

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.080
 I'm surprised by I would say 80% of the meals

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.360
 I'm like, this is really good and I'm like really enjoying it and I'm eating it really fast. I'm actually enjoying it

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.560
 Which was surprising because I like I've tried this type of thing in the past and it's always just been like the worst stuff

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.360
 So I think I guess because it's local or maybe they just got better at figuring out what foods

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.920
 Like what recipes work. Yeah, but anyway, I got so I'm because I'm on the keto version. I got

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.960
 Keto sloppy Joe's so sloppy Joe's usually like a sandwich with like ground meat inside. I guess mm-hmm

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.560
 But obviously you can't have the bread with keto so that there was like

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.000
 There were something it looked like bread and it called they call it like protein something and I taste them

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.360
 This is really good, but I swear this is meat like I think the bread was just also meat

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.520
 But I could really tell it was really delicious with everything together like we need everything together. It was it was great

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.600
 But I'm like what could this be like this tastes like more like different ground meat, you know, yeah

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.720
 Yeah, and so anyway, I've been enjoying a day they do so I get two meals a day plus a snack

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.160
 And this is the keto brownie is a snack for today and yeah, it's a big brownie and

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.320
 I'm really happy with it. It's like a homemade. It's like made by it's not a package thing that you found the story. Yeah, yeah

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.720
 Yeah, yeah, it's great. No, we've I guess we've done it in Missouri too

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.960
 We had a chef up here for a few months

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.760
 It's so nice to like give them you give them your parameters

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.000
 Like here's the things how we want to eat and then like the variety the way they come up with stuff and bring you stuff

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.520
 You would have never made yourself

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.960
 It makes for it's like the 80% thing you said like 80% of time

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.480
 It was like oh, this is so good

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.200
 I would have never thought to ask for this then there's like the 20% where like it's a miss because

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.760
 Like they're trying things and they're doing out there stuff and it's like

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.320
 But overall, I think it's pretty great worth it. Yeah. I think what these people are missing is a feedback loop because

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.640
 They have no idea which ones were massive hits and which ones or whatever

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.880
 So I think that would be cool if they did that. I don't know how much I would change what they do, but

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.280
 Yeah, it's been it's been really good and it's not crazy expensive either

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.000
 The chef one you guys did

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.820
 So how would they like how often would they drop the food off? It was

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.760
 Or you would pick it up. No, so this was a we were her only client. She has a restaurant

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.880
 We were her only like personal client where and she did this for us years ago

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.240
 And then when we moved back to Missouri, she started doing it again. We kind of like know her

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.240
 She would meet us every day at our kids school. So it's like halfway between her restaurant and our house

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.640
 So every day we have to go pick up her kid from school

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.480
 She'd be in the parking lot with our meal

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.400
 So we got him daily which seemed really inefficient to me like I would think they'd want to do like multiple days in a row

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.840
 But it was nice to get a fresh meal like there were literally warm meals that were taking home every day for dinner

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.000
 Didn't even have like reheat him or whatever. Oh, was it just for dinner? Yeah, we were just doing dinners. Yeah. Oh, just it

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.760
 Okay, so it was like fresh. Yeah, yeah, it was great. Nice. Nice. We don't have to heat it or anything

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.640
 We always had leftover stuff

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.720
 So we often have like lunch the next day just from leftovers, but yeah, it was she wasn't gonna like breakfast and stuff. Yeah, yeah

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.680
 Yeah, my my whole thing was like I had a tweet the other day being like we got to improve microwave

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.360
 Like I don't want a hot-ass tomato and I don't think people understood what I meant by that, but I didn't do this

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.800
 It's like that's how you get like Thai fried rice or something

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.440
 I'm trying to think about something with like like a tomato in it

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.440
 Usually the rice is hot and the tomato is normal temperature or like even cold when you're eating it

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.760
 It's like, you know, it makes sense. Yeah, when you reheat it

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.720
 Everything's hot including the tomato, and I'm just like this is not this is not right

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.120
 Uh-huh, but I think with these meals and I guess it's over the years they've gotten good at this

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.320
 They like I'm just giving me stuff that

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.000
 It's meant to all be the same roughly the same temperature

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.840
 So when I reheat it, it's actually actually pretty good like you like like the obvious thing is like imagine like a chili, right?

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.640
 Like a chili is great. You just reheat it and it's yeah, but it's like stuff like that where they know that

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.640
 Even reheated it'll be fine. So yeah, I thought it would be like

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.320
 I did it because I was like, let me try it. I'm probably just gonna like not enjoy it, but you know, it's like a very practical thing

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.760
 But now I I enjoy it. Not as good as my two steaks every day, but you know pretty close

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.840
 They're gonna make compromises at some point making two steaks a day sounds like a lot of work

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.600
 I guess you probably batch them, but no I did it. I use got so good every day. Yeah, it took me 10 minutes

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.360
 Wow to make a steak. Okay. I mean we could rehash go back to those old episodes and I could relearn how you do that

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.000
 Uh

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.200
 Yeah, I uh, I used to have a steam oven in the first house we built

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.000
 It was the best for reheating stuff. It like compared to a microwave

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.280
 I mean it wasn't as fast as a microwave, but like you know how when you reheat like potatoes or something

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.560
 They're just never as good. It's just like stuff that just will never be as good reheating a microwave steam oven

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.440
 It was like everything was brand new again. It's a little random fact. Yeah, we've got there's like a few things

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.440
 So we have our toaster oven

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.960
 I I would be surprised if you didn't own this or you haven't come across this. It's it's called a

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.880
 Belmuda the toaster. It's it's like it's a name of the toaster

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.680
 Yeah, something like that. Um, I've not heard of this

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.160
 And it has like a little slot at the top to put like a little thing of water in it

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.600
 So when you're toasting bread or something, it'll like

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.880
 Bring it back to life seems it as well. Yeah, that's good. Uh, I broke my microwave

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.600
 A month ago and I got a new one that also has an air fryer in it

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.800
 Which I'd never used before and that's been really good too because I like air frying is another way where you can just like

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:26.840
 Yes, we've got ones. Yeah, it's like a great way to reheat. It's impossible to have too many kitchen counters

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:32.120
 Like yeah, I know we constantly fill our counter space and we're like we're running out of room. We have this other appliance

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.760
 We need there's just new inventions all the time new innovations in kitchen technology

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.880
 Do you like hate how much time food takes up in your life?

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.200
 like between

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.240
 Making it thinking about what you want to have eating it cleaning up whatever. I don't have kids

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.560
 So I don't think it's right now. I'm taking up a lot of time. Okay. Well, I'm okay with it

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.560
 But yeah, I imagine that it's like

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.400
 With kids because they don't even eat like the same times like they

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.640
 they eat like

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.760
 Twice as many meals. That's like between every meal. We're also making them a meal

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.960
 It's just there's a never-ending stream of like clean up and prepare and clean up and prepare

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.520
 Just feels like our whole life is dominated by it going to the grocery store getting groceries

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.800
 I mean like we've done the insta cart thing but the whole the whole cleanup is the worst part because like

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.600
 And this is the thing like when I when I would cook a lot

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.920
 I like really

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.160
 Optimized for just reusing like a single

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.640
 Like my ideal thing is I only have one thing to clean up at the end because I like use it for everything like

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:35.240
 Yeah, like it just it's like a single fork that I use while cooking and also while eating like, you know

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.680
 Because like you make something really good usually ends up using like five or six things. You know, you need to wash

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.320
 Yeah, yeah, who's solving this? I saw a tweet the other day. It was like it was like some

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.960
 like diagram

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.080
 Or not not like a photo of the front of all these humanoid robots

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.960
 There's like 12 of them and all the different companies and what country they're from

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.320
 And like how much it weighs and how strong it is. I don't know

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.640
 There's all these facts about all these humanoid robots and they'll basically look like humans

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.960
 Where are these things? Can people buy them? Are they still just like in the lab?

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:12.520
 Does anyone own a humanoid robot that like does stuff for them? I think Kim Kardashian does. I keep seeing really close pictures of it

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.240
 Uh, I don't think it does anything yet. Okay. I don't think these things do anything

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.440
 Really? I think they're going to could we have a robot that does all these things like make our food and clean up after us

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.080
 I I guess so like why not because it's just

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.800
 Like like a mecca like it's machinery like we're not doing anything

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:35.800
 That complicated in terms of cooking. Yeah. Do I even want this? I don't even know like for me. I definitely want it

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.320
 So I don't care if you don't want it. Don't listen to Dax. We need to buy them

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.480
 Yeah, well, I mean it seems like there's an influx of companies

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.480
 There are a lot more attention on humanoid robots last like 18 months

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.280
 Is what does that have to do? Does that do with AI? I feel like it happened at the same time. It's like the resurgence of

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.800
 All this AI progress definitely has to do with AI as well. I think there's like renewed investment in anything

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.720
 AI adjacent so there's a lot of cheap capital so all these companies raise money and they're doing stuff but

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.640
 I don't know like it just so much has this think of

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.160
 All flash no substance. Yeah

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:17.320
 Like call us for a demo energy. Yeah, or just like really showing off stuff that

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.920
 Seems like

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.160
 It's flashy, but doesn't actually make sense. So one of them maybe was figure I forgot who it was

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.760
 They put together like this crazy slick

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:36.360
 Video about how they manufacture like the heads or something of these robots and it's like so optimized and so like

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.320
 Beautiful at the manufacturing process and I'm just like

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:46.040
 Why does it look that good already? Like shouldn't they're super early like why is that part of their?

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:54.840
 System like so developed. Hmm. So I just see these like weird red flags where I'm just like I don't know if these are these are real companies

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.160
 Maybe some maybe there is one that will like build something cool, but

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.680
 Yeah, I don't know like what do I actually I don't think I want them to cook

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.400
 Really want them to cook I would love for them to cook or mostly clean up

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.280
 I wouldn't mind to do the cooking if they cleaned up cleanup is good. I see that I see the clean up laundry

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.000
 I look up ton of things cleaning the house. It takes us forever

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.080
 It takes me like two hours to draw our floors like vacuum and mop. It's like

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.120
 That kind of stuff. It'd be huge

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.040
 But like can't you get it? Isn't there aren't there already robots that do that?

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:33.720
 No, they're not good the little like Roomba style robots. They just don't do a good job

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.960
 Okay, so I guess what I'm saying is let's say you have a cute problem like mopping your floors

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.080
 Can you make can someone make the Roomba thing to x better?

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.240
 Is that more likely or is like a robot that can mop

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.760
 You know, I guess more likely. I don't I actually don't know

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.920
 I mean the promise of a humanoid robot is that it could do everything like it could just

00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:00.200
 You charge it up at night and then it does all the stuff during the day. It's like multi-purpose

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.960
 You don't have all these little specialty robots. Yeah, no, I I get that

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.960
 But I just wonder if that's actually how if it's gonna happen if that's how it'll play out

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.720
 I we've got we've done a ton of different Roomba's different generations

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.560
 Not actually Roomba company like whatever we go with whatever

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.560
 Yeah, whatever the best one is at the time

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.480
 We never actually tried the sweet the the jet ones like the mopping ones

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.680
 I don't know. I just don't I don't believe in it

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.840
 I I just feel like it's not gonna work that well

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.160
 But maybe they do we've had cleaners in the past

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.680
 I think like we've had an issue where a five-year-old doesn't want anyone in the home

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.920
 So that's kind of killed that

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.480
 So it's just like this huge amount of chores that I'm dreaming of robots taking over

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.400
 I see what if he doesn't like robots either

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.440
 And you probably wouldn't yeah if he doesn't like people he probably wouldn't like

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.680
 Cold, lifeless robots walking around the house. That's a good point

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.880
 He'll get older and we can just probably hire cleaners again

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.560
 And then for like $200 a month we solve our problem and don't have to buy robot

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:03.160
 But this is the thing I always point out your situation is a little different but

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:09.320
 Man like you there's so many cases where human labor is like a lot cheaper than the automated thing

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.280
 Yeah, it's kind of like not worth it. I actually think that's maybe why

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.080
 well these robotics companies

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.520
 Like I don't see how getting one in your home

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.200
 Like I feel like a good one would be so expensive

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.520
 That like for most people it's not it wouldn't be like a mass market thing

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.200
 You know like most people would just yeah

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.240
 You know most people probably can't even afford having a cleaner come and this would be more expensive than that

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:39.720
 So yeah, and then as I think about it like if AI really does taking start like knocking out a bunch of knowledge working jobs

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.920
 People are gonna have to have something to do cleaning might be therapeutic

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.760
 Like what are we gonna do if we lose all our jobs? Are we gonna lose our jobs?

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.960
 We talk about this a lot do we need to stop talking about this every day that goes by?

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.480
 I think it's less likely less likely goes that likely to begin with but

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:01.240
 There's like the crazy outcome and there's a boring outcome both are pretty world-changing

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.640
 Every company I talk to like through like you know through sst

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.200
 So many AI companies like so many problems being solved

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.800
 All very boring like it's not like the crazy outcome. It's like hey, we've solved this

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.360
 niche little problem in the space that's been elusive forever

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.320
 And we're gonna build a

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.320
 10 million-hour company that does it great like that. That's

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.520
 That's gonna happen a thousand times over. Yeah, lots of problems getting fixed, but

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.960
 So just a decade of implementing is what we're looking at. It's the boring

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.240
 I'm not a hundred percent sure if that's what's gonna happen, but just every day that goes by

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.720
 It's going more and more in that direction. It could still flip, but I don't know. That's how I feel

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:53.000
 Yeah, how do you feel how do you feel about the AI code stuff after it's been a couple weeks since we've recorded

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.440
 I feel like

00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:02.200
 A couple weeks of doing this stuff. I have new takeaways or new learnings. I don't know. Well, you start then 3/7. It's just not it's not good enough

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.800
 It's still it's just not good enough for me. I want it to be better

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:12.040
 I feel like if I start with Jim and I or I start with even 0 3 to like lay out a good plan

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.120
 It keeps it on the track better

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.440
 Uh

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:22.280
 I did I want it to be better so badly. I want cloud 4 to come out and and just like get us over the hump

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.000
 Can you give me a discreet example of

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.600
 Something you try to get it to do and what you do to make it

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:34.360
 Perform better. Well, let's let's use the open code example. Yeah, uh, so in open code

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.680
 Just yesterday. I'm adding just adding color schemes to open code

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:44.040
 It's like a I want to use open code to improve open code and just like more reasons to use it

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.160
 Uh

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.120
 It

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.360
 Like it just doesn't it doesn't see the whole picture well enough

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.320
 To like be comprehensive so like there's this the first task really and introducing

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:03.880
 Theming into this thing is like we need to consolidate all the places where colors are being referenced throughout the code base

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.760
 And it just fails to get there it fails to get all of it kind of consolidated

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:14.040
 And then once it does if you just do this through cloud set or three seven like if you don't incorporate any other

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.520
 steps in the workflow, uh

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:24.200
 It also just starts taking really dumb approaches to like the next step which is like switching themes and

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:29.000
 How do you reinitialize the app or just update the app so that renders the new colors?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.640
 It's like recreating stuff. It should not recreate

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.760
 It's just doing a lot of making a lot of dumb decisions if I take like something like repo mix

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.400
 And I just do a big text file dump of the code base

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.840
 And I hand it to jimini 2.5 pro and I tell it everything I want and I just tell it

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.840
 It's writing a prompt for a dumb LLM

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:52.120
 Then it creates a really nice plan with like seven steps and it seems to work through those steps pretty well

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.920
 so like it's like three seven just can't do the like

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.640
 planning thing it can't do the

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.960
 like the high level thinking

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.320
 and Jim and I know three seem way better at that in grok three two, but I think Jim and I know three are better than

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.880
 correct. Yeah. Well, what's funny is uh, I

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:15.160
 Never think to use it the way you're trying to use it. I actually naturally just do the thing

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.640
 That you're getting uh, oh three or something or Jim and I to do

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.320
 Which is so I'll give you an example. So for me. I come up with the plan. Yeah

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.600
 Yeah, like I had a code base where half of it was like in a older css pattern and I wanted to move

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:36.040
 Everything to like the newer pattern. So I didn't just my instinct wasn't to be like, hey, go fix this

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:41.000
 Across the code base. Mm-hmm. I literally just want to file by file. I was like

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 Here's here's a pattern. I like look through this file and apply it. Mm. Yeah. It's way better. It's like that and apply it. So I guess

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.800
 That's like obviously inefficient like I'm doing something pretty mechanic

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:59.480
 Whereas like I should be able to tell it go through all the files anything that looks

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.480
 old like this make it look more like this

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:09.480
 And you're saying that if you gave that to a I guess oh three is a reasoning model m9 2.5

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:14.600
 Pro is that a reasoning model? I don't know. I don't even care people

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.280
 Just the names of models and types models and all this stuff. Just try them crazy

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.240
 I'm trying to understand like if that's why it's better because yeah

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.920
 Like the reasoning models are so much better at coming up with a large

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.600
 Becoming with a plan first before I was kidding because I mean three three seven thinking is reasoning, right?

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.920
 Oh, it doesn't that's not good enough either

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:38.760
 I but it's so silly. You have to like say think or think harder those have different meanings

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.600
 Like if you tell it to think and maybe I didn't in this case

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.320
 I think I use it the way you're describing in code bases

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.120
 I really know like the terminal code base the stamp use code base

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:54.200
 I use it as more of a scalpel not like a like the open code code base. I was not involved

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.320
 I do not know my way around it. I just want to like build features through prompting

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.920
 I think that's maybe the vibe coding thing. Maybe that's why I'm I'm depressed

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:08.280
 About three seven because like it's not as good at that. It's better when

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.960
 You kind of like know what you're doing in the code base and you're just using it for the dumb parts and the like tedious parts

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.840
 That's when I feel better. Yeah, I also don't like

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.960
 How like I think you've described this or somebody has described this feeling of like

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.880
 Or no, you like it because you've watched tv shows, but it's just doesn't feel like program

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:31.080
 It's like having between five different tabs. I don't like it. Yeah, I don't like that

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.920
 You're just not in

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.520
 You're not in focus mode at all. You're like, yeah, so I in jitter mode

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.400
 Yeah, jitter mode. It's not yeah, it's not my strength

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.600
 So I guess that in that sense, it's like a hedge

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:48.360
 like either outcome I'm probably okay with programming becomes completely automated and

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.640
 AI is so good like cloud four comes out and it just blows my mind that'd be a fun world probably

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.800
 As long as we have jobs

00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:03.160
 Or it doesn't and we get to go back to programming which I love we'll see. Yeah, I think I think what I am feeling is that

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.800
 And I've talked about this a little bit before

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.800
 I'm now putting way more work into designing

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:16.600
 Patterns and rules and consistency not just in the code, but just in the product. So

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.400
 For radiant

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.120
 I like put in so much work

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.000
 into our

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.080
 We have this dialogue that pops up that can

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.640
 Whenever you have to select from a list of options like we pop the dialogue show list of options

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.840
 Um in the past I would have just been like, okay

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.680
 We have like roughly something that pops up and then in every place we use it

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.400
 uh, you know, like I'll like

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.960
 Make it work for what makes sense and in in the case where it's used

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:51.560
 the traditional like programming mindset of like don't over abstract too early

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.880
 You know like

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.000
 In local places like things might vary so your abstraction might be brittle

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.280
 Um, that was like my default, but now i'm taking the complete opposite approach where i'm like

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.640
 I need to make this like the most powerful flexible useful dialogue ever

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:12.840
 Because I want to make sure that whenever I ask AI to do something it can just use that

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.880
 I think too hard. Yeah, um, so it's like really focused on enabling

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.280
 You know quote unquote a team that can just go build stuff without making some decisions

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.360
 Like i'm doing a lot more that up front and like

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:29.080
 I'd always eventually get there, but this ordering is totally different now

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.160
 Like I usually get there after

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.160
 You know the project's been around for x amount of time now i'm like really eager to get it

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.920
 All out up front and even the product design ends up looking a bit different because

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.400
 We're a little bit more reluctant for inconsistency even if the inconsistency leads to

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.240
 We have a better situation in some cases. Um

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:57.240
 So yeah, like it's definitely changing the way I work and I just feel like i'm spending a lot more time doing the whole

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:02.920
 Senior developer building stuff so that junior developers can be successful

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.120
 Yeah, that's that seems to be like a hundred percent of my focus

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.200
 Now or like yeah, which is uh, it's it's a shift

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:15.400
 For me i've never i've never been in a position where we're trying to hire junior developers

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.120
 Like stat news has never hired junior developers

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:24.200
 Terminals not hiring junior developer like it's just never a thing i've thought about in my codebase. It's like making it

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.760
 good for

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.760
 dumb people

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:33.240
 And I know you think about it because you've got because i'm like me dumb. Yeah

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:43.000
 No, the sst like model repo all the stuff you do all your patterns. It seems to really work well with those

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.400
 But yeah, it does yeah, it's I mean I I think

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:52.680
 I went through a period of time at my previous companies where my entire strategy was

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:59.080
 Let's just hire junior people because I didn't I knew we could only afford to hire mid-level people and I found middle

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.800
 People actually ain't knowing to work with um because it was really it'd be like blank slate people

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.480
 Yeah, so I like to entirely optimize around hiring junior engineers

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:13.640
 So I spent just years just making sure or like learning how to like create frameworks and structures and stuff

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.600
 Obviously working at sst. That's like that turbocharged because you're doing that for many different companies

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.040
 Um, but then sst and then a terminal

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:26.520
 I got past this thing where I could only hire people that were mid-level

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.480
 But everyone sst's pre-senior. I'm a terminal is pretty senior

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:35.320
 So now I'm like, okay. I'm never gonna go back and hire junior people. So yeah, you don't have to work as far as AI

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:41.880
 Yeah, and that has brought me back to that. So again, it's like very familiar to me because it's it's basically what i've been doing for most of my career

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.440
 um, but I see why

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.120
 I would guess that most people have not been in that kind of situation

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:54.840
 It's probably the exception that you have experienced doing that. So I get why people are like this thing sucks. It's so bad

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.920
 Um, but I think it just because your job needs to look a little bit different. Yeah

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:04.040
 Hey, we haven't talked about we haven't talked since Miami. We haven't talked about the week in Miami

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.560
 The yacht just all of it. Yeah

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:12.040
 Where do you want to start? Yeah, just to summarize for everyone last week was react Miami

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:17.560
 Um, adam came initially, but then had to leave early because his kids were sick. Unfortunately

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.000
 Uh, we missed you every time we did something. We're like, uh

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.480
 It'd be fun if adam was here. He would have gotten into it. That's nice to hear. I was sad and it was hard

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.560
 it was hard because uh

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.080
 I

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.520
 You feel bad

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.280
 being sad

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:39.320
 When like you did the right thing. It's like my kid my kid ended up in the hospital like it was it was bad like

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.720
 Both my kids got pneumonia

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:46.120
 My littlest one had double ear infection. It was just it was really bad. Like he's in the hospital late at night

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.040
 So I flew back the next morning

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.760
 Uh, I know I need to come back. I I wanted to be there

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.400
 And then it's like I felt guilty for being sad that i'm missing stuff throughout the week when like

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.000
 I need to be there, but then I learned I worked it out. I learned like no, it's okay

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.640
 I can have two things can be true at once. Like I can be disappointed that I missed out on stuff

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.120
 but also

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.120
 Now that I need to be home. So

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.320
 Yeah, yeah, I missed a lot of fun things. Could you tell them about the fun things

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:16.040
 And me so, uh, you got here on sunday. We all hung out

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.520
 Uh, we went to dinner on sunday

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:24.280
 And monday. What do we do? Oh, so monday, uh, super base has been so visit and making these documentaries

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.720
 They've only done one so far. I think and we're the second one

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.360
 So we filmed

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:35.880
 A quote-unquote documentary about terminal where we just kind of said a bunch of stuff that just wasn't true and was funny

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.600
 Hopefully, we'll see what they do with the footage. Hopefully we'll see

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.680
 Um

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.320
 And then what do we do after that when we do after that on monday after the well

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:51.400
 We started like working on the song. I mean, working on lyrics. Yeah, so we rented a yacht for Tuesday

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:57.880
 Uh, well, the story here is I knew that I get a yacht for half price

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.200
 So my grandma's gonna be in Miami. I'm just gonna do it so I booked a yacht then I was like, hey guys

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.240
 What should we do with this?

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:08.520
 What should we do with? Yeah, and tj was very confident that we should just make a rap video and all of us were just kind of like

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.600
 Okay, like that sounds good. I don't I don't know about there were mini dad. Yeah

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.840
 We're like from every corner of terminal

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:20.680
 Yeah, because I am but i'm not musical at all like just not something I've ever done something not something I feel comfortable with at all

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.120
 But tj was very confident pulled all of us through it

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.120
 Um

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.120
 So monday we worked on lyrics

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:34.040
 Uh, so tuesday unfortunately you have to leave but then we you know, uh got on the yacht. We had

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.920
 Uh, all these plans for

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.720
 What we were gonna shoot we also didn't have the song at this point

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.800
 So we were just like we did the video first without the song so we're just kind of hoping that you know things would line up

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.680
 Um that morning by the way, I went and I bought a drone

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.040
 Oh, I don't know if I told you this. No, I bought a dji mini four

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.600
 So you didn't use the drone guys drown used your own

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.000
 So I was we were gonna hire a drone guy and I was talking to him

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.960
 And he was like, oh, I can only do 1080p and we're like what huh?

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.840
 I'm actually 1080p like what's wrong? Do you have six?

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.840
 Yeah, and he like told us a drone and it is like one of those mats like one of the massive

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:13.160
 It's like the $20,000 dji drone which they're like in hindsight. It's too big

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.440
 It's like

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.040
 We would have to like clear the deck or they got to like launch this thing every time. Yeah

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.680
 So it was like, oh, yeah, I need like a license and I don't have the license and I was okay

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.880
 We can pay for the license. So like dji has a crazy with the licensing

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.520
 I don't know if it's their fault if it's like how the industry is but yeah

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.560
 It's like these pretty expensive licenses to like be able to actually take advantage of what your drone can do

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.360
 And but he was like, oh no, it's like on a physical thing

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.640
 So like I don't even get in time so we had to like cancel with him because he couldn't get

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.080
 The license of time, whatever. I was like, okay. I'll just buy a drone

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.840
 I've always kind of one-on-one. Um, so there's randomly a dji store in Miami

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.520
 So I went there was only one left of the one that we needed

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.320
 Wow, we got the last one and man, this thing is so cool

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:59.640
 You guys learned how to use it in time for drone shots again for audience. We also had um, the krazam team here

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.480
 Ben and shiva

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.720
 If you don't know, you probably know who they are they're the ones that made the microservices video which all of us have seen

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:11.080
 Um, they're very talented very funny cool team. It was awesome having them with us guys are great

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:17.560
 Yeah, so shiva like just spent the morning while we also oh so that morning after about the drone we're all just running around

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.520
 Trying to find costumes and stuff for us

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.440
 We were just like going to the mall and like doing whatever trying to find any kind of stuff

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.240
 They ended up finding a costume store that worked out and got a bunch of funny stuff coffee company by the way

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.320
 Yeah, we're coffee company, you know, just normal coffee company things

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.520
 So shiva like figured out like so have the drone download updates, etc

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.240
 Um, it's we own the yacht

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.560
 The captain was just like what the hell are you guys doing?

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.080
 He thought it was funny. I thought it would be like I was unsure if they would find it weird

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.200
 But he thought it was funny and thought it was awesome and he was like super into all of it

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:51.000
 That could have ruined the vibe that could have made it very awkward to feel like dancing and like done stuff and he's like

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.760
 Yeah, exactly. He thought we were he thought it was really cool

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.600
 Okay, so he took us out and then we just anchored in the bay and then we just filmed

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.560
 All these different shots of us together independently

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:07.640
 Then we split up and we're just doing like little individual like skits on our own just to get as much footage as possible

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.400
 It was really fun. It was obviously awkward at the beginning, but like once we got into it

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:17.240
 Um, it was funny like we the first costume were these like nerdy like nasa engineers saw costumes

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:22.120
 And that was like, I don't know if it was just the costumes or if it was like, you know

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.560
 Just because it was the first thing we're trying to do like we were a little stiff. It was a little awkward

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:30.520
 Yeah, um then we switched into like our Miami outfits and like everything loosened up like

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:35.800
 All those shots are just so much better and we got some really really really good good scenes

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.720
 I think we're okay with times like sun setting like we got a

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:45.400
 Film with the drone and everyone was too nervous to use it and josh was just so josh heard the camera

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:50.760
 Uh the videographer we hired you just like i'll just do it like over the water. Just scared it would fall because it was like

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.360
 This is crazy

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.680
 And he he's nailed it. He like got it up and then just it was filming all these shots

00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:01.080
 Was like swooping in and doing all that stuff. Yeah, the drone can do all these things automatically

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.640
 By the way, we just like didn't know how to work it. Um, but whatever we got some some really nice drone shots

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.200
 Uh, here's that funny thing though

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.160
 So when the drone takes off it marks where it took took off from

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:15.320
 And then when you hit land, it like flies back to where it took off from and lands. Oh no

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.240
 So what's the boat moving? We're anchored so i'm like, okay, this is fine

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.320
 So we do a test run and then when it comes back down it's letting a complete different spot

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.720
 I'm like what's going on the boat's rotating the whole time. It's not still just rotating

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.520
 Uh, so we couldn't use the auto landing wasn't a big deal

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.480
 But it was just kind of funny because it felt like we were still but we were kind of be rotating

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.280
 But i'm just like kind of like land directing the water

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.600
 It's also really smart

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.520
 So I think if it got close to the water it would know and then it would just like not land

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.760
 Uh, they make it really hard for

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.480
 To mess it up like I was playing with it like yesterday and man, this thing is so cool

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.920
 It feels like

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.560
 You know in video games where you can get like a camera that like flies around the map

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:58.680
 It literally feels like that because it's so stable. It feels like you can move anywhere instantly

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.760
 It's real time streaming to your controller

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.000
 and I was just like

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.400
 I was like flying a video game camera like around my neighborhood. Like it was really wild

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.560
 It's really cool really cool technology. It's gotten so advanced. I've always wanted a drone

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.200
 I've never been able to think of a reason to have a drone. Yeah, it's like

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.800
 I finally had the excuse to buy one. Yeah with terminal money

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.600
 I mean, maybe maybe it's maybe it's literally just like I should get one just for me and the boys should just like play with

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:26.120
 It's fun. Just be fun to like fly around and see what stuff looks like from the air

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:31.800
 Like just as like a it's purely entertainment. It's literally it. We're not trying to record stuff

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.440
 Yeah, and where you live where there isn't much like

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:40.040
 Many buildings and stuff. It can go 10 kilometers. Isn't that insane? What what's the kilometer again?

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.160
 It's like a mile

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:46.280
 Uh, I think it's I think it's like 1.6 miles or the other way around. Wow. Yeah 1.6 miles

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.760
 Or no. Sorry. Sorry. One mile is 1.6 kilometers all the way around. So

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.160
 You're 10 miles

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.760
 Okay within 10 miles still if it can go miles, that's impressive

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.720
 It's crazy because like how much is a drone like this? Do you mind saying?

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.800
 This was um, it's only 1,000. Oh, nothing that crazy

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.320
 So and this had the upgraded controller that had this so there's there's like a

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.240
 Dumber controller where you dock your phone and the phone serves is

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.800
 The screen they didn't have that one

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:18.280
 So we got the more expensive one has a screen built in and you can just tell it's like it is just like an android phone or something

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:25.240
 Uh, that's embedded into the controller and yeah, it has like as it has it can so now this for the four pros when I got

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:31.480
 Once you launch it, you can do auto track mode and when you do that it like on the screen

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:36.760
 It detects all the humans or like dogs or whatever and you can like there's like a little plus icon

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.440
 You can tap it and it just follows you just follows you around and you can walk around

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.920
 It avoids trees. It avoids everything else. You can say okay, do like a circle shot around me

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.720
 And it'll do like feel like kind of spin around you as you're walking

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.800
 Um, it's crazy. Something minutes of flight time for one

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.960
 One charge. It's pretty good. Like yeah, it's pretty solid. Um, and we got second battery anyway

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.520
 So yeah, these things are amazing. Here's another fun detail

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:08.840
 So if the FAA at some point put in a regulation if the drone is over 250 grams

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.720
 You need like a special license to be allowed to fly it

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.440
 DGI within weeks of that regulation had a drone that was 249 grams

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.840
 This this drone weighs 249. Yeah

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:25.400
 Nice. Yeah, so you can just do whatever you want. Um, I'm so even then I'm surprised how legal it is because

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:31.720
 Route one like the huge highway is like right by where I live and through the drone up

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:35.080
 And I flew it over and it's like over the highway and I'm like

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.960
 Wow, I could just slam this into a car right now. I'm causing a massive disaster

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:44.520
 It's a good point like you could actually do

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:50.360
 I don't know bad things with a camera on a you know like yeah, is it like a privacy thing? I don't know

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.040
 like

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:57.000
 Just buzzing. I mean there's that Drake video of like the fake like drone pulling up to his tower

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.240
 And he's like throwing the shoe at it or whatever. Yeah, but like really couldn't drones be really like

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.440
 Invasive why aren't they everywhere terrified of drones?

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.800
 I'm like if you just get a grenade and put on a drone like how well, how do you stop it?

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.720
 Oh, geez. Oh, yeah

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:14.440
 Well, yeah, you hear all about like I guess those aren't the same kind of drones, but you hear about the the war

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:19.640
 The war yeah, yeah, yeah, we're showing Ukraine like the drone warfare is such a huge part of it. It's like

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.600
 Have you seen what they have you seen what they do now?

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.240
 So it's it's it's crazy the cat and mouse thing

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:30.520
 So typical drone how do you stop it? You try to like make the signal and try to jam the signal you make it

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.840
 So it's like you know you like mess up the radio waves

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.920
 Pretty effective

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.320
 Then they just started using wired drones

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:43.320
 What so they have just thin wire that is miles long

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.880
 Own that word that they just fly the drone with

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:51.640
 So just like a wired zone crazy and now they have counter drones. It just cut the wire

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.960
 This is nuts

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:00.520
 Yeah, it's like all the crazy machinery that was developed through like world war two and post world war two

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.880
 And like all this crazy war machinery and then it was like these little drones

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.520
 That's what ended up being like the most effective thing

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.040
 I honestly like I'm sure people that are in charge of military are like

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.320
 Working through all these like they're probably just running my simulations and stuff

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.120
 But I'm like, yeah, if you just have like 5,000 drones

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.160
 and they're like

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.080
 Yeah, not hit manually control. They're automated and they're just explosive

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:28.280
 What what yeah, what do you do? It's gonna warfare. I would you can take out and it's funny. I think

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:34.360
 Especially with this rush to Ukraine war. I like really understood how war is just like an economic battle. It's like

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.720
 Okay, this tank costs five million dollars

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.200
 How can we take it out for less than five million dollars?

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.760
 And if we can keep doing that we run out of money

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:48.760
 Like later than the patch than them. Yeah, so it's all about like calculating. Is it worth risking this thing?

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.760
 Like can we get like an asymmetric win here?

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.000
 hmm

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.040
 Yeah, so man, this stuff is really wild. But yeah, you can buy one for a thousand dollars

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:03.800
 Yeah, thousand dollars for a drone. So then Tuesday night you guys went to a recording studio and actually recorded the song

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:08.600
 Was that the plan all along? I didn't know there was gonna be a recording studio. Was it Tuesday night? No, it was

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.720
 Yeah, it was the night or no. It was the next day. No, so we were tired from the yacht

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:18.520
 I think we yeah, we just tired and we like, you know went slept and we're talking about how

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:22.680
 Man like it's gonna be hard for us to record manually at home

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.560
 I give it. I guess it's fine. We can do it

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.880
 Then like TJ just decided to just like look up music studios and there's all it's in Miami. So it's a bunch

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.720
 Yeah, and we're just okay. Let's just do it. Let's just do it. Let's just go to music studio

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:40.680
 Here's a crazy part. So we found a music studio. It's literally walking distance from my house

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.040
 I see I

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.960
 The area that I've seen all the time. I didn't know there was a music studio there. It looks like a house

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.960
 Um

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.280
 I was like, man, this is gonna be expensive. I don't know. This isn't a budget

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.200
 Four hours

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.800
 420 dollars

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:59.240
 What? Yeah, are you serious? It's so cheap. Okay, so I'm like, okay, this is a great deal

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:05.800
 But I guess it's just like a little music studio, whatever and we and we go in it doesn't immediately look that impressive because it's clearly like a house

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.880
 That was converted then we go into like the studio part and there's a guy there

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.720
 And we we brought Ken with us because we're like Ken needs to like talk to them because we don't know what we were doing

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:19.560
 and and Ken's like asking the guy all these questions and I could tell the guy was like being polite but like

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.920
 I could tell the guy was like, don't worry. Like I know what the hell I'm doing

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.600
 And he's like, okay, let's start recording

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.000
 This door song just like the beat that we had for it and prime goes in

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.680
 And this guy is like so imagine the best neo-vim user you've ever seen

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:40.040
 It's like the equivalent of that but for whatever this audio

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:45.240
 Audio software he was using tools or whatever. Yeah, he was going crazy

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.320
 Like he was asking us. He had prime do his verse

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:52.920
 And he was like in real time swapping out individual words from different takes

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.760
 He was like prime go again prime go again

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.400
 Dropping out there. He's like, okay. Okay. Can you go like this? Can you go?

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.480
 Can you go like that? He would take that immediately put it in like a thing

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.680
 He's like, okay. Can you go like? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. No, he heard prime

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.040
 He was like he was telling prime. Oh like do this line like this and prime goes

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:14.280
 Yeah, yeah, they could always goes. Yeah, immediately grab that put it in as like an ad lib after a line

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:18.520
 He's making like insane magic and he probably spent like

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.080
 15 20 minutes

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.840
 On primes because we were like we're nervous. We're like we've never done this before like he's just gonna come out good

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:30.360
 Made prime sound like a freaking pro just pulled out magic got him to do all this stuff

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:35.640
 And it's it's crazy because it's literally like the full final verse

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:42.520
 I have no idea how like each word is probably from like a different really different try and it sounds totally cohesive

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:46.840
 You would never guess it's called punching in they basically like

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.640
 Pull out a thing and they like punch in like punch in uh each word at a time

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.000
 I've actually been in the studio a few times for oh really? Yeah

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.080
 Like buzz beat was one of colin's friends. We went when he recorded an album

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.640
 And I think it was a Nashville

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.800
 And then colin's been in the studio time my brother. Oh, of course. Yeah, yeah

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:12.600
 So i've actually been in recording studios. I kind of know the the lay of that I know what you're talking about

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:18.200
 Okay, yeah, so I was I'd never done this and it was so fun because like every minute the song is getting a little bit better

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.800
 And he's like everyone's riffing on his ideas and like, you know, we'd had like

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.080
 It was just so much fun. You know what it felt like it felt like uh

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:30.360
 It really just felt like going bowling or like doing karaoke like one of those kinds of activities because yeah

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.520
 It's not like we're dropping five grand. We're dropping

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.160
 100 and something dollars per hour

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:40.280
 Which is amazing. I can't believe just come here all the time my friends and just walk out with like a song like that's

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:45.160
 This is insane. So then I like stepped out and i'm like looking around like the

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.440
 Kind of hallway in the studio and they have all these like

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:54.680
 Signs on the wall and i'm realizing this is not a random studio. This is like

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.880
 They were just signing the wall for gasolina, which is like

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.080
 I don't know if you know this song, but when I was in high school

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:08.520
 It's like the first latin song i'd ever heard it was so famous that it like made it to suburban new jersey where there's no like

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.880
 Like latin rap wasn't like a thing there

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:18.200
 It was like crazy crazy successful like super popular like put that whole genre on the map

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:22.120
 Like all the latin music that exists now. It's like because of this one song

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:27.560
 And the guy that owns the studio made that song like he's credited with making some producer of that studio

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:32.600
 He owns three studios one in portareco one in miami and one in like chile or something

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:37.800
 Uh, and then they have a wall with all these people that record in the studio like this polaroid

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:44.920
 And it's like the most famous people ever it's like really like i would say i would bad bunnies probably the most famous

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.920
 But every him and like below him

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:53.000
 Everyone hit everyone. I was like this is crazy. This is literally in my neighborhood. Huh?

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.560
 We randomly picked this studio. We ended up with like a beast of a sound engineer

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:03.080
 That can just like 120 magic out of it and for for this price like this i can't believe how

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.080
 How much more was the sushi dinner that i before like a lot more a lot more right

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.680
 Well, that's what we did. We went to i'm like, were you there this you were there this is dinner

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.120
 I was there so yeah, it was monday night. Yeah. Yeah, so i'm like

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.080
 This is i can't believe because we could have picked any studio

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.360
 Like this we have to pick this one because it was the closest one to to my house

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:25.960
 And i was shocked at how because i am not a good singer. I'm not musical and he just pulled out

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.920
 Like the best possible outcome out of us and it was really really impressive

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:36.280
 Yeah, did he actually did you guys just use so kin had made like the track

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:41.320
 Was the sound is that what is in the final thing or did he remake it or he like remixed a little bit?

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.520
 There's a few things where he like remixed it a little bit, but it's like roughly exactly that

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.080
 Um, but he just he was like pulling up sound effects

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.200
 From nowhere and like throwing stuff. He was having a great time, too

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.480
 He like he thought we were really funny and he was having he was generally having a good time

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.760
 And the other thing is like we started at like 10 p.m. I went to 3 a.m

00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:02.200
 Which I guess is normal hours for a studio that's insane. It's not normalize for me, but he

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.720
 He was impressed with us because he was like

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.360
 Man like very few people

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.440
 Get a whole song

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.640
 In like he's like sometimes we spend weeks just doing a single verse

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.720
 Which makes sense and can was saying this because can't own the studio at some point

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.600
 He's like

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.680
 Yeah, people come in and they don't take it that seriously

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:25.080
 They just get like drunk and they like smoke a bunch of weed and they just like kind of hang out and they barely get any work done

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.520
 So I think that's

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.520
 What they were used to where we were like

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:34.360
 We have to get this done autistic program. Yeah, exactly deadline sprint planning tomorrow

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.200
 Exactly

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.200
 We were just so machine like about it

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.560
 But that was it was so much fun. And now I'm just like

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:47.800
 This is just an activity. I want to do like whenever there's people in town or whatever like when we need something to do

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.880
 That's cheap entertainment. I mean relative to a lot of things. All you do is write some lyrics

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:56.200
 And then just go in the studio and hang out and you can like get food and like just you know

00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:02.200
 Record with each other and it was it was a lot of fun. It was really really fun. So there's a music video coming

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:08.280
 Of turmoil. Yeah, so we have the song. We have the raw footage recorded. Josh is working on edits

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.680
 We gotta figure out how to work you in there

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.000
 Yeah, I'm willing. Yeah, let me know

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.640
 I'll record something now. I think the best thing would be for you to just come out here for a day and just

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:23.480
 I could just not have any audio. You could also just yeah

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:27.720
 Sit a two second be real with me somewhere. Here is the funniest part. I don't know if you saw it

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:33.960
 Do you see me post her Instagram? No, you posted to art the terminal. No, so the studio is an instagram, you know school with the instagram

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.240
 It's just like the most

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.120
 Stereotypical like rappers like you know

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:42.760
 Like like a dawn people like just doing their thing. They all look cool and whatever

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:50.280
 And then there's like a one-minute montage of us in there alongside all these people and it's just so funny

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:56.440
 They also took our pictures the Polaroids and they put it up against yeah, so we're like up there with all these

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.760
 That's awesome all these people

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:04.920
 I can't believe it's that cheap. I would have thought like thousands of dollars

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.000
 I mean still worth it, but we get a whole song out of it. You know, it's it's wild

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.840
 Our debut album. Maybe we'll go platinum. We'll double platinum

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.200
 Oh, man

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.000
 There's other terminal stuff. I guess that week you guys a terminal feud

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.600
 Yeah, that's the next day. We had a party at my house

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.040
 We did this fun thing where we put a couch in my front yard with the terminal flag behind it

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.040
 And we just had people

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.600
 Like interviewed them. So we have all that footage. I don't think we've released much of it

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:35.000
 We have my party then we had there like that react my me after party

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.360
 And we went to the

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.760
 Did we go to the studio after that?

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:46.840
 Now, maybe I can't remember the order of things. I feel like the studio was that the studio was that

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.640
 So we did the my party react my party. I went to studio

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.440
 then Thursday

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.360
 We went to the conference for a little bit just say hi then we went back home

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.920
 We had to record a bunch of our sponsored

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:04.040
 We had sponsors for react my amies. We recorded some commercials for them ads were so good

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:08.520
 Yeah, I mean having like a real videographer like the ads came out so good

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.360
 Like the the one would prime like waking up in bed like look super legit

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:15.240
 I remember being jealous of

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.640
 Aaron and like

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.320
 And yeah, the try hard stuff. I'm like not jealous anymore. Yeah

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:28.040
 Yeah, so he's got those skills that look so good. Oh, this is another thing. So in the

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.680
 When we were filming in the yacht

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:35.480
 I was like, man, I don't think we look cool. Like I just don't think we were gonna look cool. I wasn't sure

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:41.000
 Then he showed us that footage with prime like sitting there with like he's wearing he's wearing a wig

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.720
 He's like doing all this stuff. That's so good. Yeah, and I'm like

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:50.360
 He looks so legit like this was like a legit rap video. I'm like, it's just the camera

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.640
 It is literally just the camera. He's got like a

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:58.120
 The red camera. Yeah, red camera. It's nice. It just our brains associate

00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.880
 that

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:03.160
 quality style with being legitimate and

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:09.880
 It just looked it just looked great. It just looked amazing. So like all that stuff all the other jobs are good though. It's stuff

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:14.680
 Yeah, you gotta subscribe if you're listening to this you should probably go subscribe to the terminal youtube terminal youtube

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:20.120
 Yes, we have a lot of vlog stuff on there. It was we have so much good content coming out there very entertaining

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.640
 Yeah, so

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:26.680
 Film some stuff with him. I worked on family feud cleaning up the terminal feud code base that whole day

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:31.880
 And the next day we showed up to run terminal feud again went really smooth

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:36.760
 Like we did we had like no issues or anything technical issues or whatever

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.520
 Uh people loved it people were laughing the whole time. It went great

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.160
 Uh

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.760
 And then that was it. We ended up skipping the react money after party

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.520
 We're just kind of tired of that point of socializing. So yeah, we just hung out

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:54.680
 Then everyone went home on Saturday. I still asked them to watch the terminal feud

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.640
 I haven't uh, I started the stream for it and I haven't watched it. I was just yeah out of pocket

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.760
 It went well though. Yeah, we did two games. I think

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.720
 In the future like the first game

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:10.120
 Was I think it was it was really good overall. The first game was definitely higher energy

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.680
 I think it's hard to keep people at that level for

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:18.040
 An hour and a half. Yeah, so if we ever just again, I don't think we will but if we do, I think we'd stick to one game

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.720
 And just make sure it goes for yeah, it was good

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:28.520
 Uh top g was there. He was a participant. Yeah, lots of little clips. I've seen of of you two or photos

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.080
 Yeah, that was funny

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:36.440
 Funny. They asked him what his favorite part of react money was and he says dax and everyone lost their shit

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:42.200
 I did see that somewhat. That would be a good short when we post it later. Yeah, it's good

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.520
 So yeah, good successful week good stuff

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:50.040
 Got a youtube established got so much because hell's coming out. We're rolling out a digital cron

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:55.560
 Membership so you can have all the benefits of cron membership without the coffee. Yeah, it's cheaper

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:59.640
 Cheaper if you don't live in the us and you can't get it anyway, you can now get it

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.520
 You're gonna get all sorts of behind the scenes access. We have we have so much foot in so much content

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.520
 Like it then it's all so funny

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.520
 Um in hindsight, we wish we had a second

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.440
 We had like with another person under josh to like film more stuff

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:16.840
 Because you only film one thing at a time. We miss a lot of funny things that were happening week like that

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.920
 There's just so much going on. Yeah

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:24.040
 Yeah, like there was this whole thing where prime and ben we're trying to put together the whiteboard for the

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.760
 We bought a whiteboard for that that we were filming

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:29.560
 That itself could just been like a whole video

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:34.520
 There was a camera guy because they were just like it just they were just not doing a great job and i'm like

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:37.320
 we could just tell that how to

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:43.880
 Do a whiteboard interview, but just them building the whiteboard and like being horrible at it. Yeah. Yeah, it's funny when you think of like

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:50.760
 Ben and prime as like these huge youtube figures and they're building a whiteboard and there's like nothing going on in the video just

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.760
 Then building a whiteboard

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.840
 We entertaining it was funny. It was funny. Just even just hearing them in the background while I was working

00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:03.000
 Yeah, so that was a week. It was the week. You can watch the vlogs to really see it. Yeah, the vlogs are great

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.680
 Very exciting much excitement

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:12.280
 Uh, anything else going on with you? I think just kind of last thing on the re-acaminy stuff. So

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.080
 like I think a takeaway I had was

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:19.480
 terminal feud was really really great and we're gonna upload a video of that

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.040
 but

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.040
 the vlogs

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.800
 To me or what where all the value was because they're so

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:32.440
 Wide reaching like anyone can watch them and find them entertaining

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:37.080
 Um terminal feud, you know, it's a little bit more narrow a lot of inside jokes there a lot of like internet

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.080
 face jokes, but

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:43.000
 Uh like jay, uh jay's girlfriend watched she's a lawyer. She's not technical

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.160
 She watched the vlogs and I mean she obviously she knows us so it's a little bit more personal, but um

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:50.920
 Uh, she watched all of it. She found it funny like she understood most of it

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:55.560
 So I'm really excited to just continuously being able to put that stuff out there. Yeah

00:50:55.560 --> 00:51:00.280
 Yeah, when are we when are we when are we in person next what's after Miami? I don't know

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:05.880
 We don't have any official plans. We got some stuff in the works, but I don't know what's gonna be next

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.440
 Yeah, we'll see we'll see

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.920
 We'll see we'll buy we'll buy a warehouse in LA and we'll start to film

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:17.960
 Okay, that's that's my nice goal. I do love LA

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.240
 Casey and I have always loved going to southern california. It's so nice

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:27.240
 I mean the weather is so nice. I love LA. I would move there instantly. Yeah. It's the driving around LA

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.560
 Like I guess if you just were like parked and like

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:34.760
 I mean if you want to finish your Santa Monica. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, you can walk everywhere pretty much. It's true

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.480
 That's probably what I would try to do. Yeah, yeah, there's not really I guess

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:43.640
 When I've been in LA it's been for work stuff and like Disney stuff. We're having to go to Glendale, which is like

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.600
 An hour and a half drive from

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:51.320
 Like if you're in like a cool place in LA and then you want to get to those places where the studios are

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.080
 It's like a nightmare

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:58.600
 It's a wrong time of day. So I've just got all these memories of being in LA and a car on like one of the freeways just

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:02.200
 Forever in the car. Yeah, we're gonna like complaints about the driving

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:08.120
 But I I think I'm assuming it's very similar to my current situation where Miami's a very car-based city

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:11.000
 But I live in you live in a neighborhood area

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.800
 Yeah, I don't really have to leave that much. Yeah, it makes sense

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.920
 But that said anywhere I want to go I can get to in 15 minutes

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:21.000
 Which might not be the case in my in LA, but yeah, yeah weather is great

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.720
 I said the motion is there would much rather move there than the Bay Area

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.600
 Yeah, are you moving to the Bay Area? What's the deal?

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:33.000
 Are we talking about the podcast? I did post a thing being like if

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.040
 I post like my ideal

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.800
 Type of way to live and like is this possible in the Bay Area the reason I posted that is

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:43.720
 We're like, okay. If we decide to move like is that an option? We're considering it

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.840
 Jay is probably gonna move there

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:51.160
 Just because it does makes way too much sense like one of us has to be in SF pretty much

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.920
 um

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:56.760
 But he's definitely moving there within a year probably in about a year or so

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.880
 And I'm wanting to okay should I move there too?

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:05.560
 I'm not so sure. I like I'm very reluctant to give up the weather in Miami

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:09.320
 I don't like the weather in San Francisco. I think it can be nice. I think

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:14.280
 It's not nice enough where you stop thinking about the weather, which is what I have right now

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:20.600
 Um, and the second thing is like this is kind of surprising to me because I would think people there would care about this

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:25.160
 Uh, so obviously SF itself is very walkable

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.200
 But I don't want to live in SF. I want to live like outside of it. Yeah

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:34.360
 Mm-hmm. It's not very like they don't have these like nice little communities that I would I would expect

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:37.160
 to me as a cliche like

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.640
 liberal-leaning urbanish area

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:46.040
 Everyone cares about like oh, I want my cute little walkable neighborhood, but like it's not it's like very suburban and there's like

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:53.720
 Center areas that are you can't really walk to and like if you even if you walk to it's like a weird walk where you're kind of walking in weird places

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:58.120
 Yeah, so yeah, I don't know. I just couldn't find an area that I was

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.960
 California and you just commute you do the 45 minute

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:08.360
 Playing ride thing. Yeah, I mean, I think Jay would love to live in LA too. Like he'd he's like, yeah, why not just ever been LA

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.960
 He's not happy about SF

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:13.400
 He's like we're designed that it just makes too much sense that you have to be an SF for some amount of time

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.840
 But he eventually wants to end up in in LA. Yeah

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:21.320
 Azu I or I mean, I wouldn't mind LA, but I don't know. I'm happy

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:26.760
 I thought through all this. I was like kind of excited, but I'm like, I'm pretty happy in Miami like I don't

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:33.640
 I don't really get kind of have everything I want here. So I don't know. Yeah, I don't have everything I want in the Ozarks

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.960
 so

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.840
 I need you to figure out where you're gonna be and then we can figure out where we're gonna be

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.480
 Where do I see you guys?

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:45.720
 Ultimately, there's a very few places that we would consider like

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:51.160
 We lived in Naples for a while. So South Florida is definitely it's on the list

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:56.920
 California, I guess like Southern California. Yes, the Bay Area, no

00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:01.320
 Maybe Northern California you guys would want to be in you guys would want to be in a house

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:05.800
 Yeah, you're not like trying to no, we're not trying to be in like a walkable city

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:11.320
 Yeah, so I mean the dream would be Maui if I'm just being honest the dream would be like a fruit farm in Maui

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.880
 And I'd never see any of you again, but you know, how's that different in the Ozarks?

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:20.520
 How's the different in the Ozarks better weather? Yeah, I mean, yeah, the mountains in the ocean. It's

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:25.000
 You got mountains in the Ozarks. Don't you growing mangoes? I don't know. There's a lot of things

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.840
 Yeah, we have we have mountains. They're just like

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:32.600
 Wooded mark 20 forest with meth labs. I mean, it's just a little different. Yes. Obviously Hawaii is incredible

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.440
 Let me get that out of the way first

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.480
 Of course

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:40.440
 I don't okay. Here's my issue. I don't think I want to live on an island. I get that it's it's not like a

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.600
 To me, it's like a very practical thing where I'm like

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:47.560
 Everything everything just has to get shipped to you and like there's all these

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:52.520
 I'm sure you can talk about. Yeah, exactly. I'm sure you used to it and you like forget about that being a problem, but

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:56.280
 It's just it's like two

00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:02.040
 Out of the way for me. Yeah, I think I don't think in this season of life like where there's actual travel needed and stuff

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:05.880
 I don't think it makes sense. Yeah, that's yeah exactly like a retirement dream. Yeah

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:12.520
 Um, you can have a fruit farm in South Florida. No, it's true. Yeah, I mean you can grow most everything we'd want to grow

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.000
 Yeah, yeah, I should move to homestead

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:22.600
 Where's that it is? Uh, south of miami. Oh, basically where we go whenever we want to do farm stuff. There's like there's really

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:25.800
 Giant famous like fruit

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:31.720
 I guess you can call it a fruit stand, but it's like really big and they have their own like they have so much up there. It's like a giant

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:39.560
 Fruit quote unquote stand. Yeah, it means amazing milkshake. So we always go down there. Uh, and all the fruit farms are down there and

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:47.000
 For buying trees. We go down there. Uh, and there's tons of properties there where I'm like if we are one of the farmlings, probably

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.280
 Okay, I'm gonna look into it. I didn't know it was like an actual

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:54.440
 Place people live south of miami. I thought it was just like the drive to key west

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.840
 And yeah, that's like into the water. This is like more around the

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:03.240
 the coast of uh of florida. So yeah homestead is

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:06.040
 Yeah

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:13.560
 You probably get there within 45 minutes. Oh wow. Okay, so if you stay in miami then south florida is definitely

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:19.320
 That's attractive. Yeah, and I don't even think it's that expensive. I think you can get like a pretty nice house big property

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:23.320
 Uh, there's like a lot of like it's an area where they're like starting to develop more like they're putting

00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:27.960
 Yeah, paper developments on there. Oh, yeah, it's pretty it's pretty sweet

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:32.920
 Interesting. You can have all kinds of fruit trees. Okay. I'll look into it. All right. I gotta get up here

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.400
 There's so much cloud prompting to do

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:40.680
 Somebody tokens more work than ever even with AI. Yeah, that's just how it goes

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.960
 Yeah, all right. All right. See you next
