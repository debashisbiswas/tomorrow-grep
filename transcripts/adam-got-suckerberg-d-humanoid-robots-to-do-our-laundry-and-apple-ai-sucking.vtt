WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
 -All he fucking did was change his shirt and add a chain.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.880
 And all of you fucking idiots were like, "Oh, he's so cool."

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.120
 -Listen, he did Jiu Jitsu, and I was a sucker.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.720
 I fell for the Jiu Jitsu.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.840
 -He sucker-burged you.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.200
 -He sucker-burged you.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.400
 -I don't know, did you consider maybe just paying attention to details?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.840
 I don't know.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.320
 You're like, "Here's all the ways that I screwed this up.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 I didn't look at my cable.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.360
 I didn't plug it in the right port.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.120
 I don't have that problem.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.480
 I looked at all the things, and I made sure I get the full possible bandwidth, even if

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.480
 I don't use it."

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.480
 -I said in the beginning, I knew when I set it up, I didn't do it right, because I had

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.480
 to do it well.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.080
 I remember I moved one house over, and it was not planned, and it was kind of so rushed.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.080
 -Oh, right, right, right.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.080
 It's okay.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.080
 We can't all be details people back.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.080
 It's fine.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.080
 It's fine.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.480
 I mean, to be fair, the difference in 1GB and 2.5GB, not a thing you'll notice, probably,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.480
 unless you really have some reason you want to use that full bandwidth.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.480
 You know what I mean?

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.520
 That reason showed up, which is why I, yeah.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.400
 When I set it up, I'm like, "Okay, I know my setup, I'm only getting 1GB on each device,"

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.800
 which is, theoretically, that doesn't mean you're not getting the value if the modem

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.880
 is set up correct, because you might have multiple devices downloading.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.280
 Realistically, you're not really going to have two devices doing 1GB, but it's possible.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.400
 But then I had a new need to be able to download things as fast as possible.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.720
 Many times per week, so...

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.640
 Oh, man.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.160
 If we ever get in trouble with the, I don't know, who legislates the movie watching?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.160
 Is it the Fed?

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.640
 The RIAA or something?

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.640
 I don't know.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.640
 Oh, that's actually a thing?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640
 I don't know.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.640
 I don't know.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.640
 Okay.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.640
 The Record Industry Association of America.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.640
 I guess that's just for music.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.640
 I don't know.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.000
 Like, rappers can just be like, "I shot a guy.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 He did."

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.360
 Like, if they can say that, why can't we say, "I streamed a movie in my house."

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.360
 That's fine.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.360
 I don't know.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.360
 Yeah, that's true.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.240
 I just find it funny to be secretive, but yeah, so I wanted to max everything out.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.240
 But I was surprised.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.840
 Like, it's just so easy to mess it up that every single person in America has an internet

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.840
 pretty much.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.840
 Yeah.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.360
 What percentage of them just have some kind of mess up situation, right?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.120
 Even the most basic thing of like, your internet speed being good, but then like, your Wi-Fi

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.760
 router being shitty, like, it's...

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.640
 Who will probably get a fraction of what they could have?

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.640
 And they have no idea.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.920
 I remember like, 10 years ago, when I cared a lot about like, my internet quality, just

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.040
 starting out, working from home, whatever, I can remember calling whoever it was, Century

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.600
 Link or whatever, and being like, "Hey, I pay for 100 Meg, and I'm getting like 12."

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.560
 And then being like, "How do you know?"

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.560
 Like, no one ever calls them and says that.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.560
 You know what I mean?

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.120
 And most people just take it for whatever, face value, like, they get their internet

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.120
 and they're fine.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.120
 Yeah.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.120
 But yeah, when you start actually carrying...

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.040
 I started carrying about on my local network, 10GIG, across a few devices.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.000
 So my network storage, and I have a Mac Mini as a server now, as I've mentioned, I really

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.320
 wanted to make sure that was getting the full, you know, 10GIG maximizing that.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.680
 Does a Mac Mini have 10G?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.680
 That the new one, right?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.680
 The new one has...

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.680
 No, this was just an M1.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.680
 This is the original...

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.680
 Oh, I'm serious.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.680
 Do you have a 10GIG on it?

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.680
 I did, yeah.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.800
 You could pay to get, like, an upgraded 10GIG, Nick.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.800
 And I did.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.800
 Yeah.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.120
 Speaking of that, I did upgrade, I did get a 10GIG switch, and I can't say the name of

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.480
 the brand, because, you know...

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.480
 Why?

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.480
 People might get offended.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.480
 Wait, what?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.480
 I'm mis...

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.640
 I'm forgetting the inside joke.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.400
 I was hoping that you would know what I'm talking about.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.640
 There's a brand that makes really nice 10GIG switches a minute, and their name is...

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.640
 It's kind of weird.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.640
 I don't know.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.720
 Their name is Nick Giga.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.320
 Wait, what is it?

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.200
 It's Nick Giga.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200
 N-I-C-G-I-G-A.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.200
 Really?

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.920
 It just looks really weird on a box.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.000
 It's probably what you said about it, not to explain it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.560
 I was so excited when Nick Giga was like, "I have to show you what I got."

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.960
 And then she was like, "Okay, here's how excited I was."

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.920
 And she was picking me up because we were going somewhere, so I literally brought the

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.720
 box into the car to show her, and she was like, "You're so stupid."

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.160
 You're such a silly boy.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
 That's so funny.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.160
 Exactly.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.040
 I say things like that, and there's probably like most of our podcast listeners have no

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.320
 idea about the silly boy thing, and I just sound stupid.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.320
 But there's like an...

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.480
 It's an inside joke, I guess.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.400
 Well, our inside joke should be the podcast inside jokes, and that one was Liz just said

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.760
 that Dax is a silly boy.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.760
 That's the short version.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.760
 There's a longer version.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.860
 Yeah, and a car full of all of you guys, and it really stuck.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.200
 Yeah, it really stuck.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.040
 So now, amongst the terminal crew, Dax is just silly boy.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.040
 But so yeah, I have this 10 gig setup now, obviously the modem is only outputting 2.5,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:42.280
 and I don't actually have any 10 gig devices or all 2.5, but which is good enough for me

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.280
 for now.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.280
 It's good.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.560
 There's two reasons to need 10 gig, which is mostly just the Mac mini reading large

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.640
 files of the network storage.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.960
 I think I was using SMB or whatever it is, like the...

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.960
 I'm using NFS.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.520
 And I am too.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.520
 There you go.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:08.040
 Because chat GPT or something told me like we could configure to get more of the bandwidth

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.040
 out of...

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.040
 Yeah.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.040
 Out of that NFS.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.040
 Anyway.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:18.720
 Yeah, so I needed the 10 gig bandwidth for that Mac mini to read storage fast enough.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.520
 And I went down that rabbit hole, a different one, but similar.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.640
 I actually feel really good because the first time in my life, ever I recycled a device.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.640
 Like to apples?

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.640
 No, not to apple.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.840
 And so just it's sitting in my closet.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.600
 I found a new purpose for it.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.600
 Oh, nice.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:42.000
 My previous laptop I had before this MacBook is not my favorite.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.440
 My server, my home server.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.360
 And laptops make great home servers just because they're so like self-contained.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.360
 Like it just...

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.960
 I mean, it's similar to the Mac mini, I guess.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.800
 And I plugged in a hard drive directly to it.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.800
 So it's now my...

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.800
 Like NAS.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800
 A USB?

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800
 Like an external?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.800
 It's a...

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.120
 It's a thunderbolt enclosure for it.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.120
 Okay.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.120
 But it's just a normal heart.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.640
 So eventually if I upgrade to a NAS, I can just put the hard drive into a NAS.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.440
 But right now it is... like the laptop is both the NAS and also the server.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.760
 So I don't need to read over network.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.880
 So it's like access in the files locally.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.880
 Yeah.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.880
 Right.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.880
 Right.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880
 Right.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.880
 The performance has been great.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.880
 Like it's been great.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.880
 It's solved all of my issues.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.960
 It's crazy that I can like scrub like a video and like jump to a point and it actually just

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.960
 like loads immediately.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.400
 Like it just hasn't been a thing that I've had for a while.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.400
 Mine was all local originally, like I didn't go from remote to local.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.920
 But I had issues with performance and I didn't realize how sluggish it was until I moved

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.920
 to the Mac Mini.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:49.000
 I was using the NAS as the Plex server, which would be great in terms of the bandwidth to

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.080
 disk or the latency to disk, I guess, reading files.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.240
 But it was not great not being 10 gig over the network or something.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.360
 There was something about that setup that was not working.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.360
 Yeah.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.040
 And there's another detail where Intel has something called Intel CPUs has something called

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.760
 quick sync, which is a hardware accelerated video stuff.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.960
 And this laptop happened to have it and it's really good.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.600
 Like it's it makes a noticeable difference.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.960
 Not that I'm transcoding that often, but I think it even makes a difference just with

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.960
 any kind of video decoding.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.960
 Yeah.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.960
 Big upgrade.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:30.160
 We've been enjoying and getting full use out of our OLED 4K TV and also our projector.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.160
 Yeah.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.160
 Great.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:38.760
 And the home media fun stuff, you'd mention this giga, giga, Nick, Nick, Nick, giga.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.760
 Nick, giga.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:45.080
 Did you hear that like TP link routers, sorry, I should never try and say it again, TP link

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.000
 routers might be banned in the US.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.200
 There's just a ton of Chinese stuff, TikTok, uh, TP link, DJI like drones.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.680
 I just heard a thing.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.480
 Just heard a podcast talking about DJI DJI DJI DJI DJI.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.480
 Did I say G?

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.480
 Yeah.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.080
 G.A. is director's skill of America, which is where our I think you combine the two.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.080
 Wait, what?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.080
 Oh, director's good.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.080
 Yeah.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.080
 That's where our event was.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.080
 Yeah.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.080
 I forgot that's where the event was.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.080
 I was like, how do you know?

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.080
 Yeah, the drone thing is crazy.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.680
 I think, um, I think the next company I start is going to be in that space.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.680
 I'm sorry.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.680
 What?

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.680
 You're going to make a drone company?

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.680
 Not exactly.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.800
 I'm going to do something a lot more boring.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.760
 I think drones are super important and will continue to be really, really important to

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:33.080
 be able to manufacture them almost all the manufacturing of them is really only in China.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:38.160
 Even if you want to manufacture them here, they are components that drones need that

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.400
 are manufactured in China.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.400
 Yeah.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.840
 So I want to see if I can identify one critical component and move it over here.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.920
 Like, I, like, I think I want to pair, I want to try to buy like all, there's a bunch of

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.600
 manufacturing businesses in America that are run by like someone in their 50s and 60s that

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.320
 are going to try to want to retire in the next 10 years.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.320
 Yep.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:07.320
 I want to see if I can buy one of those and then repurpose it to manufacture drone parts.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.320
 That's my next business.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.200
 So this sounds, sounds hard as a software person.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:19.600
 This is all the things that I fear about a business, but it sounds like a good one in

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.600
 light of what I just heard.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.520
 Have you heard this stuff about DJI?

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.880
 Like how much market share they have in the U.S. and that like American companies just

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.680
 suck compared to them?

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.440
 If they do ban them, then like drone is just, drone tech in America is just going to get

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.960
 set back several years and all these companies in the U.S. will have to sprout up and start

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.200
 actually making drones.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.200
 Yeah.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.600
 So I think you're, if you do it now, you're maybe good timing.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.600
 How do you do that?

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.640
 I don't know if you can do it now, but it probably takes a prep.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.640
 Yeah.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.640
 It doesn't have to do it.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.640
 I don't know.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.640
 I've done a lot of things that I just didn't have to do.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.800
 I'm just kind of saying you go try to learn it and eventually figure it out, but with

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.440
 this kind of thing, it would be, you just raise a bunch of money up front and then spend

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.160
 the time trying to acquire the right business and then to people.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.160
 Right.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.160
 Capital intensive.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.160
 Yeah.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.160
 Okay.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.160
 Yeah.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.120
 Can I work at your drone manufacturing, drone part manufacturing company?

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.080
 Maybe if, you know, the location is some place in the Ozarks.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.080
 Okay.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.080
 Yeah.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.080
 Do you want to make a website?

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:24.440
 Like the factory line or something, I want to be like a, I want to be a, the same thing

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.680
 I am now, but just for your drone part company, I don't know the idea here is like you could

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.640
 probably push automation to a crazy degree over time and I'm trying to figure out what

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.080
 that means and what that could look like would be the goal of the company.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.120
 And if you can figure that out, then you do another part and then another part and then

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.120
 another part.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.840
 And maybe that eventually just make the whole drone.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.840
 Yeah.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.240
 Just anything, like any kind of like manufacturing capability means you can make a lot of kinds

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.240
 of things.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.200
 So I'm kind of very interested in that.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.200
 Okay.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:59.460
 So that's a great topic that I have thoughts on like you're saying like a factory with

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:04.640
 a bunch of machines that are like automating the creation of certain parts.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.960
 Is that what you mean when you say automation?

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.960
 Yes.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.960
 How can you make it really efficiently?

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.840
 And I will say like I think people consistently confuse this detail.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.840
 And it has most of the manufacturing capability like most stuff is manufactured in China.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.440
 That is different than manufacturing efficiency.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.960
 If America were to make the exact same stuff, we generally do it more efficiently like with

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.760
 fewer labor inputs.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.760
 Right.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.080
 So I just want to play deeper into that too, right?

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.200
 In America, stuff made in America, there's a lot of reasons for that.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:43.960
 It could be expensive because our economy has better opportunities or that stuff that

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.960
 the resources that it's required.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.200
 You make products and you need components and those components are more expensive in

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.200
 America.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.720
 You don't care why you're still going to buy them somewhere else.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.720
 Yeah.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.720
 I know.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.800
 But the thing with drones is it's likely going to have a military continue to have a big

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.800
 military use.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:05.800
 I'm sure the US government is going to eventually if not, they're already doing stockpile drones

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.920
 using those components from China is not a good idea.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.920
 No.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.920
 Right.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.920
 National security risk.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.920
 That's what I heard on the podcast.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:19.080
 So you have like a, you have a floor of demand that is kind of always going to be domestic.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.080
 Yeah.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.800
 So we jumped off of where I was headed, which was like, I think of like, when I remember

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.640
 when Tesla, when they were really trying to automate and like scale and they were doing

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.640
 all the stuff with robots in the factories and it didn't go well, like they ended up.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.640
 What do you mean?

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.640
 It didn't go well.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.280
 Well, like they had all these growing pains where like they tried to automate stuff they

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.560
 shouldn't have and it turned out humans were better at those tasks and they ended up ripping

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.060
 out a bunch of machines that were really expensive.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.560
 Do you remember this?

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.040
 Maybe I followed the story more closely.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.000
 I do remember there was a bunch of growing pains, like four years ago, or four or five.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.920
 I remember like a bunch of, there was a bunch of things, but like you're saying they figured

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.520
 it out and they ended up in the same place where they're very automated.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.520
 Yeah.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.880
 Some processes where you like are going to do it wrong a bunch and maybe like you went

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.760
 on the right place, but just kind of pushing how I'm sure they're more and more efficient

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.760
 every single day.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.760
 Yeah.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.200
 To the point where I've seen the, I don't know if you've seen the Chinese factory, like

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:21.360
 the, I think it was BYD, it's like the Chinese Tesla, the inside of their factory looks identical

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.360
 to Tesla.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.360
 It's like really.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.360
 Oh, really?

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.360
 Yeah.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.480
 So, okay, this is still haven't gotten where I was trying to head.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.480
 Yeah.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.160
 So, maybe two more leaps here before we get there.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.160
 Okay.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.320
 You've seen these factories where it's these hyper specific machines creating parts and

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.880
 it's this well-oiled machine, but like if they change the product, then they have to

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.760
 like rebuild the factory or whatever.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.960
 Well, I'm hearing all this stuff about the humanoid robots and advancing so much faster.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.640
 I think you tweeted something about NVIDIA, which I don't know what they did.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.640
 I'd like to hear from you.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.640
 Like what are they doing with robots?

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.640
 Oh, man.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.640
 Yeah.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.960
 Okay, it seems like we're on the cusp of like a bunch of human robots walking around,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.800
 human-weight, human-shaped.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.360
 And I wonder like could factories just be a bunch of robots that are human-shaped doing

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.840
 the things in a much more flexible way than like these hyper specific machines?

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.440
 Like is that the future of factories is just a bunch of factory workers that they're robots?

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:20.800
 I think sort of like obviously the goal is to get to a machine that is very general purpose.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.000
 For a factory, it's probably not going to be a humanoid one.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.260
 I think the humanoid ones are more around getting them into normal society where everything

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.260
 is built for humans.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.260
 I want one in my home.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.260
 And shit.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.260
 Yeah.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.260
 You want one in your home?

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.260
 Oh, hell yeah.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.260
 Are you serious?

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.560
 I seem to talk about this like every week.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.720
 We want a human robot.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.320
 I want a robot that will do all of the things that we have to do every day.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.320
 So bad.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.600
 So they're a human robot makes sense because your house is structured for a human.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.560
 You have like stairs and things like that.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.480
 So if it can move like a human, it could do everything.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.920
 But I think in a factory, it's more it's probably, I'm sure there's probably some use

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.920
 case for that.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:02.800
 But what I've seen is more like like a single arm that is very programmable and trainable

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.200
 that can do like all kinds of stuff.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.000
 It's not like it doesn't need to be able to, you know, walk around it can still be stationary.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.240
 I don't know for the cusp of that.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.840
 I think there's been this weird, you know how like every industry has like this almost

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.560
 like a benchmark that people are trying to like get to.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.800
 I think recruiting the human gate has been this seemingly simple thing because like,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.760
 you know, we know how humans walk, like animators can draw a human walking.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.600
 But it's been this weirdly elusive thing where it's been hard to make a robot that really

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.600
 matches a human gate.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:37.080
 So that's been like a thing that's constantly pushed.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.360
 So I think we tend to see like a lot of demos around them walking around, just because it's

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.760
 like a challenging thing.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.800
 And if you can get figured that out, there's probably a lot of other locations there as

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.800
 well.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.800
 And somebody figured it out, right?

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.800
 A Chinese company.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.240
 I did see that video of that Chinese company that was probably was the best.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.480
 I don't think it was fake.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.960
 There's been a bunch of stuff that I've seen people post that are 100% fake even like like

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.160
 biology posted one like a year ago.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.160
 That was like 100% fake.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.080
 And he thought it was real.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.080
 I don't know if this one's fake.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.000
 I didn't really look that hard at it.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.880
 But yeah, it did look really like if that was real, it was walking around in a way that

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.880
 was very convincing.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:22.560
 Why do we need them to look like humans when they walk is if they could just do all the

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.560
 things that humans do.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.600
 I don't care if they look goofy, right?

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.600
 It's not about how they look.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.400
 It's like if they look correct, that means they're walking the same way a human walks,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.600
 which means which is better for something like over the human over the same things.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.600
 Yeah.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.600
 Yeah.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.600
 Okay.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.600
 Yeah, it does seem like this has been a long time coming.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.480
 I mean, is it DJI?

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.480
 Who is the company?

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.480
 No, DJI.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.480
 DJI.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.480
 It's not.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.480
 DJI.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.480
 Yeah.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.480
 No.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.480
 Robot it.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.200
 What's the name of that company that makes the dog and I lost in dynamics.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.200
 Lost in dynamics.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.200
 I was not close.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.200
 I was way off.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.200
 Yeah.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.360
 It feels like they've been doing stuff for like 10 years, but like, where are those robots?

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.360
 Yeah.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.360
 The robots doing backflakes in parkour.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.360
 Is it actually sold?

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.360
 Yeah.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.360
 They ever sold one of those robots to an actual company doing actual things.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.360
 I'm sure they have.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.760
 Didn't let Google own them at one point and the Google sold them.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.200
 So it's been like a weird journey for that company.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.600
 I think Google owned them at one point.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.600
 So you're saying we're not close.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.440
 I feel like there's so many companies working on humanoid robots.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.280
 That makes me think we're close, but we're not close.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.760
 I can't buy one, Santa.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.320
 I don't know for that close, but let me tell you what Nvidia has built and I think this

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:30.440
 is like one of the coolest things I've ever seen because it combines so many seemingly

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:36.160
 unrelated technologies into the perfect product in a way that like no other company in the

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.720
 world could even come close to doing.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.560
 And it's like, I was saying the other day, we're always like, oh, this business.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.560
 What's their moat?

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.880
 And it's always something stupid like our front end has doesn't use react.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:55.040
 It's just like a dumb, like it's always like a little, like such a small thing.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.560
 And then when you think about Nvidia and you ask, was there a moat for situation?

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.800
 It is like a massive one.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.960
 So basically at CES, they announced again, I don't know if this product's actually good.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.520
 I'm not an expert in the space.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:12.160
 Like it might end up being stupid, but it was presented in a very compelling way, which

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.080
 is they're like, okay, we know all of you are working on robots.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.960
 Home robots, factory robots, self driving cars, they're technically robots.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.960
 Yeah.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:28.000
 We're going to build you the product you're going to use to like develop this technology

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.560
 no matter who you are.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:36.000
 So they have this thing where they had a virtual world, which of course, their history of gaming,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 they know how to do.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.840
 So you can go into VR or whatever and control a virtual model of your robot.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.840
 Okay.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.840
 Okay.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.800
 So you can control it using motion capture, picking up objects, putting it down, doing

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.520
 a very specific task in this simulated world where the robot moves away, it would move

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:03.520
 where the items move around how real world physics, you know, and it'll record everything

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.600
 you do, right, like data.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:13.800
 Then it'll use their, just all this generative AI technology to create a thousand X amount

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:19.600
 of the data as you recorded, it'll generate variations of it exactly synthetic data.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.600
 Okay.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:25.960
 Again, running on Nvidia GPUs in their cloud all cloud powered.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:31.480
 Then they're going to take that and they're going to upscale it to be photorealistic.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.240
 So it's like, it looks like raw video footage.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.040
 So again, I missed a step.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.000
 So they have a bunch of motion tracking data in this virtual world.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 That's like lo-fi.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.680
 It's like, you know, and then they're going to upscale it to be when you said photorealistic,

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.760
 I'm still imagining like a mesh, like a geometry.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.240
 But what do you mean by photorealistic?

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.560
 Like it's, I mean, this, let's say you're like in this virtual factory and you're doing

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.560
 this stuff.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.560
 Yeah.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.920
 It's not like it's not like somebody spent time to like make everything in a factory look

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.120
 hyper realistic.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.520
 It's just like, you know, rough shapes of what things look like.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.520
 Okay.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.520
 They're accurate.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.800
 But not don't, like if a human looked at a video of it, it wouldn't be like, oh, this

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.800
 is real.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.800
 Yeah.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.800
 Okay.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.880
 So they're going to take that and they have had this upscaling technology and all of their

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:24.840
 gaming GPUs for a while where, you know, the GPU renders a shittier thing and then it upscales

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.600
 a frame to be like 4k and like nicer.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.600
 Okay.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.600
 Realistic.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:35.480
 Taking that technology onto the synthetic data to create a bunch of like really much

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.640
 more realistic video footage of these scenarios.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.640
 Okay.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.360
 Of your product in a virtual space.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.360
 Okay.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.320
 And like doing the thing with the motion data, all that stuff, then they're going to feed

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:53.200
 that into the training model also part of my video GPUs to train the actual AI model

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.680
 that's going to run on the robot.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:59.920
 So it's going to feed it the video that it would see when it's actually running, but

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.920
 it's like fake, right?

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:07.760
 It was all generated to train the model along with like all other motion data to spit out

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:13.840
 like a model that you can run on a real robot that could do all of those things.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.600
 And this whole pipeline doesn't require anything physical.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.600
 It's all software.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.360
 You do it all in software.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.520
 Well, okay, I am definitely missing some stuff here.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:30.360
 So the process doesn't start with you physically manipulating objects and doing motion capture

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.360
 on that.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.360
 Sorry.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.360
 Yes.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.360
 It does.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.360
 It does.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.360
 It does require it.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.160
 So my physical, I mean, it doesn't involve you physically using the end device or having

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.200
 the end device do anything.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.520
 But like the idea is that video footage just being created is not for you to preview your

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.080
 product in a virtual space.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.160
 It's the video footage that the product will see because it's your building or robot that

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.160
 has a camera.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.160
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.040
 And it's the stuff and it's doing stuff.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.880
 So if you're like a eye robot, is that no, that's not that's not that's a company company

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.880
 company by Amazon.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.880
 Wait, what?

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.880
 Is that a movie?

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.880
 It is a movie.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.200
 But the company, the company makes Roomba is also called that robot, I think.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.440
 The company and the movie are the same.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.520
 Oh, I didn't even, that didn't occur to me.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.760
 It's like Will Smith, right?

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.760
 I wrote it.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.760
 Yeah.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.760
 Anyway.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.840
 So if you're making Roomba vacuums, you would use this to like program so that the Roomba

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.440
 though, when it sees something, it's smarter about how it acts.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.440
 Yeah.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.440
 Yeah.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.440
 So this one wouldn't even need anything physical.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.840
 You would just have this virtual world and you can put obstacles and do all this kind

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.840
 of stuff.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.840
 And then.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.840
 Yeah.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.720
 So anybody that knows 3D software could build like a setting, like an environment, you want

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.560
 to build a conquer 3D software is like, I think the bar is even lower than that.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.040
 I think it's meant to be much more accessible than that.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.040
 Yeah.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040
 Yeah.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.200
 But then you'd have to have like a 3D version of your product or what?

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200
 Yes.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.240
 So anyone making anyone building these things already has that.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.240
 It's like cadro.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.240
 Yeah.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.240
 Because they have to manufacture it.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240
 Okay.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.240
 Interesting.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.240
 Interesting.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.240
 It's all coming together.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.320
 They plop that and then you can create all these scenarios, train in this fake world and

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.280
 then generate what the camera would have seen interesting.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.360
 But that means, okay.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.240
 So let's play out the iRobot scenario there.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.480
 You want to put pets in your little virtual environment.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:21.000
 So you drop a little cat model that you got off of 3dmodels.net or whatever.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.280
 And you're telling me Nvidia software is going to take that cat model and turn it into

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.440
 photorealistic video of a cat.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.440
 Yep.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.440
 How the fuck?

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.440
 What?

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.640
 Well, we've already seen this with a video generation, right?

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.600
 But what if it's a really shitty 3D model?

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.600
 It's not starting.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.600
 Okay.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.960
 So right now you can start from nothing and tell an AI model generate me a video of a

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.960
 cat.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.960
 And it can do like an okay.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.960
 Okay.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:51.040
 Starting off of a model and upscaling it is like a much easier task.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.200
 And they've already been doing this for years.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:56.280
 I don't know if you, I guess you have been out of the gaming world, but like GPUs, Nvidia

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:01.840
 GPUs for a while, the progress in them, most of what they show off isn't raw power.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:08.080
 It's all about this trick that they do where they generate the image from AI.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:13.040
 Like what you're looking at isn't like literally what the game told it to render.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.040
 Okay.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:19.080
 So this is the thing that they've been doing for a while where like they take like a shittier

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.160
 input and they get look a lot better.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.160
 Okay.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:28.320
 But like there's still there's something missing here for me because like I want to feed photorealistic

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:34.080
 video to my robots and train it to behave certain way around cats.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.080
 Okay.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:40.880
 What if like that requires I put something at least resembling a cat into the environment

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.320
 for it to up scale, right?

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.700
 Yeah, but, but this virtual world they have, this is like a whole platform they're building.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:52.360
 So again, I don't know if they handled the we have a drop in cat that walks around the

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:57.760
 axe like a cat, but you can see how that's actually not that hard because again, they

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.120
 have decades of building virtual worlds.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.120
 Yeah.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.120
 Okay.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.120
 Like NPCs and all this.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.200
 So this is like a company that knows all of that.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.200
 Yeah.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.200
 Yeah.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.200
 Okay.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.920
 So more around like manufacturing use cases about like teaching it how to like navigate

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:18.400
 in a factory floor and like operate on certain items and move things around.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.400
 So okay.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.400
 So when do I get my robot?

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.280
 Because I really got a lot of laundry.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.480
 We got two boys.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.400
 There are a lot of words.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:31.400
 I need a humanoid robot walking around, beep up and doing whatever we ask it to without

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.400
 saying a word.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.400
 It's going to be amazing.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.200
 I'd pay so much money for one of those right now.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200
 Okay.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.400
 This has a theory which I think is correct.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.640
 All these companies make what you said, a humanoid looking robot.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.640
 You're a weird person.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.920
 So I'm going to discard your opinion.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.920
 Ouch.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:55.000
 Most people that think of this being in their house, they find it from like a gut perspective,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.640
 really creepy because it looks way too much like a person, but it's not really, there's

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.160
 a scary energy around it.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.160
 Sure.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.800
 Like they just got to hire Disney and just have them make a fun robot.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.800
 And they've already done this.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:15.400
 If you look at, if you, I'll try to find the video later, but they've showed these robots

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.200
 that they built that move according to like Disney animation principles.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.200
 So they're like cute.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.960
 And they like bounce around and they do all these like Disney type motions way more likely

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.560
 that that is going to be the type of thing that actually gets mass appeal.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.560
 Yeah.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.240
 I want like C3PO walking around my house doing my laundry.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.240
 C3PO just looks like a person.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.240
 That's it.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.480
 Yeah, but like it wouldn't be creepy because it's like, oh, it's the Star Wars robot.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.480
 I live in the future.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.480
 I live in the future.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.480
 If it's literally C3PO.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.480
 Yeah.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.480
 It literally looks like C3PO.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.480
 It's funny.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:51.240
 I get the fear and I will say if you think about like anytime people talk about AI safety

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:56.560
 and they're like, we got to make sure that the AI doesn't, whatever, we had to put safeguards

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.040
 because it could just like once it's smarter than us, it could do whatever to us.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.520
 And I always just think like, just don't let it do something to us.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.320
 Like if it's not physical, it's just digital, I guess it could like wreck our banking systems.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.160
 I could do all this havoc digitally, but I've never been afraid of AI because it's like,

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.160
 it's not physical.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.720
 What can it do to me?

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.160
 Then you think about robots and it's like, I really want a robot in my house.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.120
 Like, Adam, genuinely want a robot in my house and it's like, oh, this is how the AI could

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.120
 do something to me.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.120
 Okay.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.120
 So here's a crazier thing.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.560
 Realistically, V1 of these robots won't be fully automated.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.000
 They'll be remote controlled.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Okay.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.400
 So this is now a little bit creepy.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.400
 Who?

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.400
 Wait, what?

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.280
 By like a worker and it's like a remote worker, but for your house.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.280
 No.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.280
 What?

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.120
 I mean, a bunch of the demos you saw, like the Tesla robots doing the pretending stuff

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.280
 that was like remote control.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:50.280
 So if I bought like a $30,000 humanoid robot making up numbers, I would be also buying

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.160
 this person's time to control it around my house when I asked it to do stuff.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.160
 Yeah.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.800
 And if you think about it, like, okay, if you ignore any gut reaction to it, this is actually

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.800
 totally fine.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.320
 It's like a pretty good system.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.840
 You don't need to have a complex AI model.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:05.840
 Yeah.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.740
 You just need the physical machinery to be able to do the laundry and someone remotely

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.880
 can like, can control it.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.880
 Sure.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:18.200
 But again, really creepy to have a random person that you've never met in your house,

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.040
 potentially many people on different shifts.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.040
 Yeah.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.400
 It's like inviting an Uber driver in.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.240
 It's basically that like, like having an Uber driver just live with you.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.680
 Some random Uber driver, because you're putting your life in the Uber driver's hand.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.240
 It's like similar, but here's what really gets me.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.720
 This would be the first time in history, I would say, where there's like, you're physically

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:44.600
 in the presence of another person, but there's an asymmetric, like violence risk where they

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.040
 can try to hurt you with zero risk to themselves.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:53.000
 Oh, and I feel like fundamentally, that's not, even if the robot is slow, even if it

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.600
 whatever, like this just is a bad system is anywhere else is someone's in front of you.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.840
 They at least have to worry about their own, like harm coming to themselves.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:02.840
 Yeah.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.840
 Sure.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:10.400
 Second book of three body problem, the restaurant waitress stabbing situation.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.400
 Right.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.400
 Right.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.400
 Yeah.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.400
 Exactly.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.400
 Yeah.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.240
 I'm not letting a remote controlled robot in my home, not happening.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.560
 I want it to be fully AI.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.920
 But how else do we get the training data, right?

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.160
 It would be with this NVIDIA.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.160
 Wow.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.160
 I don't know.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.160
 What is any training data?

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.440
 It's really smart, and then like, they'll be smarter than humans at some point and then

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.840
 let them in our homes and they can do whatever, like, I don't know, this doesn't seem hard.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.360
 If LGBT can do all the crazy stuff it can do, like put all that in a robot and let it

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.360
 go.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.360
 Let it figure it out.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.680
 Tell it how to move and like, here's the buttons for moving your arms.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.680
 It'll figure it out.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.680
 I don't know.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.680
 It seems easy.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.880
 So easy to me.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.360
 At that point, what's the purpose of you existing?

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.440
 Well, I want to just enjoy life and I want the robots to do all the tedium.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.720
 Well, it's not really about the superior life form, so I shouldn't waste its time doing

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.720
 your laundry.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.160
 You sound like AI was a point of you existing.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.640
 That's what they're going to say someday.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.640
 What is the point of you existing?

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.640
 Exactly.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.640
 Right before they terminate us.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.640
 Oh, man.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.040
 Hopefully this podcast is not in their training set.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.040
 Yeah.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.040
 I'm kidding.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.840
 Do you ever, I hear so many people say like that they're nice to chat GBT just in case.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.960
 Like do you, do you feel that nice?

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.960
 I'm really not nice.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.600
 It pisses me off so much sometimes.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.880
 I'm just like, shut the fuck up.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:34.160
 Stop giving me a full react application when I'm just asking you for an FFmpeg command.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.160
 Honestly, what is the deal with the react bias?

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.080
 It is amazing how much it will spit out react at you.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.520
 If you don't tell it exactly what technology to use, but like it's not even that.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.520
 Okay.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:51.440
 Like if I'm asking for like, how do I make a button I can click and it spits out react.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.440
 Okay.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:58.960
 That's annoying, but I get why that happens when I say, Hey, how do I use FFmpeg to do

00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.960
 this?

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.400
 And then it builds me a react.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.400
 Why?

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.840
 Where I can upload a video file to then get it converted.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.960
 Like why is it doing that?

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.960
 Why?

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.960
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.720
 I guess just like there's an overwhelming amount of GitHub is react apps, I guess.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.720
 Yeah.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.720
 Yeah.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.720
 And it's trained on all that.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.720
 That's crazy.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.720
 I watched it on this.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.720
 I watched this morning.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.600
 I watched it as well.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.600
 Yeah.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.600
 Can I be honest?

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.600
 I'm going to have to listen to podcasts.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.600
 I love you teach.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.600
 This is not a criticism.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.560
 I couldn't tell if he's memeing.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.480
 I couldn't tell the tone of his voice in the video the whole time.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.520
 I just couldn't tell if he's like a whole elaborate troll, like he just wanted you to

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:42.080
 watch a 13 minute video just to troll you, but like everything he's saying is like makes

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.080
 perfect sense.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.680
 I didn't see you expected.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.400
 That's what you expect from him.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.880
 He's just so funny all the time.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:51.360
 He's always joking that it's hard when he's like, I can't tell.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.240
 It just felt like the tone of his voice like was a big troll, but all the content of it

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.240
 made so much sense.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.240
 That's funny.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.240
 You're waiting for the punchline.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.520
 There were a few jokes in there for sure.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.520
 Yeah.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.520
 Yeah.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.080
 Would you would you summarize the video for the audience?

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.080
 Yeah.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.640
 I mean, this is the thing I've been thinking about for a while, especially building a dev

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.640
 tool.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.880
 His point was if you ask an L M how to do something, it's just going to reflect whatever current

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.880
 thing is popular.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.960
 So if you're like, how do I make a UI where I can do this?

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:23.440
 It's going to build you a react app, which just kind of reinforces whatever is currently

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.240
 popular and like puts them even further ahead.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.880
 And so the flavor I was thinking about is not exactly that.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:34.880
 I think about it this other way where he was describing it as you don't know, you're not

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.880
 even trying to evaluate.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.960
 You're trying to get something done, and it's basically doing the evaluation of technologies

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.960
 for you.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.520
 And the point was it's like going to lead to a bad place.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.340
 There's another case where you are evaluating technology.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:52.800
 You're like, how should I do CSS and you're picking between tailwind or something else.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.600
 But tailwind has this crazy upside of the training set is massive.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:02.040
 And your L M experience while using tailwind is going to be 1000 X better than anything

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.040
 else.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.600
 So even if something new emerges, that's better.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.440
 It has to compete with the fact that it's not in the training set.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.680
 And that is like an insurmountable thing.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.880
 So even someone trying to pick between these two options, they're more likely to pick the

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.840
 one that the L M is good at.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.240
 So just kind of calcifies everything makes competition worse.

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.240
 Makes sense.

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.960
 So yeah, it's like, it's not a great situation.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.680
 I think about this because SST is in the training set and Pulumi is in the training set.

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:34.020
 So at this point, nobody new can really show up because like you're not doing logic in

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:38.400
 SST, you're just, it's just config, which L M's are fantastic for.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:42.800
 So if you're not already in there, you're kind of, it's kind of done at this point.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.800
 There's not going to be a new thing.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.800
 Yeah.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.800
 So what's the solution?

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.800
 Or is there one?

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.800
 I don't know.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.120
 It's just an observation that this is what's going to happen.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:56.160
 And yeah, like whatever, yeah, just this thing, like big thing, just get bigger.

00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:00.560
 And this is just like another, I guess that's kind of a property of the world as it is,

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.560
 right?

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.560
 This just exacerbates it.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.560
 Yeah.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.560
 Big things get bigger.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:10.660
 I think as a society, like need to one allow for things to get big, but then also recognize

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:15.200
 when they're like throttling competition and make it so they can get destroyed.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.400
 It's just hard to bounce all that.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.200
 It reminds me in the dev scenario, it reminds me of like LSPs.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.520
 It's like TypeScript gets a lot of momentum because I was a good language server.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.960
 It's almost like companies that if you come out with a new framework or a new language

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:34.520
 or whatever, you're going to have like ship your own like LLM workflow, like, yeah, it's

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.360
 like that's going to be part of the dev tooling expectation.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.640
 It's like, I want to be able to build this easily with an LLM telling me exactly what

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.640
 to do or generating much code.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:47.160
 So you have to like deliver that because you can't get it from the off the shelf ones.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.560
 It's too new and niche.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.560
 Yeah.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.960
 And it's and like there are solutions for that today, but then then you have the secondary

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.720
 problem of, well, you need to deliver it in a place that isn't open.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.800
 Like you need to deliver it in my chat, GPT experience, but like it's kind of hard to

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.800
 do that.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.160
 And it'll kind of annoying to like, you can install like a plug in and it's just like

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:13.080
 not what you're going to do, but it's not not great for you're trying to make a new framework.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.080
 Just give up.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.040
 Well, I actually am trying to make a new framework.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.040
 So that's true.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.040
 Goodness.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.040
 Yeah.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.040
 Yes.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.040
 What?

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.040
 Chat GPT is never going to spit out your framework.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.040
 It's true.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.040
 It's not.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.520
 I'm making a JavaScript framework just so the podcast knows I said it on Twitter, but that's

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.760
 not one to one with podcast listeners.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.760
 I'm making a JavaScript framework and ironically it is, well, maybe ironically, I don't know.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.800
 I don't know how to frame it.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.080
 No, it's a genuinely good framework.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.080
 It's a great.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.920
 It is the actually the in a lot of ways it's not competing with anything.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:49.880
 It's the only option for this type of thing, so it's so true.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.880
 Yeah.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.560
 I really don't know of any, any apps running in this environment.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.760
 Do you know of any, is this the first?

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.760
 I think so.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.520
 I've only seen much more.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.760
 I've seen cool stuff here, but nothing this cool.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.760
 Like it's just.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.760
 Yeah.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.960
 So you'll probably want to use my framework.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.760
 You will want to use my framework if you're building an app for this particular context.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.760
 Yeah.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.760
 I'll say.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:17.480
 The one thing that I say mitigate this a little bit is even, let's say, take something like

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.640
 Next.js, which LMS know very well.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:27.080
 And they also have a problem with this because Next.js, whatever version number is very different

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.660
 than some other version number.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.660
 So they're kind of competing against.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.320
 I love that you don't know the version numbers.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.320
 Yeah.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.160
 They're kind of competing against their, their selves because the LMS may be returning the

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.160
 wrong thing.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:41.440
 So there is some pressure on the LMS to like incorporate new stuff.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.440
 Yeah.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.440
 Yeah.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.560
 I do feel like it's a little impromptu that needs to be solved.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:51.880
 If it's going to be useful for developers, which they are, and there's companies just

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:56.160
 with that pitch, like making their LLM very specifically good for developers.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.720
 This is like an inherent problem they have to solve, right?

00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.720
 Yeah, I agree.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.800
 But like, and TJ is another good thing he brought up, but it's a compared to SEO, which

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:10.560
 is a great thing to look at because you can see how that product degraded over time.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:15.200
 Search is now pretty bad just because there's so many, so much incentive to optimize the

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.200
 hell out of it.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.200
 Yeah.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.640
 Like billions and billions and billions of dollars of incentive and the results are

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.640
 getting worse.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.640
 A great example.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:26.560
 He said like a, that being game like the top 10 of Google responses.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:30.200
 I have to tell you about something I learned recently, which has been blowing my mind.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.200
 Okay.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.440
 Liz has been consulting at this company by, like I'd say this without specifics.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.600
 She's been consulting at this company.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:45.160
 They're a B2C product, they're a product that they sell to customers.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:55.560
 They are listed on this Forbes article saying the top X products in their category.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:01.680
 They're going to pay them $15 million in 2025 for that Forbes.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.680
 Yeah.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.680
 What?

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:11.360
 For that spot for one article because it generates so much traffic and they're like, their customer

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.960
 value is very high.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.960
 Yeah.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:20.080
 But like those lists are just who paid to be on the list in some ways is bad, but in some

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.360
 ways it also kind of makes sense.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.200
 So, so Forbes has his property, right?

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.200
 They're generating.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:30.240
 So they're even buying ads just for that article, like they have this value here.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.360
 So they are, they show up on Google and a lot of their traffic comes through Google ads,

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.360
 whatever.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.080
 Well, this category and people end up on this page.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.520
 They have 10 slots.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.400
 The top three slots basically make all the, all the money.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:50.040
 They will rotate who is in the top spot based off of which company performs the best because

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:55.320
 Forbes only gets paid when someone buys the end product, right?

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:59.760
 So if the companies are bad, people are not going to buy the end product and Forbes is

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.280
 going to get less money.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.280
 Okay.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:07.560
 So you only get those top slots if you convert, if your product converts really well and then

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.800
 you pay them every time for conversion.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:16.320
 So it's still not a good system, but it's not like totally like, oh, yeah, anyone can

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.880
 just buy a spot with a shitty product.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.880
 Sure.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:20.880
 Yeah.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.880
 But yeah, is this wild?

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:28.320
 So this one article probably makes like, I don't know, like 30, $40 million a year, a

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.320
 single article.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.320
 Yeah.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.360
 And it's all downstream of Google and this makes you realize like, no wonder Google makes

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.360
 so much money.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:39.480
 This is like, like a tiny business inside of the Google machine.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:44.760
 In a lot of ways, like it's like, signal is more, this is a, it's almost like a parasite

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:50.160
 because Google is failing to capture this money, like Forbes is capturing it, but Google owns

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.160
 a traffic.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.600
 They're the one that generate that traffic.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.400
 And technically Forbes is making Google search results worse because they're ranking high

00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.280
 for this, but they're basically taking people to an ads page, right?

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.280
 Mm hmm.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:07.120
 So again, just a nice demonstration of what a clusterfuck having traffic ends up being,

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.800
 to actually, VT has a lot of traffic.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.120
 It's going to turn into some kind of clusterfuck like this at some point.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:20.120
 So I, as someone who is the founder of a startup that very much depends on Google search traffic,

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.960
 I can't listen to this without thinking, we should be making more money off of our search

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.960
 traffic.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.960
 Yeah.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.960
 We get a lot of inbounds from Google.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:31.440
 I'm trying to think, what kind of articles could we write that would still rank like

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:37.520
 our stats pages, and who could we sell less than those articles say, that's, that's crazy.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:42.680
 Like you think about these, these media companies, you're like, who the hell, like, they write

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:46.560
 so much garbage, like what, like, what, like, how's Forbes make any money?

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.680
 But it's because there's these, like, probably handful of properties they have that just

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.240
 generate like 90% of their revenue.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.240
 That's insane.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.240
 Huh.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.240
 Yeah.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.240
 That was worth a lot.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.240
 If you can find the right, uh, right buyer.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.240
 Yeah.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.680
 I'm going to look at those articles totally differently now.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:04.480
 They do say at the top, it's sponsored, like it's very, it's not like a secret thing.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.480
 Yeah.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.480
 It's not like a shady thing.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:12.520
 It's just like, it's wild to know the numbers involved, like $15 million for a spot in an

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.520
 article like that.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.520
 It's just mind boggling.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.120
 What else is going on?

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.440
 I feel like there's stuff going on.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:21.280
 I, there was even stuff I thought of that I wanted to talk to you about, like, something

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.520
 I saw on Twitter or something, like there's big news.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.960
 What's the big news right now?

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.240
 And the TikTok ban.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.240
 TikTok ban.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.160
 Zuck is not cooling in.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.400
 This has occurred to me.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.400
 Okay.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.400
 I want to do a rant on this.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.400
 Perfect.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.400
 Yeah.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.720
 I, you've known I've been a lifelong Zuckerberg hater.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.720
 Yeah.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.720
 Okay.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.720
 Forever.

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:47.320
 It pissed me off so much when a couple years ago, yeah, all he fucking did was change his

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:53.520
 shirt and add a chain and all of you fucking idiots were like, Oh, he's so cool.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.760
 Listen, he did jiu jitsu and I was a sucker.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.480
 I fell for the jiu jitsu.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.480
 He's a sucker bird.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.480
 He's a sucker bird.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.400
 He was annoying me so much.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:07.280
 I'm like, do you guys not see that this is just that guy in every social circle that

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:14.520
 just like is just kind of like acting a certain way and not really like, doesn't really get

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.520
 it.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.680
 But he's kind of like copying the things that other people are doing.

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.240
 And it's not really, it wasn't just the appearance.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.240
 It was the lack of like public dumb statements.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:30.160
 Like he kind of like stopped doing a lot of press or something it felt like.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.920
 And then like his actual personality became kind of mysterious because he wasn't like

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.680
 doing a lot of talking it felt like, or at least I wasn't seeing it.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.000
 And then now it's like he can't stop talking like the Rogan thing.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.680
 It's just like, Oh, yeah, you're that guy.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.680
 You're a lizard man.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.680
 I don't.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.680
 I don't like Zuckerberg.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.680
 I forgot.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.120
 But I hadn't been exposed to him enough, I guess.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:55.880
 So I'm glad that it's correcting itself, but it was, I was so annoyed when it was like,

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.720
 Oh, Mark Zuckerberg is cool.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.640
 Like, no, he's not guys.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:00.640
 He's just lame.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.640
 He just, I don't know.

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.280
 And they were doing all this, like all the open source llama stuff.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.920
 Like there were reasons to think like, Oh, Facebook might not be the worst.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:12.080
 I mean, I would never go to Facebook.com, but like, maybe meta is not the worst.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.360
 Maybe Zuckerberg's not the worst.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.280
 And then it's all back to where it started.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.280
 And they're the worst.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.280
 Yes.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.640
 The worst part, I can't even say anything about it right now, because people, because

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.480
 right now he's in trouble for being anti woke.

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.120
 So if I'm like, yeah, Zuckerberg sucks.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.120
 People are going to think.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.120
 It's a woke.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.120
 Hang on.

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.840
 This is so it takes my brain so long.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:36.560
 So woke is if you're very progressive in America, very liberal, an annoying degree, an annoying

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.560
 degree.

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.560
 That's woke.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.480
 So if you're anti woke, you're very conservative.

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.480
 Is that accurate?

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.920
 No, you're defining yourself as the opposite of that.

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.320
 So you're equally annoying, just in the opposite direction.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.320
 Well, wasn't Zuckerberg pretty progressive?

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.320
 Yeah.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.640
 He just he just he has no real thing.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:00.120
 He just yeah, he just like, like puts his fingers at weddings, like, okay, this is my personality

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.120
 now.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.680
 So we're watching him do that.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:08.680
 And then all this stuff about how Apple hasn't done anything in 10 years or whatever.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.680
 Okay.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.160
 How did he step?

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.440
 How did he set himself up for that?

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.160
 I was like, that was pretty bad, no one's admit or is this that dunk on him?

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.160
 Yeah.

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.760
 Anyway, like if all you think Apple is is the iPhone, then sure, Apple hasn't done anything

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:23.760
 in a long time.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.200
 But like, if you don't, if you're not paying attention to any of the other things, like

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:33.600
 the chips, then sure, I guess, yeah, the chips, which again, go back to the iPhone, which

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:38.160
 is now made this device like competitive with a $3,000 camera, we're just totally changing

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:41.480
 our people, like make, just that, yeah, a million different things that you can come

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.480
 up with.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.480
 Yeah.

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.580
 Everyone that's thought that participated in the Zuck is cool thing.

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:47.580
 I'm guilty.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.760
 Each one of you, I want you to send me an apology.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.760
 Okay.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.760
 Well, here's your apology.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.760
 I'll do it in person face to face.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.020
 Well, not in person, but on the zoom call.

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.020
 I'm sorry.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.320
 Here's the other thing that kills me, okay.

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.720
 A lot of the shirts I have kind of look like the shirts he's switched to.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:09.760
 I also have a gold chain, okay, pad one forever and here's a kicker.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.760
 You know, he, you know, he does.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.820
 You know, one of the things that he does on his like property, Hawaii, what he's trying

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:18.680
 to raise the best cattle in the world for the best.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.000
 Oh, my word.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 For the best.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.400
 He's stealing your bit, Dax.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.760
 It's just, it's just, it's just painful for me.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.760
 Yeah.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:32.560
 And then he has like, like he did that custom Porsche build for his wife.

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.560
 Yeah.

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:39.200
 That's like the exact silhouette of Porsche he chose was the exact one that I am super

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.200
 into.

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.200
 Oh, really?

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.200
 Geez.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.760
 It's just been, it's been hard.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.760
 Tough.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.760
 Well, I'm glad.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:50.360
 I'm glad he's returned back to the original zuck that we all know and hate.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.040
 And you can, you can have your identity.

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.040
 He's a loser.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.040
 Nobody forget.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.040
 Nobody forget.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.040
 He's a loser.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.040
 Yeah.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.040
 I mean, he is the guy that made hot or not in college.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.200
 Like let's just not forget that he's not special.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.920
 He is a doofus.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:03.920
 That's enough about zuck.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.280
 There is something cool happening, Nikita launched a new app.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.280
 How does he keep doing it?

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.840
 I let the review for his app.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:10.840
 Oh, really?

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:11.840
 Have you used it?

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.840
 Did it work?

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:13.840
 Okay.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.840
 Had you tried it?

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:15.840
 No, I know.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.680
 It is the most insane onboarding experience ever invented by like a hundred X.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.400
 Like it's really good.

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.400
 Or it's insane.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.400
 Yeah.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.400
 It's outrageous.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.400
 Okay.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.400
 So let me, it's the first thing he does.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.720
 Imagine an App Store page.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.520
 You could probably imagine there's like a picture of the icon.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.040
 There's a name of the app.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.320
 There's a manufacturer of like the company that makes the app and there's a get button,

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.320
 right?

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.800
 You tap get.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.360
 He named his company tap get.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.360
 What?

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:44.320
 So in the Apple UI above get, it says tap get.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.640
 I'm looking for it now in the store.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.400
 What's it called again?

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.400
 Explode.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.400
 There it is.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.400
 Okay.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.400
 I've clicked on it in the App Store.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.400
 Tap get.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.400
 Wow.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.400
 That's smart.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.400
 Like tap.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.400
 Yeah.

00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.360
 If you go through the onboarding experience, it is wild.

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.160
 So there's a part of it because it's kind of like a weird app.

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:07.040
 You have to like leave the app and set up stuff like in the OS and like your settings in

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.340
 the phone right now.

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:16.320
 When you do that, it uses a picture and picture mode of of iOS to like play a video in the

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.960
 picture and picture mode of what you should be doing.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:19.960
 What?

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.480
 Like he came up with like every single hack possible.

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.200
 I think it's like, he said this way.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.680
 He's like he called himself a performance artist.

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.040
 I think this is like performance art.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:31.280
 It's not like meant to be an app that like is actually used.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.480
 Oh, it's so good.

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.040
 It's like a it's like an experience.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.040
 Mm hmm.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.040
 I'm going through it.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.040
 I really have to pee.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.040
 So this is a great time to take a break.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.120
 Talk about terminal crown membership.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:51.760
 And I'm going to pee and I'll be right back while I go through the onboarding.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:57.600
 All right, everyone, here's the scheduled ad break.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.400
 As you know, this podcast is sponsored.

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.960
 We have sponsors.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.120
 We have one sponsor.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:07.160
 It's sponsored by terminal dot shop, which is the best coffee.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.400
 If you're a developer, if you're not a developer, might not be the best coffee.

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.360
 But if you are a developer, probably the best coffee you can get.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:16.320
 So you know, if you're looking for coffee at stage terminal dot shop, we are about to

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.480
 launch terminal crown.

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.520
 Crown is our membership goes up at your door.

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.680
 Once a month, the surprise inside, it's going to be different every single month.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.680
 You're not going to want to miss it.

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.680
 You're going to see it on all of our Twitter people posting what they got in their

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:32.680
 crown box.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:37.800
 So if you want to support us, it helps us do wild, crazy things, including this podcast.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.800
 Consider doing that.

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.800
 So there you go.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.800
 There's a little ad break.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:46.480
 Fly away for Adam to finish being.

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:53.880
 Okay, so my review, are you ready?

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:54.880
 Yeah.

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:55.880
 The onboarding is nuts.

00:49:55.880 --> 00:50:00.320
 I don't know when I'm in the app and when I'm in something else, it's great.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.320
 It's really confusing.

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:06.720
 I think actually using app, it's like, again, there's a lot of hacks in there too.

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.680
 And I think the experience just doesn't come together that great.

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.680
 Yeah.

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.920
 Cause I mean, the first thing I did was take a picture at my bathroom floor and send it

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:19.840
 to you, but it just pulls up the normal iOS share thing and I just tapped on your face

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.120
 and it was slack.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:27.880
 And then the message it sent in slack is my message, so that's not intuitive, but I get

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:28.880
 the idea.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:33.800
 All the little vibration stuff is really cool also like during the, yeah, like when I send

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:38.200
 it to you, you see how that's like playing, wait a minute, because I think that whole

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:44.760
 thing is a video and if you click that, like the video opens, you get this like ugly thing.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:50.520
 And then if you tap open, then it actually opens, you would send me that it was a pretty

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.520
 cool experience.

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:54.960
 I mean, like just now the photo you sent, I sent you a picture of my meat.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:59.320
 So I'm going to send you on just because I want to actually do it right.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:02.760
 Dax or you are in texts, my message.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:03.760
 It's very confusing.

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:07.000
 It's like, anyway, maybe we've spent too much time talking about this app because I don't

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 know.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 You said it's not even serious.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.400
 Like this is just a performance art.

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:12.400
 I think so.

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:20.340
 So either of you saying half is okay, but I want Silicon Valley to get together and agree

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:25.200
 to never buy one of Nikita's companies or pay him for consulting ever.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:34.200
 So he's forced to live up to his potential because I feel like like, why is he not trying

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.240
 to be at the level of Zuckerberg?

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240
 Oh, interesting.

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.880
 Like he has so much insane talent.

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.640
 I know he just loves the early stage of these apps.

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.640
 Yeah.

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.320
 I'm sure there's a good reason, but I would love to like if there just wasn't an option

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.680
 to exit, what would he have done?

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:50.680
 I'm like, so curious about that.

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.680
 That's a great point.

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.600
 Like his apps don't ever continue to exist, do they?

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:58.120
 They get bought by these big companies and then his talent.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.720
 The thing he actually made that was so great just goes away.

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.720
 Yeah.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.720
 Like how would he operate?

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.720
 Well, in the world.

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.720
 Texas weren't an option.

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:05.720
 Yeah.

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.680
 There's this thing that I think about all the time where I'm like, like obviously we need

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:12.720
 a market where exits can happen so that things even get funded.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:18.200
 At the same time, I think about Nest and I'm like, Nest was such a good, like the Nest

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.200
 thermostat.

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.200
 Yeah.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:24.440
 And to this day is still a very good product, even like the current iterations of it.

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.440
 What would it have looked like if they just had to make it?

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:31.600
 If they just had to make it instead of selling themselves to go off, I feel like they would

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.000
 have been if they succeeded, maybe they would have died.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.520
 But if they succeeded, I feel like they would be like an Apple scale company, but making

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.120
 all this really great home automation stuff.

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:46.280
 And we wouldn't have this clusterfuck of like 1000 options and all of them suck.

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.600
 So sometimes I wonder about these acquisitions, like people don't.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:55.740
 It gives people such a nice option that they never go for it, even if they're capable of

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:56.740
 it.

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:57.740
 Yeah.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:03.040
 There's Twitter tweet Kramer tweeted about acquisition just the other day.

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.040
 Yeah.

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:08.540
 I was just as non related to what we're talking about, but just kind of like a founder perspective

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:12.520
 take on acquisition and like as a failure mode.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:13.520
 Yeah.

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.760
 There's no solution to what you're saying, right?

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:20.080
 Like it's just part, it's not like some unnatural legislation that creates this environment.

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:25.000
 It's just normal market forces that lead to those scenarios, right?

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.240
 I would say a little bit.

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:31.320
 I'm very pro capitalist, but the position that I have, which is different than I would

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:35.360
 say most people that are pro capitalist is I think we need more regulation on some of

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:41.760
 these things that are clearly monopolies, like we need to disrupt Facebook and Google.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.000
 These companies are just like Facebook just buys every single social media app.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 Yeah.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 Right.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 So again, if there was no exit option for what's that, but would they have become?

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.840
 If there was no exit option for Instagram, what would they have become?

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.240
 Would Facebook even exist?

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.240
 You know?

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.960
 So I think yeah, like the level like these companies have gone really good at M&A, like

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.400
 they don't let they just don't let themselves be competed with.

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.400
 Yeah.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.400
 They take them out pretty early.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:10.400
 So I just down to the founders like having the risk tolerance to be like, no, fuck that.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.920
 I'm going for all or nothing, which like only people like Elon really do.

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.680
 Just like so few people really have that.

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:17.680
 Yeah.

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:21.320
 So you think about Google, do you think like, like when you think about the monopoly they've

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.320
 had for what?

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.320
 20 years?

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:26.160
 How long have they had this search?

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:31.600
 And like basically, it's like a monopoly on the internet really, like the internet flows

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.600
 through Google.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.600
 Do you think that's going to like this is kind of branching off, but do you think that's

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:40.840
 going to go away with this whole world of like LLMs and AI?

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.240
 And if we really are, oh, we should talk about that.

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.240
 Are we really hitting like some AGI this year that they're talking about?

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.240
 Yeah.

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.800
 So I have a few different thoughts on this.

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:52.480
 So if you remember early, early on, when we first saw time at podcast, when the stuff

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:58.720
 first came out, I said that I can't see my Google habit going away was totally wrong

00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.720
 about that.

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:00.720
 I like do not use Google.

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.720
 I hate using Google.

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.760
 I feel so much worse than using Chad JBT.

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.320
 So my use of Google has dropped massively.

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:13.000
 I'm only there if for a certain amount of cases, increasingly, I've been using grok

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.520
 for those cases because grok understands current events, which has been grok in Twitter, right?

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:19.520
 Yeah.

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:22.360
 Because I just saw yesterday, there's actually a grok with a queue.

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:23.360
 Website.

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.360
 That's true.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.360
 No, no, no.

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.360
 Yeah.

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.360
 I grok with a queue.

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.360
 Yeah.

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:29.360
 They're like a really fast L.M.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.360
 And then there's the grok website.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.360
 Is that different from Twitter's grok?

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.120
 No, grok with a K. Did they just launched a website?

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.120
 Okay.

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.120
 grok.com.

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.120
 Yeah.

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.120
 Yeah.

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.120
 I use grok in Twitter just within.

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:39.120
 Yeah.

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:40.120
 Yeah.

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.120
 Yeah.

00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.120
 I'm like, what?

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.120
 What are you talking about?

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.120
 And then the grok will like kind of give me some idea.

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:45.120
 Usually it's wrong.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.120
 I've actually never used that feature.

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.120
 Oh, really?

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.120
 Which means I must put it too much.

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.120
 I understand everything.

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.120
 No, all of it.

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.120
 Yeah.

00:55:51.120 --> 00:56:03.120
 Uh, but so I was 100% wrong on that like it totally was a thousand times better and I,

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:09.160
 my cool habit as strong as it was eroded, that said, I feel like with the way these tech

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:13.560
 companies are, you just never, you can just never count them out.

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:18.740
 They can move like years later and end up winning very silently.

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.320
 And the perfect example is Microsoft and Slack.

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:22.320
 Mm hmm.

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:23.320
 Right.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.320
 Mm hmm.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:29.840
 Slack had been around forever captured this business use case, literally went public and

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.960
 teams is still bigger.

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:36.960
 Microsoft just moved super late with a worse product and they still won.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:40.960
 It's just because the inertia, just the world moves so slow that like, yeah, the inertia

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:46.920
 and the, the, like the distribution they have and like, it's so I can see Google as the,

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:50.960
 even though it looks like what the hell, like what are they doing?

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:51.960
 Mm hmm.

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:56.800
 I feel like they, they're just so much room for moving slow, like you move super slow and

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:57.800
 it doesn't matter.

00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:58.800
 You're a big company.

00:56:58.800 --> 00:56:59.800
 Like you'll still.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.800
 End up winning.

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:04.400
 Um, and Microsoft, I feel always ends up winning too, in the end.

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.400
 Yeah.

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:09.400
 Apple would win because I use Siri because it's convenient.

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.400
 It's on my watch and I hate it.

00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:13.640
 It's so bad in the world of LOMs.

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:16.200
 Like when you're used to getting the kind of crazy stuff

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.040
 we can get out of Claude or Chad GBT,

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.640
 and then you ask Siri to like add some to your grocery list.

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.080
 And it's like, hello.

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.400
 I'm like, oh my God.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.820
 (laughing)

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.280
 Like are they ever gonna get it?

00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.440
 Are they gonna get the LOM thing on Apple products?

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:32.280
 'Cause I would love that.

00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.400
 I guess that's what intelligence--

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.840
 - I mean, you can now.

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.680
 - It's just funny.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.520
 Apple intelligence launched and I like don't know

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.920
 what it is still, like where is it?

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:42.920
 Like I know sometimes I can ask it to ask Chad GBT stuff,

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:43.840
 but like, yeah.

00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:44.960
 - I've never even used that.

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.640
 I know when it first came out in the beta,

00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.560
 it would summarize text and that was kind of cool.

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.280
 'Cause I do get these very lengthy texts sometimes.

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.360
 - It's so funny.

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.800
 - Mine won't do it anymore.

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.640
 And I haven't turned on and it's trying to be crazy.

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.320
 'Cause I get nothing out of Apple intelligence.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.040
 And I hear about it every day in the news

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.280
 about Apple intelligence and it's doing this and it's doing that.

00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.640
 And it won't even work on my phone anymore.

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.480
 So I don't know.

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.440
 I don't know what they're doing with that stuff.

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.280
 It's like comically bad.

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:12.120
 And I think to be fair, Apple especially does really well

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.200
 when they can wait a very long time.

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.880
 And I don't think that it's been a very long time

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:17.920
 since that whims have come out.

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.640
 Like they put out features, like the writing features

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.480
 to help you like generate emails and stuff like that.

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:27.120
 So that's just like what any random ass startup thinks of.

00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.040
 - Right.

00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:30.560
 - To do, we're gonna generate emails for you.

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.560
 It's just, it's not that compelling.

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:36.960
 So you just kind of put like timeline into the conversation.

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.720
 I do remember, I was just thinking the other day,

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.240
 I remember when chat GPT came out.

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:43.040
 We were at re-invent or were you there at that re-invent?

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.360
 I was at re-invent.

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.200
 I'm pretty sure.

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.040
 - I don't remember.

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.360
 - I remember where I was the day chat GPT came out.

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.840
 (laughing)

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:50.720
 Like it was wild.

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.080
 I mean, it was just this kind of like open AI

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.520
 was just this research place.

00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.640
 And then like, I remember when this is this new thing,

00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:58.840
 you don't remember playing with chat GPT

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.280
 in the early, early days and the excitement around it,

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.480
 how Twitter blew up.

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.560
 - I just don't really have a clear memory of that.

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:05.400
 - Okay.

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.240
 Well, I remember it.

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.240
 And now he, what's his name?

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:11.360
 Sam, Sam, Sama, Sam Walton.

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:12.200
 Yeah.

00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.840
 He's saying AGI this year.

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.840
 That's the last thing on the podcast today.

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.440
 What are your thoughts?

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.000
 What does that even mean?

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.800
 But also, is it gonna happen?

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:24.240
 - Sam, like Zuckerberg, I have always gotten

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.960
 a really negative vibe from like--

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:26.800
 - Me too.

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.440
 - I would just look at his face and be like, no.

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.280
 - Okay.

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.120
 - No, he's lying to me.

00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.960
 Zuckerberg, there was a little period where I kind of liked him.

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:37.320
 When he got fired and he was kind of sassy on Twitter,

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.480
 I liked Sam for a little bit.

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.760
 I was like, oh, maybe he's not so bad.

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.360
 And now he's back to being a lizard man.

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.680
 I mean, him and Zuckerberg are like the same human being

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.520
 to me.

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:45.360
 I do not like them.

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.200
 - Yeah.

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:47.760
 - I can't even articulate why.

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.600
 They just seem--

00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.280
 - I think we should listen to these feelings.

00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.640
 I think there's some deep, ancient wisdom in them.

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:54.800
 So--

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.560
 - I mean, every time Sam says something

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.480
 on like a podcast, he seems so out of touch

00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.600
 with like actual human beings in the world.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:04.360
 - I don't believe his intonation of speech is real.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.440
 To me, it feels like he is doing a very specific way

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.800
 of talking.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.400
 I don't think that's his real way of talking.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.520
 And that immediately just puts me on high guard.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.360
 - Yeah.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.200
 - Yeah.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.880
 - It's like, you know, Elizabeth Holmes did this.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:21.560
 A lot of people do this, but if you think about,

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.960
 again, come back to Elon.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.120
 Elon does not do this 'cause he sounds so incompetent

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:26.960
 when he saw us.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.720
 He's always stuttering and he's always like interrupting

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.040
 himself and like, he doesn't sound good.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.280
 Whereas Sam Altman has this like,

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.080
 he has this like, "I am thinking really hard."

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.600
 And that's what I thought really hard.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:41.680
 - That exactly is tough.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.120
 - It's like a very practice calm like demeanor.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.000
 And it's not, there's no way you're just talking

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.080
 to your friends like that.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.440
 Well, okay, regardless of Sam, I shouldn't have framed it

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.600
 with Sam.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.440
 - Okay, yeah.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.000
 - Things seem to be escalating with AI.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.600
 It does seem like it's doing things people didn't expect

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:00.480
 to be able to do.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.760
 I even feel like it's doing things I didn't expect to do.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.800
 Do you have like a disgusted face?

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:05.640
 You don't think so?

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.160
 - No, it's just, here's the thing.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:11.040
 It does so many things that are so incredible and useful

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.560
 that it feels like it can do anything.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.600
 But when you sit down and look at it,

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.800
 it also is like, cannot do,

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.880
 I thought I'd categorize a wide set of things.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.760
 Like it can do this, it can't do that.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.600
 - Yeah, that's true.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.840
 - I think where it's really impressive.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.840
 And it's, I was talking to A.J. by the other day,

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.840
 I'm like, I've never introspected this hard

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.560
 about what I do all day.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.960
 Cause like AI is forcing us to think about like,

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.960
 okay, I'm writing code, but then like,

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.360
 there's like 12 different versions of that.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.320
 And sometimes I'm in this mode and sometimes I'm in that.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.280
 I can help me in this mode, it can be that.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.840
 So what it's really good at

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:47.360
 is having a giant photographic memory.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.640
 So when you ask it things and it answers,

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.480
 it's really impressive and it's compensating for,

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.280
 it's, it's raw intelligence, it's pretty stupid.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.080
 - Yeah, it's compensating for the fact that it's never forgotten a fact,

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.360
 basically.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:04.440
 So when I'm like, how do I do copy paste using ANSI codes?

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.280
 And it spits it out.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.320
 I'm like, this is amazing.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.480
 I would have never found this otherwise, right?

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.440
 - Yeah. - But when I tell it,

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.880
 hey, I had a scrollback buffer in my multiplexer.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.360
 When I resize the screen,

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.920
 I need to make sure that things reflow properly,

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.920
 cannot do it even a little bit at all,

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.120
 horrible at it.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.320
 - Yeah. - So clearly you can't compensate

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.800
 for what's required there using memory.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.400
 You have to like have raw like logic,

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.000
 some kind of raw horsepower there that doesn't have.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.440
 So I don't feel like it's escalating, really?

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:39.240
 I feel like the way it's being delivered

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.480
 has gotten better, like some of the UX things

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.640
 have gotten much better with actually using these things

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:44.480
 that they workflows.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.440
 But it's clear we're just like massaging

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:52.640
 this fixed amount of raw horsepower into different ways.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.000
 And it scales like way beyond the current.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.840
 - I don't know.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.680
 I mean, that's a question.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.360
 Every time we see something interesting,

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.520
 and we do the SC a few times around AI products,

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.680
 we'll deep dive into them and just talk about it,

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:08.640
 we'll do all this complex analysis

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.240
 and really get down to it.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.560
 And the answer at the bottom is always the same,

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:16.040
 which is this is not a good product,

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.720
 but it can be amazing if the raw thing

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.200
 at the bottom gets better.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.120
 It's always that.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.960
 So the question is always,

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.120
 will the raw horsepower get better?

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.160
 If it can't, none of these products are viable,

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.840
 really, like not in like a big way.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.600
 So it just comes down to like,

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.240
 does the scale it does going while it's a holder?

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.280
 Or is it gonna flatten out?

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:39.640
 - I saw a levels tweet where he launched some like photo

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.080
 or text to video or something.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.400
 And it's like you, it's like your avatar like talking,

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.720
 but it's all based off of like a generated image of you.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.120
 So it's not you don't even have to make video.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.880
 It's just like you, but it looks so awful.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.000
 Like you would never want to like put this video

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.680
 if you talk to him anywhere.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:57.200
 And he acknowledges it and he's basically like,

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.400
 well, as the underlying models get better,

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.960
 we can all imagine how this will get better.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.240
 It's like, well, that's a big assumption.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.240
 That has to happen.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.480
 Like the underlying models have to actually get better.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.640
 - Yeah. So it always just comes down to that.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.600
 Like none of these products can really make the impact

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.160
 they set out to do today.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.480
 'Cause we're just massaging this existing thing.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.400
 - And then there's the question that economics have it.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.400
 I do wonder like, are we doing--

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.040
 - That's another crazy disorder.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:24.880
 - Yeah.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.680
 - Are we doing this crazy magic trick

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.480
 but we're spinning way more than we could ever,

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.720
 that anyone would ever pay to do this?

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.600
 I think about this every time I hit a lemon on a claw.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:36.080
 It's like, are we just like, is this all just vapor?

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.600
 It's gonna go away because we can't even afford to do this.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.720
 Like, I would have to pay crazy amounts

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.000
 just for the functionality I get today

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.520
 that wouldn't justify.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.800
 Like, do you feel that way?

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.880
 Like, is this all being mortgage?

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:49.280
 - Yeah. I just, it's like, I don't even,

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.640
 I just want to know what the actual numbers are

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.160
 so I can like, understand what types of businesses are possible.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.840
 I grant it that you can bring the numbers down

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.640
 some big magnitude over time

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.200
 'cause it is just pure software.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.240
 But I do remember the days of $4 Uber rides in New York

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:09.240
 to literally anywhere and now it's like minimum $35 to anywhere.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.080
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:14.640
 - I can recall how it feels and how it feels to go away.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.840
 - We built the habit on a cheap dollar amount

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.800
 and then to maintain the habit, it's gonna cost.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.960
 So like, I just want to know, like, what are the actual,

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.920
 'cause like, 'cause Sam was saying

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:28.560
 that they're losing money on O1 Pro.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:34.560
 So I'm like, that is wild 'cause O1 Pro costs $200 a month, right?

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:40.200
 Imagine, like, you personally consuming $200 of infrastructure.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.080
 - Yeah, it's a lot.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:42.920
 - That's insane.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.240
 Like no other, like, I was trying to compare it to Netflix.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.640
 I'm like, if you had Netflix on 24/7,

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:51.200
 there's like video, 4K, streaming.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.200
 That's still probably gonna be like nothing.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.640
 That's gonna be like a dollar in infrastructure costs.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.240
 - Just taking $200 worth of--

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.600
 - Like what that, like, that's really mind-blowing.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.440
 - A lot of GPUs, I guess.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.800
 - Individuals can do that, yeah.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:08.400
 Like a home GPU costs $1,000.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.640
 So you're telling me I'm consuming that every five months.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:15.160
 That's just like, it doesn't, it's so crazy.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.360
 Like, how is that possible?

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.800
 - That's insane.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.000
 Okay, I have to unceremoniously get off here.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.080
 Sorry, this episode is now exploding

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.980
 in three seconds or whatever.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.640
 (laughing)

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.840
 It's been an hour, 10 minutes.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.720
 - An hour and 10 minutes, something like that.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.360
 - Apparently, we record on Wednesdays.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.200
 That's good to know.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.240
 I'm sorry, if we always were supposed to,

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.400
 and every Wednesday, I can't.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.760
 - We put a counter, I have a counter invite.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.720
 I'm like, I'm gonna pay things to it, though.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.600
 - I do not, I do not pay attention to a counter.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:47.680
 So sorry, KCL, so that it'll pay attention to my calendar.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.480
 - This is the thing I should probably start doing

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.840
 to make everyone in my life happy.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:51.760
 - Yep. - Anyway.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.920
 - Yep. - See ya.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:53.760
 - See ya.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.340
 (upbeat music)
