00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 How can I hear your keyboard so well?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.600
 How about now?

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.600
 Oh, wait.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.600
 I'm not typing.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600
 Yeah.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.520
 I think the thing you're doing is snapping.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.200
 I have no, I have no idea what that is.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.200
 It just sounds the same in the book situation.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.200
 It's funny.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:45.880
 How's your cold plunge?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.520
 It was good.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.960
 There's a rule with cold plunging where you can't cold plunge without telling somebody

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.040
 because it's so hard and if you're going to do it, you've got to tell everybody.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.640
 I feel like everything in life that's in that category you just do, oh, I just talk about

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.640
 all the things.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.720
 No, I'm just thinking, by the way, the BJJ, you know, oh man, sorry.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.160
 Yeah, I'm just very passionate.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.920
 I'm a very passionate individual when I get into something.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.920
 I get very into it.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 Talk about it.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.920
 Yeah.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 I will.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.920
 And I'm free to make funny of you.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.920
 Yeah, for sure.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.920
 Yeah.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.600
 You're very passionate about making fun of people.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.200
 Oh, we are.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 We're live on Twitch.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.200
 You didn't even tell me.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.480
 Oh, I've been live for Twitch chat.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.880
 I've been talking to them.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.880
 Yeah.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.880
 You kidding me?

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.880
 Been talking to chat.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.880
 I've been warming up the crowd.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 I wasn't invited.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.160
 You're literally the other person on the podcast, like, how are you complaining?

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.800
 I just feel like I missed precious time with our friends on Twitch and all this chat I'm

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.420
 scrolling back and reading it all.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.440
 I was like, I was like, can relate.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.200
 Oh, I told them to guess what I'm doing.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 Yeah.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 I was like, wait.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.560
 Oh, it's he was peeing too.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.280
 Why is everybody peeing cold?

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280
 Yes.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.280
 Yeah.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.280
 The juice got it.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280
 Oh, it's awesome.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 Are you a host?

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.280
 I always forget how I pronounce the name.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280
 It's yes.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.280
 Yes.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280
 Getting beaten up.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280
 That was another yes.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.280
 Oh, I'm too predictable.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.280
 Okay.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.280
 How is it my house right now?

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.280
 Oh, for real?

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.280
 Can we get Alan on the pod with a little guest appearance from Alan?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.640
 Do you have too much staring off into the abyss like, I'm just like, technically, how

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.640
 do I do that?

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.640
 I haven't come to the next to me and speak into them.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.640
 Yeah.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.120
 You guys can just snuggle a little bit and just get real cozy next to the mic.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.120
 Now I don't want to do it.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.120
 Well, yeah.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.120
 I made it weird.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.120
 Sorry.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.760
 How was the in town till Sunday?

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.080
 You got kind of screwed.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.240
 This keeps happening.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.880
 People keep having plans to come visit and I wake up in the morning of the day that's

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.320
 supposed to come after like us, again, the house clean and like, you know, yeah, prepping

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.320
 for their arrival.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.000
 Oh, look at my phone and I'll see a message from the person who's supposed to come being

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.600
 like disaster, flight canceled.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.600
 Oh, no.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600
 Yeah.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600
 So they actually figured it out.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.400
 So they they're coming in from Maine and it's snowy as Maine often is.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.480
 Yeah.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.320
 And their flight got canceled and then just everybody started a panic and try to like

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.880
 book other flights and they made it.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.720
 It just took them like 16 hours to get from Maine to Florida.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.960
 They were supposed to come in.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.960
 That's awful.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.960
 They could have driven.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.960
 Yeah.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.960
 Yeah.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.200
 Like if they just drove straight, it's like, you know, 20 to 23 hours and like that.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.200
 Yeah.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.200
 But they made it.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200
 They made it.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.320
 Allen is a he's a great meaner.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.880
 He's part of a little, a little crew on Twitter.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.440
 That's they're just great meaners.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.840
 And he would be from Maine, like I feel like Montana, Maine, like all these random states

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840
 where the best meaners are.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.600
 Is it just they have nothing else to do?

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600
 They just live in these places.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.960
 So I have to burst your bubble though, cause Allen is from San Francisco lived in New York

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.840
 for the last 10 years and now is in Maine.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.840
 Okay.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.840
 So never mind.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.960
 So he's just he retired in Maine cause it's nice to focus more on meaning, I guess.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.960
 Yeah.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.080
 Is, is Allen coming to react Miami?

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.080
 He might.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.720
 He's hey, he asked his work and if they approve it and it seems like they will then he'll

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720
 come.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.720
 Yeah.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.720
 Uh, how about react Miami?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.040
 It's going to be so good.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.040
 I know.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.040
 I just see more and more people.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.040
 Every single week.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040
 I see more and more people.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.040
 I know.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.920
 Did you see that there's a react, like an official react conference going on to that they randomly

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.920
 announced?

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.920
 What?

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.320
 The Facebook team is throwing a conference like, I think it, I think it's official.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.800
 It's just called react conf.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.120
 It's not like, you know, react Miami.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.720
 It's the first time they've done this.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.720
 No, no, no.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.720
 They've, they've done it a bunch of times.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.720
 Yeah.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.680
 But I think it, I don't think it's been around for last few years.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.480
 At least I hadn't heard of it.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.640
 Uh, but yeah, no one, it's funny because like, very few, like you said, you didn't hear

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.640
 about this.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.640
 Like very few people heard about this.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.480
 Uh, but it's like the official one and it's in like Henderson, Nevada, what?

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480
 Which is like, what is that?

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480
 Yeah.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.600
 It's just like the south part, like if you go south of Las Vegas directly south, it's

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.660
 like the suburban area that's next to Las Vegas.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.440
 Uh, but yeah, so many people, the, uh, like Kramer, like the, the, uh, the century CEO,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.280
 he was like, what the fuck is that is Henderson, Nevada?

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.080
 He was like, I don't want to go there, like make it somewhere better.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.480
 It's like, why there?

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.220
 It's like, oh, it's Vegas still somewhere better, please.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.220
 Yeah.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.220
 Not Vegas.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.220
 Can we stop at the biggest conferences?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.220
 Yeah.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.960
 And the person he was replying to was like trying to just be like political and be like,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.960
 it'll be fun.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.600
 Like it's a bunch of nerds and it's a big setting, like, you know, like a bunch of like-minded

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.840
 nerds in a suburban setting and he's like, no, give me a better setting.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.840
 I guess I've not been to a lot of tech conferences, but suburban setting has not been the norm

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.800
 what I've experienced that it's like, what do you, you go to the mall?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.800
 Like what do you do?

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.760
 You're just in like a hotel slash commerce center the whole time and then you go back

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.760
 to the airport and you leave.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.760
 Yeah.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.680
 That is most of the experience I've had in tech conferences.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.680
 We're just at the venue.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.680
 Well, really?

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.680
 Even for render?

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.480
 Like you didn't go like around Atlanta.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.560
 We went to like a concert in Atlanta that was like an outdoor thing.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.480
 They rented out or something.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.480
 That was cool.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.400
 So for me, a conference is just an excuse to travel.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.840
 I'm not trying to travel with a nurse in Nevada.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.840
 Yeah.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.840
 No.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.840
 So you don't like to travel, do you?

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.840
 That's why you don't go to conferences.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.600
 Well, I thought I don't like to travel.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.800
 It's just we haven't like figured, since we moved to Miami, we haven't figured out like,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.680
 oh, this is what we do when we travel.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.720
 So every time it's like, what do we do at Zuko?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.320
 Like we got to find something that was like a scramble.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.520
 So we seem to like get better at our routine and yeah, get better, Dax, get better.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.760
 You need to travel more.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.760
 There's stuff going on.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.360
 Well, speaking of traveling, so here's a, here's a little funny thing that happened.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.120
 So you know, we posted the AI demo, like, I guess maybe a week ago, last week.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.120
 Yeah.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.120
 Oh, the movies thing.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.360
 I want to talk about that.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.360
 Yeah.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.120
 So that ended up going pretty viral.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.520
 My DMs were like insane.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.180
 I was getting so many questions from people about like, no, not me.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.180
 Trying to throw money.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.180
 Oh, okay.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.340
 No, no, no, no, no, not VZs, unfortunately, just from people that are like 10 times further

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.600
 into AI than I am asking me, like really obscure questions.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.360
 Like, I was like, someone was like, I spent the last six months trying to optimize this

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.320
 but with all these techniques and like, do you have any suggestions for how I could get

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.320
 better results?

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.720
 And I'm just like, I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.840
 Like we put together this demo in one week and that was it.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.160
 But it got to the point where someone from, I haven't replied to them and I should and

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.160
 I will.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.160
 I haven't decided yet.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.160
 Someone from Cascadia at JS.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.160
 I don't know if you've heard about this.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.160
 Oh yeah.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.160
 Like the Seattle one.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.760
 They were like, we loved your demo.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:58.720
 Would love to have you do a talk at our conference and I'm like, you guys know, I don't know

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.720
 shit about it.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.720
 Yeah.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:07.360
 Well, how did you guys like you stood up like you got this construct for vector storage.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.360
 Yeah.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:15.100
 In terms of like what off the shelf stuff are you using to take a movie plot and vectorize

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.100
 it?

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.680
 First of all, and then what are you storing it in like I have questions about the whole

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.680
 thing.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.680
 Just maybe lay out what you built.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.680
 Yeah.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.680
 So it's actually really simple.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.400
 So, so there's really just two components.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.320
 There's the vector database, which is stores, like, you know, like a vectorized version

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.080
 of a plot.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.760
 And there's like the thing that can take a plot and turn it into a vector.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.440
 So we started with just using all the bedrock stuff.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.760
 So their models are Titan embedding model.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:51.520
 And all we did was we crawled, I found some lists on IMDB, like top 700 movies or something.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:58.280
 And then I went to the synopsis page, took each paragraph as a synopsis of the synopsis

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.560
 and ran it through the Titan embedding thing and they gave me back a vector.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.200
 So for a given movie, if it had 10 paragraphs in the plot synopsis, there were 10 entries

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200
 in the database.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.400
 And then when you queried it, whatever you typed in as your search, we would turn that

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:21.120
 into a vector, find the closest matching vectors, and then like group by movie, and then likes

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.600
 add up this, the scores, and then like that gives you the ranking of the top movies and

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.600
 magic query.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.080
 So we started with the Titan one, man, it sucks.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.400
 It was like not very good.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:37.280
 It was, we got okay results and we like tried so many different combinations, like chunking

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.240
 it by paragraph is one approach.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.840
 And also like a rolling thing where you like put paragraphs one, two, three together, and

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.320
 two, three, four together, three, four, five, there's like all these techniques.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.280
 We tried every combination that we could think of and actually the simplest one ended up

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.360
 being the best, like just chunking by paragraph and like kind of scoring by which paragraphs

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.200
 match and by how much they match.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.360
 So then we swapped it to open AI for generating the vectors.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.240
 And our contract lets you swap between models.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.240
 So like you can use the Titan models, you can switch to the open AI one and then you

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.920
 just need to put in an open AI key as a secret.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.760
 And then yeah, the open AI ones were just like way better.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.000
 I don't think this is a permanent situation.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.040
 Like I don't see why all the models wouldn't at least get as good as open AI is today.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.040
 Yeah.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.760
 But yeah, we did have to switch to that and we got better results and the search results

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.760
 aren't like amazing.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.640
 Like I think there's potential there, but there's some funny stuff.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.640
 Yeah.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.480
 There's a point of results if you like trade around with it.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.520
 The similar movies one worked pretty well though.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.480
 The vectorization step is pretty fast, right?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.200
 Because when you're typing, if I remember, is it not it's not like a type ahead?

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.880
 Is it like it's a single call to open AI and it's a really fast call and it's a really

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.880
 cheap call.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.760
 I think Frank was trying to compute the difference between this versus like actual generative

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.640
 AI and I think it's like almost like a hundred X price difference.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.640
 Wow.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.480
 It's very cheap to run up a model like this.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.840
 I think I posted some of the costs like after we were done going viral.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.840
 I saw that.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.840
 It was like $4.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.840
 So that's awesome.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.840
 Yeah.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.400
 Did you guys make it on like Hacker News or anything?

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.400
 No, we didn't post it there.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.400
 I don't think anyone posted it there.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.400
 Oh, I should have.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.400
 Twitter.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.400
 Hmm.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.480
 Seems like the kind of thing that Hacker News would get a hold of.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.480
 I don't know.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.600
 But I have to be completely honest, I'm like afraid of being on Hacker News.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.000
 To be on Hacker News.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 Why?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.080
 You're a YC founder.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.080
 There was.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.080
 Yeah.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.600
 There's no protection at all, isn't there who you are?

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.600
 Okay.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.680
 So someone once wrote an article about and they called it a magical serverless experience

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.060
 and they wrote about how like they're using SST and it was like a long article about

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:55.280
 a little details and they posted on Hacker News demolished the comment just ripped it

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.280
 apart.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.280
 Again, by people that have no idea what the hell they're talking about, but it was just

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.480
 like, they just like were not even giving it a shot and it's very painful when people

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.960
 misinterpret your work, it's like the hardest part about doing things in public.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.960
 Yep.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.400
 And no one will do that more than the Hacker News.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.400
 The Hacker News.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.400
 It's really true.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.880
 Like, I mean, you hang out on Hacker News.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.640
 Oh, it all makes sense now.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.640
 Yeah.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.640
 It all makes sense.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.640
 I was going to say like, I mean, you're a nice guy.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.640
 Wait, don't you not.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.120
 You're the kind of people.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.640
 I don't comment on Hacker News.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.640
 Oh, okay.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.200
 But like, who are all the people on Reddit and Hacker News that are so angry in the developer

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.200
 community?

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.320
 Like, are they not on Twitter as much?

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.760
 Is Twitter angry?

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.760
 Not as much.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.760
 No, definitely not as much.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:44.000
 Happy about everything, like toxic positivity, all that stuff.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 You're right.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 That actually is true.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 What is worse?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.800
 LinkedIn's like that, but professional, Twitter's like that, but shitposting.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:56.160
 And then Hacker News and Reddit are just angry, just angry at everything, bitter and angry.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.160
 Why?

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.560
 It's tough because the best comments I read anywhere are on Hacker News.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:07.600
 Like the most useful ones that I see are on Hacker News, amid like a mountain of garbage.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.000
 So diamonds in the rough.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.200
 You got to get all the rough stuff with it, I guess.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.200
 Yeah.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.440
 So at this point, I'm like, Hacker News gives you crazy reach.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.720
 We're in the dev tool space that like basically targets a large percent of our audience.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.480
 But I'm like, so afraid of it that I'm willing to just give that up.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.480
 So that's interesting.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.080
 Like Hacker News is like the milestone that everybody's like, oh, we made it to the front

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.080
 page of Hacker News.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.720
 Our site got hammered.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.640
 It like you said, it's such a big reach.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.520
 Do you know like numbers like what is being on the first page of Hacker News compared to

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.960
 like a tweet that blows up?

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.040
 How many retweets does it take to be the equivalent?

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.040
 Yeah.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.040
 It's a good question.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.920
 To me, I don't think it's about pure numbers.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:52.760
 I think it's about accessing a niche of people that might not really consume anything else.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.760
 Interesting.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.480
 So people who are on Hacker News don't really consume other things, they're just straight

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.480
 to Hacker News every day.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.480
 Yeah.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.720
 Like I think there's like the set of developers that are on Twitter and I think it's this,

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.480
 there's like a type of person that will be a developer and also be on Twitter.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.840
 And there's a type of person that'll be a developer and be on Hacker News.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.960
 And I know that there's not like a crazy amount of overlaps.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.960
 So interesting.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.720
 We'll reach on Twitter is great, but like we're missing out all these people that aren't

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.720
 on Twitter.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.160
 And then what about Twitch?

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:26.400
 What's the overlap with people who got Twitch?

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.400
 It's so fragmented.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.880
 You think we'd all just hang out in the same places, but it's really, it's all over the

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.880
 place.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.880
 I wish.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.880
 I wish.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.880
 And then there's a whole LinkedIn mystery.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.880
 Yeah.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.880
 Like how do you crack LinkedIn?

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.880
 That's like a whole.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.880
 Yeah.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.880
 Have you been still doing the LinkedIn thing?

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.880
 Did you fall off?

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.880
 No, I lost.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.920
 I kind of like, I kind of forgot about LinkedIn stuff, but I don't get back to it.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.920
 I don't know.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.240
 Did you feel like it was resonating your style?

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.160
 Because you were just doing yourself on LinkedIn.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.880
 It was actually doing pretty well.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.880
 And I was like growing.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.400
 You're probably just like, it's a breath of fresh air to hear like something honest and

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.680
 actually based in something, just like what you want to hear.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.200
 The tough thing for me though is I feel, and maybe I'll get over this at some point like

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.440
 I've gotten over a lot of other things, I don't want to just post the same.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.920
 I feel weird when I post the same content on both.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.920
 Yeah.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.880
 I post the tweet and I post the same thing on LinkedIn.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.880
 Definitely.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.880
 Yeah.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.800
 And I'm like, but I'm not like smart enough to have enough contact.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.800
 Yeah.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.800
 Content for both.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.720
 You can just imagine how I feel.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.320
 You actually have smart things to say on Twitter, I don't know anything to say.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.720
 Well, then there's a whole like game of like, okay, I thought something really good.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.960
 Do I spend it on Twitter where like it's going to maximize who sees it or do I like invest

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.960
 it into LinkedIn?

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.960
 Yeah.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.960
 To like grow.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.400
 That's just a lot.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.640
 That's why I don't think any platform will like be thrown any existing platform because

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.320
 like if you're someone that's like established there, it's so hard to adopt it yet another

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.320
 one.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.320
 Yeah, it really is.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.440
 I do feel like SST could have a lot of potential users on LinkedIn, right?

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.440
 I know.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:07.480
 Again, it's tough because yeah, these are places that have people we want to reach, but my what

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.680
 I'm hoping is that if you're not on Twitter, you at least are friends with one person that

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.680
 is.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:19.680
 Oh, that's interesting if we make some, I mean, but that's the whole thing with making viral

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.680
 products, right?

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.600
 Like you need to put out something where someone tries it.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.920
 Even if the product's not for them, like they don't have this specific problem or like

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.480
 it's not painful enough or like whatever.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.480
 Yeah.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.480
 As long as they walk away from it being like, oh, this product is competent or like the

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.480
 people behind this are competent.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.640
 When they run to someone that has that problem more than they do, they'll note it'll be like,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.640
 oh, I tried out this product.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.640
 You should check it out.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.640
 Even if they're not a user.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.640
 Yeah.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.640
 That's a long time.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.640
 Optimize for it.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.840
 But if you if you can achieve that, like you will, you will hit that like viral coefficient

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.200
 or whatever they call it and you will grow a ton.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.200
 Hmm.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.200
 Yeah.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.200
 Interesting.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.200
 Can I shift gears?

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.200
 Yeah.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.640
 I don't even ask, but I should just do it.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.240
 I'm just going to shift gears and I want to from now on.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.240
 Okay.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.240
 Okay.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.240
 Take me on a ride Adam.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.240
 I'll take you on a ride.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.240
 Do you feel like you're a role model?

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.240
 Do I feel like I'm a role model?

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.240
 Yeah.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.240
 Do you think people look up to you?

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.240
 They should.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.240
 I'm pretty great.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.240
 Okay.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.240
 Oh, buddy.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:26.880
 It's weird to think of it in that terms because one, if it feels like embarrassing to think

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.360
 of yourself in that way, yeah, like I think there's resistance to doing that.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:37.360
 But I think, yeah, I think you reach a certain point in your life where I can remember when

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:43.240
 I was where I was 10 years ago and like the type of people I was like looking at and was

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.360
 like, I would love to be more like them one day or like to have a similar life.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.360
 Yeah.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.160
 And those people kind of look like where I am today.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.960
 So I think I'm sure this is happening.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.960
 Hmm.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.960
 To some degree.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.960
 Yeah.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.960
 Yeah.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.920
 Do you I guess when you are a role model, do you know it?

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.160
 Do you get like did people tell you like I look up to you?

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.560
 I didn't tell anybody I looked up to, I guess.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:09.520
 I do get some messages, not super frequently, but I can say that there have been some.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.520
 I'm sure you get them too.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.560
 I feel like you're more of that than I am because you're like more established in your

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.560
 life.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.040
 But you must get them.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.040
 What?

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.040
 Yeah.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.040
 Say that again.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.480
 I'm more established in my life.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.480
 I'm older.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.480
 You just made them older.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.360
 I feel like you're you're at a phase in your life where you're like, okay, like I figured

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.360
 it out.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.360
 Like I have kids.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.360
 They're not like tiny kids.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.360
 It's like my beard.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.360
 Yeah.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.360
 Like you have like a family home that you're probably going to live in for a very long

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.360
 time.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.360
 You know, it's true.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.360
 Okay.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.360
 It's like transient phase.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.560
 So I can see how for a lot of people, I mean, even for myself, like I kind of look at your

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.560
 situation.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.120
 I'm like, oh, that's that's like where I want to be at some point.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.120
 Okay.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.160
 I'm putting it in my Twitter bio.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.160
 Yeah.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:54.280
 I'm putting up more established than next.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.280
 More more roots.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.280
 More roots are going deeper.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.280
 More rooted.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.280
 More grounded.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.280
 I'll put grounded on LinkedIn.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.560
 That sounds like that would go well on LinkedIn.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.400
 So how do you feel about the role model thing?

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.120
 Well, somebody said something to us, right?

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.720
 About how like maybe maybe we could be a role model to younger men, specifically younger

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.720
 men.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.720
 And I hadn't thought of it.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:21.000
 Just hadn't thought of like younger men looking up to me or you about anything.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Yeah.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.320
 But it's interesting because I'm in an age, it just made me realize how much I deny that

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.320
 I'm getting older.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.320
 Yeah.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.320
 Like I'm almost 40.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.320
 Of course.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.600
 Like I'm at the age where I should start thinking about the influence I have on people younger

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.600
 than me.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.600
 I should, right?

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:42.680
 If about now then when like I feel like that's the age on 37, you're not like, you're not

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.040
 too old to be out of touch.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.400
 It's like a nice window.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.400
 Yeah.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.640
 Because yeah, once you're 65, it's like, I don't know, you lose some of that.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.280
 Like it's a different kind of wisdom you have at that point.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.280
 Yeah.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.280
 Yeah.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.280
 I don't know.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.280
 I've never thought of myself.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.280
 Or whatever.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.480
 When I became an adult, like I just feel like I'm that age and I will perpetually, like

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.480
 I just see everybody.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.480
 Yeah.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.760
 I still feel a good younger.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.760
 I feel like a kid.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.600
 I'm just like, I'm a kid.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.600
 Wait, wait, wait.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.360
 Like eight years old or like, no, no, like I feel like like when I hear the fact that

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.400
 I'm technically a man, I'm just like, holy shit, like a man walking around.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.400
 No, no, no.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.920
 The people I see around me, like those are men walking around.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.920
 I'm just like, yeah.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.680
 I'm just like, I'm just like a boy.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.680
 You know?

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.680
 Yeah.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.680
 No, I hear you.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.680
 Yeah.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.440
 Just like being an adult is kind of surprising sometimes if you really think about it.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.920
 And you only noticed that when, I think I've told a story before, but I remember getting

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.040
 to an elevator and there was like, there's a woman and a little kid.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.800
 And the woman was like, say hi to the man.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.680
 And I was like, man, what the what man?

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.680
 Oh, me.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680
 I'm the man.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.720
 There's a man here with us.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:53.200
 Oh, yeah, so but I was like, this is go away when you have kids, because how can you feel

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200
 like a kid when you have kids?

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.200
 But you're saying you still kind of feel like a child for sure.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.640
 Like it's very hard to imagine.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.760
 I'm trying to think like how much older my dad is than me.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.400
 Like my memories of my dad or when he was like my younger, younger, younger, for sure.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400
 That's wild.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.400
 Yeah.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.400
 It's so weird.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.400
 I don't like that one bit.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.400
 Why don't I like that?

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.400
 What is it about that?

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.760
 I don't like when my dad was my age.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.440
 I think I was like, six or seven already.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.280
 I don't even have kids yet.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.280
 Yeah.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.280
 Wow.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.280
 Yeah.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.280
 My mom was even crazier.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.140
 I think I was like 10 by now for her.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.080
 Is this just feelings of mortality?

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.080
 Is that what I'm feeling?

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.760
 Like I don't like to think about being older because it's like a reminder that yeah, I

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:43.040
 think the thing that really messes with me is when I realize my dad's only like 25 years

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:50.360
 older than me and my mom is only like 22 years older than me, which is really, really weird

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:55.280
 because you're like, at least in America, I think that's not, at least the people I've

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.240
 been around, their parents have been a lot older.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.240
 Yeah.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.800
 And it's weird to think when my parents die, I'm going to die in 20 years.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.800
 Oh, wow.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.000
 That seems like really short, you know?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 That's wild.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Yeah.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Yeah.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.280
 No, I guess like my parents are probably a little bit older than I think they're like

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.600
 30 years older than me.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.600
 Yeah.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.680
 My wife's dad is 40 years older than me.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.680
 Wow.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.160
 Yeah, he's like a lot older than her.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.160
 So it's very different.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.160
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.160
 20 years.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.160
 Yeah.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.160
 Wow.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.160
 That's, that's nuts.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.160
 I don't, I don't like any of this.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.160
 I decided I don't like this conversation.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.160
 Let's go back to the role model one.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.160
 Role model.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.160
 Yeah.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.160
 So I guess people probably do look up to us.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.000
 And I know even I've gotten those messages, the kind of messages that are like, Oh, I was

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.280
 thinking about doing this and I decided to go for it and that kind of stuff.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.280
 Yeah.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.280
 Yeah.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.280
 Yeah.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.280
 I don't know.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.280
 I don't, I feel like I should be doing something different if people are looking up

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.240
 to me than what I'm currently doing.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.840
 Do you ever feel like that?

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:59.840
 Like if you start thinking about younger people wanting to look like us, does it make you want

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.840
 to look different?

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.840
 Because it makes me all look different.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.200
 I think we're a little bit different in that my whole life, I've just been very used to

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.560
 telling other people here's how you should be.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.560
 Yeah.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.560
 You're not sure.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.560
 You're not sure on advice.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.040
 You're constantly throwing it out there.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.040
 So it makes sense.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.360
 I always try to make everyone more like myself.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.240
 So it's a little bit more natural for me, I think.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.240
 You love yourself.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240
 You love money.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240
 You love yourself.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.240
 I love money.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.240
 I love myself.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.240
 Yeah.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.240
 You're a simple man.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.240
 It's a whole philosophy too.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.240
 If you like it, follow me.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.240
 I'm your role model.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.400
 If you love money and you want to love yourself, do you like the sound of that?

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.440
 I feel like how to live.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.240
 Do you like Huberman and cold water?

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.240
 Follow me.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.240
 No, follow Huberman.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.240
 Well, I guess yeah.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.240
 Follow Huberman.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.240
 Yeah.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.240
 Good point.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.760
 I have no original thoughts.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:52.040
 I am just a puppet and I only am a puppet for so long before I switch to something else

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.440
 and then I'm a puppet with that thing.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:58.000
 Well, to anyone listening, if that sounds good to you, if being a puppet sounds good

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 to you.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 Yeah.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Follow out.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 There you go.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 I'm your guy.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.120
 I'm an adult man and I have lots of things to look up to.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.120
 Probably.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.120
 All right.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.120
 Enough of the role model stuff.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.800
 I don't know where I was planning on that going.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.800
 But it went into mortality.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.960
 Do you have one other thing?

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.760
 I don't have a couple other things I think.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.400
 I think you mentioned something to me.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.880
 Oh, I want to talk about what was it?

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.000
 You had a tweet that made me think of this.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 Oh, the career thing.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 The career thing.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.960
 This is great because we're just talking about role models.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.960
 We're talking about, yeah.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.960
 Role models, career advice.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.960
 Look at that.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.600
 That was so smooth.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.280
 If you're really interested in having a podcast someday with smooth transitions, look up to

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.280
 me.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.280
 Pretty good at this stuff.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.280
 Oh, look away.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.280
 Yeah.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.280
 Probably.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.520
 So you had a tweet, could you remind me exactly what the tweet said?

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.800
 Something about like if you had followed all these dummies on Twitter.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.800
 Yeah.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.800
 I love my career.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.600
 Like I like where it is.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.000
 I like the opportunities that I have that I'm not taking advantage of.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.440
 Like I'm excited to like see what I could do.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.960
 I love what I'm doing right now.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.600
 I think my day to day is super unique.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.920
 I think it's like not what most people get to do.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:11.000
 I get to like do fun stuff like this podcast, like making super videos, like having fun

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.400
 on Twitter, and that's like part of my job.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.400
 All my work is public.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.520
 I can kind of talk about it, interact with, you know, people like a large number of developers.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:25.080
 I have like a pretty good way to talk to anyone legit in our field doing something interesting.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:31.600
 Like I'm able to like, you know, my work tends to overlap with theirs and like when your wife

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.200
 has friends over, you get to explain how your awesome office is set up like this because

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.200
 your awesome job.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.200
 Right.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.200
 That's a perk.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.720
 And my wife's friends think have no idea what the hell I do.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:47.640
 I think it's really weird, but yeah, it is weird, but it's great and it's, and I would

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:54.520
 have never predicted it and I couldn't have drawn like a direct step by step plan to getting

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.520
 here.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.520
 Yeah.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:02.160
 But I know for sure that every step of my life and you know, times change and what people

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.160
 say change.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.920
 But when I think back to what people were saying when I was earlier in my career, I very much

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.800
 did not do any of that.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.880
 Like I remember people telling me that I was doing the wrong thing or like I should care

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.920
 about these other things and I didn't and it worked out.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.680
 I'm sure like whatever their advice was like, there's a flavor of that working out too,

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.680
 but it wouldn't have been this.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.320
 It wouldn't have been where I got to now.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.320
 Yeah.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.240
 And I think where I got to now is a lot more unique than where you could get to otherwise.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:34.720
 So yeah, it's like the advice could be good, but if I followed it, I wouldn't have this.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.080
 So it's like this weird like kind of paradox thing.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:43.440
 So I've had similar experiences in life, like not had a normal job in terms of I've never

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.880
 applied for a job, never had a resume, that whole thing.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.000
 We've talked about that.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.880
 And I love my career.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.960
 I love everything it's meant for my family.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.320
 I love all of it.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.400
 It's all fantastic.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.640
 My question to you is like, does that work for everybody?

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.680
 Do we need like a large swath of people that are just doing the normal thing?

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:10.520
 Is that like inherent in society that only some of us can have this very unique, weird

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.680
 path, but like everybody can't have it?

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.680
 Yeah.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.680
 What are your thoughts?

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.680
 Yeah.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.440
 I think it's, I think you have to be honest with yourself because there kind of is like

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:25.320
 an objective cultural thing where when we describe this having your own path thing, it's automatically

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.440
 placed as like, oh yeah, that sounds amazing.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.960
 And I should do that too.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:36.600
 But you have to know yourself, like not everyone really wants that culturally, it's set up

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.240
 in a way where it feels like everyone should want that, but not everyone does want that.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:45.920
 On the flip side though, I think there is this other dynamic going on where the normal

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:55.520
 path to me has gotten like less and less attractive and like maybe even like more chaotic.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.080
 And it's also never been easier to have a weirder path.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.880
 So I still think it's like, yes, a small, it's really like a minority of people that

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.120
 get to do the weirder path thing.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:11.840
 But I also like, if I look around, I just like, I see so much more of that than I ever

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.840
 have.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:17.080
 I saw a post the other day, someone was like, the internet has made like so many of these

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.440
 types of business as possible.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.280
 And so it's reached out of Reddit being like, I forgot what he was like, I don't know what

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.800
 the number was, but it was something like, I make $20,000 a month by making these mini

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.980
 cinder blocks and selling them online.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.600
 He just makes these like miniature cinder blocks.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.720
 And that's just his job and his career like, no, there's no path for that.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:44.960
 It's like, yeah, like this completely made up job that this person completely invented.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.380
 And I think there's way more ability to do that now than ever.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.480
 I think there's a lot of pressure to like, maybe do that, given how like commoditized

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.760
 like, normal jobs have become.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.760
 Yeah.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.280
 But yeah, I agree, like it's not for everyone.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:03.080
 And I would say the average person probably won't succeed doing that.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:11.480
 It's like, how do you, you can't sell advice to the like chart your own path people?

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.960
 Because there's really no, is there any advice that could have helped either of us get to

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:23.160
 where we are in our career, like maybe the life advice, just general, like, I don't know,

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.240
 eat your veggies, get a lot of sleep, whatever, but like, there's no path, there's no way

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.120
 I could have charted where my career, the twists and turns, what worked, what didn't,

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.160
 there's no way I could have read a tweet that would have been like, ah, that's, that's what

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.160
 I'm doing.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.160
 I'm going to do that.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.160
 I'm going to take those steps.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:45.160
 I think for me, the most that could have happened, and maybe that this is kind of what

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:52.120
 did happen was there were enough people that had made it through that.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.400
 Not this, I don't care about specific details of what they did, but like, yeah, they had

00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:00.880
 a similar mindset and they were kind of rejecting the same things, and they like made it through.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.600
 And seeing that, like knowing that people think the same way and ended up successful,

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.480
 like that's kind of what you need, because everyone else around you is kind of telling

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.480
 you the opposite.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:15.140
 Like, I'm not bold enough to go do something where like, there's zero signal that can

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.140
 work.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.140
 Yeah.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.940
 So seeing the people where it did work out for them, like that's, that like keeps you

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:25.800
 in the game, I think, because there's a lot of doubt on the weir path, like some days

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.800
 you wake up and you feel great.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.880
 Other days you're like, oh, I just like burned my twenties because this was the completely

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.640
 the wrong thing to focus on.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.640
 Yeah.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.640
 Yeah.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.840
 Just motivation, I think whatever people can do to keep me motivated, that this is all

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.840
 going to be worth it.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.840
 It's probably the most you can do.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840
 Yeah.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.600
 The signal part was important for me.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:48.000
 I guess, like, if I think of my whole career, I never felt like I was taking any risks,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.240
 like every step of the way, there was like a reason I'm doing this and somebody's paying

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:57.560
 me to do it or like, there's, there's very clear need for me to get better at this so

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.160
 I can, you know, level up in this project or whatever.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.160
 Yeah.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:07.800
 I always had, I mean, I guess with the exception of starting Stanis, that was, but that was

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.520
 only after like having enough success to be able to say like, let's take a risk.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.760
 We've got savings, whatever.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.760
 Yeah.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.680
 I guess like it never did.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:22.240
 If I look back on my 15 years of all the random things I've done, there was never like

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.880
 some moment where I felt like I'm putting my family at risk.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.760
 Like my wife is depending on me.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.640
 Like I've never felt like, I don't know, this might not pan out.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.680
 It was always like, I got more work to do than I could possibly do.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.480
 I don't know what, yeah, I don't know what that like, how to distill that and hand it

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.680
 somebody else and be like, make your own path.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.680
 I don't know.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:47.360
 I can think of some like specific situations and they're not that dramatic, but to some

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.920
 degree it does fall under this.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.880
 So one of the first steps for me that was a little bit counter was going fully remote.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:00.000
 And again, it sounds ridiculous now because everyone's remote, but yeah, I live, I live

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.680
 in New York City, I lived in Manhattan where like there's a lot of employers and a lot

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.440
 of in person jobs.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.000
 And well, all my friends that lived there at the time, they were like, that sounds like

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 a bad idea.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.440
 Then they just gave me like a whole list of reasons why it was bad and it did seem kind

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:22.320
 of crazy that I was like, I would like live 10 minutes away from work and I wouldn't consider

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.320
 it.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.720
 But yeah, it did work out.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.560
 And again, I didn't bet on this.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:30.040
 I was like, make this up and I was like, I'm going to be the first person to do this.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:34.280
 I saw some people doing it and I saw how it worked and I saw the life they had and it

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.280
 worked great.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.960
 This is when DHH and you know, 37 signals was really like vocal about this was like the

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.120
 topic they were vocal on.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.120
 They wrote that remote.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.120
 Okay, book.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.720
 And I was like, okay, there's people out there that in the world that are like minded and

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.920
 believe that this version of the world is possible.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.920
 Yeah.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.880
 So I can, there's something for me to like tap into when I go look for work, like there's

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.240
 has to be some small percentage of people that think this way.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:05.720
 And it was hard, but I saw enough people that we're doing it where I'm like, okay, at least

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:11.160
 it's not like probably not going to pan out to nothing, but now it felt like a giant risk.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:16.760
 But given that there were people that evaluated it for me, but I would say like the people

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.520
 around me were probably saying the opposite.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:24.240
 It's crazy that like similar timelines, I would have been going to the same thing.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.320
 But with no awareness whatsoever, like you were actually thoughtful about it.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.360
 And you, I just lived in a place where there weren't tech jobs.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.360
 So I had a choice.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.360
 It's a nice thing to have a choice.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.360
 Yeah.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.920
 I never even considered like, I'm going to find a job where I work at a place.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:41.520
 It was like, I'm on e-lance and I'm finding people who will pay me money to do programming

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.520
 related things.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.680
 Yeah.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.880
 And that just kind of snowballed into other stuff.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.560
 But yeah, I was never aware of the book.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:54.600
 I mean, I am now, but I didn't know that remote work was like this niche thing.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:59.400
 It was just a necessity when you live in the woods.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:05.240
 So the, what about going, so the other step, which we both have is like, and you, I think

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:10.280
 you were always like this where you were freelance and you weren't like, you know, being a company

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:15.880
 person and like working up in a company, did people feel any, like people in your life?

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.400
 Did anyone feel like, oh, that's like too risky or like, yeah.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.800
 All the mortgage lenders, they felt that way.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.800
 Oh my God.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.800
 Yeah.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:29.200
 I, so my, our first home, we, we rented for the first two years after we got married and

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:34.080
 then bought our first home, had to get a loan from my mother-in-law because we couldn't

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.080
 get one from the bank.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.040
 I didn't have enough history and it was self-employment and it's like, well, that doesn't

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.040
 really count.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.440
 It's like, I've made enough money this year to pay off the house.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.440
 Can I have it?

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.440
 Can I, can I get a loan?

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.440
 No.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.680
 No, you can't do that.

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:47.680
 We paid off the house.

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.320
 So we paid off my mother-in-law in two years.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.880
 I mean, it's like, I'm making a lot of money.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.440
 Look, I promise, but it wasn't a W-2, so it doesn't matter.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.440
 Yeah.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.600
 That was like, that was the main thing.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.520
 I don't think friends, I don't think family, friends, anybody cared.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.000
 I mean, in the Ozarks, like, this was magic.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.760
 This is like, this guy sets it at a computer and he has all these screens and he makes

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.760
 a lot of money.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.760
 What is going on?

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.600
 Like, they wanted it too.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.920
 And that, honestly, I've had a lot of that in the Ozarks, like people around me that have

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:23.040
 wanted to understand and get into this because they've just seen, it worked for me.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.040
 Not so much online.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.360
 I've not felt like a role model there, but in person, there's definitely a lot of that

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.840
 just in this area.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.840
 Yeah.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:34.920
 So for me, it was quite different because everyone that I, again, I was in like an area

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:40.080
 that was like, quote unquote, high achieving, like, a lot of, like a really good school

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.080
 district.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.080
 I hear that about New York.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.080
 Yeah.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.640
 No, I mean, in New Jersey, where I was prior.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.640
 Oh, New Jersey.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.640
 Gotcha.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.680
 Everyone was like shooting for like the top schools.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.240
 And if that's like your mindset, when you come out of school, you're shooting for the

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:57.200
 top employers, like the quote unquote top employers.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.400
 And like, that's how your life gets made and you like, you know, work your way up.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.920
 So even like my mom, even to this day, I think she still feels a little weird about like,

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.600
 despite how like far my life has progressed, you still think I should like go work at a

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.960
 company with a name that she recognizes instead of like every week or being like, what are

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.400
 you doing?

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.000
 She's the next year's video.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 It's free next year.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 Yeah.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 She has.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 She's like, this is a job.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 Like all our friends, kids are like working at place like they can communicate it easily.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.480
 Like, yeah, my son works at Google.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.480
 Okay.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.240
 We all know Google is we know what that is.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.800
 And she can't really explain it.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:42.240
 So not that she cares about not being explained it, but like I see why it feels weird because

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.600
 it's so like outside the box of everything else.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.600
 Yeah.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:51.040
 So in a lot of ways, it feels like I think they have the perception and I think a lot

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:55.680
 because perception and maybe it's changing now, she was like, Oh, if you work at a company,

00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.160
 it's like stable or like you'll have like, yeah, predictable, stable life.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.160
 And I think that's true.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:05.880
 But it's like the exact thing that blacks one is all about like anything that's that

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:12.320
 stable is trading off something and that something will blow you up randomly one day

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.320
 with zero prediction.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.720
 So that's what happened to people to lay off, right?

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:21.760
 So I've never had that crazy of a disruption in my life where like, boom, you're laid

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:25.440
 off during a time where getting a job is super hard.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.440
 Yeah.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.960
 And like you're like totally out in the wind trying to figure out what the hell to do.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.920
 Like I've never had that crazy disruption.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:36.120
 I've had constant mini disruptions like every week of my entire waking life, but but that

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.600
 builds some resilience, right?

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:43.440
 And it makes you kind of like immune to the small ones.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.760
 I'm sure the big ones would still hurt, but yeah, like you like learn to like have like

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:53.640
 several layers of fall bags and kind of always have opportunities like in the works and yeah.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:38:00.280
 So I think net, it's more stable to not be on that like traditional company path and in

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.800
 net less stressful, but yeah, again, it just comes on your personality.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800
 Yeah.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.560
 People describe like like if you're if you're doing freelance work, which I've done a lot

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.760
 in my career, you might have three, four clients that you're working on stuff for off

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:18.160
 and on over a few months, whereas, you know, you work at a single job, you have one client.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:23.560
 And I know it seems more stable, but they can end that relationship so quickly.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.480
 And then you have zero sources of income.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:32.560
 So it is like it feels stable, something about it psychologically when you don't have like

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:38.920
 somebody who signs your payroll check every week, it does feel scary.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.760
 Like you don't know where it's going to come from next, but I've always made more money.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.760
 Yeah.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.760
 Like always made more money when it was the most uncertain, like when there was completely

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.240
 like no cap, but also no minimum on what I could bring in month to month.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.760
 That was that was always the most lucrative.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.760
 Yeah.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.760
 Once you figure it out, it's like it's amazing.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:07.600
 And you also get this mental freedom, which it's so hard to explain until you have it.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.640
 When you're when you're an employee of a company.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.040
 And let's say there's like something that you don't like that happens.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.840
 You like go to your friends and you rant about it and then you go back the next day and do

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.240
 your job.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:25.560
 But when that kind of thing happens when you're a freelancer, you just drop the client or

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.200
 like, yeah, you're like, okay, this is not the exact type of thing.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.600
 And like you work, you use your way out of it after a couple months or whatever it is.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:39.200
 And you just stop putting up like your own value, like your own self value, I think rises

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.960
 and like you like really learn what you're going to put up with.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.280
 And the stuff that you'll put up with, like the bar keeps going up as you get better at

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.440
 freelancing in general.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.560
 So that like just kind of changes your whole relationship with work.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:56.920
 I think it makes you a better worker too, because you're like, you're not distracted

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:03.320
 by feeling like I'm so committed to this and every little thing that goes wrong means

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.440
 like I'm stuck in this thing forever and that kind of makes you like a resentful worker.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.440
 It's just like mentally, it's totally different kind of work.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.520
 Yeah, something as we've been talking about this, it occurred to me that I always thought

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:17.520
 like when people ask me what I do and I hated the question, I hated answering that question

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.040
 or trying to answer that question.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.040
 Yeah.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:24.680
 Because it's technology and I live in a place where there's not a lot of technology jobs.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.440
 I always thought it was that, but I think it's actually it's the it's the freelance.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.080
 It's the kind of chart your own path thing.

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:35.400
 So I guess if you want your life to look like me and Dax where it's this very unique

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.360
 career path, you'll know your head in the right direction when you hate when people ask you

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.360
 what you do.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.400
 Because if you just work at Google, it's like, what do you do?

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.400
 I work at Google.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.400
 Yeah.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.400
 And they know.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.400
 Simple.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.400
 I would love when people ask me that.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.400
 Like I'd be excited for people.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.400
 But I would go places, but I would go places just so people would ask me what I do.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.400
 Like people.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.400
 I don't know.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.400
 I work at Google.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.320
 You know, the thing where you ask all the questions, you know, Google.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.320
 Yeah.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.320
 Yeah.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.320
 Yeah.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.320
 I hate it.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.320
 Like whenever I meet people at some social event, they're like, Oh, what do you do?

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:08.320
 I always try to like work or I'm always trying to like avoid that topic because I don't really

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.320
 want to get into this.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.320
 I'm like, what do you do?

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.320
 Let's talk about.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.320
 Yeah.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.320
 Let's talk about you.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.320
 People like to talk about themselves.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.320
 Let's talk about you.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.320
 Yeah.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.320
 I mean, you don't say that part.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.320
 You don't say the part where they're like.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.320
 Yeah.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:23.540
 I've had various like strategies for answering that question because it does seem like that

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:24.540
 question comes up a lot.

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:28.680
 Is that just all we know to ask each other when you meet a new adult or another human

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.680
 being that you've never met?

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.680
 Like what do you do?

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.680
 America.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.680
 It's America.

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.680
 We're all about what we do.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.680
 Is that what it is?

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.880
 In like Europe, are they like, what do you enjoy on the weekends or what do they say?

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.880
 What do you do?

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.560
 What do you do in the afternoons when you have your break from that thing we have to

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:48.720
 do called work?

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.120
 Answers of work.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.040
 What brings your life fulfillment?

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.560
 That's probably what they ask in Europe and we're like, so what do you do for work for

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.560
 people?

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.560
 Yeah.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.040
 How do you make money?

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.040
 Yeah.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.720
 I guess that's all I have to say about career.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.920
 I mean, I think your tweet was good.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:13.040
 It just made me think about like in the beginning of my career, if I were on Twitter, how would

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.480
 that have shaped me?

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:20.480
 Like I wasn't on Twitter until well into maybe like, I don't know, 10 years into my career.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.080
 I was on like a head of Twitter account and I created it in college, but I didn't really

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.600
 use it until the last few years.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:32.600
 So I think like the people who are junior, not like junior developer, just like early

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:38.280
 in their career, the 20 year olds, the 22 year olds that are on Twitter and that are seeing

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.480
 us just right, stupid stuff.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.360
 I mean, you write good stuff, I guess you give advice.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:51.480
 But like the people who are in this developer community on Twitter, do they take any of

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.480
 this as advice?

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.480
 I hope not.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.400
 I hope they don't take stuff from Twitter and actually make decisions in their career

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.480
 based on it because none of it is worth basing anything on.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:05.800
 The other funny thing is like, I think you might relate to this, I feel like only recently

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:12.680
 have I even had the luxury of making career decisions because I impose a bunch of constraints

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.880
 where I was like, I'm going to be freelance.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.040
 So I can't work at any place I want to play.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.040
 I'm going to be remote.

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.200
 So I can't work at any place that needs me to come in.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.640
 I'm not making a lot of decisions there.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.280
 I'm just taking whatever the hell like floats my way and like happens to work out like for

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:32.280
 most of my career, I was just like, I had one option and I was I said, yes, and I took

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.280
 it and an object.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.280
 I said, yes.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.280
 And I took it.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.280
 Following the signal.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.280
 Yeah.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:45.760
 And then really it wasn't until me working, like doing SST, that was like my first real

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.920
 career decision.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:52.560
 Up until that point, I was just like, grabbing whatever I could, ejecting out of one failed

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.680
 situation, trying to grab the next thing.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.560
 But at that point, I was like, okay, I have like a really good job.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.600
 I could literally work here for the next 10 years if I wanted to.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.840
 I finally have the option to like decide what to do.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:08.280
 That was my first is in that was like, yeah, you know, six or seven years into my career.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.760
 That's a really good observation.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:16.680
 Like I feel like people on Twitter who are giving advice, it's make it sound like people

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.840
 are looking for advice because they have like decisions to make, but I don't I'm with you.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.240
 I don't remember making decisions until pretty late in my career.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:28.280
 It was just people will pay me money to learn and get better at this thing.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:33.120
 I'm going to do that wherever it comes from and taking every single thing I had every opportunity

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.120
 I had to do it.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:39.480
 Yeah, there wasn't like big life choices sitting with my wife, like, oh, should we go this

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.480
 way or that?

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.960
 No, it was just like, this is the thing that's going to pay me to do this, I'm going to keep

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:44.960
 doing it.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:45.960
 Yeah.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.360
 And then yeah, recently, maybe there's you've got more opportunities later in your career

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:52.040
 to kind of think about opportunity costs or whatever.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.320
 Yeah, it's it's interesting.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:00.680
 I I just I don't know it's I don't talk to a lot of younger people early in their careers.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.640
 I would love to hear from them if you if somebody's listening to his podcast and you're in your

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:10.280
 early 20s and you want to share, I don't know, John discord or Twitter somewhere find us

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.240
 or on the Internet a lot.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:18.280
 I would love to hear like, what is life like for you in 2024, especially in technology,

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.680
 specifically in technology.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.680
 Yeah.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:24.160
 And these are so different now to like, yeah, it just seems I can't even wrap my head around

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:29.400
 what it's like to be early now, like, I don't have any, I don't think I have any advice

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.400
 for that.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.400
 Yeah.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.400
 Same.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.400
 So weird and different.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.680
 If we talked about the layoffs and all the current situation, like, is it a good cycle?

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.680
 Is it a bad cycle?

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.680
 What's going on?

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.680
 I feel like we did talk about this.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.680
 Yeah, I forgot.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.680
 There's still another.

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.280
 I mean, every time we talk about us, because there's like another round and they're like,

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.760
 yeah, it's still kind of going on.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.760
 I is just a random guest, like, don't take any faith in it.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.840
 But like, I feel like it had like is tapering off, like, I know that there's a bunch of

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.840
 things that have happened.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.840
 Good.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.080
 Just tapering off or bad is tapering off like there's, I feel like it's like the last

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.400
 that companies are getting in their last layoffs.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.400
 Oh, okay.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.320
 Like getting it out of their system, just a little like whatever last ones they can get

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.320
 out there.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.320
 They're doing it off.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.320
 Yeah.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.960
 I'm sure they'll be more like every company is the same, but I'd like the big employers

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:21.040
 where it doesn't really matter whether they have like 50,000 or 100,000 employees, like,

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:25.960
 it's not going to like turn them profitable and unprofitable, like of that category where

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:30.800
 they're just like kind of trimming stuff.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:31.800
 Yeah.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.800
 I feel like they must be close to done.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.800
 And I don't know if they'll go back to hiring like crazy, but I was saying before you got

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:42.360
 on, all these companies have attrition, like 10% of your people quit or retire or whatever.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:46.520
 So at minimum, they'll be hiring at least for like a replacement rate.

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.520
 Oh, interesting.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:52.040
 So as long as they're not laying, when they're done laying off, at least go back to hiring

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.040
 in that way.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.040
 And that'll kind of re-stuff up.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:59.720
 I'm always just looking for like some amount of thing like that, looking for stuff to settle

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:03.960
 because right now, so many people are flooding the market because they've been laid off and

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:08.360
 all those people need to like land somewhere and things only to shift around.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.600
 And that's going to have impacts on what like demand for the stuff is and what salaries

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.600
 look like.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:19.280
 So yeah, once things settle, we'll know like, okay, like what is reasonable in terms of like

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:23.280
 what people will be making in this new state of things.

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:28.400
 That's where my mind goes when I hear like, meta lays off 1% of its developer workforce.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:32.500
 It's like, that's tough if you're trying to get into YC and all these Facebook engineers

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.440
 just got laid off and I'm just going to go start a company.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.200
 I mean, that it has ripple effects all over, right?

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:43.720
 People say that, but I'm like, I don't know how often that happens.

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.320
 I guess maybe they're not the kind of people, if they went and worked at meta, maybe they're

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.880
 not the kind of people that start companies.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:48.880
 I don't know.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:49.880
 It does.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:50.880
 It has happened.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:56.000
 Like a bunch of companies that come out of these layoffs, but I don't think it's like

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 that relevant.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 Like, these are the people that like post on blind where they're like, I don't know.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.840
 Like my my TC is 800k.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.840
 Is that good enough?

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.440
 Like should I just like just people in that like mindset?

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.520
 So yeah, not a good point.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.920
 And if you shouldn't be trying to get a YC anyway, remember chart your own path.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.400
 That's the dumb startup way.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.400
 Oh, wait, you're a YC fender.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.400
 I'm sorry.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.400
 Nevermind.

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:24.040
 Did you see that there was a post today by someone?

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.040
 Okay.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.280
 So there's a company called Porter.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.120
 You know, have you heard of them before?

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.920
 No, Porter, like Porter house, like stakes.

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.600
 No, Porter, I think Porter, like someone who takes stuff from one place to another, like

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:36.600
 a transporter.

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.600
 Oh, okay.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:38.600
 I think.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:43.720
 So what they're company, another one of those like services that deploy into your AWS account.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:48.280
 So they have like, you know, simplified interface for some concepts and they deploy into your

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.000
 AWS account.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.960
 There was someone took a picture of a bus stop ad for them.

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.160
 It's like says, Porter, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.160
 Yeah.

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:05.640
 And at the bottom, it says, YC founders don't waste your time on DevOps QR code for discount

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.840
 for YC founders.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:12.360
 And the sign was like near like YC's HQ.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.360
 Yeah.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:22.200
 And I'm like, did they build, do they like get an ad just to target YC founders, who they

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.360
 already have access to?

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.200
 Because I'm aren't they like, okay, if they're not a YC company, maybe this is like the only

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:32.520
 way for them to access them, but how many people do you, that's like a dedicated bus

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.920
 ad to hit like a hundred people, you know, it's kind of weird.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:36.920
 Yeah.

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:39.880
 It's like, isn't there a better way to do circles around their building?

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.960
 Maybe it pays off.

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.880
 It's just like the seems off and I get the whole things like do things that don't scale,

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.280
 but the funny thing about that is totally agree with the idea of do things that don't

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.280
 scale.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.400
 But sometimes you see a company you think is really far along, but then they do something

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:59.400
 that doesn't scale and you're like, Oh shit, like they're still pretty early.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.280
 You'll try to figure it out.

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.280
 Yeah.

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.960
 They kind of lead the fact that they're like, you know, that's still worth it for them to

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:11.520
 capture a hundred YC founders with businesses that are even earlier than theirs.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:17.400
 They probably can't pay that much money, you know, it just doesn't make any sense.

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:22.000
 I feel like that whole story probably makes more sense to you being a YC founder.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.320
 I didn't even know there's only a hundred, well, how many?

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.320
 There's not really a YC company.

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.680
 I feel like there's a thousand YC companies every year.

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:32.800
 I work at a company where I joined when the founders were leaving YC.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.800
 Okay, but still.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:34.800
 I didn't do the YC thing.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.800
 I'm one Y Combinator.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.520
 Do you have a nice or no?

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:38.520
 I don't.

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:39.960
 I don't have your name.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:40.960
 Wait.

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.960
 I thought you did.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:42.960
 I thought you had like perks.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:43.960
 You don't.

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.960
 You really don't.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:45.960
 Nope.

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.960
 Nope.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.400
 I mean, I just, I get access to those stuff.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.720
 Cause like, like Liz is looking for, like for work.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.880
 So I can ask Jay to go post stuff in the YC thing.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:55.880
 Oh, I see.

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:56.880
 I see.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.880
 But no, not direct.

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:58.880
 I got you.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.720
 I got well, we all have a by proxy.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:05.320
 I have a by proxy through you who hasn't.

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:06.960
 I need to work for some for work.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:07.960
 I'll let you know.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.920
 No, but the YC thing is so funny.

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.840
 Cause do you remember my tweet from a while ago where I was like, every time I tell people

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.120
 were a YC company, they're always like, what?

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.520
 You guys are a YC company.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.520
 It's just like nobody.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:24.600
 I was so shocked and I feel like vaguely offended where they're like, why are you so surprised?

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:28.880
 Like, why is it surprising that we're always like, what really?

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:31.600
 I think you seem, what's the word?

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.840
 I don't, I don't want to offend you or YC fenders here.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:40.320
 You don't seem like a person who would align with Y Combinator.

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.320
 I don't know.

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.320
 You know what's ironic?

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:47.240
 I actually think if you drill down to it, we're actually the most like prototypical YC

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.240
 company ever.

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.240
 Oh, really?

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.240
 Not ever.

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:54.160
 But like, you know, I feel like if you really get the ethos, we actually align with it perfectly.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:59.000
 It's just like anything else, like all sorts of people go through that program and some people

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:04.120
 go in with a mindset and come out with the same mindset, just with a bunch of new rationalizations

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:08.040
 for the mindset they already had and other people like actually like, you know, absorb

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.400
 it more and adopt it more.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:16.480
 But yeah, like we are always just doing random shit and always trying to like, just try to

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:20.120
 do stuff that people want and like we don't like narrow our scope.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.360
 We don't have like some grand vision.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.440
 We're trying to do like, we're like very scrappy.

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.240
 And I think a lot of ways that we kind of follow a lot of stuff they teach.

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.880
 I think I don't know the YC ethos.

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.080
 I think I don't really know.

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:40.560
 I just, to me, on the outside as a boy from the Ozarks, like I just, the YC thing.

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.640
 I think anytime there's like a club, I just don't like it.

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:44.640
 Can you describe what?

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:45.640
 Yeah.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:46.640
 Just like it's like a good old boys club.

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.640
 I don't know.

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.640
 I just don't like it.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.640
 I just, I see something like that and like everybody trying to get in and it's like exclusive

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.800
 and like, we just don't like it.

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.680
 Something about it just rubs me wrong.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.680
 Yeah.

00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:02.760
 I think what, yes, there's definitely that aspect of it and with every kind of exclusive

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:07.840
 thing, like you have that dimension, if you look at what the actual value is, their whole

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:13.960
 thing is they tend to like radically simplify everything that people convince themselves

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:17.920
 that needs to be way more complicated, but yeah, their whole thing, like, what do you

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.920
 have to do?

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:19.920
 You've got to build something people want.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:23.120
 Another strategy, nothing else, like just figure out how to build stuff that people

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.120
 want.

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:30.320
 And every dimension of it, like fundraising, every size, they help you like not overcomplicate

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.320
 things.

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:36.920
 I know that like lines up with how me, Jay and Frank work, but yeah, I mean, like I said,

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:40.960
 I see a lot of YC companies that do the opposite of all of that.

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:41.960
 Yeah.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:42.960
 No, I probably agree.

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:47.400
 I mean, if it's, if it's, if it's like you, if you actually fit the ethos, you and Jay

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:48.400
 and Frank.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.600
 Then I probably like YC and their ethos.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:55.120
 I just don't like the outside perception, the thing I built up in my, my head about it.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.120
 No, it's not.

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.120
 It's, it's, it's there.

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.640
 And there's definitely like a whole name dropping in her club.

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.640
 Yeah.

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:03.920
 I just have a problem with like Silicon Valley, San Francisco, the whole thing.

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.920
 Yeah.

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.680
 I just like the traditional startup mold.

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.680
 I just don't.

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.680
 It rubs me wrong.

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:09.680
 Yeah.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.280
 Speaking of traditional startup mold, let's talk about the clerk fundraise.

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.760
 Oh, clerk raised a bunch of money.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:16.760
 Yeah.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:17.760
 30 million.

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:18.760
 B.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:19.760
 Series B.

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.760
 Yeah.

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.760
 Okay.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.680
 I, I, when I saw this, I immediately sent you messages because I don't know anybody who

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.680
 pays for clerk.

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.360
 I'm sure people, lots of people, I'm sure they must be making money.

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.360
 Right.

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.160
 Wait, they must be right.

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.880
 It's not an environment where you raised 30 million dollars on pre-revenue.

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:39.600
 Well, I'm going to flat out say this fundraise bewildered me.

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.880
 I was actually very, I'm a continued to be very same by it.

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.280
 If this was three years ago, I'd be like, yeah, sure, of course.

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.280
 Yeah.

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:51.120
 It's fun about a lot of dev tool companies is our metrics are open source.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.400
 You can go look to see exactly how we're doing.

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:54.800
 We can't bullshit.

00:54:54.800 --> 00:55:00.000
 We can post all the charts we want missing a Y axis, but you can just go look up what

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 the Y axis is.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:07.920
 It's because our sites are public and I was looking at, I like tried to find the NPM package

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:09.880
 of theirs that all the other ones depend on.

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:14.160
 So like the one that would have been instead of the most and they're growing, but they're

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:20.200
 like, it's not, it's actually the same rate as SSD, like they're doing a little bit better.

00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:22.760
 But like if you look at our chart, like we pretty much started growing at the same time

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.960
 and like roughly the same rate.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.160
 And their pitch is like a lot smaller than SSD rates, like just an off thing and drop

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.760
 into any framework where we have like a harder pitch.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:34.880
 So I'm like, these numbers aren't numbers where I'm like, damn, they're like breaking

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.160
 out and like you got a, like they're like growing like crazy.

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:43.360
 And then you also put in the other dimension of how much they've spent so far, like there's

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:46.960
 been a lot of money that they raised like what, 20 million or something last year for

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:51.000
 a series A or something like that, maybe like 15, I don't know what the number was.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 Yeah.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.720
 And they have like a huge team and I'm like, this doesn't really make sense.

00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:00.000
 So like in terms of the little growth numbers, I'm not seeing it there.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.040
 Again, I'm not just all speculation, I can be wrong about a bunch of things and the series

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:09.520
 B series B's are like serious, like, yeah, they're not like, yeah, me too.

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:10.520
 That's what I thought too.

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:16.600
 Like selling an idea or selling potential, like, right, you had to have landed some big

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:23.480
 enterprise customers that tell a story that you're going to land a lot more.

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:28.200
 I think to do is to be like that traditionally is where you need to have gotten to.

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:32.520
 So I guess even though they don't have giant numbers, maybe they could have landed some

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:37.120
 enterprise companies and like the VCs are convinced that, okay, that's like the start of something

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.120
 bigger.

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:44.040
 But even then, I'm just like, then the other explanation is in a world where things are

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:49.320
 like really uncertain, are they attracted to the idea that this is a very established

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.000
 market and there's been Auth0, which had a giant exit.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 That's true.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 And they just.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.880
 This octa in the same bucket, or is it more like SSO?

00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.440
 Octa bought Auth0, right?

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.440
 Isn't that how?

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.440
 Did they?

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.440
 Is that what it was?

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.440
 Okay.

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.440
 Yeah.

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.440
 Yeah.

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.440
 Auth0 is basically the same model, right?

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.640
 As for your user.

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:12.360
 And there was a lot of problems with Auth0, and I'm sure Clerks vision, and you can see

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:19.000
 some in their release, like they're thinking about it as every SaaS product has a concept

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.400
 of a user.

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:26.760
 And given that there's like all this undifferentiated stuff that exists, Auth is like one, but like

00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:30.880
 managing their payment, managing their subscriptions, like managing their permissions.

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:35.960
 Like you can see how they're trying to expand way more than Auth0 did, and it's good.

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:39.000
 It's a good way to progress in terms of what they're trying to do.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 Yeah.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 But I'm like, yeah, this is just like doesn't fully make sense.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.880
 Like maybe you can get away at Series B with like a story still, but it's just very surprising.

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:55.680
 So I have a million thoughts, and I'm going to just, I'm going to shotgun them at you.

00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:00.680
 First of all, I guess just like scientifically look at the thing you're kind of proposing

00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:05.440
 here, which is that like MPM downloads, basically, right, of their package.

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:11.560
 Is there any scenario where that's decoupled from their, how they're making money?

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:15.640
 I guess like everyone that pays for Clerk has to download the package, right?

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:16.640
 Yes.

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.640
 Is that a given?

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.640
 Yeah.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:22.400
 But it's possible you have like three companies that like are paying a shit done.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:23.400
 Okay.

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.960
 So it could be few downloads, but lots of dollars per.

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:27.960
 Yeah.

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:28.960
 People downloading it.

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.760
 Yeah, I think this is part of the Twitter bubble for me.

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:37.200
 It's so hard to escape what I see on Twitter, which is like sure, like every person building

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:41.840
 little hobby projects is using Versailles and Clerk, because it's real fast to stand it

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:42.840
 up.

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:47.640
 But like real companies with lots of users, it's very hard to imagine paying for something

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.400
 like this.

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:53.120
 And even like, it would have to be new things, right?

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:56.560
 Like if you have an existing user, there's no way you've already built it.

00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.560
 Yeah.

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.320
 You're not going to go like port to Clerk, right?

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.520
 There's no story there, right?

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.520
 Exactly.

00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.520
 And that's why I'm very confused.

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.160
 So like if, if it is the case, okay, they landed some enterprise customers like who in

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:12.920
 the world moved all their, yeah, what enterprise is like, we're going to pay you a lot of money

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:16.600
 because we have all these users and it's just, it's too much.

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:17.600
 We can't manage anything.

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:21.520
 We're going to overhaul our auth system at this, but it's like a new work that you're

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:25.040
 now having to do to, I don't, I don't understand it.

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:30.240
 The other side of that is, do you see my other tweet about how I feel like SaaS is like kind

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:35.280
 of going to implode because here's the other side, here's the other problem.

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.440
 I don't think Clerk is self-hostable.

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:40.560
 I don't think you can deploy Clerk into your own AWS account.

00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:45.000
 From like the way they've built stuff, like very few companies have in the last couple

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.400
 years have architected with that in mind because it is a painful thing to like architect in

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:55.520
 a way where you can host it and other people can host it, you give up having some fancier

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.440
 features and stuff.

00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:03.040
 And I am really skeptical that big enterprises are like, oh yeah, we'll use a third party

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.280
 host it off.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:09.480
 Like we so quickly run, we hit that ceiling very quickly, like with our products.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.320
 There's a whole category of companies, small to medium companies that will use our hosted

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.800
 version.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.840
 Any enterprise company is like, of course, no, like of course we're not going to use

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:23.600
 the hosted version, like deploys into our AWS account, this infrastructure and all this

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.600
 infrastructure.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:29.200
 Especially something like auth and all of your user data, like that just I don't get

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.200
 it.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.520
 I totally have a million thoughts.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.640
 I love so many people at Clerk.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.640
 It sucks.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.360
 I feel like I'm always just like trashing Clerk, but like there's a lot of people they've hired

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.360
 a lot of people.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.360
 Okay.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.560
 There's a lot of people that work at Clerk, which is also part of the problem.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.040
 I mean that we're talking about here, which in terms of SaaS and imploding and all of this

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:52.520
 feeling like the zero interest rate era, like how did so many people work at Clerk?

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.760
 How did they raise 30 million dollars?

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:59.440
 All these questions I have and it sucks because I like a lot of the people, so I'm sorry people

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440
 that I like.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.440
 You know who you are.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:07.440
 I just feel like I've done a lot of Clerk bashing, but I have no motive to like bash on

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.440
 Clerk.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.880
 If anything, I have a motive to not bash on Clerk because I like them.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.880
 They're my friends.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:12.880
 Yeah, I don't.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.880
 I don't feel this is bashing.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.920
 I'm just like trying to analyze what's going on.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:21.240
 Just find and full disclosure, I actually messaged your CEO yesterday asking if they're

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.800
 hiring, not for myself because like, you know, let's looking for work.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.240
 So that would have been a twist.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.240
 Yeah.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.600
 Actually, I'm going to work.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.600
 Yeah.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:32.280
 But I was like, it would be so funny if she ended up working there because like I'm always

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.320
 like, you know, playing with them.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.320
 Yeah.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.320
 Yeah.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.320
 Playing.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.320
 That's the word.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.320
 Playing with them.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.320
 I'm always playing with them.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:46.880
 But yeah, like I don't I think so I'm convinced that I am told I must be totally wrong on this.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.720
 I'm like missing something, like I'm missing some key thing.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:51.720
 Yeah.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:56.360
 The other thing is that I feel they did say that they have they did put out some public

01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:00.120
 numbers that we wouldn't be able to clean publicly.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.080
 They said they're they're 16 million users on a Clerk.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.560
 Not like Clerk users, but like users of their users.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:12.200
 Not paying customers 16 million users registered because that's what they do is they they handle

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.200
 your user registration.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.200
 Yeah.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:21.120
 The 16 million is not that many like you guys you guys have probably have that many.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.120
 Yeah.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:26.120
 I mean, more than that monthly act is and that that that's just you on your own.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.120
 That's just yeah.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.480
 If you add up all of Clerks, I don't think that's 16 million monthly active.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.960
 I think that's like 16 million and they have registered ever.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:34.960
 Yeah.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.960
 Yeah.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.960
 So I'm like, yeah.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.960
 I don't know.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.960
 Something is weird.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.960
 Good for them.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:46.320
 Yeah, no, it's just it's it does like challenge everything I understand about software and

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:52.360
 about the current landscape of fundraising, like it just it racked my brain really hard.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.320
 I'm glad we had the same reaction.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.360
 So I feel a little less crazy because it did.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:02.360
 It made me feel like I just as a person who builds software trying to understand like who

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:07.000
 their customers are and who who's paying the bills.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
 I don't know.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
 It all hurts my head.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.640
 I feel like I'm missing some fundamental something about it.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:17.160
 Similar feelings about Vercelle, but I get that like there's e-comm companies, I guess

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.360
 that I've never interacted with that use Vercelle.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.360
 I don't know.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.360
 Yeah.

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.240
 I mean, the Vercelle case, I have, I think that one is less complicated in a lot of ways

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.920
 because I just think they're as obvious.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.800
 They're not doing well, they're doing just okay.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.480
 The Clerk one, it's weird for someone to like put in $30 million and make a giant bet.

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:41.040
 And also the leads changed like the lead investor lead investor every round.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.280
 Is that weird though?

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.240
 You don't normally see that really.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.600
 I guess like in dev tools or just in startups in general.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:53.560
 I personally generally don't see that much usually like you have a lead and every round

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:56.800
 if you're doing well, they like continue to, why would they give up?

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:02.120
 Well, yeah, I don't, I'm not like hanging out on angel lists and wherever crunch based.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.920
 I don't look at a lot of rounds.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.880
 But I know in my own experience fundraising, we've had different, like at different stages.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.160
 So like the people who led our A, it's like they participate in the next round.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.040
 But the lead was like different types of funds that do series Bs.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:22.480
 Like a lot of funds like have these hyper specific, you know, focus.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:28.640
 And it's like we do series B for farm companies, it's like random stuff like that.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.920
 But I'm sure the bigger names, they probably lead all kinds of rounds.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:36.600
 Yeah, so that that, so I think TJ, too, just said the source graph had different leads

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.600
 for each round.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:45.200
 But in this case, their initial leads were giant VC firms that technically do lead other

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.200
 types of rounds.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.200
 Yeah, I got you.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.640
 Wasn't Andreessen Horowitz one of their leads at one point?

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.800
 I forgot what I forgot.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.960
 The names are all recognizable across the board.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:00.080
 They're not like smaller funds or anything, I mean, surely, like I've never even looked

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.720
 but he's surely an investor, right?

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.720
 He must be.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.720
 I'm looking at that.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.160
 There's just like a vibe you get.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.960
 And it's like this is definitely a Vercel company.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:12.120
 And by that, I mean, Guillermo personally invested in it.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.360
 I think it definitely is, definitely for sure.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.480
 But like it's actually not weird in a negative way.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.200
 It's actually weirdly positive, like.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.200
 What is weirdly positive?

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:26.080
 That the deal was so competitive that they're old that they got a new lead.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.560
 They got like new leads.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:31.280
 Like I don't think their previous leads are like fuck this, we're out.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.080
 Like they're not, not either doing badly.

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.080
 Yeah.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:39.280
 So yeah, I can just a lot of weird stuff with this one, but in a lot of ways it's just,

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.720
 they really feel like they're like in like a time bubble.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.720
 That's how I feel with them.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:48.360
 Yeah, like they escaped everything collapsing and like they're still living in 2019.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.760
 There's no like operating the way everyone operated.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.960
 Yeah, like sponsoring all the conferences and like have a giant DevRel team.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.520
 And there's no one competing with them anymore.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.440
 It's like Clark is sponsoring all the things.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.160
 There's nobody's still living in that time.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.160
 Yeah.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.160
 Timeline.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.800
 And what's, but what's interesting is did you see what Worko S did?

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.040
 What is Worko S?

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.560
 Is that an Apple app?

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.560
 What is that?

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.560
 Worko S is like an Apple first party.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560
 Yeah.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.200
 SST's auth is actually modeled off of Worko S. There was a time where I spent, I went and

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:21.280
 tried every single hosted managed auth solution and I was like, Oh, I like Worko S's model

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:27.280
 where they just proxy forward to like real OAuth providers.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.760
 And they focus very much on like SAML integrations, like kind of like the enterprisey stuff.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:34.240
 And that's their core business where they make their money.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.320
 Then they launched auth kit because you remember they bought Radix?

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.320
 Do you remember Radix?

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.320
 Radix.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.320
 Radix.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.320
 Wait.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.320
 The component library.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.320
 The component library.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.320
 Radix.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.320
 Yeah.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.320
 Do I remember Radix?

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.320
 I love Radix.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.320
 Yeah.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.320
 So they were.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:53.560
 Same back when I used to use React, but they joined Worko S. And at the time I was like,

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.560
 this is really random.

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.480
 Like Worko S is like an API product, like what?

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.000
 This seems like a weird fit.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
 Yeah.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.680
 And they launched auth kit, which is basically a one to one competitor with clerk has like

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:09.000
 really amazing front end components that were built on, you know, everyone loves Radix

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
 now.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
 Yeah.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
 Like so integrated with them.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.240
 Insanely free.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.000
 It's like free for your first million users.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
 I'm sorry.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
 Insanely free.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
 Yeah.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
 Insanely free.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
 If you're free.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
 It's free.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
 Like everyone's free.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.520
 Everyone's got a free tier.

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.520
 Insanely zero dollars.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.720
 I don't understand how you can be insanely free.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:28.720
 Okay.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.120
 Think about there's different sizes of infinity, right?

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.120
 It's kind of like that.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.960
 No, there's not what there's different sizes of infinity.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.960
 Okay.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.320
 Let's say you have a house with infinity rooms.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.320
 Okay.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.840
 Oh, no, this is going to hurt my brain.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:40.840
 Okay.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:45.140
 Let's say in each room you put two chairs, okay.

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:49.560
 And compare the number of chairs, the number of rooms you have.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:50.560
 Stop.

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:51.560
 No, you can't.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.760
 It's not like a number that you can do that with.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.040
 This is like my son being like infinity plus one.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.040
 Yeah.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.040
 I think I'm wrong about this.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.440
 But I think you are too.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.840
 This mental model that I came up with.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:05.120
 Do you mean like insanely free in the sense like everything has a free tier, but they

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.840
 have like an insanely generous free to go.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:07.840
 Very generous.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.840
 Yes.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.840
 Yes.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.720
 I think it's like free for the first million users or something.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.000
 And I can see, I'm sure like Clark is a little bit ahead in terms of the maturity that

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.640
 product of course, but that's, that's some hot competition now.

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:19.640
 Yeah.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:24.200
 That's like some real, like they're going the same angle of deep integration with frameworks,

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:29.200
 UI components that people really like and just, and it's like, what, let me look up the actual

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.200
 thing.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.200
 Amplify too.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.200
 I mean, sorry.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.200
 That's punchline.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.200
 Yeah.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.200
 That's all I had to say.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.200
 Radix is good.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:46.200
 I saw Sam Selikov just had a, he'd put out like a Radix course, Radix is one of those

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.200
 things.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.200
 I never know if I'm saying it right.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.200
 Radix.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.200
 Radix.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.200
 Radix.

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.200
 Radix.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.200
 Radix.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.200
 Radix.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.200
 Radix.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.200
 Radix.

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.200
 Radix.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.200
 Radix.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.200
 Radix.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.200
 I don't know about that one.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.200
 Did you say it slowly?

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.200
 I'm probably going to regret saying it.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.200
 There's an invisible you.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.200
 You know, sometimes there's like a silony.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.200
 Well, there's an invisible you.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.200
 Radix really reflect on the sounds coming out of here.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.200
 Does it sound like a bad word or something?

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.200
 Rodix.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.200
 What does it sound like?

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.200
 You don't like the sound of that?

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.200
 Okay.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.400
 How many syllables are in that word?

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.200
 The way you pronounce there's two.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.200
 Say it syllable separately.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.200
 Why doesn't it do that with the other ones though?

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.200
 Radix.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.200
 It's the same.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.200
 Yeah.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.200
 The first word is different.

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.200
 Yeah.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.200
 Gotcha.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.200
 Got it.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.200
 Free for up to one million users free.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.200
 That's crazy.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.200
 One million users.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.200
 One million users.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.200
 None of you will ever have a million users.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.200
 None of you will ever have.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.200
 I think about that a lot.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.200
 Like all this talk on Twitter and like nobody has any.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.200
 They don't have any experience doing anything.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:47.200
 I just feel like there's so much talking about stuff that anything.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.200
 You know what I mean?

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.200
 Like it's just like what do you know about any of this stuff?

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.200
 I don't know.

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.200
 I'm glad I worked at one consumer facing company.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.200
 So I can say like I know how to deal with millions of users.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.200
 Yeah.

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.200
 But like that was like a small percentage of my overall experience.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.200
 But I can technically say I'm not one of those people.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.200
 That's the thing.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.200
 There's a lot of people I'm sure on Twitter talking that have success in B2B situations.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.200
 It's just so different from consumer facing stuff.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.200
 Like consumer facing stuff.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.200
 A lot of technical challenges.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:18.200
 Not that there aren't technical challenges building a spreadsheet replacement for B2B.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.200
 It's just like are there?

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.200
 But are there really?

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:28.200
 Like you're going to most have like a thousand users and like you're killing it because they're all paying you a lot of money.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.200
 But like it's just a different thing.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.200
 They're working on like their data is completely separate.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.200
 So really you have like one user a thousand times.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.200
 Right.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.200
 Yeah.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.200
 It's just I don't know.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:48.200
 Like there are times where I can submit a piece of code and then see tweets immediately from people who are angry that we broke something that's happened yesterday.

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.200
 Like it's just a different animal when you got lots and lots of people using your stuff.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:56.200
 And the hardest part is they just don't give a shit about you at all.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:00.200
 Like they're like you're like trying to get them to use your thing and they just don't care.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.200
 They can just go about their lives and not give a shit.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.200
 Yeah.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.200
 It's true.

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.200
 You're not care.

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:06.200
 All right, I got a P.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.200
 Okay.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.200
 Like really like not just like one of those.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.200
 You lasted an hour and 13 minutes without having a P.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.200
 That's pretty good for me.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.200
 I feel like I've not been having a P in the night.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:20.200
 I don't know if anyone out there's a doctor that listens to our show and they're concerned about my urinary tract.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.200
 I think it's getting better.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.200
 Now there's some stories I'll look it up I'll try to find it because I don't really remember.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.200
 Is it like a long story?

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.200
 Like I'll just say it's a quick concept.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.200
 Okay.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.200
 Yeah.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:37.200
 There have been doctors that have diagnosed like public people from like problems they've

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:43.200
 described but like very serious issues that they've like saved their lives because like they've like put together what's going on with them.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.200
 Okay.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.200
 Now new motivation to grow the podcast.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.200
 We got to get out there.

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.200
 Yeah.

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.200
 I need a doctor to start listening.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:52.200
 If anybody knows one this may be point them in this direction.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.200
 All right.

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.200
 It's been good decks.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.200
 Thanks again.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.200
 See ya.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.200
 See ya.
