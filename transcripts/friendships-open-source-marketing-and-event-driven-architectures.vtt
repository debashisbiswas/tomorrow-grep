WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
 I made mistakes, okay?

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.720
 I made mistakes on the internet and I'm paying for my mistakes.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.200
 That's all.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.320
 All right, what's been going on, Dex?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.200
 I feel like it's been a year since we spoke last.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.560
 Well, yeah, that's true.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.480
 A lot has happened.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.880
 Depends how much you want to talk about it.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.360
 It seems like maybe you don't want to talk too much about the various

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.320
 controversies that you've been embroiled in.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.640
 I would not.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.200
 I would not like to talk about it.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.000
 OK, I made mistakes.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.640
 OK, I made mistakes on the internet and I'm paying for my mistakes.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.200
 That's all.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.720
 You should have taken the advice that I gave Dev that one time where you

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.600
 never made a mistake and just always doubled down.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.640
 It seems like it would work out well.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.720
 Maybe second video is even more offensive.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.280
 OK, yeah, I guess for people who listen to the podcast,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.400
 there was just a little controversy.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.680
 I'm not going to go into it a little controversy over some YouTube

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.440
 videos I made and I might quit YouTube forever.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.800
 But that's all and no big deal.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.200
 No, it's fun.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.800
 It is hard.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.760
 It's so hard to think of you.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.640
 I mean, you do YouTube.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.000
 It's so hard to think of video ideas.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.680
 I hate it.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.440
 I hate that part.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.800
 Yeah, I think the volume of videos you need to put out, like I

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.040
 definitely have a good amount of natural ideas, but I don't have

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.000
 enough for like two videos a week, I think.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.920
 I have enough for like one or two a month, maybe.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.320
 Yeah, I've been telling some like stories.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.080
 I've been doing more videos that are just like, Hey, here's things I

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.960
 learned, you know, in my years at Stat Muse and just in my career.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.160
 And I feel like I've only got so many stories, you know,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.000
 going to live more life or I'm going to run out real fast.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.120
 You guys are leaving your house and making new stories.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.040
 Yeah, exactly.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.520
 It's so funny.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.920
 Like every time I consume anything now, like we just do so little,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.040
 just this season of life, the kids are young, like our entire life.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.960
 It's just making sure they're good.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.840
 But we just have no time for like watching stuff or consuming any kind of media.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.640
 But whenever I do, like we let the boys watch part of the Lego movie the other

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.280
 day, my three year old still never really like set to a movie.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.560
 And you only allow them to watch part of it.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.280
 Or they were only interested in watching part of it.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.280
 My eight year old watch the whole thing later.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.360
 But the three old just can't sit there long enough.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.280
 Like he just, he gets antsy after like 30 minutes.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.320
 So we let him watch part of Lego movie and I just watched some of it with him

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.440
 and realized like, oh, there's so much good humor and stuff like this.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.400
 And you watch it and you just get ideas for things you could.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.120
 It's like, if you don't consume any media, it's really hard to make interesting

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.600
 content, which is why nothing I make is interesting.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.160
 Yeah, you're back.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.920
 A lot of media is from like 10 years old, I think.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.600
 Exactly.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.360
 There's no ties to the current culture at all.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.440
 Yeah, that is that is tricky.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.640
 I realized with this controversy over ahead of video that I took down, it was my fault.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.600
 I want to just say that on my podcast as well.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.760
 I shouldn't have singled out one company, one situation, not fair to anybody involved.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.000
 And I did.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.240
 And I took the video down, but there is some rise.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.480
 Oh, yeah, yeah. So what I realized with this whole disagreement that I had with this

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.000
 person, it really was a lot of it, I think generational, like as the person

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.360
 explained where they were coming from, as I thought where I'm coming from, there's

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.360
 just a lot of misconceptions or a lot of things that I thought about

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.720
 situation wrong because I was thinking from my perspective in my age bracket

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.960
 and the way they view certain things, which is very different being younger than me.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.760
 So I realized like there really is something to that.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.160
 We're all interacting on the internet.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.360
 We're all like, I just assume everybody's in their 30s.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.400
 I don't know, but we're all different backgrounds, different places, different ages.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.080
 And it makes it hard, makes it hard to do stuff together on the internet.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.280
 Yeah, it is funny though, because I feel like I imagine that every person gets

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.320
 to a certain age where they don't really understand what like the kids are talking

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.080
 about quote unquote, but I think it like delays that somehow I like just like being

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.440
 on the internet as much as I am.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.240
 I pick up on, I don't ever use like slang, but I pick up on the words and what it means.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.960
 And this always comes up with me and Liz, because Liz is a much more

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.400
 normal person who doesn't spend all their time on the internet.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.640
 But whenever like new terminology comes up or a new concept comes up.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.840
 So it's like, what is that?

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.120
 Like, I don't get what that is.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.280
 And then I always know.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.400
 And I'm kind of like, is it weird that I know what 18 year olds are saying?

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.240
 Like, is that weird?

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.800
 Like, I mean, you think I past generations wouldn't have had that.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.560
 Like before the internet, there's no way they were picking up on that stuff.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.800
 So it's this weird, it does kind of blur the lines, I guess, maybe between like the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.120
 cultures aren't so different.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.960
 If you're just extremely online, you have a pretty similar understanding of the world.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.360
 Yeah, but I get what you're saying that because it's blurred, you feel like there

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.440
 isn't a difference, but they're so definitely clearly is.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.440
 Yeah, there is a difference.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.920
 Here's a question I'll pose to you and kind of talk about some of the stuff that I

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.480
 learned without directly going into specifics.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.400
 How many friends do you think you have decks?

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.160
 Like in the world, online, not online, maybe.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.120
 Hey, okay.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.960
 Yeah.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.120
 They're going to be able to hang a hand.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.080
 So I have, I have like old friends that I've been friends with, since I was a child.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.280
 So that's like a fairly large number.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.080
 Not that I see you interacting that often, but I would just kind of always consider

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.720
 that my friends.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.240
 Yeah.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.920
 If you remove that and just think about like my adult friends or people that I

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.640
 talked to day to day, probably like less than five.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.560
 Yeah, that no, that's how I feel.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.200
 I mean, I think part of this whole conversation was realizing that like, I

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.040
 think younger people, I don't want to generalize here or put anybody in a box.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.360
 But I think they view like online relationships are much more like friendships

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.560
 to them than maybe we view them.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.720
 Does that make sense?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.600
 Yeah, which I kind of get because even my real life friends, a lot of how we hung

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.920
 out was just through like playing video games together and talking online.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.720
 And that's where all of our conversations happen.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.400
 And there was a time where we all live in the same city.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.840
 So we would always interacting together.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.200
 But now that we live in different cities, it still feels pretty much the same

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.360
 because there was a huge segment of our relationship that was online.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.240
 But yeah, the origin of the friendship did begin in person.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.360
 But I do, I do kind of understand how you can have a pretty strong relationship online.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.000
 I mean, our relationship is primarily online.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.080
 Yeah, but I know other people just don't get it.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.840
 Like there was a period of time where losers did not understand how that worked,

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.280
 somehow I just couldn't see my friends for like weeks and months.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.560
 And I still felt like I was close to them.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.560
 So I can see how like you take that a step further and people view

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.240
 related to the people that they've never met just as strong as anything else.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.160
 And I guess like as I think about the distinction, like if we had not spent

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.320
 that week at reinvent, I don't know that that really changes our friendship that much.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.280
 I think like it's the time we spend together that makes to me friendships.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.160
 If I haven't really, if I've just kind of like existed on Twitter with people,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.760
 I don't consider them friends.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.640
 I think some of them I would love to become friends with.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.400
 But like there's got there's more time involved than just like we're hanging out

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.640
 online and public in a public forum.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.800
 Yeah, like you need that one-on-one thing too, where like it's totally different

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.760
 when you're hanging out as a group together with everyone and you're all

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.760
 interacting versus like kind of direct one-on-one stuff.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.600
 So yeah, that's it.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.960
 Yeah, but I guess it may be as different these days with the kids and their

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.760
 internets.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.960
 Where are those people already?

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.480
 It's so funny how quickly you become the people that you would have teased.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.480
 Your kids have friends?

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.920
 Like are they at the age where they have friends?

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.560
 Like I don't know how that works.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.600
 Yeah, we live on a street that has a bunch of kids.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.760
 So I mean, our neighborhood in generally is mostly young families, but our street,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.560
 it's like four houses in a row, five houses in a row where everyone has kids

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.400
 around the same age.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.200
 So they all just play in each other's backyards.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.760
 Like kind of one seamless big backyard and they're always playing out there

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.600
 together.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.080
 So yeah, I think like my oldest, he's eight.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.240
 He's got friends just here in the neighborhood.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.120
 That's basically it though.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.200
 I mean, he's not been out into like, he's not in school, he's homeschooled.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.200
 Yeah, so that's basically it's just our neighbors and the three-year-old.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.480
 I mean, he's friends with them.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.960
 I don't know, whatever that means when you're three, they're his friends too.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.360
 He's just the littlest of the group.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.320
 So it's different.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:33.960
 Yeah.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.640
 I mean, that sounds similar to my childhood.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:42.800
 Like just, you just go and hang out in other people's houses, yards all day and you come home.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.160
 But that also is kind of uncommon, I think now.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.120
 I mean, we, this is the first time we've had it.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:55.920
 Like we, we've lived a few places since we had our now eight-year-old and he's never had this before.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.920
 So it's been really great.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.160
 We've lived in other neighborhoods where it was more older people or more.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.720
 It's not families that it's probably rare.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.120
 I don't know, we love it though.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:12.960
 Yeah, because I know, I know a lot of people now, like kids in our days just have a, again, I think just from a young age, it's just completely digital.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.440
 Their relationships.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:23.080
 Yeah, I remember seeing those charts, like how, how little people like, how little people have teenagers, how little they spend together.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.240
 Like they spend more of their time hanging out online than past generations.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.200
 And it makes sense.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.120
 Like if we were teenagers growing up right now, I'm sure we'd be in the same camp.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.600
 Like you said, we did the gaming thing.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.560
 I mean, that was, that was online.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.760
 Yeah, I mean, there's a specific image that I have in my head that I'm kind of wondering if it even exists anymore, where it would be the middle of the day.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.000
 I wouldn't really know what my friends are doing because we didn't have phones or anything.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.040
 Yeah.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.080
 And I would go on my bike around my neighborhood till I saw a pile of bikes in front of someone's house.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.000
 And then I was like, oh, that's where they are.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.320
 You know, is that kind of Steven exists anymore?

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:03.680
 I mean, it does hear on this street, the kids read their bikes around and that they, I mean, it's a lot of like whose house are they at today, which I really liked that for them.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.840
 What's been going on with you?

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.200
 I don't want to talk about my stuff.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.320
 I just, I'm going to talk about it.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.520
 Yeah, yeah, no, no.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.480
 Well, what's been going on with me?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.720
 Uh, I guess a few things.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:21.240
 I think I shared that, uh, that stuff yesterday about some of the progress we made on, you know, this is blowing up now or you're going to get left behind.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.840
 Everybody just go ahead.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:30.640
 It was kind of funny because, uh, last week, so we basically, uh, every Sunday we have a meeting.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.080
 Everyone hates whenever I say this.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.440
 We have a meeting every Sunday at eight p.m.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:34.760
 Yes.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.440
 How could you get angry at the weekend?

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.800
 That's upset.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:45.240
 Everyone gets so mad that I'm doing this, uh, that I hang out with two people who I consider friends.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.920
 On the weekend.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.200
 Yeah.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.000
 At 30 minute meetings, people go, people go crazy.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.560
 I would never.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:11:01.840
 Anyway, uh, so every week we review a certain stats and the set that we've had the most data for, because it's easiest to get is a number of downloads.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.400
 So what are the number of downloads that Steve's getting every single week?

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.400
 How do we do week to week?

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:12.200
 And since January, we've kind of been focused more on marketing and trying to like get ourselves out there.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:21.160
 And that number, the downloads of the week to week number were like, okay, it's continuing to grow, but pretty much the same rate, it's always grown.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:29.880
 So we just, it kind of felt this weirdness that, okay, we clearly are being mentioned a lot more like every day when I open up Twitter.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.400
 There's like someone that's like, oh, just try to see, like it's great.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.440
 I see that that.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.040
 Yeah, that's like not something we had.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.040
 So anecdotally, we were feeling all these things and then, but it wasn't showing up in the metrics.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.600
 Um, so I was like, last week, I was like, I think it's time for us to find a new metric.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.000
 Like I don't like what the numbers are saying.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.640
 Let's find something else.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.760
 Uh, so I just was like, maybe we should look at something because the thing with the downloads is there's just so much noise in it.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.160
 Um, there's all sorts of reasons why someone would download.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.600
 SST, if we push out a lot of releases that causes that to go up just because people are updating more.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.120
 Um, so there's just a lot of noise there.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.880
 So we're like, so then this week, this Sunday, we were like looking at the numbers again.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:12.000
 And when we did this stupid thing, when we had the user, the weekly active users and the new users.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.360
 Yeah, line on the same chart.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.800
 Now, obviously the weekly active users way higher than the new users and the new users chart just always will kind of like flat.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.320
 Yep.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.480
 But then we're like, okay, let's put this on its own chart.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.080
 And then we chart it and we're like, oh, shit, like this is a huge difference.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.640
 And then we started, you know, just the lens of like how many new people are trying to SST.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.800
 And they were just like there, then the data reflected everything we were seeing as a classic basis.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.640
 Quote, where it's like, if anecdotes and data disagrees, probably the data that's wrong.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.720
 Like you're looking at the wrong metric.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.680
 Um, so just fine.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.800
 We're like, we didn't like our numbers.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.360
 So we looked at different numbers and I were happy.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.480
 Uh, yeah.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.640
 But that was pretty exciting.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.040
 Uh, it's the thing I was saying that thread is it is so hard to move the new user chart.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:05.440
 And if you look at the whole history of SSC up until January, going back two years, we pretty much have never really moved that number despite trying all kinds of things.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:11.760
 Uh, and if you look at a lot of different projects, even projects that like Astro that you're like, you know, you're very excited about very similar things, right?

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.080
 They just have like a long period of time where it's fairly flat.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:20.800
 Uh, so moving the number is very hard and it was really good to see validation that the new stuff we're trying is finally moving it.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.440
 And that should be a precursor to, you know, the actual down numbers going up downstream.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.760
 So a big motivator for us this week and it's always important to find those pieces of motivation to keep you going.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.240
 Do you think that the fact that it takes so long?

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.800
 Is it just a function of time that graph never moving?

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.040
 Like if you're just, is it that chart where it's like, this is pointless and then it takes off?

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.560
 Like, do you feel like now you've waited long enough?

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:49.120
 Yeah, we'll see how long I mean, it's less about way because there's a clear point where it shifts and we like changed our.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.440
 Like, oh, yeah, like the things you guys have been doing, like you just being a jerk on Twitter.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.960
 That's been working very effectively.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.840
 Um, so it's just like there's more change of strategy than a function of time.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:09.640
 Yeah, I think we figured out marketing like we tried a new, because before then we were just kind of doing what everyone else does.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.280
 We're like, oh, we have a new feature.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:18.480
 We do a release and we make a video showing how to use the new feature and then we just try to like up the quality of that.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:24.600
 And every time we did that we were getting these like spikes and as we got better that the spikes were bigger, but nothing that was like sustained.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.160
 It was like spiked.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.520
 Yeah, I go back to where it was.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:33.160
 Um, so we're like, hey, we, I think we got to try something that's totally not like what anyone else is doing.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.680
 And that's always a gamble, but it seems to have worked out in this, in this case.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.520
 Yeah, I'm happy for you.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:39.880
 I did.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:46.520
 I did want to point out that you've now talked about having meetings on Sunday and you quoted basis in the same episode.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.880
 So you will be canceled.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.480
 I'm sorry.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.320
 I don't like the rules.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.440
 Let me get the quote in there too.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.000
 When girl is here to one.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.800
 It's important to make our features 10 times.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.920
 Hey, I've read that book, by the way.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.240
 You tried to say I haven't read that book.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:01.640
 I know.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.760
 I like how it got to you and you had to clarify it twice now.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.560
 Does you offend me?

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.240
 It's funny.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.680
 So that's one thing.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.000
 So that's good motivating.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.480
 Um, well, always it feels like, OK, that's good, but we have like a million things to do.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.240
 It's fine.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:15.440
 Yeah.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.120
 I don't think I'd have it any other way.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.640
 Uh, the second thing, this is now boring technical stuff.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:31.240
 Yesterday, I was like, OK, let me actually dig into the whole thing with SSC and serverless and all this stuff is it's built on the concept of event driven architecture.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:36.160
 Uh, there's a very basic question that comes up with the vendor of an architecture.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.800
 When you admit an event and a subscriber and subscriber consumes the event and it fails.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.760
 How do you deal with that failure?

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.240
 And it's like your cues tweet.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:45.920
 Yeah.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.200
 So I asked like on Twitter, you know, how do people do it?

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:54.960
 Because I try and it's the thing that we do as a C usually when you're trying to do something like with your own app, how do I do with failures?

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.520
 You may be able to spend an hour on it and then you'll like just pick one approach and you'll go with it.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:04.400
 Yeah, we had to spend like a week on problems like that and then figure out what the exact best way is.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.520
 That's what I'm doing right now for that.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.360
 And yeah, there's actually so many different ways to implement it.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.920
 Like I thought I had all the ways and we just kept discovering like new ways to do it.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:20.560
 And based on the replies to that thread, no one really had a slam dunk answer where it was like, oh, obviously, that's a way to do it.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:29.200
 So yeah, yeah, it's kind of interesting because it's such a fundamental thing, but it's so largely unsolved or not obvious at least.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.640
 Yeah, I would love for there to be definitive answers on stuff like that.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.080
 Because I always feel like there's so many like, where do you stop?

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.080
 Like there's so many places you could throw a queue in between two things.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:46.400
 And it's like, I don't know where I'm creating just unnecessary bloat and where I'm really saving myself down the line.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.000
 It's so hard to know early on.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.160
 Yeah, so I'd love to know like a definitive guide on like a flowchart, like this is where you're going to need some durability and you better just put it there.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:01.840
 Yeah, because because basically every time I've done that approach of just putting cues everywhere, it's actually been good.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.160
 It's like something failed where I didn't expect it to fail or push something that broke.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.560
 And it kind of was like a kind of like a covered ass feature, like worst case ends up in the queue.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.160
 You fix it, everything retries and goes back to normal.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:19.680
 Yeah, so I feel very insecure not having that safety net, but there's like seven different ways you can implement it.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:25.840
 And the way I was doing it, I think based off the conversation I had with the people yesterday, I think I found a new way to do it maybe better.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.120
 But yeah, I was trying to figure that out.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.880
 It's just we're doing because we're building new versions of consoles and a very event driven.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.480
 So I'm kind of rethinking just for ourselves, that's the best way to do it.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.640
 And if we do discover something, we'll bake it in.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.880
 What's the you just tweeted something about something unconventional you saw?

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.600
 Oh, yeah, you just told me maybe an idea.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.760
 How'd you create the Lambda warmer?

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.680
 Do you not want to talk about it?

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.680
 No, we can talk about it.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.560
 It's a secret sauce.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:54.320
 OK, so this is something and what we're going to do, which I'm trying to figure out how exactly to market this.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:04.480
 So obviously, so much talk about cold starts, they've gone from mattering to not mattering to mattering again, which things we go to that phase.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.240
 I do think they matter.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.600
 And there's all this like stuff about do we use Cloudflare workers?

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.080
 Because they don't have cold starts to use these lighter way runtime.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.920
 But then you can't use all the stuff that you used to use as libraries don't work.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.960
 Yeah, you're doing.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.880
 Sorry, very silly avoided saying that.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.760
 I can't believe that that's become a came up again yesterday, which Theo.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.840
 I don't think they'll listen to our podcast, but if you're listening to you, I don't get the car seat thing.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.280
 It just doesn't register with me.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:37.440
 The car seat example is I just can't my brain is not smart enough to put together the connection.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.760
 So just so you know, something that I think Theo should give up.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:46.360
 Because yesterday he got into a situation where Dev had a better point than him.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.640
 And when you're getting the off by Dev, you just got to exit the game.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.680
 I love the way you treat Dev.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.560
 It's so funny to me.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.400
 He's like your little brother, and it's the best Dev is a person, by the way.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.040
 I don't know if people like that.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.040
 They're like, well, you develop it software development, Dave, the dev there.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.120
 You know, I think when people first discovered land of functions, they're like, Oh, easy.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.240
 What are called the soft code source?

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:17.560
 Let's just have a cron job that pings the function to keep it alive, which at first feels like it works.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:22.800
 But actually it doesn't work because if that will keep one instance of the function alive,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.520
 but the moment there's two concurrent requests, like two users on your site, the second user gets a cold start.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:33.920
 So there hasn't really been an easy out of the box way to do lambda warming in a way that's cost effective.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.760
 Eventually, AWS did launch like provision concurrency.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.120
 So you can just say, OK, this function needs to have 20 instances always up.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.960
 But again, pretty expensive when you turn that on.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.000
 It kind of takes away a lot of benefits of using lambda functions in the first place.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.840
 So we're going to add a feature.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.440
 We're going to start just the next JSI and we'll bring it to Asheville, bring it to everything.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.400
 We can just say like warm, true, maybe some configuration things.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:07.760
 And there is a way to like send requests to a function to keep it alive and also control the number of instances and have that automatically react.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:15.280
 So we basically send like these bursts of requests and spin up, you know, let's say 20 instances of the function.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.080
 The next time we send that burst to keep them alive, we can actually keep track of, OK,

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.600
 we spun up 20, but only three serve requests.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.960
 So it's like scaled down that so we can only keep three or four alive.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.040
 OK, we spun up three or four, but then like we had a bunch of cold starts.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.640
 So it's so we can kind of like reactively.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.200
 It's kind of like auto scaling for your lambda function in a way.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.320
 Point being you don't have to worry about how to implement another hood.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.400
 We'll improve that over time.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.120
 It's more just a flag you turn on.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:39.760
 Yep.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:45.080
 Even if you're using Prisma in a serverless function, which I've been saying about for years, even your Prisma

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.320
 lambda function will you effectively won't have cold starts.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:59.040
 And the thing with this is it kind of then brings to the question, OK, like, do I really care about these

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.240
 cloud player workers anymore?

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.280
 Like if I can just have this and it works good enough, we do the math on the cost, how the cost is

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.200
 compared to just using provision lambda.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.360
 It's like totally different.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.000
 It's basically a very marginal cost to implement this.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.880
 So it also brings to the question, like, do I even split up my functions?

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.000
 This is better just to keep one big function more.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.440
 This is where I was going to go with this.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.120
 It's like I'm torn.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.880
 Like when snap start, when they started, that first came out as a snap start.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:29.160
 Yeah, and they had it for Java and they're like, eventually, maybe it'll be no JS functions.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:34.200
 There'll be no more idea of cold starts on your lambda functions for some increased cost or something.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:39.360
 It was like a mixed emotions thing for me because I feel like I was ready for some of these things

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.960
 that are kind of made for the old way to just die.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.440
 Like if Prisma is just not good and serverless, then we'll just find other ways.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.600
 You know, I was kind of hoping for that future.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.120
 And now it's like, you have to think about things differently.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.120
 Like, well, I guess, sure, put express on your lambda function and just run and express that.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:56.720
 I don't care.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.680
 It doesn't matter anymore.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.960
 It doesn't still matter.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.880
 Sort of.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:05.360
 So it takes it basically takes away the argument that you need to fill up your functions

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.080
 for performance reasons, but there's great observability reasons to slow split them up.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.240
 Like if your infrastructures are aware that these requests are going to do different things,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.760
 your logs are automatically split, you can set up like alerting in like a nice, nice way.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.880
 So I'm so pro splitting stuff up just to stay organized and like your infrastructure,

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.400
 that give hints to your infrastructure on what things, how things work.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.680
 But it's just like a nice fail say for people that do need to do mono functions,

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.400
 which I still do for things like TRPC.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.240
 So I like like, oh, yeah, having the option.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.600
 But yeah, it's kind of like, yeah, I don't really know where there's like different avenues

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.280
 for the future.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.640
 There is these lighter weight runtimes become more of a thing.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.000
 If AWS doesn't support them natively, then it's kind of only available in the cloud

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.920
 for ecosystem.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.880
 There's a future where no JIS continues to get better.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.760
 They're saying a library gets better.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.400
 It gets better doing situations.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.280
 There's a future where you have things like BUN come out and like some sort of

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.440
 Lewis provider offers solutions, like native solutions there.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.960
 So yeah, it's unclear what the future path is.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:12.200
 But the reality is is there's a huge amount of people that will always use

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.760
 node and continue to use node.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.520
 And there's a huge amount of code bases that are on notes.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.240
 It's going to be a long time before things shift.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:22.480
 So if the node ecosystem can figure it out to get to a place to seem

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.000
 like 80% as good as the other stuff, it's just going to continue to win.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.960
 Because the other stuff needs to be 10 times better for, you know, it to get any adoption.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.360
 There you go, Peter Thiel quote.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.000
 And right now it is, right?

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.560
 What cloud workers are like, basically no cold starts.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.480
 That is like a monumental benefit.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.400
 But if it becomes like a marginal benefit, then then yeah, the current setup will

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.280
 continue to dominate.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:47.600
 Yeah.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.200
 So that's topic for another episode is your MPM package certification thing

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:53.920
 you're going to make.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.840
 I want you to make that so bad because node sucks.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.680
 I hate the ecosystem so much.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.040
 I know we'll get there.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.080
 We've got a once we get a few things done here.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.240
 I think it's something I'm going to focus on, try to just improve the bar on.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.080
 The dependencies that we have available for us, they need to all look the same.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.200
 They need to all be documented the same.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.400
 They need to have the same behavior.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.120
 It's going to be really controversial.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.240
 I know as soon as I do it, people are going to be like, one, who are you to do this?

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:18.600
 Yeah.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.760
 Two, I disagree with, you know, the 10 things that you say are required.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.640
 But I'm actually really ready for that.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.640
 Like I actually just don't care.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.160
 You live off that stuff.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.240
 You just you drink it for breakfast.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:29.520
 Yeah.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.400
 You just love.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.400
 Come at you.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.320
 I'm going to call it Dax's package.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.560
 Dax's favorite package.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.760
 It'll catch on eventually.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.400
 Dax is a pretty cool like DAX.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.000
 That could work.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.360
 I mean, there's so many products named that.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.960
 So oh, yeah, like dynamite.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.200
 What's that Oprah Oprah's thing, Oprah's favorite things?

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.320
 You know how Oprah win free every year?

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.720
 She's got like a list.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.160
 Yes, Dax's favorite things.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:56.760
 Yes.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.360
 OK, I like that.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.440
 Here you go with it.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.560
 Do it in print.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.480
 I feel like she has like a magazine or something.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.680
 You need to have like a DAX.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.080
 It's just like it's like like the Michelin ratings or whatever.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.120
 Like it goes in like some big magazine to like a write up on each package that makes

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.040
 the top 10 or something.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.720
 That would be amazing.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.480
 Please do that.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.000
 Just give photography of the the authors and spend some time with that.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.440
 Exactly.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.240
 Uh huh.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.040
 All right.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.080
 Speaking of spending some time, we should probably spend some time not recording

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.760
 this podcast.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.840
 This has been good, though.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.400
 All right.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.280
 And good.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:27.920
 All right.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.480
 See you Dax.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.200
 See you.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:43.680
