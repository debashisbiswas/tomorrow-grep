WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 So Dax, this SUV thing, how close were we to just total meltdown?

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.080
 You know, it was pretty dramatic for a few days, but in the end, I think it was actually

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.640
 kind of a boring run-of-the-mill situation, which is exactly what you would want from

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.280
 the banking sector and the government.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:46.940
 I actually think it was a great example of a rare example of our government working extremely

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.940
 well.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.840
 I think that might have gotten lost a little bit in the details.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.840
 Yeah, and quickly.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.080
 I mean, we thought we'd do a podcast today, didn't know it all be sort of resolved.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.080
 At this point.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.080
 Yeah, exactly.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.300
 I think the news was just coming out really fast.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.200
 I think it was actually happening so fast, I was seeing the reactions kind of delayed

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.200
 on Twitter.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.520
 I saw like when the news came out, you know, of how they're going to resolve it, they were

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.440
 already, you know, going down that path, but there were so people reacting to like the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.600
 initial information.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.520
 So that's how quickly they got it done, the news cycle couldn't even keep up.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.520
 Yeah.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.680
 So you said that there's been sort of some lost in translation here, like people not realizing

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.840
 that this was actually handled really well.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.640
 Could you talk about what reactions you've seen where people are missing that?

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.640
 Yeah.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.720
 Maybe we just talk a little bit about what exactly happened to summarize it.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.720
 Yes.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.640
 So one was like last Thursday, right?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.120
 There was effectively a bank run that happened on Silicon Valley bank, which is a bank that

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.040
 is like often used by startups in the tech industry.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.680
 There was news that they lost a bunch of money on investments, which with rising interest

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.080
 rates, like it's just kind of bound to happen with with some of these banks.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.560
 And that concern, the concern over that spiraled into a full panic of people pulling their

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560
 money out.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.840
 So they kind of showed down operations and then that DC came in and took over.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.800
 So I think the initial reactions were, oh, no, this is terrible, a bank has failed.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.400
 And I think there was a lot of people had memories back to 2008 of being like, oh, great.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.480
 Now the government is going to bail out these rich, like Silicon Valley investors, VCs, et

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.480
 cetera.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.080
 Because if there was a big VC crowd making a bunch of noise about this, which was also

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.080
 kind of annoying.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.080
 Yeah.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.080
 I want to talk about that too.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.080
 Yeah.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.080
 So it was, I think a lot of reactions were around this political angle of they kind of

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.560
 bucketed this as into another example of a bunch of rich people gambled and lost money

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.920
 and they wanted the government to make them whole, which has happened a lot in the past

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.920
 historically.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.960
 But this situation wasn't exactly that.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.600
 I think that's kind of what was lost in just in the chaos or anything that was going on.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.600
 Yeah.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.880
 So I think people here are Silicon Valley bank and they think like startups and they think

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.600
 venture capitalists and like all these people are doing really well because you talk about

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.760
 like this was not a malfeasance or whatever, like this was not people gambling in ways

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.960
 that are just super risky.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.280
 Like this was sort of like normal bank operations, unfortunate circumstances, and then a lot

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.600
 of fear.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.480
 But the people that like ultimately would have been hurt so badly if the government didn't

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.720
 bail it out, we're not just like rich people.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.560
 It's all the people that work for startups, right?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.480
 I mean, could you kind of break that down for me?

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.480
 Yeah.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.800
 I think the reality is is sometimes businesses fail.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.560
 You know, I've only worked at businesses that have failed, but thankfully I've only worked

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.280
 in industries where when a business I am building fails, it doesn't really ruin anyone's lives.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.880
 It's maybe annoying for someone to switch to something else if they were using my product.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.080
 But sometimes banks fail just like any other company, a business, a bankages a business

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.880
 that's run by people that can sometimes fail.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.640
 But when banks fail, it kind of creates a lot of chaos for their customers.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.120
 And that's what the situation was, there were people that were running a bank who for whatever

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.280
 reason it failed.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.720
 Those people, I understand you don't want to like save them because they kind of ran

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.360
 this thing and it failed and they should kind of pay the price or like, this system should

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.120
 learn the lesson and the data point that exists from their failure.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.960
 But the customers were just people that deposited their money in the bank.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.320
 And any of us deposited our money in a bank, we're not going to go review the bank's balance

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.280
 sheet and like, keep up with the quarterly meetings to make sure that the bank is operating

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.640
 the way we want them to.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.680
 Like none of us really have the overhead, none of us are the time to manage that overhead.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.760
 So anyone that had their money deposited there, again, just like any other business, you're

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:02.040
 just a customer, all of a sudden this, you know, this business is starting to fail.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.240
 That's actually why we have a government, right, when there are situations where a random

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.800
 person just gets hurt.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.680
 It could have been you, me, like the fact that I didn't have my money in SVB is effectively

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.680
 random.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.400
 Like I'm not like some genius and new not to have my money in there.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.680
 So people that they get hit, it is kind of random and the people, in this case, the people

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.320
 that were were hit were people that, you know, a lot of startups that employed other people.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.440
 So just having them, you know, fail with the bank doesn't really make sense.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.560
 They weren't in charge of running the bank, Robert in the bank.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.520
 Just like none of us really are paying attention to our own personal bank operations.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.520
 Yeah.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.520
 So a few things I want to impact.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.080
 One, I guess the unique thing about SVB is a lot of the customers being startups have

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.480
 huge deposits, like they have huge account balances because they've raised $10 million

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.040
 in venture capital or whatever, right?

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.840
 So normal bank fails with just like normal consumer accounts, like a lot of them are

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.480
 going to be under that FDIC insurance, the $250,000 limit.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.240
 But in this case, I think I read it was like 95% of deposits at SVB would have been lost.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.680
 You know, if this weren't, if somehow the government didn't step in, somebody didn't make them

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.880
 whole because all these huge balances at startups, is that all accurate?

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.360
 This was something that was kind of lost in some of the chaos.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.520
 The money didn't vanish.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.040
 There wasn't a bunch of money that someone gambled away and it was all gone.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.000
 It was unclear how much of it was readily available.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.040
 They did lose some, but you know, it could have just been like two or 3% that kind of

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.200
 causes this panic.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.680
 So making the depositors whole, they didn't have to look like the government coming in

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.040
 and filling in like a $200 billion gap.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.320
 And in fact, that's not what happened.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.480
 If you read the document that the FDIC put out, it looks like they were able to find

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.800
 a buyer for the gap and for all the debts and all the assets that SVB did that would

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.240
 make all the depositors whole without the government even having to spend anything, any

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.000
 taxpayer money or anything.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.200
 They do have like a backup fund in case there are like short-term gaps while the stuff gets

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.200
 figured out.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.080
 But this is a really boring part of our government that none of us really, I think we often see

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.240
 the beginnings of things like this, but we never really hear about the endings, right?

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.920
 One of my favorite stats is the birdie made off situation.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.840
 When that went down, we all heard, okay, stole all this money and this was all gone.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.800
 And it took them years to figure it all out.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.760
 And not many of us heard the ending, which is, I think they recovered like 85% or something.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.280
 It was some like crazy amount of money they recovered.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.520
 So ultimately, and they also even paid out least to most.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.240
 So if you, they actually were the investors by who had the least with them and paid those

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.800
 out whole first, yeah, and then some of the people that had more with them, you know,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.200
 they didn't get, percentage-wise, they didn't get all the back, but you know, it was a good

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.200
 way to do it.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.320
 So they just tracked it all down and then they made it work.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.600
 It takes time, but this is like the thing that they're good at, and they kind of kill

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.360
 it when it comes to the type of thing.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.800
 So I didn't know that that the made-off situation, most of those people were made whole, I guess.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800
 That's good.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.800
 Yeah.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.280
 Because you heard all those stories when the news was breaking about, you know, bus drivers

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.480
 losing their life savings, that whole thing.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.480
 Yeah.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.720
 I don't hear the ending.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.680
 So I want to talk about the takes, you said, "Oh man, now that I know we're trying not

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.600
 to cut stuff out."

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:31.200
 Some of the people on Twitter have been upset that people are expressing they shouldn't

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.560
 be on the hook when a bank fails.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.360
 It's not their responsibility to sort of split their money across several banks or several

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.760
 accounts to stand at the limit.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:46.480
 I think it's totally reasonable to think that we shouldn't expect banks to fail.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.640
 I guess the takes that bother me on Twitter I've seen are like, "It's a risky thing to

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.640
 put your money in a bank.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.640
 You should know that."

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.640
 Like, really?

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.640
 Like, is it?

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.120
 I don't think so.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.640
 Does that make you mad?

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.200
 Like, when I see those takes, it makes me mad.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.200
 Yeah.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.400
 It's like, let's kind of be reasonable and kind of practical.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.560
 You don't really want every single person in the country thinking that hard about whether

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.520
 they trust their money going into a bank.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.600
 And it's kind of an unfounded fear.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.280
 Yes, the process of running a bank is very complicated and some like FDIC closes a bunch

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.040
 of banks every year just like this.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.600
 It just happens to be a very big one.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.640
 It is tricky.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.200
 But because of that, it's also one of the most heavily regulated industries ever.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.240
 If you look at what banks look like 100 years ago in this country, that was a risky time

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.840
 to put money in banks.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.880
 Like, anything, it kind of is like what crypto is today.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.640
 Like, banks are going under, left and right.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.800
 They are making their own currencies effectively.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.360
 Like, all this crazy stuff was happening.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.920
 And all these regulations we've discovered were and put into place over the past, you

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.080
 know, 100 years or so lead to a pretty good system, a system in which a bank having a

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:01.360
 situation that, I guess, Phoebe did is effectively resolved in three days over a weekend, right?

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.520
 That's really incredible.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.080
 It's like no other part of our government.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.840
 If something goes wrong in any other part of our government, like, you're not getting

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.120
 a resolution in three days, right?

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120
 No, right.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.560
 This is a rare part of the system that works really well.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.800
 It's not risky.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.800
 There is complications running a bank, but there's like a counter measure here with all

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.280
 regulations in the way the government operates and how all the insurance stuff is structured

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.240
 with that VIC.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.240
 It's a miracle.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.240
 It all works really well.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.280
 And that's kind of what's exciting about the situation we can kind of get to witness

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.880
 that in a tangible way.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.040
 Do you think had they not acted this quickly and we had gone into this week with that

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.520
 all still kind of up near no word from the government or from whoever the Federal Reserve?

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.960
 Do you think, like, what do you think the outcome would have been?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.960
 I don't know.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.640
 Maybe it's done to even guess, but I feel like there was an urgency.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.640
 I just couldn't.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.880
 I just can't even imagine that being the case, like it was so this whole organization exists

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.280
 just to react to situations like this.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.280
 So I just can't even imagine what that would have been like.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.680
 But yeah, if they hadn't, and I think this is probably so happening to some of the great

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.880
 people kind of reevaluating where they have their money and maybe, you know, centralizing

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.560
 their money and less risky banks.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.960
 I personally use all these like weird new new banks, but I'm personally not really moving

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.960
 anything around.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.320
 Well, yeah, all the extreme takes I was seeing on Twitter where like every regional bank will

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.320
 fail.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.720
 It'll be just the big four that are too big to fail left standing and I don't know how

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.760
 much that's just extreme online speak.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.800
 There definitely is some kind of reaction.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.640
 The other thing that I saw that was also a little annoying.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.960
 And I am not going to.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.480
 I think having looked at the profile of some of the people saying this, I think I knew

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.480
 what they were doing.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480
 Like they knew what they were doing.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.520
 It wasn't like, you're talking about the founders and people investors or whoever that

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.200
 were just trying to like, no, well, that's another we can talk about.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.240
 But the thing I was going to mention were there were a bunch of takes that were like,

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:59.400
 oh, anyone with more than 250 K doesn't deserve protection from the government, whatever,

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.840
 making it seem like these were individual bank counts that were affected.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.840
 Yeah.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.840
 Like they weren't.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.000
 They weren't individual bank counts the most part.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.520
 They were businesses like, yeah, the average person doesn't really need more than that much

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.840
 sitting in a bank account.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.720
 Only businesses need that much sitting in a bank account because they might spend that

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.880
 much over the course of three months for their operations.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.320
 So I think people that was also they kind of were like tapping into the this like outrage

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.080
 thing that that annoys people.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:29.200
 So yeah, it's pretty disappointing to see just like the immediate opportunity that people

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.880
 saw to like, you know, get, get attention and get, get engagement around that thing.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.160
 It just harmful a long term.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.640
 Like, I think a lot of people are going to walk away from this situation.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.960
 Again, just hearing the beginning of it, not understanding some of these details and just

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.040
 remembering this as yet another situation where something corrupt happened.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.040
 Yeah.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.360
 Can we talk about the, the like, what's that guy's name?

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.240
 Is it not founder's fund, but he like worked with, no, it's the kind of work like it.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.240
 Jason.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.240
 Yeah.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.240
 Yeah.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.240
 Yeah.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.240
 Yeah.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.240
 Worked with Elon Musk on the Twitter stuff.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.000
 Uh, the all caps tweets, just all the like, if you don't make this right, the world is

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 going to end.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.440
 There were a lot of those tweets.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.440
 Yeah.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.440
 It was really annoying.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.240
 Those, uh, I think everyone was joking about the, the, the, I don't really fall in that

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.240
 much.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.700
 I find that guy really annoying and his whole crew, like Jason, something and, and David

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:25.080
 Saxon, a bunch of those, like VC people, um, they're kind of always chattering with this

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.080
 stuff.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.120
 Uh, people are joking today and I think they were joking and they were a little commenting

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.800
 on how they're taking credit for the resolution.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.320
 They're like, yeah, and their podcast, um, because like they were making a bunch of noise

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.840
 around around this thing.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.080
 I found it kind of cringy.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.600
 It was like a bunch of VCs were getting together being like, we are going to make this right.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.000
 Like we're going to stand up blah, blah, blah.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.020
 And we all know this is a very boring government procedure that is just going to play out the

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.720
 same way to always play it out.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.920
 Uh, it's just, to me, it felt like, wow, they just don't have anything that they need to

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.800
 like insert themselves and like, try to, you know, be relevant.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.640
 I mean, didn't they, there's a reason that the run on SPB happened in the first place,

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.640
 right?

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.440
 Like it was founders or like VCs telling all their port codes founders that they need to

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.120
 pull their money out because they didn't sound like, from what I understood that the SCB underlying

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.240
 issue where they had to raise a little capital, am I, uh, overstaying that saying they had

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.800
 to raise a little capital or am I understating, like it didn't sound like a major catastrophe.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.720
 And then it was enough to spook whoever it was, Peter Thiel and founder son, I don't know,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.720
 all those people.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.720
 Yeah.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.760
 I think they just couldn't immediately find a buyer for it.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.760
 So that was like, okay, they're screwed.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.920
 We should pull our money out.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.400
 Um, but yeah, I, I, I would guess it was like 20% of it was, yeah.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.800
 That's the actual situation and then 80% of it was just from the bank run and suing bank

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.800
 run that happened.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:54.680
 Uh, but yeah, ultimately, I think even just with that initial thing, the FDIC would have

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.680
 probably stepped in.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.520
 Cause I think you have a limited amount of time to find some of that hole before, before

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.520
 they step in.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.000
 But yeah, a lot of it was kind of manufactured and engineered.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.160
 Um, I'm seeing like crazy conspiracy takes on all this stuff where there are compelling,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:17.200
 but it just requires these actors to be really smart, which I just, I just don't think this

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.200
 case.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.280
 But they're like, this was all coordinated.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:27.560
 So to make it more difficult for the fed to continue to increase interest rates, because

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.960
 now banks are failing and I'm like, oh, that might be how it plays out because now the

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.960
 fed has to think twice.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.160
 I don't think they were going to slow down hiking just because of this, but we'll see

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:44.000
 what they do, um, but yeah, like no one, no one is that smart, especially not like a

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.040
 bunch of VC guys with a podcast.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.880
 I'm very biased against VCs.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.200
 So I got to be careful not to just say bad things.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.560
 We're going to, as he's going to raise a series A and six to 12 months.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.360
 So I might just be screwing myself, stop talking.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.000
 We just like the good ones.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 We know you're out there.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 You hear us right now.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.520
 You're probably, if you're listening, you're probably one of the good ones.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.520
 Yeah, for sure.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.520
 Yeah.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.320
 Okay, we're getting way over the top here.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.680
 So there's a few takes that I would like to hear your take on your response to because

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.360
 my, I mean, I'm just much more alarmist.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.880
 I think my immediate take in the aftermath was not, oh, wow, this was just an example

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.560
 of the government doing the right thing.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.880
 Uh, I just get swayed too much from everything I read online.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.120
 What do you think of Simon Woodley's thread because he, I mean, he's written, I think he's

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.680
 not in the United States, not from the United States.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.440
 He may have a different perspective on it from their politics over there.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.440
 I don't know.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.240
 But I wasn't smart enough to understand it.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.240
 That's why I'm asking you.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.560
 I didn't understand his thread and I need you to make an sense for me.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.560
 Yeah.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.360
 I think to summarize his thread, he, uh, his take was, it was kind of what you were saying

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.600
 earlier that putting your money in a bank is risky.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.400
 If you claim that it's anything other, you should nationalize the bank and it shouldn't

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.560
 be a, it shouldn't be like this private system.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.160
 I just don't think it needs to be that black and white.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:09.960
 There's, there, there's options of like just complete free market chaos and then like completely,

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.840
 you know, like public nationalized thing, right?

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:18.080
 I, like I said, I think banks are in a really great situation where, uh, they are private.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.240
 So you have the diversity and the benefits that come from, you know, a bunch of different

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.400
 private companies emerging and compete with each other.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.600
 Um, but you still have a heavy amount of regulation probably more than other top three most, you

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.800
 know, regulated industries.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.240
 So you don't have the full chaos.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.640
 Um, so I feel like the situation is, it's great, like we found this nice balance between

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.640
 these two extremes.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.440
 I think he was saying you can't have a balance.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.400
 It's either one or the other, which I obviously disagree with.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.960
 And I think he also was missing the point that the, the quote everyone keeps tweeting

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:53.640
 is like privatize the gains, socialized losses, which is a problem to have a good capitalist

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.640
 society.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.640
 Like you can't do that.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.520
 You have to let losers lose.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.240
 And they're kind of bucketing this under that situation.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.360
 And I'm like, Oh, like these people lost their money and we're saving them.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.560
 But this is actually perfect.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:08.160
 Like the statement from the, from, uh, yeah, Yellen was, was exactly what you want.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.560
 They're like, we're not saving the shareholders or the investors in these banks because they,

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.200
 they made a bet and they lost money.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.200
 That's good.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.200
 Like they, that signal needs to make it back.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.840
 We're only going to save the customers, which is exactly the perfect harmony of everything

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.840
 you want.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.240
 So I think in 2008, this isn't exactly what we got.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.440
 So to me, it feels like we learned a little bit in 2008 and now like we're doing it pretty

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.840
 well and I feel we're going to continue to continue to do it well.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.840
 Yeah.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.840
 I remember the stories.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.400
 I think it was 2008 when all the stories came out about what happened with all these

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.640
 bailouts, like where the money was actually flowing and executive bonuses and stupid

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:48.120
 stuff that like just, I don't know how people can do in that setting and not fear the repercussions.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.120
 I don't know.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.120
 Yeah.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.680
 But in this case, all the people, I don't know who, who's an investor in SVB?

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.680
 Like who are these people?

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:59.980
 They must just super wealthy, but the thing is, it probably is also like pension funds

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:04.600
 that invested in it and they're going to lose money, but they're probably heavily diversified.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.440
 So that like one, you know, one blow up like this is not really going to cause anything.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.600
 The 2008 thing is also funny because that's another example of all this hearing the beginning

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.640
 but not hearing the boring end.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:20.280
 I think we all heard that the government was buying all this garbage quote unquote garbage

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.720
 rated investments that these banks lost a bunch of money out.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:28.480
 So government was like, okay, we'll buy it off you to, you know, to save you.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.000
 That was kind of upsetting.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.200
 It turns out those actually weren't garbage and fast forward 10 years, they actually

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.600
 made a ton of money for the government.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.600
 Wow.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:42.680
 And the Fed actually ended up reinvesting that in a bunch of infrastructure projects and

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.680
 things like that.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:49.960
 So yeah, this is a complicated long term space, more long term than anything we like deal

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.120
 with day to day.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.000
 And these are just like the biggest nerds that are in charge of this stuff.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.040
 Like they just, they know, they know how to do this stuff and it's really impressive.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.160
 So everything is very complex and these stories just reminded me of that constantly, but how

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.400
 do you keep track of this stuff?

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.640
 Like, how did you hear the end?

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.280
 Because I would love to be informed and not just hear the big flashy news story and get

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.280
 outraged and then forget about it.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.800
 Like, what do you do to stay on top of things?

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.800
 You seem very responsible.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.880
 Well, nothing specific.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.720
 So I think I'm in a kind of a unique situation because my dad is my dad is a software engineer,

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:26.520
 but he spent most of his last half of his career in the finance world and he's actually

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.240
 a full time day trader now.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.240
 And he worked at, he actually worked at a, before he retired and became a day trader,

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:38.440
 he worked at a company that specifically bought distress assets, that was their thing.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.960
 So when SVP, coming out of SVP as an issue, they come in and they're the ones making the

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:49.340
 pitch to buy the stuff, so I just constantly hear the type of thing from him and just hearing

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:54.040
 like, we're just not, it's just like anyone external talking about the tech industry.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.680
 Like you realize like they don't really know how all this stuff works.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.200
 It's kind of similar in finance is just as complicated of a space with just as many smart

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.200
 people in it.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.600
 It's kind of hard as an outsider to really keep track or understand it all.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:13.720
 I have nothing else to say, I'm sorry, I'm just nodding it's my thing.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.520
 Yeah, my answer to your question is there's like, we just can't keep up.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.040
 There's no way I can benefit from this.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.040
 Yeah, I can't keep up.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.040
 I can't keep up.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.040
 I guess that's the one I wrote.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.040
 You want to call him up?

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.040
 You guys can talk.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.720
 I'm sure you do like that.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.720
 Okay.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.720
 Well, I don't know anything else about this situation.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.320
 So I wasn't expecting it to be so tidied up so quickly.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.320
 So that's great.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.320
 Yeah, I'm glad.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.440
 We do have some friends that had funds there, right?

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.440
 So yeah.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.080
 I mean, it's a lot of play out fully, but you know, it's headed the right way so far.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.960
 Yeah, mainly curious to see if the Fed ends up reacting in terms of their rate hike schedule

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.320
 and what they have planned.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.600
 But besides that, it's pretty much a blip.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.880
 And I think by next week, people probably will have forgotten about it.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.880
 Perfect.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.880
 Right.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:03.320
 When this podcast episode comes out, it'll be perfect timing just as if it was forgotten.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.640
 Yeah, we should rename it to remember that thing.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.640
 And so that's more.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.640
 Remember that thing.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.640
 Yeah.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.640
 It's always in the past.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.640
 It's funny.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.000
 Well, we got to do another whole episode on interest rates because I hear people say,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.520
 I don't know another interest rate hike and I don't know what any of it means.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:25.120
 And I'd love to know because you sound like you know, so that's basically this podcast.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.320
 It's turned into a DAX teach me things.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.320
 You smart.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.320
 That's basically what it is.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.320
 Here's the thing.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.320
 We're running out of stuff.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.800
 It's like the last category of thing that I know about.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.800
 Oh, no.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:40.680
 Like we did back and stuff, which you know, you know, about the same as me, then we did

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.840
 fun and stuff, which I knew a little bit more about.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.840
 You know, a lot more.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.840
 Now we're doing finance stuff.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.840
 And then that's it.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.840
 I think we have to retire this podcast after that.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:52.280
 Oh, so we could get into a topic that I know more about like, oh, it's true.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.280
 Hang on.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:58.520
 All of your individual stuff like, you know, when more than you know, nobody cares.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.520
 What do you mean?

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.520
 I want something cool.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.520
 Hang on.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.520
 Not finance.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.000
 I know a lot about, I got nothing.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.160
 I really can't think of anything.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.160
 The Ozarks.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.000
 Do you want to do some episodes about the Mark Twain National Forest?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.560
 Well, what we never did that nutrition episode we talked about.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.680
 Oh, we got to do a nutrition episode.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.240
 I still can't believe your keto.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.240
 There's a little teaser.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:24.880
 I don't know the keto, but I have keto phases, but yeah, keto phases.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.640
 I have keto tendencies.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.640
 I'm not a keto.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.640
 Okay.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.640
 I just have keto tendencies.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:35.600
 Well, that would be fun because I'm vegan, your keto, together, whereas annoying as you

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.600
 can be when it comes to your nutrition, that would be fun.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.600
 Okay, cool.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.600
 Well, that's enough for this.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.600
 See you.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:41.800
 See you next.
