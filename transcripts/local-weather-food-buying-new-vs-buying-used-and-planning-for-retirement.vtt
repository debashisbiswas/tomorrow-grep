WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 Like I should say face she's because face you face you for the clarification yeah audio only format, you know

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.720
 Look at that reinvent hoodie. Yeah, is it chilly got to get a touch of it is chilly here. Oh, yeah

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.720
 You're in Miami. It's never cold there. Yeah, it's like my first year going through the whole

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.000
 Seasonal cycle and like not being in sync with the rest of the country. I guess it's been really chilly

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.720
 It's been nice. We've had like 38 degrees in the morning Fahrenheit for international listeners

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.480
 I don't know if that isn't Celsius zero maybe I don't know

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.440
 It's been really chilly. It's like fall is here

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.160
 And it's official and I'm very excited. Do you know how I like noticed it?

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.760
 There were some video going around of like just some it looked like it was in New York

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.760
 Someone was getting into a fight and I was like, oh, they're all wearing

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.800
 like a sweater

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.200
 Just like whenever viral videos going around like that's the only way I can really keep track of seasons by what people are wearing

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.240
 Yeah, it's actually this is cold now

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.160
 Miami like it's only the very tip of Florida like the very south

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.800
 Tip of Florida that is like the very tropical weather like if you go up to Orlando, even is it start getting cooler?

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.040
 I guess I don't know if you go to Orlando ever. I have no idea. I know very little about Florida

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.680
 Uh, I don't know if I'm ever gonna know much more

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.840
 You like my name and you're not really in Florida

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.560
 No, I just remember when we moved down there it was like

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.600
 The only that south tip of Florida that you can actually grow like tropical things. Like you can't just like all of Florida is not like that

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.400
 It's it's a very narrow little strip at the bottom

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.320
 The farming stuff is interesting to me though because when we were in New York, we did uh, so we had two great options in New York

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.800
 So uh for half the year mostly in the spring summer and beginning of the fall

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.440
 uh, we signed up for a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.560
 You basically partner with the farm and the farm

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.240
 Gives you like every two weeks or like every week a farm shape box of yeah, I'm sure exactly. Yeah, we did

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.360
 um

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.360
 and it was great because

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.560
 you would uh

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.080
 Like there would be seasons and there would be certain crops that were in season and you would get them

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.800
 And Liz had this amazing cookbook that uh was all about cooking seasonally

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.080
 You just work through the cookbook and you line up with the stuff that was in season for that part of the world

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.160
 Yeah, uh, then also we had like great farmers markets that were in uh

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.120
 kind of the middle of the city pretty close to us and we recently found out the reason that

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.120
 Those farmers markets even existed initially. We were like, okay. There's a lot of people in New York

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.120
 That's why the farmers markets are there

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.920
 But it was actually more that there's a lot of restaurants in New York and those farmers markets were there primarily to like do business with

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.120
 Restaurants not necessarily buying stuff on the spot more like them coming and sampling and doing all that

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.080
 So us as normal people got to benefit from that

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.600
 But here in Miami, we've gone to a few farmers markets and that it really hasn't been very good

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.880
 To be honest and a bunch of them. We were very convinced. They just were just reselling grocery store

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.440
 Stuff

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.560
 You know how the berries come in like to the company called driscoll like the strawberries raspberry

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.640
 They that's what they had there like the labels and i was like, why would this be a

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.800
 So we don't have that but we did find a farm to do a thing with but

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.440
 And we haven't started yet like it's gonna start

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.600
 Maybe a month or so

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.760
 But like this concept of seasons eating seasonally is probably very different here and liz thinks that there probably isn't

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.800
 An equivalent book so she wants to figure it out and make it. Yeah, but yeah, we have no idea what like eating seasonally here

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.640
 Even means like is it just without the floor south florida or like do we also get stuff from

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.720
 Like northern and central florida. Yeah, do people come down to Miami and sell their other things

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.240
 Yeah, I guess like Miami you can grow other stuff

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.800
 It's just you have access to growing more things right like you can still grow normal crops

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.320
 That's what I was that's what i'm not sure of or maybe the soil so different. I don't know

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.880
 Yeah, maybe it's too hot. I don't know but I mean I love tropical fruits

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.000
 Like I love tropical fruit and it's awesome to have that be local like your local fruit is tropical fruit

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.640
 but like that doesn't

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.720
 Make-up meals. Yeah, you know more than that. It's just like bonuses

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.680
 Yeah, I love the farm share thing. It makes you like eat a bunch of different vegetables

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.960
 You wouldn't normally pick at the grocery store. It's just kind of like what are we getting this week?

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.520
 Yeah, that's a fun time. Yeah, having that like constraint also just simplify stuff because you just

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.440
 Have to make any decisions. You just get a bunch of stuff and you gotta yep find a way to cook it

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.600
 Um, yeah, that book is called six seasons for anyone listening, but there's only four seasons

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.600
 No, but there's actually six why if you look at if you look at it by food

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.120
 Uh, joshua mcfadden. I think is the author

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.280
 Interesting super super popular book. Uh and everything in there is

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.680
 Is so good. Um, yeah, some of it so much so much of it is like

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.560
 I think a lot of people here

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.560
 Uh, like you being vegan or like people being vegetarian and they just picture

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.520
 People eating boiled broccoli here

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.640
 But the stuff in this book is insane. It's not like a vegetarian book

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.440
 There's like meat and everything but yeah, a lot of it is around cooking the vegetables that are in season and

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:48.800
 It's like such crazy stuff like it'll be like here's a way to cook radishes and you just you would not believe how good

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.120
 They taste like they taste so so good and all it is is like

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.320
 Just a vegetable and a few steps and it's like yeah, one of the most delicious things you've ever eaten

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.560
 Radishes, huh? We eat a lot of beets around here. Not a lot of radishes. Love beets pickled beets

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.360
 One of my favorites. I think i'm saying radishes, but i'm not imagining. Well, imagine is not radish

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.160
 It's a small thing that looks like a radish, but it's really small

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.960
 That's like this big. Okay. Is that a radish? I don't know. I think radishes might be small

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.760
 Radishes look like a small beat to me. I think oh, I don't like turnips. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I don't like turnips

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.760
 I can tell you that I don't like the taste of them

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.400
 Yeah, I think radishes are just little beets

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.240
 Yeah, okay, I got it right there. Don't come at me like horticulture experts

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.400
 Horticulture is that what this is is it agriculture what what is horticulture?

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.400
 Did I make that word out? I don't know what no it is a word. I don't know what it means

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:49.680
 To me in my head. It's like a more specific narrow form of agriculture garden cultivation and management. It's the arter garden. Yes

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.760
 Got it

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.240
 So, yeah, do you guys grow anything at home? We do

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.200
 We grew this year. So we always grow like the normal stuff tomatoes

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.080
 Zucchini, which they go nuts

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.960
 This year we grew some melons and they took over we have watermelon and cantaloupe that were just

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.240
 Everywhere like the leaf part was everywhere. We didn't get a lot of good watermelon out of it

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.440
 Like I don't know what was wrong with them. Some of them were big

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.480
 They just weren't that tasty. I don't know what the trick is

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.120
 I know how to pick out a tasty one at the store. I don't know how to grow a tasty one

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.280
 You get the pre-sliced one like ryan florence melt pre-sliced what they what do you miss this? I missed it

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:38.080
 Okay, this is gonna be funny for you to pretend i'm not on twitter. Did you not see so ryan florence

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.640
 Like the remix

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.600
 ryan

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.600
 He go wasted

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.480
 He posted a picture

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.760
 Of like his he like once or grows sort and put it all on his kitchen counter and he posted a picture

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.560
 Yeah

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.000
 And it went like stupid viral and like people were roasting

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.800
 Him that means stupid people were trying to roast him

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.920
 I couldn't believe how viral it went because literally lizzes friends were sending

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.080
 her that tweet or like pictures like it gets like

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.160
 screenshotted and put on instagram and then copied to red that is much

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.640
 Yeah, so i've made it most the tech circle made it out of the tech circle

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.480
 That might be the most viral thing i've ever seen from someone that i like directly know

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.920
 Yeah, huh, it was everywhere, but what was the deal with the watermelon?

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.000
 He got sliced he had he had sliced watermelon and everyone was like

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.960
 Everyone hates pre-sliced fruit because it's like it's such a luxury

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.680
 Uh, but ryan had a really funny explanation

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.880
 He was like because he just broke his collarbone. He was like, yeah, I picked up the watermelon and like my collar bone

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.440
 Hurt so I grabbed the slice one

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.840
 That's awesome

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.840
 I uh, I love cut fruit. I uh, we don't I don't think we get a lot of well

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.840
 I guess so we do get like chunked watermelon. I guess that's pre-cut watermelon

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.680
 We see that at the store, but I don't never see that. I don't know whole slices of it

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.880
 What is chunked? Oh, just like they're cute. That is what it was. That's what it was. That keeps okay

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.040
 I was just picturing like slices of watermelon in a package. I don't know. I just

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:16.400
 Sounded different to me. Well, people would hate you if they found out that's what you were getting interesting cut fruit of the luxury

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.840
 Huh, there's probably a lot of stuff in my life. I don't realize they're a luxury that are luxury

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.560
 Yeah, I think it's because it's like doubly expensive and it probably is like twice as expensive as I guess

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:30.640
 Okay, another very like luxury thing. I don't actually know what suit costs. Yeah, it's I know it's expensive

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.600
 I do know it's gotten more expensive because I remember one day

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:41.120
 Uh, we were at mama jeans and it rung up like $650 or something. I can't ever remember spending more than like $400

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.480
 As a grocery that was it was like we go to the grocery store. It's like $400

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.680
 It was like 650. So that's that was something

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.680
 inflation or something. Yeah, we noticed it too. Like me and liz are

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:57.120
 Consistent like coming close to $200 for the week. That's just the edge for two people

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.000
 Yeah, that's why we're getting that much crazy stuff out of there. Yeah, it's getting out of hand

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.800
 Yeah, we can do it. That's one air. It is one area that I'm like very okay spending money

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.080
 Yeah, no, same

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.920
 So just kind of the thing we spend most of our money on actually yeah, I thought I was thinking about this other day like how

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.360
 Stuff just caused such like a wide range of money

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.880
 But then if you think about it in terms of joy that it brings you sometimes some luxury goods are actually super affordable

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.120
 And the reason I was thinking about this was

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.520
 So my soap that I use in the shower. Yeah, it is that fancy

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.400
 I'm freaking breaking the brand now. What's that fancy soap brand? It has all like the fancy stores

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.560
 Uh, oh wait, so we get a fancy soap called uh

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.760
 Oh, no, I don't know if they have stores

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.560
 I can't remember the name. I'm sorry. I think it starts with this. Okay, not going to help you

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.480
 It's I think it's local nevermind their stores are really cool and all they sell are like

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.200
 Just like this like one kind of soap. I mean they have like a different flavors or whatever

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.680
 Um flavors if you look at it

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.360
 It's all like it's all like uh

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:09.760
 Food related flavors. Oh like it's always like citrus or like coriander and all these things that you expect. Yeah, I gotcha

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.600
 Oh, I got a bunch of about popcorn too after this. Oh, okay

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.960
 That's random

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:23.040
 So if you look at it if someone saw me getting soap from there, they would be like oh, that's like the most excessive

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:29.200
 Luxurious thing because yeah one bottle of soap is expensive. It's like 50 or 60 books. Yeah, but

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.760
 You can look at it another way where it's like

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.400
 Well in a year. I need two of those so it's a hundred bucks

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:43.440
 And it makes every single day of my life. Yes, meaningfully better like anytime. I go take a shower. It is like

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.520
 So much better

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.600
 And there's so many things in life. You would just drop a hundred dollars on that are way less impactful

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.320
 So that's like the it pinned me of a luxury good, but

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.120
 I don't see it as a luxury good because it just so like the ratio

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.480
 Yeah, yeah, it's I feel about my sauna and my cold plunge every day of my life. They're worth the investment

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:10.240
 Can I say something without uh all the financial nerds coming at me?

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.920
 I like buying new stuff

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.440
 I it brings me joy to buy something that's new and I feel bad when it's been used. I don't know maybe that's terrible

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.400
 I'm destroying the planet or something. I'm sorry, but

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:27.040
 There you go. I'm gonna buy a new stuff so other people can buy old exactly. I sell a lot of stuff

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:33.280
 Used to other people who don't mind buying you stuff. So I've gone the other way where for some reason my whole life

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:39.520
 My I just was just I was just like unaware that you could buy things secondhand

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.480
 and I think it was like it's like a weird cultural thing like for me from my mom like the idea of

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.440
 having something secondhand is like

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.960
 really

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.960
 Weird to her not because she's like

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:57.440
 Super rich or anything like just because it wasn't an option. Yeah, it's just like I don't know but no not even that like now

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:03.280
 If we talk about it to her it's like some core thing in her where it feels weird

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.720
 But I don't I don't understand where it comes from because I'm sure like when she grew up in india like stuff was

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.680
 Secondhand all the time. Yeah, but if she has like a weird thing was growing up. I never

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.400
 Just it just didn't register me. That was an option

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:23.440
 So now all of a sudden I'm like, oh, I can buy things secondhand and it feels like I'm twice as rich as I was before

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:29.360
 Because now all this stuff that I wouldn't consider buying it's like an option now or like it's like a crazy discount

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.080
 So I'm like realizing I'm realizing that. Oh, yeah, I'm like realizing that

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.840
 That's an option like yeah, it's a psychological thing for me. I must have your mom's issue like for me

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.840
 There's something about

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.120
 Someone had it and did stuff with it before me. I just I can't do it

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.200
 It's not like I like the new car smell. It's not like that. It's just like

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.000
 I want to know that it came from the people who made it and it is in my hands

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.320
 That's probably terrible financially environmentally whatever

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:04.000
 It brings me joy. Okay. So every single thing I buy brings me joy get off me

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 That says it's soap. I have all the things I purchased

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.240
 Yes, I have my hundred dollar soap and you have all these other things

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:20.160
 Uh, so then speaking of things to buy so my friend just got really into popcorn recently

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.040
 Okay, and he's he showed weird flex but okay

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.320
 It's not a flex. I know

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:32.080
 Uh, he got into this thing called the whirly pop and this is

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.960
 uh again going back to

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:41.840
 Ratio of like cost impact it's a $30 thing. It's it's just it's just like a pot that you put on your

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.680
 So yeah, it has a gahank crank that like spins everything inside of it. Okay

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.320
 To pop your popcorn more evenly

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:56.480
 So yeah, basically you put the corn kernels in there and you spin it and that makes it something about that makes so it pops

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.560
 As fast as like microwave popcorn. So it's like done within okay a couple minutes

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:09.680
 So it's almost as convenient and there's no kernels left over and it is burning. Okay. No burning at all. Yeah, uh, so I got one

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.960
 Last week and I tried it and always add so or was that a new?

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.960
 No, I got a new so 30 plus

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:25.200
 Say it's also not like the most well-built things. I don't know if it's gonna last to make it second hand, but yeah

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.560
 And then they like

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.840
 Give you all this like fancy. Okay. I don't know what how much of a difference like the corn makes like how good can you make the corn?

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.120
 But it did taste very very good and all we did was add salt like we didn't even have butter

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.120
 Uh, and it was very good. So this is upgraded my popcorn

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.440
 by like double I would say wow now we're never watching you fold an order of magnitude

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:52.320
 Yeah, is that an order of magnitude? I never know what that that phrase is. I always okay in my head

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.160
 I use it all the time, but in my head, it's like

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.400
 For me, it means like oh, it's not like a 5% gain

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.200
 It's like a multiple gain and then whenever it's that I say order of magnitude. Yeah, I think it's like if you

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.800
 Not how it works. I think it's like if you go from 10,000 to a hundred thousand

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.320
 It's like the next zero. Yeah. Yeah, zero. Okay. So two times would not be an order of magnitude

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.640
 My my mistake, but in my head it is. Okay, so then it worked

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:27.280
 So I as a person who gets into a lot of things did not know you could get into popcorn. I'm interested though

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.400
 You've got me entry. Do you guys eat popcorn? Oh, you got a movie theater. We yeah

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:38.400
 So we buy just like the it's a lesser evil they make like a bunch of different flavors of popcorn

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.880
 It's just a microwave. No, it's just a bag

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:46.800
 I was like warm. I'm realizing now. Wait, you're just buying pre popular. You got a long way to go

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.440
 I am so far from being into popcorn. I really gotta stop it up. Just a pre-popped one

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:57.200
 No, it's it's really I'm gonna be on the forums like mr. pop or whatever the forum is for popcorn

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.520
 I'm gonna be deep in this stuff. You're $30 a little whirly whatever

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:07.840
 Whirly just wait. Just wait. Here's the thing brass. Okay. Go ahead. What they do sell a copper one

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.840
 Which is like $60

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:17.680
 Yeah, I think this is uh, I don't know to me. I'm like, okay. This is great. Every time I watch a movie

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.280
 I'm just gonna have to routine of making a popcorn. Yeah, and you can do a lot of faults

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.360
 And like you can put real butter on it. Whatever you want. Mm-hmm. Yeah

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.720
 You can use grass fed corn kernels or whatever

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.920
 Oh

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:40.160
 What is mind-blowing to me is how little corn makes so much popcorn like oh really whatever you're imagining

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:45.680
 It's like five times less than you're imagining like a bowl of like corn the number of little kernels

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:51.040
 I think like how much per cob. Okay. I see enough popcorn or like really fill you up

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:56.800
 Is like less than one cob of corn. Oh interesting. Yeah, because I guess there's a lot of little kernels on a cob

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.800
 Wow, but it makes no something because I can eat a cob of corn with like no worries

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.360
 Yeah, but you can just eat popcorn for a long time like a big bowl of popcorn

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:11.520
 Yeah popcorn is one of those snacks. You can just like I like something I can eat a lot of volume of and it's not a lot of like

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.080
 Density. Yeah, but I think when you add the salt and the butters are to feel well sure. Yeah

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.840
 Feel like more because I get pretty full eating popcorn. Really. Do you ever eat the honeycomb cereal

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.640
 Grown-up or still I haven't had it before it is very good. All that stuff. It's just candy though

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.600
 It is. Yeah, but it comes in like a box like three times bigger than any other cereal box

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.000
 Because you can literally just eat the entire box and not notice like there's no

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.480
 Whatever substance to it. It's like in a lot of cereals of that way, but honeycomb takes the prize for

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.760
 I could eat the most honeycomb without ever feeling full

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.600
 Like bowl upon bowl upon bowl. Do you guys do breakfast? Like what do you have a breakfast routine?

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.000
 We don't really do the same things. So

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.200
 I generally so lately I've done this like smoothie. I make it's just got everything in it

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.080
 But then like this morning, it's just too cold. It got cold and a cold smoothie. Just not do it for me

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.160
 Like I'm in pants and a hoodie

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.840
 So I made a little oatmeal with cherries in it and then I take a half a block of tofu

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.840
 And I crumble it up in a bowl and I season it with

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.000
 Turmeric is it turmeric or turmeric? I've always heard turmeric

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.760
 And it is the spice of my people so you should it's how it's spelled, but we've always said turmeric

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.760
 And then I'm like, oh, we're from Missouri, so we're probably just

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.320
 We live in the Ozark

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:37.520
 Uh, so turmeric and black pepper and that's a little salsa and avocado on it. It's delicious

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.720
 It's a little tofu scramble. So that's why I did this morning. So the reason I'm asking is because

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.960
 Uh, I love Miami, but I think that we don't

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:51.280
 Have good breakfast. We have great others like everything else, but

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 uh, growing over the northeast

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:01.920
 So in the town that i'm from randomly there's like an extremely famous bagel place there like, uh, it's been on tv shows and stuff

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:08.640
 And a treat would be going there and getting a jalapeno bagel pork roll with cheese

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.280
 And this is like the most delicious thing in the world. The bagel itself is so good

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.640
 Pork roll, classic new jersey thing the cheese amazing

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.360
 Um, then in new york, obviously bagel like great bagels, which is everywhere

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.000
 So like a really good breakfast

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:32.240
 Under 10 bucks, but so like fantastic you just go grab a really good bagel. Yeah, there's not a single good bagel in Miami

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:39.200
 I've tried a bunch interesting. There's one that people say is like good and i'm like, okay, it is like decent compared to other stuff, but

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:45.520
 We just struggle like there's no good bagel option. So that means that if we want to like do some kind of

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.240
 Breakfast on saturday where we're not making it

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.560
 There's just not an option. I'm like, I don't know how to resolve this

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.800
 I mean, I guess we make all of our breakfast. We don't really have a breakfast option where we can go somewhere

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.560
 But if you wanted to get a bagel like do you guys eat bagels?

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.880
 They eat bagels almost every morning, uh, we just we get them at the store and we put well

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.800
 They're just like grocery store bagels that we put in the toaster

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:14.000
 They're okay. I don't know that we've gone through a lot of different ones to find the ones they like at the grocery store

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.000
 Uh, but they put like paper and jelly on them. So I don't know the bagel doesn't really shine. Oh, it's not like a bagel

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.840
 You'd get it a place. I'm sure. I mean, maybe i've just been spoiled by growing up where I grew up because isn't like new york

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.800
 Like the bagel place like that's where you get the bagels

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.960
 Yeah, and it just it's just confusing to me when something is that popular

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.120
 It's not like more replicated and everyone has like their weird explanation of it

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.560
 There's like the water is different and that makes the bagels come out bad or like the air is different

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.240
 So I need kind of like bait type of thing. Well, the air being different

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.480
 Known for its excellent water and air quality. That's what I hear

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.080
 Maybe the point is not to be excellent. Oh, the poor quality. Yeah, okay

00:21:54.080 --> 00:22:00.560
 Just whatever whatever's going on there produces. Huh, New York and New Jersey's fantastic bagels across the board

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:06.000
 Interesting pizza like pizzas also like not well replicated across the country and that's also kind of confusing

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.080
 Yeah, what food does Miami have?

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.880
 I mean, you got mangoes if we had mangoes growing in our backyard. That's what we need for breakfast every day

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.360
 Well, mangoes don't grow every single day. Oh, that's true. Okay. That's what that's what sucks about

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:24.240
 Farming in general. It's like you go most of the year not having something and then for a two-month span

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.960
 You have way too much of it. Yeah, you can't spread it out. Yeah, it's like grains

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.680
 You can put in a big silo and like last year all year, but tropical fruit

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.880
 Just gonna rain down one day now. You gotta make marmalade now. That's the best you can do marmalade. There you go

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:44.480
 Yeah, oh some mango marmalade sounds are really good right now. Sorry. We have really good just

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:50.640
 Everything else besides breakfast like I have uh, I mean, this isn't a year vegan. So this doesn't work

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.720
 But like we have like crazy good

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.680
 uh

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.080
 Like barbecue like but like not like American barbecue more like South American barbecue

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:03.280
 Which I really really like we have that in Kansas City right here. There's a lot of barbecue

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.160
 I'm just trying to relate with you. I'm trying to

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.520
 I live in New York. We're close to Kansas City

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:15.280
 Yeah, so we like I'm fine everywhere. It's just the breakfast like last week

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.160
 We did go to brunch and there was we went to a really good spot and it was really delicious

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.240
 But you know it was a chicken sandwich. I got a chicken sandwich which for breakfast. Oh for brunch

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.480
 And it was really really good, but you know, it's not it's not a really classic breakfast. Yeah

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.320
 Yeah, we make a lot of waffles

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.680
 Do you guys ever make like pancakes or waffles at home? No, but there is a spot

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.600
 We go do that does these really good banana pancakes, which I'm not even usually a fan of

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.080
 Banana stuff, but banana. These are

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:46.800
 Wow, like very good. You're not a fan of banana stuff. Oh man. We eat so many bananas. I like bananas themselves

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:52.160
 Yeah, I like bananas. Just not them in stuff like banana bread or actually maybe I do like banana

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.880
 You're a banana guy. It turns out

00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:00.000
 I'm never out there trying to like get banana stuff, but if it's around I guess I enjoy it

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.120
 We used to buy bananas by the box and this was before we had the boys like just Casey and I we bought a

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:10.400
 literal box of bananas every other week because we freeze them and we make banana ice cream

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:15.920
 Uh, so good. Have you ever had banana ice cream? I feel like most of the world has not happened in ice cream

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.760
 And you guys are missing out. Okay, it's delicious. This tastes like vanilla ice cream

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.040
 Yeah, okay

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.440
 You see freezer bananas when they're nice and ripe like a perfect banana goes in the freezer

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.440
 Uh, and then you just blend it up and it makes just the bananas blend it up when they're frozen

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:38.000
 Makes this like soft serve vanilla ice cream taste and texture. It's that easy. It's that easy

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.160
 Well, so there's a bit of a science to like

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:52.080
 One we're just constantly having to keep bananas in a cycle to where we have like

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.000
 And put them in a bag so that they're already kind of easy to drop into the blender

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.040
 You don't just put like a whole banana in there. It's really hard to peel once they're frozen

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.480
 Uh, but yeah, it's that easy. You put them in a blender if you've got a good blender

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.560
 We've got a Vitamix that does great with it. You got ice cream in like one minute

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:12.320
 Yeah, there's a bunch of things like that where it's actually easy once you have the logistics down. Yeah

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.320
 Like it's a little bit of learning

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.360
 Uh, it's very easy to make but like you need to have

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.080
 certain habits around it

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:26.160
 Interesting. Oh for stretches. We'd go through different kicks. Like we'll do chocolate cherry

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:32.000
 We'll do like cocoa and peanut butter in it and you can just put whatever in it to flavor it and man

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.440
 It's good. It's so good and it's bananas. So there's no like sugar dump. You don't feel like

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.640
 I don't know if you eat a big bowl of ice cream. Oh, bananas are great

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.960
 Yeah, I used to and I still eat like when I was I was playing a lot of sports growing up

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.800
 I'd always just eat bananas in the morning

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:51.200
 And sometimes I just like go by I think I've been as an eat them during warm-up at the beginning because they're like

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.200
 Yeah, perfect. Oh, yeah, they're great for pre-workout. Yeah, yeah, yeah

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.640
 They're bananas are good breakfast. Oh, yeah, great breakfast

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:05.760
 Do you like all the different varieties of bananas since you have access in Miami my sore banana the best banana wait, which one my sore

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.920
 That is those indian

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.880
 I'm not sure tastes like a it literally tastes like a like a green apple. It's delicious

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.040
 Yeah, I had a banana here

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.640
 Last year and I was like this is a multiple just thing I've ever eaten

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.760
 But I didn't keep track of like where it came from. Yeah, but yeah, it's like I think we've already talked about this

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.240
 Banana and all that we're gonna. Oh, we're gonna run out of stuff to talk about eventually

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:33.360
 Like we are not interesting enough people. We're gonna eventually cycle back through every single topic, aren't we?

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:41.040
 Yeah, I guess not if tech not if tech keeps on being tech and giving us new things to talk about

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.200
 Well, is there any new things in tech for this week? I don't know. I've been really hits down

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:53.440
 Like what feels like a year. Is there anything new going on? What what? Yeah, what tell me catch me. Oh, that's nothing

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.200
 Let me oh there's nothing. There is really nothing

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.360
 Oh, I heard uh centuries donating much of money to open source and people got mad

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.080
 There wasn't enough money

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.320
 Why are people like this? It's just like

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.720
 I can't imagine a more annoying trait than

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.920
 I know who are these people in person like

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.320
 Have we ever run into these people in person? I just didn't notice that

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:25.120
 Oh, that's those jerks to me. This is such an egregious thing where someone donates something and your first reaction is to like

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:30.320
 Find some way to be upset about it. I don't care about any other personality trait you have

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:37.920
 Yeah, that is like enough for me to be like I don't like you suck. Yeah, I can give you entirely your entire being off of this

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:44.160
 Are they just bots? Maybe they're not maybe like the the bull case for humanity is the person that was

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.120
 Oh, you know, it was kind of weird the person that was that initially like

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.400
 kicked that off was the founder of front and masters, I think

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.840
 Oh, really, but not like a rando kicked off the

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.560
 the negative

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.040
 attention on center. Yeah, it's funny because like

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.040
 He did that thing where he was just he didn't say anything explicitly. He was like

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.720
 Here's how much they raised in vc. It was like 200 something million

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.480
 Like clearly he was letting he was like there was a clear implication there

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:19.200
 Yeah, but didn't like say explicitly. Like they suck. He just let the reader kind of come to that conclusion

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.960
 Interesting. I'm experiencing this thing where I've had a bunch of

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.800
 Ways of doing things or opinions that were a little bit

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:34.560
 At least initially they were like maybe counterculture or like a little bit opposite or contrarian

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.520
 You say you take things like working remotely at some at some point that was like pretty contrarian

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.120
 You take like not going a typical vc path. That was like at some point kind of contrarian

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.320
 But enough time has gone by where they're no longer contrarian. There's like a lot of people that

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.960
 buy into that stuff. Yeah, but now i'm finding those people extremely annoying

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.080
 I don't know what to do. It's like

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.720
 Uh for a while it was very like, you know

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.400
 Not into the whole vc thing and now there's a lot of people that are like

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:08.720
 Like looking for alternative ways, but I find them extremely annoying

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.400
 They're like they're on my side, but they're like representing it and like they're really stupid and annoying way

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.040
 Yeah, you can't talk about that. So now i'm gonna be i'm gonna be pro vc now because like

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.720
 Yeah, you just want to go against those annoying people

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.640
 Yeah

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:28.000
 Which just makes me wonder if I ever had any rationale or if I was just if i'm just one of those people that just want to do the opposite

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.640
 You're always just contrarian. You just want to be the opposite

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.920
 You know, you really can sound pretty smart if you just take anything a lot of people are saying and say the opposite

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.040
 Like just the contrarian thing you can basically just sit there and think for 30 seconds

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.760
 What does everyone seem to agree on and like oh actually

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:49.600
 If you look at it from the other angle and you've said stuff about this in the past like it really comes down to judgment

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.320
 And there is no like universal truths and anything

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.720
 It kind of ties into that, right?

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.600
 Yeah, I think that magic actually because I see people like

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:03.280
 Attempt this and like completely miss uh, where they just try to like say the opposite and it's like oh, yeah

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:08.400
 It's just a dumb point. I think the key is to look at both sides and explain why both of them are wrong

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.760
 Yeah, that's the only way to really be contrarian because then you're truly on an island by yourself

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:20.880
 If you can pull that off, I think then you can sound smart. Okay. Well, I don't want to sound smart because that sounds like

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.080
 I can't leave. I just saw my camera. You haven't said anything about my two black eyes

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:32.480
 Did you just think ask it? Oh, you're working. Yes. Okay. I couldn't tell it. Maybe it wasn't I thought maybe it wasn't shown up as much on camera

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.160
 Which you can't see it that much to me. It looks like two little dirt smudges

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:41.920
 So, okay, I don't want to be like your face dirty. No, it was swollen yesterday. They're not so swollen now

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.680
 Uh, got a fight and at a bar and now I'm just kidding

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.080
 It was a jiu-jitsu

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.480
 Uh, but I've done jiu-jitsu for like three months and for some reason on back-to-back days

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.120
 I got one cheek like right below my eye and then the next day got the other cheek

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:02.000
 Apparently I can't like I came back after two weeks. I was sick. You know, I haven't trained for a while

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:08.160
 Came back and apparently I'm really bad at defending my face, which I didn't know is a thing. You can't hit the nose. No, just uh

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:13.760
 Maybe I don't know. I thought black eyes happened because like you get hit in the nose and the blood like leaks out

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:19.680
 Well, it's not really a black eye like it's below my eye area. It's kind of more on my cheek. Does it hurt?

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.680
 Yeah, it did it first. It was just this one was pretty swollen. The other one's pretty small

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.440
 I'm kind of confusing because you're not getting punched into it. Well, no, that's what I can't figure out is

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.760
 I don't know like I don't know how

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.440
 It happened to my face. I think somebody was on top of me and just they're ghee

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.440
 Maybe drove into my my face a little bit

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.160
 I don't know, but it never happened to me in three months of training and then back-to-back days

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.160
 Got both my face cheeks. I should say face cheeks

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:49.600
 Yeah, the audio only format, you know

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:57.360
 Uh whenever you say gee, it's like funny to me because I think about like clarified butter, you know, because I'm sure you guys

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.360
 don't know

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:07.440
 Yeah, like g h e yeah, that's not how you spell it. Yeah. No, it's just g i g

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:14.960
 Which is really hard when i'm like trying to say plural geese. I'm like my geese and it's like gis. Is that right?

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.120
 I don't know. Maybe is geese

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:22.000
 The thing is how you say it. I don't know. I just never know how to refer to multiple g

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.800
 Maybe it's like mice. No

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.680
 Mouse mice. What am I thinking of?

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.840
 Oxen. No, what am I thinking?

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.920
 What's the animal that's the same?

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.160
 It's like deer deer. Yeah, there's not deers. It's just deer

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.520
 Yes, there's a really funny like uh, I think it's brian rakin skit

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:46.000
 About this like trying to explain the rules of english

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.320
 And it was it goes into that stuff like so you have like

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.080
 ox

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.080
 And more than one ox is oxen

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.600
 So if you have a box. Oh wait, I did see this. I did see this. Yeah, i'm doing a terrible

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.760
 Is the one with the he has like he has the uh

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.560
 The clipboard not the clipboard like it's like visual. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Yeah

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:12.320
 Like he's writing it out like okay. That makes sense. So yeah, i'm doing a terrible job of

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.920
 Reenacting it, but so that did remind me for some reason

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.960
 Uh, did you see that theo is putting together a new course?

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.960
 No

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:28.800
 Wait theo's doing a course. No, no, no, but it's not what you think it's he called. He's calling it dev rel 2.0

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:37.120
 And dev rel course. Okay, so he knows a lot about that. Well, it's funny because uh, he's targeting it at

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.520
 Companies like he's gonna make it very very expensive

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.840
 So like it's not for like the individual person

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.120
 Which is to me was very clear from what he posted

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.440
 But then if i look at the replies is all like individual people being like i can't wait to buy this i'm like

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.160
 Oh, no, no, he hasn't posted a price. I know the price trust me like the average person is not gonna buy

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:59.600
 It makes no sense. Is it like the company buys it for like the whole company?

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:03.520
 Like the whole company has access to it. I think that's it's something like that

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.640
 Some like yeah, it's it's meant to be that the person paying for it as a company

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:11.120
 Yeah, it's not like gotcha. I'm an individual trying to be a dev rel person. This is a course for that

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.760
 It's trying to come a dev rel and get hired. Yeah, no

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:19.760
 It's like your strategy as a dev rel company or as a company who has dev rels. Yeah, yeah, and he laid out like

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.200
 What he shared was a bunch of the chapter titles

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:27.840
 Mm-hmm and just based off of those like I think it's all stuff that I agree with. I think it's all stuff that

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.240
 That we try to do at sst

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.000
 Yeah, I think it's gonna be really interesting because I like I said I agree with it

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.640
 I think it's you know most I probably agree with most of it

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.040
 I think it's probably the right strategy. Yeah, to me

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.720
 It's one of those things where it's actually very simple and very correct

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.040
 But I don't think most companies can pull it off

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.560
 Um, but this is gonna be the first time it's at least spelled out

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.400
 In a very clear way. Yeah, I mean there's been so little

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:58.320
 Like formal anything around dev rel, right? It just kind of like dropped up out of nowhere

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.080
 And everybody's just kind of winging it

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.600
 He's calling it dev rel 2.0 because there is like an established somewhat

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:09.120
 Sadist quo how you do dev rel is just companies copying other companies and yeah like we need to

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.760
 but is it effective does this it's not it's not very effective and I think it's actually

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:18.240
 I would say harmful best case is neutral worst case. I think I actually hurt your company

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:23.760
 I always go back to stripe everyone loves stripe all developers love working with stripe and I've never heard of a stripe dev rel

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.520
 I'm sure they have them

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.480
 but like

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:33.040
 They just have really good docs and a really good api and like dev's want to use it because they have those things

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.040
 Is it is that too simplified? I think there's like a spectrum of companies

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.360
 There's companies that are like stripe where

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:45.120
 Okay, you have an api. Your product is an api so you need to make stuff that faces developers

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.360
 I would say that's like

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.200
 On the spectrum of stuff in the dev tool world. That's like the lightest way you can

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:59.520
 Yeah, I see your sand then the other extreme is something like a gashro where it's like, yeah, you know a much deeper thing whole developer experience. Yeah

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.920
 yeah, um

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.920
 and you know obviously there's like

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.040
 different strategies depending on where you land but

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.240
 I found the stuff that is targeted at developers like more directly like stuff

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.480
 That's very important key parts of your framework or like your database or things like that

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.360
 Yeah, I've overall found like the dev rel approach to be completely ineffective

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.200
 um

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.840
 And on some level i'm like a little worry because I feel like we have actually figured it out at sst

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:33.360
 And i'm like, I don't I don't want. Oh no, he's gonna make a course that shares your secrets. Oh, no

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.080
 I mean, it's always stupid to think that way because ultimately what I believe is

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.400
 This stuff is actually very simple and I don't think even if it's spelled out for

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.040
 the vast majority of people in this space that

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.440
 It's actually yeah

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:54.480
 I think what with a separate thing what happens is people like in just information and they're really excited by it and they agree with it

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.040
 And they turn around and they just continue to do the same stuff but now rationalize it

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.640
 Somehow as like, oh, this is technically i'm technically doing this, but yeah, yeah, they're actually not

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.840
 Yeah, I was thinking like who's the actual target for some of this

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.320
 I think any established company I feel like it's a very unlikely for them to be able to change their culture

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.440
 I think a good target for it is like people founding companies now deciding like what

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.960
 Do we want to do about this whole part of our business?

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:26.240
 I don't think companies should have really think of it as like we need to spin up like dev rel

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.480
 I feel it's just like not the right way to think about it. Um, yeah

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.600
 Yeah, and it gets like conflated with marketing too

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.760
 I think the only part that matters especially for other stage companies is the marketing aspect of it

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.920
 uh, and it's weird to like

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:46.960
 Externalize that into this separate role. Mm-hmm. There's something of a dev rel yourself. You could have made a course

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:54.240
 Oh, you could do you're like consulting or something. Yeah one. I mean, it's one of those things where it's like

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.960
 I have developed a bunch of

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:04.320
 Skills while trying to build a company. Yeah, and there's always a pathway for me to like go and

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.000
 Sell those skills separately from trying to build a company

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.800
 The underlying implication is I failed at building the company if I go to do that

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.200
 So it's a nice like fallback if I do fail, but realistically I rather just keep trying

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:21.440
 To build another company to build another company until one of them succeeds. So

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:27.360
 Yeah, I find this thing with my career where it to me like I get this like clear image of me like

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.760
 Uh, like sewing seeds and like growing

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.640
 a bigger and bigger crop

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.600
 But like never actually harvesting it because I know if I like wait one more year, it'll grow even bigger if I wait

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:45.840
 Another girl girl even bigger at some point. I will have to do that if you know the things i'm trying to don't work out

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.720
 But yeah, the one thing I think I feel like I did write in my careers. I've like deferred that

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.200
 Like gratification the pay out much. Yeah. Yeah, much longer

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.640
 And I think the longer you wait the bigger it is once you do decide to

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:05.840
 To harvest it. Yeah, it's so much of life, right? Like most good things just come from delaying gratification

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.560
 Yeah, it's hard to do

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.600
 Yeah

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.440
 It's really easy to slip into the like what's the thing that feels best right now?

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:18.320
 Yes, but when there's so many there's constantly opportunities like all the time to just get like a quick win

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:22.000
 Yeah, and like everyone around you. You also see them taking it and you see their lives

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.680
 Like progressing in certain ways. So that also makes it makes it challenging

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:31.600
 So I want the hardest things about I think one of the hardest things about starting and doing a company is that

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.360
 Uh, if you're someone that could make a company successful

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:42.000
 You're very competent and because you're very competent. There's like a million opportunities always around you. Yeah at any given time

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.800
 Uh, so it's hard to like

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:50.880
 Ignore those and focus on the thing while everyone else around you is kind of taking advantage of them. Yep. That's the hardest part. Yep

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.000
 I hear you and it is I'm hearing you. I'm thinking am I actually the person you're describing

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:04.880
 Well, I mean you did you you I think you're just ahead of me on that like life cycle because you did that already with like you had those years where you

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.120
 You know

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.120
 Maybe company, right? Yeah

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:12.880
 No, I definitely did but yeah, because you you went from making a good amount of money consulting

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:19.040
 To that. I'm not making any money for a while. Yeah. Yeah, I did that. Yeah. Yeah, so that's kind of the phase I'm in right now

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.520
 Yeah, I'm always trying to figure this out. It was ever since Aaron said

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.560
 That's him. I retired

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.680
 I said to bring that in because last time we said it

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.240
 He he said something on twitter

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:37.280
 Yeah, man. That's such an impact on you. Do you not want to be retired? Uh, I don't maybe I do want to be retired. I don't want to perceive

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:42.560
 I don't want to be retired. I really enjoy what I do

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.520
 Uh, like I can't imagine ever stopping

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:52.240
 Doing stuff with technology. Uh, I do wish like just and this is a more societal thing not like my specific case

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:56.240
 I wish there was some way society could have been oriented in such a way that when your kids are young

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.760
 You could have more time with them and like you're not

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.360
 Putting off your livelihood or like lessening

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:12.080
 Your opportunities by spending time with your young kids because it's like this weird like peak of your career peak of your like family

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.480
 Potential all at the same time and it's just like what do you do with that?

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:21.280
 I'm just kind of like you're going to look back and you're going to be retired when your kids are gone and be like

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.360
 All those years

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.240
 I could have just been chilling with them and then working now

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.560
 I'm not going to lose my mind at 50 like I'm still going to be able to do this stuff. I don't know

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.600
 Yeah, it's just hard though because like you need to build up that foundation

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.440
 Yeah

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:40.640
 And it's like anytime delayed. Yeah, I don't see I don't see any solutions. I don't I don't know that there is

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.480
 I just it sucks that that's the way things work. Well, I have this funny thing where

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:50.880
 Because people live all kinds of lives. So my landlord super interesting crazy quirky weird dude

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.760
 I saw this video that video. So my doorbell camera

00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:03.760
 Captured footage of him. Okay with his consent or without without I mean he's it's there. It's not hidden like he knows it's there

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.280
 but I mean there's a reason I didn't post it publicly but

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.960
 I did share it with my team because so he's in his 50s

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.680
 I would guess he's probably worth like maybe close to 10 million or something like that

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.640
 He owns

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:22.320
 Like a bunch of houses in my neighborhood and the the values in that neighborhood have gone up like crazy in the past by the 10 years

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.240
 But he's worth a lot of money

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.200
 Okay

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.520
 And he randomly showed up to my house to like bleach my deck

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.880
 To like clean it

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.520
 Wow

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:36.640
 And you see him like going insane with his broom just like grunting and just like

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.560
 Just working super hard and cleaning the crap out of this. And I'm like, yeah

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:45.840
 This is a guy in his 50s and he's worth like a crazy amount of money and like look how hard he's worked

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.680
 It was like an inspiring thing to me to see like the amount of energy and vitality he has

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.240
 Wow

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.960
 His age and like when he should just be relaxing

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.080
 The other interesting part is he just had a baby

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.760
 He had a baby girl

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.400
 Oh, wow

00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.360
 Like a month ago

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.560
 And he has two other kids that are like under four years old

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.600
 Oh, maybe that he's got three kids total and they're all under five kids late in life

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.440
 Yeah, uh and his wife's a lot younger

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.480
 But he was he was talking to Liz the other day and he was like he actually

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.440
 Likes the way his life turned out because he's like

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.200
 He does work hard

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.920
 But he's had a phase of his life where everything's set up

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:27.360
 And he spends a lot of time with his kids and he's got a lot of energy still like he's like he's very very alive for his age

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.600
 Yeah, so there's a good trade-off right like he's not gonna

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.840
 See he might not see his grandkids because like age wise

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.680
 Yeah, yeah, like that doesn't work out

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:41.840
 But he gets to spend a lot of really active time with his kids because like they're fantastic really really well set up

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.160
 There's no like big thing. He's gonna

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.400
 Do in the do still in his career. Yeah, there is that season

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:52.320
 I guess like that's what retirement is if if that exists for us

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:56.560
 It's just where you're not really trying to like start new companies or trying to

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:01.760
 Like bigger and bigger the biggest thing you will do is already kind of been done. Yeah

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:08.880
 But yeah, so he like retired and then I mean he's not really retired but like he's pseudo retired and then he died kids

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:15.520
 He kind of got to do what you said in reverse. Yeah, the reverse thing. Yeah, I don't know why that would be

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.640
 I guess like traditionally

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:25.200
 A lot of like manual labor. It just makes sense to do that when you're younger, which is when people generally have kids

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:31.280
 But yeah, I guess you could have kids at an older age. Yeah, I mean if you're a man, I guess

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:37.040
 Yeah, man. Uh-huh. Yeah, that sucks. Okay, but I mean, yeah, so the two things one

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.960
 He did that and two like it's just so weird imagining someone so rich like

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:46.960
 Doing in such intense manual labor. Yeah, but yeah, just get an impressive interesting weird guy

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:54.080
 This is in Miami or did you say it was in New York? No, this is in Miami. This is our car in your current. Okay. Gotcha

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:58.080
 You still are you still have the apartment up there? Yeah, we do. We're like

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:03.040
 We're like just getting squeezed from every every angle

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.600
 I mean, these are going up attacks

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:11.360
 The more you can't sell it. I can't remember you can't sell it because we're gonna put it on the market

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.000
 This the next summer

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.640
 Mm-hmm. Uh because that's when our tenant leases up. We're gonna see if someone buys it really

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.200
 Skeptical that someone's gonna go get a seven percent mortgage to then

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.280
 Buy this one bedroom apart in New York apartment in New York

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:33.920
 For an amount that at least breaks us even on the whole thing. Yeah, yeah, it's like it seems kind of unlikely

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.680
 We're gonna listen and we're gonna see but yeah, we definitely need to get rid of

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:43.040
 That thing we moved to Florida and had a house and the Ozarks that we had built

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:49.520
 And we spent way too much building it and we we didn't ever think we were gonna get

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.800
 What we put into it out of it, but we didn't know how much less we were good

00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:01.120
 We took a huge huge haircut. Is that the word shaving?

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.680
 Uh that sucked and then what really sucks

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:14.880
 This is just Adam's bad at finances. So we build a house. We sell it for I don't know 60% of what we built it for

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:21.360
 Wow, and then like three years later when the market was crazy the guy who bought it from us sold it for

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.680
 Uh 30% more than we put into it. Oh my god. That's fun

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:32.800
 Here's the thing there's some people in life where they just nailed the timing is just

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:37.040
 For them. I've never been that person. No same like my current landlord

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:42.400
 Exactly that he was born in this neighborhood and he slowly acquired houses here and randomly

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:48.720
 Without anyone predicting it. It just went through the roof. Yeah, he paid so little for all the houses. He owns

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:52.400
 Yeah, yeah, he was blessed by timing. I never had that

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:57.760
 I was terrible at it and like in that case we built the house thinking it was our forever home

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.840
 We were never gonna leave it. So we didn't care how much it costs and like we're not gonna sell it

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.840
 But then like a few years past we had a kid and case you just want to be somewhere warm

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:11.120
 It's like okay. We're doing it. Yeah, it's just like is that impulsiveness? Maybe is that why timing is ever on my side?

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.600
 I don't know. I'm I'm bad at the timing. I think that to me is maybe the opposite of impulsiveness in some ways like you

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:21.120
 Thought you were never gonna be you thought like things would never change but then they come out

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:25.840
 I never really do that's another thing that I've gone through a few things in my life where sometimes I'll like

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:32.400
 Be so into some way of living or something and I can't imagine ever not wanting that

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:38.960
 Yeah, and then inevitably I like start to want something different. Yeah after it's crazy

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:45.440
 Yeah, and you kind of almost forget that like you used to have that as part of your life

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:50.400
 Yeah, when it seemed like such a fundamental thing like for me lard bars. I used to eat like three lard bars a day

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.040
 months

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.040
 I remember I used to

00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:00.480
 I used to say to myself like how am I not like 20 pounds overweight when I ate like three lard bars a day

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.760
 And now I've lost 20 pounds and I don't eat lard bars like oh

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.680
 I'm going to this funny thing where I am the heaviest. I've ever been in my life

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:16.160
 Uh, but not I don't think I'm overweight. I think I'm just like going to go to the gym more

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.600
 But I'm trying to get to 1.5 x my body weight

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.440
 Quoting

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.440
 but oh squatting

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:28.000
 I just heard you say I thought you were saying you're trying to gain like be one and a half

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.360
 I was like that's a lot of weight gain. What are you gonna do with all that?

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.160
 Okay squatting one and a half

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.880
 That's like my goal. Like I think I got to do that. I'm gonna be satisfied and kind of maintain that

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.600
 But my weight just keeps going up as I get

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.280
 Like my target is shifted so much

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:51.760
 That's funny. And I like is it even possible? Like am I just gonna keep getting weight, but eventually it's got taper off, right?

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.640
 Yeah

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.320
 Yeah, but it is funny because like I I hadn't weighed myself in several months

00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:02.080
 And I've been noticing that I'm like hitting like new highs and all my lifts and it's like kind of been easy

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.800
 And I weighed myself. I'm like, oh, I'm like

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.000
 literally

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.160
 My my scale keeps track of like every single data point and we weigh yourself

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:15.760
 It shows a next data point. It's shot up by like 15 pounds because I had I gained 15 pounds the last time I

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.240
 I weighed myself. Oh since the last time. Yeah

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:25.200
 Have you ever been so much heavier or lighter than it didn't know it was you like it because we have multiple people in the household

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.880
 So it's like me and Casey and it like after you stand out for a second

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:34.400
 It like lights up like ADA like that's me. Okay, and then one time I got on there and I was I can't remember what direction

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:38.480
 But I was so different from the last time I had weighed it was like two years later or something

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.360
 I didn't know who it was. It was like question mark

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.400
 It's just nobody in your household

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.840
 Yeah, but I was like, okay. This is why like all my

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.480
 Okay, it's been easy to gym because I just

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:56.320
 That's so much of it like if you're just bigger. You can just love mine. I know it makes sense like yeah

00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:02.800
 The bigger people just get that for free. How do you when you lift like you do like programs

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:08.240
 Like for squatting you want to get to 1.5 extra weight. What is your like a process?

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.160
 I do something very very simple and I've been doing this for years and it's worked for me

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.480
 I just do three sets when I'm in a gym

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:21.360
 Uh first two sets are five reps and the last set is as many as I can do

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:26.800
 Oh, and I increase by five pounds every single day every time

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.960
 I go in there unless I can't

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:34.560
 Hit five on the last like if you can't yeah, if you're not hitting it then you drop it down. Yeah

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.040
 and

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:41.840
 It's like extremely slow progression. I mean, but it's it sounds like a good approach

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:46.080
 Yeah, it's like very slow progression, but because it's slow like you don't often

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:50.160
 Like the lifts actually feel pretty easy every single day. I go. Yeah, it's a little bit challenging

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:53.440
 But it's not crazy hard and somehow the next day I can do a little bit more

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:59.360
 I feel like I need somebody in there in the gym with me making me do stuff because I remember in high school like football

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:04.240
 I was able to lift crazy amount to wait all my lifts were just nuts now looking back being like

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.720
 How is a 17 year old me?

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:11.920
 Able to just like run circles around adult me in terms of weightlifting and it's like oh, yeah

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.960
 I had like a strength and conditioning coach forcing me to do it all no

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:18.800
 I don't think so. I think it's because you were 17 like I remember when I was at age

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:22.000
 I was like I could literally run forever. I like never get tired

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:28.000
 Just never get tired, but like I I go in the gym now and I just feel very uninspired. It's like

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.200
 It's even coming up with what I'm gonna work on that day

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:35.440
 It's like I know I want to do push stuff today like I'm gonna do bench and I'm gonna do whatever

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:41.360
 It's like I just fall into the I don't know three by five or five by five or whatever

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.080
 And I'm just gonna raise the weight a little bit. That's what I mean. It's all I do too

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:49.440
 Yeah, it just feels like I'm not like pushing myself the way I would push myself if someone made me do something

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.520
 I didn't want to do but like are you still increasing?

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.920
 Yeah, I do plateau pretty often. I feel like

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.640
 I'll go good for like two three weeks

00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:01.280
 And then I feel like I'm not really progressing and it's hard to do any more weight that kind of stuff

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:07.680
 If you plateau, you probably have to switch it up somehow if you're trying to grow more because I think for me my goal is

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:12.640
 I want to get to a certain level and I'm gonna completely switch it up and try to maintain

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:15.120
 So I'm not like trying to get to like some crazy

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:20.240
 High weight really. Yeah, I'm not either. I mean there's certain things I wish

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.760
 Uh, that I could do like that I could do when I was younger

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:30.080
 But I'm not like I have no specific goals really. I just want to be stronger mostly for jiu-jitsu. Just want to

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:35.360
 Yeah, I don't know. That makes sense. I really like uh adam wathans

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:42.560
 Uh routine, but I want to do that until I'm at like I hit all like my base

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.240
 What's his routine calls?

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:50.640
 It's like it's pretty simple like he just walks with a weighted vest and he does some kind of like uh circuit with like pull-ups and

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:54.880
 Just like very basic things that you don't need to go to a gym for. Yeah with a weighted vest

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.480
 My gym is very close and very convenient, but I would really like to just work out at home

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.680
 Yeah, and all the stuff he does I could just do at home, but

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:06.320
 You like need to I don't think you can like just do that. I think you need like it's what you're in

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:10.720
 Level and then that's what you do for maintenance. Mm. Yeah

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:15.120
 But yeah, I'm like working towards being able to do that and the the walking with a weighted vest also

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:19.120
 I get like wogs who go and like kind of kills two birds. Yeah, I do that

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:26.080
 We have a rec vest. I do a lot of those. It's nice. What how much harder is it like does it actually like

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.960
 meaningfully make a difference it depends like

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:35.040
 If I do it with 30 pounds, I can walk three or four miles and I know early on when I was first doing it

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.880
 I noticed it like my heart it was higher than if I just did a walk without it

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:45.200
 But if you do like 50 60 pounds now we're talking like I do a mile and I I want it off my shoulders

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:50.720
 And I'm sweating like I'm I'm feeling it. What does it feel like? They feel like running or does it feel like something else?

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:55.440
 Something else. I mean it doesn't I hate running. I don't feel like I ever need to stop

00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:00.080
 When I'm walking with a rec vest. It's just like the pain on my shoulders

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:05.520
 Just overall the exhaustion like I'm ready to be done. Like I can't go further than a mile or so

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:09.520
 With a lot of weight and how does it work? It comes with weights that you put in yeah

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:13.360
 So like we have one from go rec and it just has like a

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.600
 a plate

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:20.720
 Like slot slot. Yeah is the word. I guess and then you buy the plates different weights

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:24.560
 I see yeah, and you can you can go up to like 50 60 pounds

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.520
 So I think the plates

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.520
 I think the the heaviest plate is 30

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.520
 But the one we have is like a backpack

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:34.560
 So I put the 30 pound in the slot and then I put a 20 pound just in the backpack in the back of it

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.920
 So it's not ideal in terms of the way the weights distributed on your back, but it works

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.400
 I see

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:45.440
 Okay, interesting. Yeah, I want to get into that. It's nice. It's just like makes walks more meaningful

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.640
 It gives you like a little more bang for your buck. It's really nice walking around here

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:54.240
 So it's it's a good option and yeah, I just want to understand like if it actually made that much of a difference is yeah

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.520
 If you put enough weight in there, I get to sweating

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:01.360
 I mean, it's it's very different from a walk even just with the lighter weight for me

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:06.480
 It's like you can look at the heart rate charts and it's definitely a higher heart rate than if I walked without it

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:10.160
 I'm gonna put it on Zuko's vest too. He's got a little he's got a little vest

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:14.960
 It's actually it has like slots for things so I can wait him to get him tired more tired

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:20.400
 It's hard to get big dogs like that. Yeah, actually I'm not joking. It's like a thing that people do

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.960
 They like yeah, it makes sense. We waited wait it walks for their dogs. Yeah, you gotta wear them out

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.640
 Big dogs like that the young dogs especially they got energy

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:35.840
 I've been doing this thing where uh, I tried to sprint across my front yard and like juke came out

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:41.200
 And I go back and forth and so it's just funny thing where like he'll fall for any fake

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:45.840
 Very easy, but he can recover instantly. So it's like it's very challenging

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:49.440
 Like I do like spin moves. I gotta do like a head fake and all that

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:53.600
 It's fun. I'm gonna put together a highlight video. Oh, yes, please

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:59.360
 Let's get that on twitter ASAP. Maybe that'll start a trend everybody juke in their dogs

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:03.520
 Uh, you ever gonna stream again?

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.440
 I think about it like twice a week. Yeah, like

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:12.160
 I actually cleaned up my office and I actually plugged in my other camera. Like I got all ready

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:17.600
 I fixed my overlays. They were kind of broken. Whoa, that's a lot of steps. I know I might start straight

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:20.960
 Well, it was one morning. I couldn't sleep and I woke up like 230 and I just started doing all this

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.360
 I might get back into it

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.800
 We'll see

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:29.920
 I'm gonna do it at least once before uh twitch con which is next week. It's just Thursday. Oh, yeah when you're leaving

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:35.280
 Uh, thursday next week next week. Okay. Yes. I gotta like I gotta keep myself busy that week

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:40.320
 So I don't see you know watch the twitter feed. It's gonna be so it's everybody. I can't believe

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:43.120
 How many dev streamers like?

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:49.760
 It's you and it's teach they're the only people that I know that are developers streaming that aren't gonna be there

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:54.400
 It's nuts. I wish I was doing like a surprise arrival. I'm not I wish you were too. I wish it

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:58.800
 I'm gonna hold on to hope that it might happen. Oh, it's not happening. Okay

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:01.920
 flights to vega, so

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.680
 Shockingly cheap really I mean vegas is awful. It's

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:10.240
 Kind of the worst so my meat to vegas route. I think is very

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.320
 Popular

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:17.280
 Oh, yeah flights are very cheap. Oh, yeah, I guess more people doing it makes it cheaper. That makes sense

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.360
 Yeah, I think they might even be like

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:24.080
 Up to die somehow by the casinos or something. It's like oh wow. It's like stupid cheap

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.240
 Doesn't make any sense. Oh

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:31.280
 It's not stupid cheap to fly from those arcs to anywhere because we have to connect to stay there and never leave

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:35.920
 That's basically the plan. Yeah, you're gonna move if you live somewhere like that. You just gotta stay there

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.280
 Yeah, nobody else wants to see you around just stop it

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:44.160
 All right, I gotta pee. That's always the ending

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:49.200
 Oh, we did it one exactly one hour like one zero zero and some seconds, but who's counting?

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.920
 All right, see you next yep

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.240
 You
