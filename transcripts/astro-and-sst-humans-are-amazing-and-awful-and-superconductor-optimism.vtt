WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060
 Well, I finally figured out that link doesn't change so it's just the same link every time okay the past 45 episodes the process has been

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.720
 I get on and I wait for you to DM me the link and I haven't noticed in 45 times

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:21.200
 And today I figured it out cool so you can just bookmark that thing

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.560
 Just show up. That's one less step. I don't have to copy the link and send it to you now

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.980
 I love that actually we're gonna be so much more efficient now. Oh look at us

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.680
 I'll have more time to talk about such interesting topics such as

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.680
 Astro

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.480
 That's a great one actually yeah, I was just wondering if you had thought about what we talked about cuz I have not well

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.000
 Share share what yours tell me more about what you're thinking and exploring

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.060
 yeah, so I mean been using Astro a lot and SST and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:23.880
 There's just there's some features that Astro they're moving fast over there - yeah, and you guys you guys are also moving fast

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.840
 But you have a lot of different things you worry about that are not just Astro. Yeah, so I think it hit me this week that like

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.160
 I'm in a good position to push some stuff

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
 Because I care about this stuff. It's in my critical path

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.360
 Yes, so Astro you pointed out just this morning has already launched the code splitting stuff. So instead of

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.200
 Astro shipping your astro side is one big function

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:57.840
 Now you can split it up by page by route or whatever and that means there are cool opportunities now in it and at an SST

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.440
 To take advantage of that and bust it out into separate functions. So that's cool. Also lambda has streaming now

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.640
 That's been a while I guess but

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.680
 That's some low-hanging fruit that I'd love to add cuz Astro supports streaming. So

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.200
 SST post Astro streaming on lambda. It's like all these little things that I feel like just chipping away at these people who are like

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.120
 Look how awesome our thing is I'm gonna name names

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.880
 We do streaming and stuff

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.240
 Yeah, well, so do we over here in Astro land and SST land

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.400
 Well, it's the other thing. There's one other thing you said streaming code splitting and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.400
 It's a good day. Oh redirects. Yes redirects. Yeah, so to Astro two dot nine has this redirect config where you can

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.400
 It's looks all like next to us where you can configure

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.000
 redirects

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.840
 Which is a lot better than just creating files that have like the fences and a redirect

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.600
 Yeah, what we have right now a bunch of files for every single redirect we want

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.840
 We can move that into this config. So yeah, there's another opportunity

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.800
 There's just like these three little low-hanging fruit

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.160
 I feel like I could come in and just like boom one PR. Maybe three PR's. I don't know whatever you think

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.960
 Hit all this stuff at once. Yeah, I mean, this is exactly the model that we're aiming for

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.720
 We can get the initial thing working, but because we're not heavy users of any of these frameworks

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.200
 we can only

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.800
 Like it's just not aligned like we can't yeah do it as well as someone actually using it is so this is exactly what we hope for that

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.800
 There eventually is someone that is really motivated to get this stuff working

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.760
 And then they get working for themselves and in that process for everyone else

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.280
 And I think that's why like this is a great example of a place where

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.360
 It's just a crazy advantage for this kind of thing to be open source if you look at

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.440
 Like equivalent plates to host this like for sale or netlify or whatever whenever whenever Astro releases a new feature

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.960
 Suddenly some p.m. On their team is like, oh, no, like we got to support this

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.960
 Like where do we fit this in the road map?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.200
 other people

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.960
 Building iterating on their framework just creates work for them that they directly have to solve and they might

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.080
 They're the same problem as us. They might internally not be heavy users of these things

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.560
 So they might not even know about these features and they probably don't even hear about it till someone expects to work, etc

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.800
 So yeah, this is exactly exactly what we want. So definitely excited for you to try that the one thing I'll point out though is

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.400
 I'm not smart enough. Sorry jumping jumping ahead

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.140
 Oh, something else you're not supposed to do the insults for me. That's that's taking away

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:48.080
 But rely on the insult you you don't need it. Oh, I'll wait for it. Yeah, the route-splitting thing

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.520
 So just a for the audience just to explain what it is again

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.040
 Right now. I totally know go ahead. I do think you know

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.120
 Okay

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:15.480
 So right now Asha shifts is a single function which is fine for most situations

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.200
 But as your application gets larger with lots of dependencies

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.680
 It's just a lot to put into a single function so they announced they launched code splitting which actually didn't even notice

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.160
 I've been like

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
 eager for that feature

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.600
 But yeah, it seems like they launched it and I missed it. So now it can split one

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.520
 Bundle per route

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.600
 So you can deploy a separate functions the issue that though is

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.840
 Cloudfront by default only allows

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.560
 10 behaviors per distribution

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.840
 25 was it 25? Okay. Yeah, I just had it raised to 50. That's how I know guys an ask

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.680
 So one you can get it raised and two was the amount they raised it enough for you

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.320
 It what well not when we had the redirects and somehow the redirects did create more behaviors

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.840
 I didn't look at them closely, but it was still we were still hit in the limit and then we had to cut the redirects out

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.760
 Okay, but so ignoring the redirect just a normal route splitting for the number of pages you have is 50 enough

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.080
 So it's it's not even just a page is it's like every file in your public every file in the root of your public directory

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.280
 So all the static assets you want to ship if you got images or fonts or whatever

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.480
 All of those the top level so like if you have individual files in that public directory each of those gets its own cash behavior

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.720
 So it blows up really fast and then folders also like you could put everything in a subfolder within public

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.880
 And it's just one cash behavior. Just the nature of the way. It's it's a Cloudfront thing

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.280
 It's stupid. I never really thought about this that hard until I ran into this

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.000
 But like you can't define a path. That's like some complicated glob

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.160
 Where it can handle like Regex style like

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:56.480
 If it ends in these it's like every if you want to have like an extension like every PNG and JPEG and and GIF or whatever

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.800
 You've got to do like separate behaviors for each of those

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.360
 So it does it blows out really fast way, but why why do static assets need to be split in that way?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.680
 Are they all served under the same policy? I have not actually looked at the behaviors that

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.640
 SST is deploying into my my Cloudfront distro. I haven't looked down that closely, but I thought I assumed

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.440
 That's what it was. I read something I thought in the SST docs even that said

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.840
 The number it was like a little warning that like the number of files in your public directory

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.900
 Well, you'll you'll hit this cache behavior. Oh in the public

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.200
 Okay, okay in the public so static assets that you you serve

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.320
 I guess those just get put in the bucket and exposed directly

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.960
 And not going to like the Astro node server the clean way to limit the number of behaviors

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.880
 You need is you make a subfolder for all like assets, right?

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.880
 So if you do like assets slash all of your stuff

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:55.020
 That's one behavior that applies to all your static assets because a pattern can just be

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:03.360
 Yeah, that's yeah, but if you have a bunch of random files in the roots of the public folder then there's no like

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.800
 Clean way to specify a pattern. So

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.320
 Yeah, that might be why and that's that that is kind of annoying

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.400
 We we moved them around like we had them all in the root and then we realized yeah

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.760
 We just put them all in sub folders

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.240
 We already had a bunch of sub folders too and each of those get the cache behavior. So initially, yeah

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.000
 We blew past the 20 or 25 whatever it was saying. Yeah, I wonder yeah

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.200
 You might be able to come up with just like a better way to think about some of this stuff as you like as you go through it

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:38.640
 But yeah, so I was actually just referring to the stuff that actually needs SSR. So each SSR route

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:46.040
 Like even then like are you under 50? Are you sure the each so each route actually gets a new cache behavior?

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.160
 Are you sure no those all just like hit the default behavior and they flow through to the Astro node server, right?

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:57.240
 Well, then that then they would all go to the same function. Oh, you're saying in this new world was splitting. Yeah

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.680
 Yeah, oh, I hadn't thought about it. That's what that's what that's what's up. Yeah. Oh interesting

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.640
 Yeah, it's so cloud front routing is the function. Here's an annoying thing. So I

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:15.320
 Think for the first bit cloud front routing my house. So again, just to clarify. We're getting it's a lot of details here

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.320
 But yeah, someone finds it interesting

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.720
 So on the cloud front team is like this is good. Yeah

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.680
 Cloud front is something called cloud front functions. These functions can run for one millisecond. That's their limits their runtime limit

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.200
 They're just meant for like quick logic and they can kind of when a request comes in they can change certain properties

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.680
 What was the limit? How many milliseconds one millisecond? Oh, yeah, no, and it's not even a dollar script

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.360
 It's like or like a extremely limited subset. It's like an embedded scripting language

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.400
 I can put into your CDN to change what happens when a request comes in

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.760
 They can't change the origin that it goes to so if they could change the origin

00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:00.520
 I could basically build a router there that just says okay this request goes to this function URL this request goes another function URL, etc

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.600
 But it doesn't do that

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.040
 Unfortunately, you can't even do the redirects in my mind

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.240
 I think you can't change the origin but with the redirect you're not changing the origin you're changing the path

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.760
 That's a good URL path in the origin. Oh, yeah, okay

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:20.240
 Yeah, it's somewhere right away with a 302 or whatever it is or whatever it is. So yeah, okay do that

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.920
 So it's just a weird limitation there. So so what's the answer Dax just graze your limit of cache behaviors

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:32.440
 I mean it comes with the it comes with the performance implication right like those cache behaviors the more of them

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:38.680
 Presumably that's like hurting performance by itself, right? That's what the cloud front like

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.080
 Docs seem to suggest really it's like yeah

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.720
 It's like don't raise this limit too high like you can increase it

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:51.120
 But like there's a real world cost to that and I guess that makes sense well cuz like the

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.360
 routing pattern matching is like a whole deep

00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:00.760
 Like world of making that really efficient. So I imagine and people always complain like people like I know

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.920
 Jared from bun always complains about like cuz he got into like implementing that for bun

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.960
 He's always like oh these certain features like certain vlog card feature like blows up

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.160
 The performance of certain things. Yeah, I

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.240
 Don't know if there's like that much of a I think from like the micro optimization standpoint

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.920
 Like they're probably for those people if it's like but not a huge

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:26.240
 Worse what certain features, but I would be surprised if like you felt it as a one

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.160
 So maybe this needs to be a higher default limit

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.600
 I actually have the ear of someone at on the cloud front team who's in my DMS right now and was asking for some feedback

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:39.720
 So I might suggest hey, maybe that limit could be a hundred by default. What are the real world applications?

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.680
 Yeah, so we were asking for that as success in the same thing because because of that, but yeah

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:50.200
 I'm wondering if there's like some clever way to structure your astro project that limits the need for this

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.320
 I also wonder like with route splitting

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.800
 Your performance might be worse because there's just more cold starts overall

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.560
 So you have to really understand whether we're splitting if it lowers each of your functions by like 10%

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.960
 In size it's probably not worth it if it lowers the right like a lot then it's may worth it

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.160
 So it's got to be like you've got a really heavy dependency on one certain route

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:18.000
 Yeah, and it might make sense just to split that that one route out and that we do that what we were thinking that in the

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.040
 SST adapter for astro you could potentially specify what you actually want split

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:31.440
 Deeply into that again just because this is all theoretical for me. I'm not actually building yeah anything with us

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.520
 Yeah, cuz you could still well

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:40.220
 I guess assuming astro in the build process when you build with splitting turned on assuming they still give you the original like

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:48.560
 Fat function then you could SST could opt in to some of the new functions. You know I'm saying yeah, I don't exactly I don't it's

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:54.520
 There's a question of can you do this from the adapter like is actually give you everything you need to do it from the adapter?

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.520
 It might it might not so

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:02.060
 Yeah, I mean you can also rebuild oh you can like build your own like router

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.480
 Bundle up the multiple functions. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, we're getting really in the weeds here

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.740
 This our audience for this is like Fred and someone from the cloud front

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:23.680
 I heard you're talking to the astro team tomorrow. I heard you're coming too. Yeah, I'm gonna be there listening not that guy

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:31.680
 I have two meetings with them tomorrow, isn't that crazy. Oh wow look at you

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.480
 Yeah, it's becoming part of the astro core team. Let's just make you an honorary member of the team

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:43.100
 Yeah, it's like I again just I never have I never have meetings and I had

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:50.200
 Like three meetings in one day the other day. Oh geez. It's Friday. You got your Sunday meetings. I'm toxic

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.520
 It's like it's like a

00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:01.160
 To me, I think of it as I'm kind of like blood sacrifice like I do a blood sacrifice where I do one meeting on Sunday for

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.020
 No meetings the rest of the week. Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah, it's worth that

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:11.320
 But then you actually have a lot of meetings. Sorry. Yeah occasionally very rarely my it was just like all external people

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.480
 My previous role I

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:21.360
 Had minimum three hours of meetings every single day daily. Yeah

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:28.680
 I mean, I've been I've been at places where it's the meeting culture. There's a lot of that. Yeah, I had nothing else to do

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.920
 How does that not died yet? Like how is that not like?

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:37.320
 These companies that like half your days and meetings and you're like an icy like you're contributing code

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:44.400
 How how does anyone think that's a good idea? I don't understand how that's not at that company. Like I was okay

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.000
 I wrote zero code. I wrote like basically zero code. Yeah

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.560
 so half my day was meetings which I think for a

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.240
 Manager of entirely and purely management role. Yeah, that makes more sense

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.160
 I guess not terrible you're in one-on-ones and you're in well. I don't know what your role was. Yeah

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.620
 Yeah, so I'm director basically one-on-one roles

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:12.640
 Well, I'm on one meetings with everyone on my team every week. Yeah, I was spread them around those are fun leadership meetings

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:19.460
 The one one's are fun because it just like getting a fuck around with people. Yeah, so those are not bad

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:24.440
 Lower pressure. Yeah, and then they were the other kinds of meetings also much more active though

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:30.140
 Sorry, like you can't just like chill and do your work while you're on those calls. Yes, actually having you talk

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:34.140
 Yeah, to be honest. I think almost all my meetings were fairly active

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:38.960
 Because again, it's only worth that I did so I was not a director so

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:45.120
 My meetings were mostly coding and half listening kind of listening

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:51.360
 Yeah, and then they're like, what do you think Adam or did you want to a story point this one? Like I do not actually

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:57.080
 Let's go five probably like five. I don't know roughly five story points, please

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.720
 Yeah, then the other category meeting was

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:08.080
 And this was what I was fantastic and this is why I think it was good at this role it was

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.600
 meeting with other

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.040
 people that led other departments and making them feel like

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.920
 Okay, engineering knows what they're doing even though everything is going wrong

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.520
 Just just like making one feel positive and confident and like yeah. Oh, yeah, like totally like

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.280
 Too by the way, yeah

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.680
 Yeah, that's that's mostly your job

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:39.760
 Going fine. Yeah, no matter where competent. We know what we're doing. Yeah, I mean like manifesting to reality because like oh

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.120
 Yeah, when people stop feeling that way they start

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:48.320
 To need to stick their fingers into stuff and that makes stuff go even worse

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:55.240
 But yeah, there's there's a reason for it. Can I ask you a question on the record like you deal with all these?

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.960
 Web frameworks Astro

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.760
 next JS

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.680
 Solid start smelt kit, whatever you guys support them all

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.680
 And you deal with all those people a lot of external meetings. I hear do you have a favorite?

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.400
 Who's your favorite like who do you like working with the most like building with?

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.480
 Yeah, like just like as a team like you really like interacting with that team. They're great

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:23.680
 It's probably gonna be Astro mostly because they are the ones that actually have a company behind it. So there's there's like

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:31.120
 Like that's everyone's day-to-day job. That's the thing that they're focused on so it's very easy just on a base level

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:37.640
 It's very easy to work with them because we're also working on it as like a real job. Yeah, that's your job. Yeah. Yeah, so it's like a very

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:44.680
 Clean collaboration and beyond that. They're just personally all great like always really excited to help. Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't really

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.640
 Why yeah, why do you hate next year's? Why do you hate those people so much? We don't even wish them

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:57.400
 You don't open next you just kind of do your own thing. I mean we'd like to but it's just oh, well, let's put the word out

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.800
 I'm sure somebody one of them someone who works at Vercel has heard this podcast. We've had like episodes titled Vercel

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:10.920
 I'm sure someone in our listenership works there and if you know, this is a solid branch Dax is reaching out

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.760
 They'd like to work with you. It's not our branch. It's actually something. Oh, it's not our branch

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.320
 It is please take this project off of our hands and just do it instead of us

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:25.320
 Please just do it. Please like just take it like we don't want this project you take it you take it

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:31.640
 I mean that would they take would they take open next or would they are you saying like they should open source the equivalent of open next

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.760
 Is that what you're saying?

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:42.680
 Or no take over open next and just make it for me just conceptually make it so that open next doesn't need to exist or needs to exist less

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.600
 Yes, I got you our relationship with every other framework is pretty different

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.600
 And we do very little in the adapter

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.520
 We do like a little bit of work in the adapter and we just get at working at WS what next JS

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:58.360
 It's like and the thing I always say is if you combine our efforts on every other framework and combine altogether

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.880
 It's still a fraction of the amount of time we spend on next year's so yeah

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.080
 It just it's just pretty different. I mean it's telling that like you look at the sst organization and github

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.720
 And you guys have the sst repo which has like

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.360
 Astro sst and all the adapters for all the other ones and then open next is a separate repo

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.640
 Yeah, it's like a whole big thing the separate repo. I never look at

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:23.000
 I never never get this is a frank does frank live in there. Yeah, frank guys

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.920
 He dies and then we have to facilitate him and he comes back and we send him back in there

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.360
 Yeah, it's very aware of all that

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.760
 Astro's the one that we've worked the most with I think

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.760
 the other frameworks also everyone has been really just everyone's like really

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.160
 Good to work with I think this is my one of my favorite parts about open source

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.800
 It's when and I talk about this all the time where

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:51.640
 It's not meant to be like random people submitting pr's that you don't know like that's that happens

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.040
 And that's fine. Yeah, but the best part of it is when you like establish a relationship

00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.200
 And then you can kind of work really efficiently together because you both know each other and everyone

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.160
 Like each other it works well together and it's a lot more streamlined than just

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:09.080
 Submitting a pr out into the void. Yeah, so we've gone to that place with like with the solid team

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.960
 Of course, uh, and and I mean even with a

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.680
 Svelte kit, uh, like rich Harris is like been taught like reply to our pr's and everything

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.800
 So it's nice to salvage your relationships because whenever we need something we're not going through like

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.280
 Random person door. We're going through that. We have a relationship with you door

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.520
 That's like kind of through us out in a faster way

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:35.640
 So yeah pretty much every every other framework we have that with uh, how hard is it for like a just like a product company

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:40.920
 Just like company that makes some product and has a bunch of customers or users or whatever

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.120
 Is it hard to sort of adopt an open source?

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.920
 mantra where you're gonna like

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.320
 make your stuff open and and

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.920
 Available for people who are passionate about the product

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.480
 To contribute because you just said like not about like random people submitting pr's

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.560
 What if it would only be random people because there's no one really aligned that cares about your product

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.000
 You're kind of like you're like an edge of the graph. You're not like

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.320
 You know sst. Yeah, show you guys are like in the middle of that graph. Yeah, if you're like building products for specific things

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.160
 You know what i'm saying? You know i'm getting at theoretically. Yeah, I think uh, yeah

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.240
 I don't think that really works and even within sst

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.040
 We have portions of it that are like that like the core of sst

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.440
 We don't accept any contributions to because it's very unlikely that some person is gonna

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.800
 Get on the same page with us and like know exactly where we're trying to go

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:33.000
 Yeah, uh, if you look at the console, which is a very typical sass product

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.800
 It is open source

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.240
 Extremely unlikely that we're ever gonna get a meaningful contribution on that

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.960
 Yeah, because there's just so much like you have to be aligned with like the way we think about product the way we design things

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.480
 The way we do whatever

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:50.840
 Uh, we still like to keep it open source because it is a great code example of a real life learning

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.840
 Yeah, exactly. It's a good teaching example. Yeah

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.600
 And I think that's the main reason why people should make their stuff open source

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.640
 Uh, and they're okay

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.680
 So there is a offhand chance that someone does contribute something useful like they like take care of something tedious or like

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.960
 Yeah, something that is uh a small cut

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.920
 But not high enough priority for anyone on the core team to work on like there's always gonna be random stuff like that that

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.920
 The people can take care of

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.280
 But yeah as a learning is that it's been actually been insane. I joke the other day

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.000
 I think we have more users of our code base from our product

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.960
 Because a ton of people have just been

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.000
 Uh, like taking that set up and like trying to build their own stuff

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.600
 I've referenced it a lot

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.600
 I mean, I've already looked at the console code

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.320
 Just like for just best practices with sst

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.880
 Like just as i'm working through stuff and I realized i'm not thinking

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.120
 I still have like cdk brain

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:41.320
 And I realized that like there's things that haven't transferred over for me in terms of how to do it best in sst

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.800
 So I just look at the console repo and that's like my gold standard. I know it's the last thing you guys worked on

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:51.320
 Yeah, I love it. Yeah, and that's the thing I was looking for when I was first getting into serverless stuff

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:56.600
 So I'm glad it in like a real app that does because for me the questions would serve those what I had in the beginning

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.920
 We're never like what's the grand theory behind this?

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:03.080
 It was more like how do you like check for the current user? Is there like what the worst way?

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.840
 They just like really specific things like that

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.760
 And then there's the whole local first thing like that's a great repo for learning all that stuff

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.960
 I haven't even touched any of that but yeah, exactly. I think that's the part

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.160
 I've been

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.880
 Surprise that a lot of people because I because we talked about as a bunch that I think more people should to do that

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.960
 But I acknowledge that's a big

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.920
 Step and learning curve and a lot of the front from cost and building stuff that way

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.000
 But I've seen a bunch of people posts on twitter if you would be like, oh, look at this thing

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.400
 I'm messing around with like kind of base off of our setup

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.440
 Some of it looks better than our console

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:40.200
 I think I've seen some of these conversations like stock talking about he did it with next day s and like yeah

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:45.640
 Just people it's so cool how people will take that learn from your example and then apply it in other ways and

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:50.680
 Yeah, I love open source. Yeah. Yeah, and and in some way that's going to come back to us

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.440
 So whether that's they build a product that's really good because they're using a similar setup

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.840
 That leads to good products and we get to use it or they come back and they're like this pattern actually works better

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:06.840
 I'm just kind of seeing other places testing it. So yeah, I think more companies should just consider open source saying their

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.160
 code

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:15.800
 It's usually not your competitive advantage as much as everyone likes to tie up all this stuff with IP and and all of all of that

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.280
 like where I see someone's product I like

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.560
 Can guess how it works for like 99 percent of cases like I don't need to see their code. Yeah, sure

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.680
 But yeah, I think more companies should should definitely consider that

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.680
 I am seeing that a little bit more too as a product company

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:37.720
 You've never dealt with like you don't have the internal muscles for like dealing with a community if if it does

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.000
 Build up like if there's a group of people that do want to help

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:48.920
 Is that like a challenge too just to like build up the the mentality of an open source organization where you have to handle that community?

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.240
 Triage and I don't know. I just imagine a lot of stuff involved with that

00:24:53.240 --> 00:25:00.040
 Yeah, so we like we are an open source company and we like very intentionally want a community and we like try to grow that as much as possible

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:06.760
 Even then like I don't think we do like that creative a job at doing all that stuff. I mean there's literally three of you

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:12.280
 Yeah, that's the thing that suffers the most when we get busy with other stuff. Yeah, so I can definitely see that if you're

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.320
 Like you're not really an open source company that

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.920
 You probably aren't going to spend any time there again. I think it's okay

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.840
 I just don't think it matters that much because even for us

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.800
 We like don't do an amazing job and it's still like fine

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.200
 So it's still serving a lot of other purposes

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:32.520
 Like you said like the learning aspects of it is like a baseline that that'll always be there regardless of if you're taking contributions or not

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.720
 Is a lot? I guess how do you communicate it though? Like do people ever get upset like hi?

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:42.600
 I put a PR out a week ago. Why I haven't gotten any eyes on it. What's going on? Does that ever happen?

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.760
 Yeah, I know all the time because we are

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.960
 I'm gonna push one that today and be like dax. It's been two hours. Come on

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.280
 Okay, this brings me to another topic. I wanted to talk about okay, so

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:59.160
 Uh, as I said earlier me and you have a relationship so when you push a PR

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.240
 I am gonna look at it more than I would look at a random PR

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.040
 And a lot of people might hear that and they're like that's unfair

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:12.200
 That's not a good system because you have like people are getting unfair advantages, which is 100% true

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.280
 I'm not gonna say that is not true

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:20.040
 Um, but for a lot of people their ideal world and I talk me and let's talk about this a lot with apartment hunting like

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.240
 uh

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.760
 in new york

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.520
 When you're looking for an apartment

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.520
 They're every building

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:31.560
 Insanely standardized process of like you fill out this form. You tell me your credit score

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.600
 You tell me your income

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:37.640
 We have this exact way of computing whether you get it or not and then that's the process. No one skirts that process

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.920
 There's no

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.920
 There's no like clicking with the length of none of that. It's just a standardized process

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.840
 And that is technically fair it like prevents something extremely unfair from happening

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.080
 But it also kills any opportunity for like two people to really just connect and be like, okay

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.720
 This is a good situation like we want it. We want to grow. Um,

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.440
 Whereas when we moved here in miami, uh

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.840
 We saw this house

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.640
 And we talked to the landlord and like very clearly a type of people and because they lived two doors down

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.560
 Like exactly the type of people we wanted to live near

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.840
 Uh, they really clicked with us as well. Uh, it was a really great like personal connection

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:18.680
 And then when we left they called us and being like, hey, well a lot will knock down the rent by about $100 if you if you guys

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.160
 agree, that's awesome. So

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.480
 it's like it eliminates

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:28.040
 opportunities for like for that to happen and I get that like that's technically unfair

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.760
 in in a way of looking at it, but

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.480
 I just don't think any extreme is

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.640
 Is the best in that case like you do want to allow for these really personal local

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.760
 Localized things to happen like that where something like better than like the average outcome can happen

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.760
 Um, whereas they would have just gotten an average neighbor. Now they got like a more ideal neighbor and more ideal tenant

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:54.360
 Um, so same with the pr's. It's kind of it works the exact same way. Yeah, but is that different?

00:27:54.360 --> 00:28:00.600
 Is that a wholly different thing than like nepotism like where you know who you know kind of gets you

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.840
 I don't know a career or something else. Is that a wholly different thing than what you're talking about?

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:11.000
 No, that that I think it's the same it's the same problem like another extreme is someone is like racist and like doesn't

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.480
 They have full control over who they make decisions around and they like ignore like

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.600
 They have some like crazy bias or like, you know, they just give it to someone that's that got there an unfair thing

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.080
 So I like get the other so those are the extremes. Yeah, uh, where I feel like in New York

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:32.200
 It's on the opposite extreme and I think a lot of cities. It's it's honestly extreme where it's like so overly standardized any concept of individuality

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.640
 Just like disappears entirely. It's hard to strike that balance

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.720
 But I think people react to those negative situations by taking it too far in the other way

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:44.280
 Yeah, I I'm thinking of an example of because I've always thought about the like

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:50.200
 I know the who you know thing. Is that even bad? Is it kind of the way the world works and that's okay?

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:58.360
 There was a jack uh, no joe buck. He's a like a baseball announcer. Not there was he's still an answer. I guess

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:03.480
 I don't know he does football too. I don't know he's an announcer and his dad was jack buck

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:10.360
 Who's like this legendary announcer for the cardinals here in mrs. And he he makes a lot of self-deprecating jokes about nepotism

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:14.520
 because he very much got his career from his dad being this legendary announcer, but also like

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.080
 I don't know. He's got a great voice like genetically

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:21.160
 There's like a reason that they had this great announcer voice

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.600
 And he's good at what he does like the fact that his dad was really good at it

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.520
 And that's why he got his job and I know like there was well documented the way he got into his career was

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:35.000
 Very like I mean it was nepotism like to its core, but like is the world worse for it? No, he's a good announcer

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.880
 So i'm sure that there are extremes like you're saying like cases where it plays out very badly

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:45.240
 Uh, but it's not all bad like nepotism doesn't have to be a bad word. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's uh

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:50.600
 Yeah, it is tricky like with everything the world's really complex and any kind of some like

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.440
 Rigid rule like that usually is not it's not the right way to go

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.480
 Speaking of that because this has been very top mind for me when you said the world is very complex

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:05.000
 Uh, I realized I have this worldview and I don't know if I've communicated to you or if I've ever put

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.640
 Uh enough thought to it to communicate to anybody

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.960
 Uh, but I have this worldview where like I don't blame anybody

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.280
 For literally anything. Yeah, like I view everything

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:21.240
 That happens every you know action that someone takes or reaction

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.640
 It's just like this product of like their entire life and every circumstance and every whatever

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:30.200
 and like not that they don't have like free will to like do whatever they want, but just that like

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.240
 Everyone's sort of a product of their environment. They're

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.680
 Their genetics. They're upbringing all those things

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.480
 And it's just sort of like yeah, they were going to take that action

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.920
 So it's very hard for me to like place blame in any situation

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:47.640
 On a person or a group of people because I do just view it through this lens of like

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.960
 I don't know. I haven't lived their life and I don't know. I don't know what led them to that point to do that thing

00:30:53.960 --> 00:31:00.040
 But it probably all makes sense like the math of it in the universe probably all works out. Does that make sense?

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.440
 Is that way too far removed from our conversation?

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:09.640
 No, I I feel the exact same way about everything and I think that the way it is manifests a lot is when

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.520
 Uh, I think a good example

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:18.200
 And maybe a very extreme example is uh, who's a with their nose woman Elizabeth Holmes. Oh, yeah

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.720
 Obviously you see something like that that did a bunch of stuff bad wrong

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.080
 But a part of me

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.080
 Like very much sees how I could have ended up in that situation like

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:33.960
 Just being myself and just being in a certain environment and like set up in a certain way

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.000
 uh, so I also have a tough time being like

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.480
 Getting angry or like upset because I'm like I like very

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.800
 Like I'm like the way you're saying it like you can just see how they became that way

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.000
 And you can see how like any like human put in that situation would have become that way

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.880
 Uh, and then said the other side is I like can see myself in that situation

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.960
 I'm like wow that would suck like I I would suck to be in that situation and like I

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:03.160
 I don't most things even things that are bad. I can like see how I would have just done

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.720
 The same thing. Uh, yeah, and let's talk about this a lot too. Like whenever there's

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.560
 Situations like that she feels the exact same way like she has a hard time like

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.280
 getting angry or upset

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.200
 For those reasons why I feel the same way it's like I don't I I would have done the same thing or like

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.200
 I thought I didn't know how much of it was like I was a middle child

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:27.960
 Like I've got this theory this personality that wants to like defuse any conflict and like work it out between parties

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.840
 I didn't know if it was that or if it was just some kind of other worldview, but

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.600
 Uh, I feel like there's a name for it. I feel like you probably know it and you're just hiding it like you don't want to sound too smart

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.920
 But like oh, well, that's the crow's eye principle everyone knows that

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:49.160
 Okay, I think it's it comes from feeling like there are the things are deterministic and there isn't really like free will

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.400
 Is that what it is? Yeah, I mean, I think that's where it's for me. It stems from it

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.400
 I can see where you can play it out to that degree

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.480
 And I don't know how I hold on to my beliefs that people get to choose what they do

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.920
 I still believe that I guess yeah, you like I agree that it's definitely hundred percent feels that way

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:10.440
 But the other side of me knows that some asteroid hit some other asteroid at a certain angle like

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.760
 8 billion years ago, and that's why I don't have hair in my head, right? It's like there's like

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:22.360
 There's just I just I just fully see it as if you knew all the rules of the universe

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.400
 You could just predict it forward in a perfect way

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.280
 So I don't really believe in free will at my core

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.520
 So I think that kind of bleeds out to these places where it feels like maybe I don't either

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:36.680
 Maybe I'm just it's like trying to pretend I do is because I feel like I want that control or something

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.840
 Maybe I don't actually believe it because if I really think about what I'm saying is in contradiction to free will

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:47.000
 Yeah, I'm just I'm just sort of like hanging on to something that I don't really believe

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.600
 I think it definitely feels like we have free will and I think it's

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:56.120
 Probably and also not right to like make everyone blameless, but no, right

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:02.680
 It doesn't like get you out of your consequences. It doesn't change the circumstances like like actions lead to

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.400
 Uh, it's still like all of those things apply. It's just there's a lot of empathy

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.880
 Of empathy that it brings of like this could have literally been me or this could have been anyone or like yeah

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:17.080
 A lot of things led to this besides like uh-huh. There is like a rotten spirit at the core of this person

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:22.600
 Yeah, no, I've been I've been up close on some like situations in the recent

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.840
 Weeks that have led to those thoughts. This is it didn't come out of nowhere

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:32.760
 Uh, but I I feel like I'm in contrast the way I view it is in contrast to everyone else around me

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:37.720
 Which is like no, this person's at fault. No, this person. It's like their fault and I don't know

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.080
 I just view it like

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:43.240
 They are who they are and that's how they would have that would have played out a hundred times out of a hundred times

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:47.640
 Yeah, yeah, I feel the same way cool. We were supposed to disagree with me. That would have been way more fun

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.320
 To help me why we have free will

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.280
 Uh, so the other thing obviously we gotta talk about the superconductor stuff. What?

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:00.120
 What happened with superconductor stuff. I don't even know what you're talking about. Are you serious?

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:06.920
 I've been way unplugged and I'm not saying that you're this I'm like all I think about right now is astro and sst

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.920
 Like that's for weeks. So what is superconductor? Tell me more

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:16.040
 You're you're you're you're gonna feel so bad when I describe what's happening. Oh no

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:20.920
 Because it's did you learn this on happiness? It is literally everywhere like there's not a place that I can escape it

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.160
 It's literally just everywhere. Is it on twitter? It's on twitter. I made a joke about it yesterday

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.640
 I was like I don't are you serious? I was like I'm not ready to become an expert on superconductors. Okay. Tell me

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.760
 What is what is what is a super dagger? What are we? Okay? So I

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:37.000
 Again, is this the alien thing? I'm not it's not it's different. It's different

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.400
 How do I explain this? Okay, so there is there's a paper that came out

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:47.720
 Um, I guess why are you gonna feel bad because if you if you spend this time obsessed with the web framework, you're gonna feel like

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:54.120
 You're everything you do is completely meaningless when I and I tell you what this is just changed. You're hyping this up

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.680
 I'm so excited. Okay, there's a paper that came out

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:03.240
 And it's people are trying to replicate it in the next couple days because it's seemingly like simple to replicate

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.200
 Uh where people uh these three

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.720
 It's kind of confusing. They're they're kind of like arguing over who gets credit

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.000
 But uh these people from korea these reaches researchers from korea

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.280
 That that they've made a superconductor that is room temperature that's stable at room temperature

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:23.800
 Could you tell me what a superconductor is or are you getting there? Uh, again, I'm not looking at super expert on this

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.400
 So i'm not super expert on superconductor. You're not super expert on superconductor

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:33.720
 Um, but I've like seen videos of superconductors in the past where uh, you've probably seen them too. They're like these

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:38.120
 There's there's there's material that's used in certain places

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:45.320
 So the word itself that gives you a hint a superconductor means you can put energy in it and it transfers through with very very little

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.480
 Lost

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.480
 Okay, that makes sense

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:55.400
 A conductive. It's like 99.99 percent energy transmission, right? So if you think about a power line

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.920
 You just now got me out of the branch. That's not like a train conductor

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.640
 No, no, no, no, it's like well, why have you have occasions for trains? So we're gonna be back there. Okay

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:08.520
 Uh, there's so if we think about a power line like uh

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:17.560
 A power plant can only supply power to a certain distance because the heat loss from the power lines eventually like becomes too much

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:22.040
 And we lose a ton of energy even with the current distance like some percentage of energy is just lost in transmission

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:26.040
 So a superconductor can theoretically transmit energy at

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:32.760
 Near infinite distances because the loss is is so so minimal. Okay, but the issue is every superconductor

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.760
 We found so far needed to be at some like crazy low temperature to operate

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:42.280
 So like you need like liquid. I've always seen videos of like liquid nitrogen and then putting the superconductor in like showing

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:46.520
 There's other weird effect. Uh, there's a name for it where it lets you like

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.040
 It's kind of a magnetic effect where it hovers over uh

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:57.480
 Over other um, or like some other materials. So a superconductor hovers over other materials. Yeah, again, I don't know this stuff that well

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.920
 I don't know what the actual uh mechanism is but

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.040
 It has to do with something like

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:07.880
 The word superconductor implies like electrons flowing through it and something about that

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.000
 There's like some effect that it creates where it can like hover over stuff

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.320
 And you I feel like you must have seen this video like imagine like

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.880
 A bunch of like gassy liquid nitrogen and something like kind of hovering over a surface. Have you ever seen that?

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.520
 No, you should look at my youtube history. It is not that

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.280
 There's a great video where someone built a hoverboard

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:28.920
 Uh that like is made from the stuff they're constantly filling with liquid nitrogen to keep it cold enough

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.440
 It's like a real hoverboard

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:36.440
 Yeah, and they have tony hawk try to use it and it's so difficult because an actual hoverboard would be like is so so so hard to ride

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.520
 Uh, so anyway

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:42.040
 Uh really low level material and obviously the constraint has been uh,

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.600
 It needs to be super cold kind of expensive to produce

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:48.760
 Someone has built that's the people are saying that we've now have a superconductor

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.640
 That's works at room temperature and ambient pressure. So you can just have it in any environment

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.280
 And it's very cheap to make

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.200
 theoretically

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.600
 So this has implications on literally everything so I was gonna say this sounds like a big break

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.880
 It's like a

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.800
 It's a first small tiny step and like a lot needs to be done to get it

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:13.320
 Like progressive to a place where there's a lot of other variables that are uh in play

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.960
 But if you just let if you ignore that and just kind of fantasize

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:23.640
 Theoretically you could build a crazy solar power plant across the desert in the middle east and run power lines for the rest of the world

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.800
 Oh, wow

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.800
 It has implications. There's like some

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.720
 Yeah, so

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:34.680
 I feel like this in fusion research this solves like one again, not isn't solve the whole problem

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.680
 That solves like one problem in fusion

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:42.040
 Uh again with the magnetic effect the hovering effect. Now you can build uh like trains that are not

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.080
 I kind of had a maglev trains work, but again, yeah

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:51.240
 It has implications in like so people keep coming up with other areas where it could it could impact so

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.880
 We might be on the cusp of

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.840
 AI super intelligence

00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.520
 No, it has implications in in uh in semiconductors as well

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:07.160
 Yeah, exactly. So again really far-fetched, right? So that we're like all fantasizing here

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:13.000
 Um, because one the paper might not be real to there might be limitations that where it never leaves the lab

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.200
 Kind of like how graphite is we might but I know if you let yourself fantasize we might be on like a new era

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.440
 of

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.520
 Like humanity. What do you think?

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.360
 Yeah, what do you think the percentage likelihood that like this pans out is?

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:32.280
 I have no idea. I just I just you're not an expert. No, but you're you're not a super expert, but you're expert

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.520
 You think

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:38.840
 Because you just explain conductors if you can't explain super conductors, maybe just conductors. Let's start

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.040
 You're not a super expert

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:46.680
 Give me it. Give me like is it a coin flip. Is it like a 1% chance with like a moon shot?

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.480
 I don't know. I don't know. I feel like I

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.640
 I have no idea your intuition is good. I want to know what your gut is. Is this gonna happen?

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:59.240
 Something about it makes me feel like it's a yes. Yeah, I do feel like it checks this box for me

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:04.440
 That's like I do feel like there's gonna be these weird little dominoes that happen that just like completely alter everything

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.560
 Yeah

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.760
 So it checks out for that because that might immediately jumped all these other fields that are like making breakthroughs

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:13.160
 You think of AI you think of fusion energy

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:19.560
 I mean both those things are way ahead of where people thought they'd be at this point in time and you think about like something like this just

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:25.800
 Being a catalyst. It's it's really exciting. What's really crazy about this is no new technology

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.320
 Need to first exist for this thing to be produced

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.800
 Uh, I saw someone saying that you could have made this in the lab in like 1890

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:41.080
 Do you know anything about like the material or whatever is going on here? It's like some kind of led thing led. Yeah, it was led all

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.600
 Yeah, we were interesting. We ran away from lead and now we're running back

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.760
 Presumably it's not just led. There's like they're doing something. They're adding something to lead. Yeah, yeah

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:57.080
 There's some so basically that they actually discovered this material initially in 1999 these these scientists

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:02.440
 Uh-huh, and they were kind of and what's weird is they're not like they're not like these like really renowned

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:07.320
 Scientists they were kind of like mid-tier scientists that were kind of played at this on the size of a side project

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.120
 And they finally got funding a couple years ago

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:16.840
 Two of them to like explore it deeper and they sent in like a big shot scientist and babysit them. So there's three of them now

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.280
 Uh, and they they've they've they've been working on like

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.680
 Refined the process to actually produce it and then now they finally figured it out

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:30.360
 Uh, and they've been super paranoid that it was gonna leak and someone was gonna steal it because they were like so convinced that this

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.480
 Is gonna work and it is like gonna change the nobel prize-winning

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:38.120
 Statues in every city type of situation like Einstein level fame. Wow

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.480
 So the everything they've done indicates that

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:51.160
 They genuinely believe that's what's at stake here. Yeah, so I think the question of is it like fake is maybe I don't believe that it's fake

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:56.840
 Um, does it actually work is the question, but it's so easy to produce at a bunch of labs. I'm not I was actually wearing

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:03.880
 Uh a shirt from this company. That's like a space company. Um, they have all the equipment. Yeah, so they

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:08.680
 They're engineers in the past but they've been tweeting about this for the past couple days. I've been trying to replicate it

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.240
 And they should have everything in place by tomorrow or saturday

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:16.200
 Oh, wow. So we're gonna know soon if this is like something it could be replicated and if there's real stuff here

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.360
 Yeah, I get taking it to industrial. You see there's obviously a lot there, but this yeah

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.600
 This doesn't break any physics laws. It's not like someone made infinite energy and that breaks

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:31.000
 It's like it follows everything. Yeah, or like faster than speed a lot or something like we've seen that like oh the new tree knows or whatever

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:36.120
 Yeah, that people brought that paper as well where people were like we know this is wrong, but we don't know why but they did

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:40.280
 They publish it anyway. So yeah, like this this could be a major thing

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.560
 The other thing that brings up for me is there's like this

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.520
 thing about us that I hate

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.600
 Which is

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:54.360
 Actually, it was funny humans hate themselves a lot, right? Like I think if you like just look it

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.960
 I hate myself. No, I'm not gonna end up at a dual level like

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.800
 We like hate human like the concept of humanity. Like we hate them. We're like humans like scum

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.320
 and if you look at like

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:11.640
 Any fantasy story, it's always like there's a magical kingdom and then the humans arrived and they like

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:16.840
 They like destroyed it and it's it's always like we have this low level of heat of ourselves

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.520
 and

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.920
 I think that shows up in places where it shouldn't so if we think about like we're all worried about climate change

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:28.840
 Everyone is convinced that the only way to solve it is to punish ourselves because that's kind of been like

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.640
 It just shows up everywhere like in certain religions

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:36.680
 Like the idea is you're bad and you need to like repent for who you are and then you get saved if you sacrifice stuff

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:41.560
 Yeah, if you limit yourself you limit the bad parts then like then there's like a solution for you

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:45.720
 Um, and I think people have this feeling with climate change where they're like

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.520
 We need to stop having children and we need to stop like

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.400
 Doing xyz. We need to stop stop stop stop stop

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.760
 And if we repent for the badness that we are and agree that we have yep

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:02.440
 We will stop climate change. Uh, it's completely impractical because that's nice to say that from like a very developed country

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:09.000
 Uh saying all those countries. Yeah, they're developing. It's yeah billions of people you're like denying them

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.480
 But it's like it's like kind of a mess up position, but oh, yeah people believe there's like de-growth thing like the only way out of this

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.920
 Is to like shrink ourselves because like we were greedy and we grew too much

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:24.520
 But my position has been this happens all the time like in history so many so many times

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.840
 There's a famous one in india where everyone was all the scientists were predicting

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.720
 How there's a huge famine

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:38.360
 Millions of people are gonna die is gonna be disaster. We've hit the ceiling on like what the ecosystem can support for this population

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:44.520
 Yeah, there's there's like a name for people that believe that think like this. It's it's like a very like natural place to think you're like

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.000
 Okay, you can only support so many people

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.120
 then a scientist from somewhere in the midwest actually

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:54.360
 Figured out a strain of I think it was rice

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.880
 That had like crazy yield. It was like a multiple yields

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.920
 And he literally saved like millions billions of people because the yield was something that no one could predict

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:10.520
 Uh, and we've just gone through this so many times where like one or two people will innovate something that was so outside the realm of any calculation

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.840
 We just enter a new era of what's possible

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.280
 So that's what I've been hoping for and and leaning on and this kind of

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:20.120
 I think I have a lot of bias because I want this to exist to like support

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:24.280
 Yeah, my way of thinking so that's why I feel like it it can be the thing

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:28.120
 But it's an example of the type of thing that can happen. Yeah, I'm definitely guilty of the other side

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:33.160
 Like I'm guilty of the like we need to stop doing things like just that mentality of like

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:38.200
 Uh retreating a bit. I'm definitely guilty of that. So it's nice to hear your perspective

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:42.600
 It does give me this optimism that like humans will figure it out. We will solve problems

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:48.280
 We can keep pushing we will figure it out. It's a very natural place to go. I remember the it's called a mouth fusion trap

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.360
 I think it's called

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.480
 Malthusian or it's like mouthusianist or something like they are

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:57.560
 Pareto principle. Yeah, yeah, keep going. I can't I swear

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:02.120
 I don't think I actually know that many of these but somehow the ones that I know always pop up

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:06.360
 Well, I guess I guess I'm in control of the conversation to some degree. So yeah

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:12.120
 So we're all gonna have hoverboards now. Well, I think this video shows that hoverboards are kind of useless

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:20.360
 Like even tony hawking does barely ride it and if you can't but you can't ride it. I'm not gonna be able to ride it

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.440
 Look back to the future. I mean they they look so cool

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:31.000
 And useful. Yeah, I think I think friction is important. Like that's all right. It. Yeah. Maybe you can't really maybe we'll get

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.480
 Trains. Yeah, we'll finally get high speed rail and I love this story. Yeah, no kidding

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:41.000
 I love this story so much because it's like you realize all the ways we can make advancements

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:46.840
 I don't even think about materials. Like I don't think about material sciences and how much like they could just invent new combinations of things

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.360
 There's probably like infinite

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:53.480
 Combinations of things they could figure out have important impact on society. It's like

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:59.080
 I don't know. I get I'm in this little bubble with technology where I think about like all the advances we're making in technology

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.720
 But there's like so many ways that humans can push the boundaries and learn new things

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:10.840
 And you just start to imagine like alien zipping around the universe with these materials that we are just now discovering like we're little babies

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.920
 And we're figuring stuff out. I don't know. I love it. It's all interconnected too, right? Like

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.880
 This discovery might push

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:23.320
 the cost of compute a lot further down which then enables all sorts of things that

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.840
 All sorts of stuff that we just ignore because it is not

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:34.760
 Possible. Yeah, which then you know, we were able to do better research exactly and lock stuff in fusion

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.840
 Which leads to like more abundant energy and then it's just like this crazy feedback

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.960
 Yeah, yeah, Pareto principle or something

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:46.040
 Yeah, I mean if this leads to fusion then a fusion is super that makes energy super cheap

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.960
 Then we can suck carbon out of the air for really cheap

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:53.480
 Yeah, like the sound really there's just like so many so many things so it feels so much like a video game

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:57.880
 It's like insane how much like a video game it feels. Yeah, like the the the arc of it

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:03.560
 The yeah, like you like research one technology and I'll lock another one and then like eventually you're like working on high level things

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:06.120
 Yeah, it does that is some games. Yeah

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:13.160
 Sorry, I know these things. I said Pareto principle is a joke needed in laugh and I want everyone to know I didn't think that was actually a Pareto principle

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.480
 I don't know what the Pareto principle is. I don't remember

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.080
 But when I said it it was just a joke. Okay, I just have to say a joke

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:23.480
 It's a joke. I don't know if you principles Adam's Adam remembers. I just remember that word for some reason

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:28.120
 Yeah, it reminds me of Japetto. I I think a Pinocchio. Well, Pareto wasn't Italian

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:32.840
 Economics. Oh, it's so this Japetto. Okay, maybe I don't know. I don't know I hear

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.080
 Same family basically

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:45.160
 Yeah, so anyway, this has a huge impact on react server components too. No, it doesn't wait

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.640
 You got me a little distracted. Oh, yeah

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:57.480
 So bringing his back to the beginning where you're like oh, I've been doing his web framework stuff

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.640
 Are you even motivated to work on code splitting now?

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:04.200
 Oh, no, I super am but like it does put everything in a new perspective. Now

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.080
 I've got to read the stories and I got to know I want to see the paper

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:11.880
 I don't understand it. I love when like a new big paper comes out and it's like monumental until like skim it

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:16.440
 Like you know what you're doing like oh, okay, well those those math symbols cool

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:22.200
 Well, what's interesting is I think this is actually one of those things that is

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:27.960
 I would say most technical things like this are so outside the realm of

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:32.760
 Understanding like it's just not even worth it. I think this what's amazing about this. It's so simple

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.080
 It's like it actually is. Yeah, it's understandable

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.800
 Like how how quickly do you think there's a team a two-pizza team at amazon doing something

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:44.920
 To try and use these materials and like the semi-conductor lab or something. I feel like that's a thing

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:49.640
 They're probably jumping on it. So they're order of operations is first

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:56.360
 Uh put out a memo that says we are now a blank company. So now they're a superconductor company

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.240
 Oh, okay, and their CEO does an interview where they're like

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.800
 Uh, we were actually ahead of everyone in this

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.480
 And it's it's I didn't know this was their thing

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:08.520
 And then and then like then they like kind of try to build something and catch up

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:13.880
 I'm I'm just referring. I don't know if you saw the AI comments that uh the CEO of a AWS making

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:18.200
 Oh, no, I didn't see it. Yeah, he basically gave an interview where he was just like

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.280
 uh

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:24.920
 Were ahead in all this all this stuff and we're gonna do this all better and like yeah

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:30.440
 Like just kind of like say stating it as though like they've always been ahead and they're like not even worried

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:35.080
 Um, I want it to be true so bad. I want it to be true so bad because

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:39.320
 Uh, I do want access to all the lm stuff. I want it to be a lot cheaper

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:44.680
 And from like a technical point of view, it's actually important that exists in AWS because I can't just be shipping

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:50.200
 Like a lot of companies like the whole thing with all this AI stuff is you can hyper personalize stuff

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:55.560
 Like yeah, but you can't just start sending hyper personal stuff to like the open AI

00:51:55.640 --> 00:52:01.560
 Api if you're doing like anything medical. You can just start shipping and who knows what they so having stuff all in your own infrastructure is important

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.840
 I'm getting a cheaper is important. So I wanted to be true

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:11.160
 But I'm like really skeptical that they have made they're like the the image they're projecting externally anywhere lines up

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:16.520
 To what they have been really quiet on like the llm space like they do a lot of AI stuff

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:21.480
 Obviously, they're like a lot of machine learning stuff. I guess with like sage maker and all that family of stuff

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.520
 but like

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:28.520
 The the llm stuff. They're saying now that they're sort of like they're up there with all these people that are pushing the boundaries

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:34.440
 They just have been quiet. He basically was saying that you can't count microsoft. They outsourced the work to open AI

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:41.160
 So azure is not relevant. They didn't like do they don't have any expertise internally. We have the expertise internally. The thing is

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:47.640
 They can make one claim always for no matter what happens, which is they are operating at a bigger scale than anyone

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.720
 And anyone they have more customers than anyone. So yeah, yes

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:56.280
 They will obviously enter into any space at like a crazy advantageous position

00:52:56.280 --> 00:53:01.960
 But he kind of went further than that being like he made it sound like no like this is like we've always been doing this

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.680
 We've been doing this. Yeah, and like we were turning our own LMS

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:11.160
 I would not be surprised if they didn't start doing that so after like the general public was aware of this stuff

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:18.920
 I would be kind of as if they didn't be very customer obsessed. So like that makes sense that the customers come to them and they're like I want to do LLM stuff

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:23.800
 On my AWS account. Yeah, like we've always been doing LLM stuff. Yeah, it's coming

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:30.200
 Well, have you seen there? I think we've talked about him before there's an AWS hero who works at hugging face and he publishes

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.520
 Roughly an article every day

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:37.160
 And he's got an article on how to train like how to fine tune llama 2

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:42.920
 On SageMaker, which is really interesting to me. Like I'd love to play with that and have like an open II alternative

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:48.200
 Maybe it's like 90 percent of opening. I don't know what gpt4 versus llama 2 looks like

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:52.760
 But yeah to have that on your own AWS account running on a serverless SageMaker

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.320
 You know inference endpoint. That's pretty cool

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.920
 It's like a whole article walking through it. Yeah, it's a very important

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:04.680
 Workflow to figure out for this to actually make it into products because that's kind of the limiter right now. That's why all the

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.840
 AI products that are getting funded are just like

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.720
 a UI wrapper

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.520
 Because you just like the other stuff is it's too hard

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.360
 But the scale of it the economics of it do not make sense like yeah

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:24.200
 I can say as a company that has a lot of users like working for a company that has a lot of users

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.880
 Uh, we can't just like outsource everything to open AI like

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.920
 Most of our users don't pay us

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:36.920
 Uh, there's like ad revenue and stuff, but like that it would have to be like training your own LLMs on

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:41.480
 Much more economic infrastructure. So that yeah, that's exciting to me

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:45.720
 I think able to be able to get there. I think like I do look at them as the only cloud that matters

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:50.840
 I mean, I guess like I know you think about cloud flare and all these but like in terms of the big three like azure google

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.160
 Yeah, I don't know. I just don't care about those things

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.320
 They will get there and I want it to happen

00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:01.160
 Sooner than later because that also gives us as a like SST as a company an opportunity to like oh

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:04.280
 Bring AI to people in a way they can actually

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:10.440
 Uh use it at scale not just for like little toys. So that like I got i'm excited from that angle as a user

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.320
 I'm also excited like boomy. We have it's really great

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.240
 Uh feature that when a doctor goes to go see a patient

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:20.600
 They get a nice summary of everything about the patient

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:24.520
 So they don't have to like read through the charts. They know there's important things I need to know

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:31.080
 Uh, and even we like like let us come with a prompt for open AI that generates a pretty good good

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:35.000
 And that's a perfect use case because it doesn't have to be perfect because if it's

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.320
 Misses a detail. It's like not the end of the world

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.640
 It's just not like a crazy viability situation there

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:44.520
 Like we can kind of send data to open AI as long as we don't say like

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:48.760
 The person's name or who it is and open information but

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:54.040
 Again, like there's there's a cost question. We like need to make sure that economically that all makes sense

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:58.600
 I think it will for us because we're b2b. It's like everyone cares us and we can differ forward the cost

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:05.640
 Uh, but like yeah, just like that complexity there like I need it in AWS and yeah, I like to see that it's coming

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.320
 I'm excited

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.320
 and now i'm excited that

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:14.840
 A new material entered the world and it's gonna change everything and I don't care if it's still early. I'm buying it

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.000
 buying it on the hype

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.480
 Well, there's all those prediction market. Have you seen these prediction mark this concert prediction market?

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:25.720
 You know what that is is this like futures like is this like a banking thing?

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:30.680
 Yeah, basically. It's basically like I think it came out of the crypto world. I don't know if it existed outside of that

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:37.000
 Basically, someone can create a bet. It's business betting. It's a bet for anything and people can place

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.800
 Their bet on either side and that creates lines on like what people think

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:46.360
 Oh, so there's like a line on whether this is gonna plan out. Yeah, pan out exactly. So

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:52.120
 I think it's pretty low. I think it's like under 20% of people believe

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:59.240
 That it will yeah, there's like only 20 percent. Oh, really? On the will side. Yeah, so most people are betting on the lower and lower

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.760
 as like time

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.760
 Huh? So

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:07.320
 Everyone's mostly a pessimist. We're some of the few optimists out here. Is that what you're saying?

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.640
 Yeah, I mean, I just wanted to be true so bad

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:15.080
 I feel like those betters are very efficient though. I feel like lines are very efficient and they're good

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:19.480
 Those prediction marks are interesting. They're like wisdom of the cards or whatever. Yeah, yeah

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:24.280
 It's like if you have a jar of jelly beans. Have you ever heard that? No, what is that? No, I'm sure you've heard that

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.640
 You've read 10 books

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.640
 Uh, if you have like a jar of jelly beans

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:31.880
 And you asked like one person to guess how many jelly beans are in there like they're never gonna be anywhere close

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:36.760
 But if you ask like a hundred people and you average all of their responses pretty close. Oh, wow

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:42.520
 It's interesting. Yeah, this is like there's science behind it. I always say that. I'm always like there's a paper or something

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:47.560
 I don't just say these things lightly. Okay. I'm not so my best friends or scientists

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:55.800
 Oh, really? I'm just kidding. I was like, I was like, that's what you're like. You're like, no, it's true. Yeah, I've got friends

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.800
 That's what I should say. Yeah

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:05.400
 Okay, all right. Well, I got a lot of work to do on astro astro site and astro SEC

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:10.280
 So I'm gonna hop off here. Well, the world is changing underneath. Nice. That's work for that's work for me

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.320
 You're doing work for me. Oh, yes. Sorry. Nice. I'm gonna give you some work

00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:15.880
 That's a good work. I don't know the work for me today

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:23.880
 That's cool. This was fun. This was a good one. I don't know. I don't always feel at the end of it like that was a good one

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:30.440
 This was a good one. Yeah, exciting day in general. Yeah, exciting day. The world is changing. Okay. Cool. Good acts

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:46.140
 (gentle music)
