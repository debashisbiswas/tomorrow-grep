WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 Did I just leave? Yeah, he waved. Did he say it to go? He waved. Did he message me? Okay, I guess Adam had to drop off

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.000
 Aaron was telling me about how so he lives in Hawaii. I know if you're aware, you could probably

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.240
 hear the birds and the nice things. I wasn't aware. That's amazing. That's why you're so tan.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.960
 You've got the nice complexion. Hawaii. I was trying at the last minute, I realized, oh,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.080
 I should really do this from like an outdoor location that looks like really Hawaii.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:55.200
 But my my own backyard, it looks it has this one corner that looks like super Hawaii.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.040
 Well, there is, I can't predict when the gardeners are going to come. So there's like a 10% chance.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.440
 Your indoors looks Hawaii though too. I can like tell you're in Hawaii with his background.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.440
 Yeah, so it's not bad. I feel like my backyard can kind of look like it's Hawaii because all

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.720
 the trees in Miami are imported from like Asia. It has like that tropical vibe.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 But he was telling me that he went to go get that mic and you can't next day order anything in Hawaii.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.760
 Oh, that makes sense. So he's like a best buy. And I was talking to me and Jay where I was

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.440
 conversation two days ago of like, okay, if we would like radically move somewhere, you know,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.320
 like where in the world would we consider moving? Yeah. Now they're trying to come up with criteria

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.680
 to ask, and now I'm being like here's my criteria, what makes sense. One of the things I came up with

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:54.480
 was if a new MacBook drops, how fast can I get it? Not because I literally want MacBooks right away.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.960
 Yeah, but I thought it was a really good proxy to figure out where in the world is like really

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.680
 plugged in, you know, logistically. And one of the interesting answers I got was Singapore,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.920
 which has like the stereotype of being like a really high tech city. But on top of that,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.480
 it's like the logistics hub for that whole part of the world. So anything there, you just can get

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.120
 immediately like there's no delays on anything. But yeah, Hawaii was not on that list.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.600
 In Miami, you can get like same day stuff, right? I don't get that in the Ozarks,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.920
 like same day with Amazon or this is like such a what's the word? What's the word like

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.240
 problems when it's like a rich person problem? First world problem. Yeah, first world problem.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.160
 But yeah, we've just gotten crazy spoiled with the whole Amazon thing because in any major city,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.360
 it's absurd. Like before, it was like, oh, you pay extra and then you get like the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.000
 faster shipping. Now by default, they just deliver it to your door like several hours later.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.800
 Or like if you order the evening, it's there at like 3 a.m. So we've gotten very

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.240
 spoiled by all that. Yeah, I don't get that. And then I guess Hawaii is even worse.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.040
 That sucks. Yeah. I didn't think about that. But I guess if you if you're in Hawaii,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.800
 like who cares who needs stuff, right? Is there an adjustment or you used to it?

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.160
 Uh, yeah. I mean, it only comes up randomly like when, you know, some, you know, it's unlikely that

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.560
 it's uncommon that I feel like I need it. But it's funny, you know, Hawaii has one of the highest

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.880
 bounce rates in the world of people who move here and move back. Yeah. Yeah. And so a lot of times,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.320
 like during COVID, I had a lot of people like from the Bay Area that were like, I'm going to

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.120
 move out to Hawaii. And I'm like, okay, you know, like, but just be aware that like 80% of the people

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.480
 bounce, you know, and a lot of it is this. It's like people get here and they realize,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.920
 what I can't get, like, whatever my heart desires, like the instant.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.160
 Whatever rock. Did you realize you want to rock 4000 miles?

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.520
 This is like a curse of islands. It's like an island is always the best place to live.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.400
 But the definition of the island is like it's on its own and everything else you need is outside

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.120
 of the island. So yeah, that's, uh, that's tough. But you've been there for how long now?

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.480
 Um, six years. Nice. Didn't bounce. I don't know what the technical, like, definition of

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.160
 bouncing is. I don't know how long you have to stay. But six years seems like not bouncing.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.040
 Yeah. Yeah. We love it here. Yeah. What island? Yeah, I live on a wall, which is like the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.880
 ghettoist of the Hawaiian Islands, I guess, kind of how you measure. But it also has schools and

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.920
 hospitals and stuff. So yeah. What is, uh, what is life like? Like, what's like a day in the life

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.440
 of you? That's different than what other people would experience. I mean, a lot of it's like little

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.160
 stuff, right? Like one, one of the most minor things, and I mean, you have this where you live,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.240
 Dax, but like one of the most minor things that I love that's like super important to me is like,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.640
 I wake up every morning. I take my dog for a walk in shorts and slippers. Like, it's a minor

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.440
 thing, but I love it. You know, like, like, um, and there's beautiful mountains behind me and the

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.920
 clouds kind of like wrap around the mountains. And I just, it's, I mean, I live in a neighborhood,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.240
 like a suburban neighborhood. So in some ways, it's just like every day, you know, like it's just,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.000
 it's just everyday life, but in the other, but you know, I used to live in San Francisco and I grew

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.040
 up in Southern California, or it's warm. And the whole time I was in San Francisco, I friggin hated

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.320
 it. I hated the way I just couldn't, because I grew up with like, sun every day, you know?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.360
 And so it never felt comfortable. And after 12 years living in the city with the weather,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.480
 being able to go out every morning and in shorts is like a huge luxury. But I guess like,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.720
 other sort of like, you know, everyday things, like yesterday, yesterday was like a really calm

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.720
 Wednesday, which is like where we live, we don't care. Like the weather is always kind of the same,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.640
 but the, but the winds vary a lot. And the winds matter for like water sports. So you really look

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.320
 forward to calm wind days. And yesterday with a dead Wednesday, and Abby, my daughter and I

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.120
 went out for a paddle on a one man canoe. That's what she does, like for her sport, for school sport.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.040
 And we have like local offshore islands that are like a mile offshore that are at small,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.440
 like Ilets. And we paddled out to those and we looked at the fish and we like, you know,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.920
 we practiced. I made the canoe, like especially hard for her to paddle by sitting on the back.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:22.000
 Like those are like everyday tends to involve like outdoor like water stuff for us. Anyways,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.680
 that's different from the places.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.360
 The reason Adam and I were both laughing at the beginning when you were like,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:34.160
 you take your dog out for a walk in your shorts. That's almost that's very similar to how I describe

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.200
 my day to day, except juxtapose the way you describe it. I sound like a total crazy person,

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.160
 because what I do every morning is I also love the sun. I love going out and getting the sun

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.360
 right away, except I'm like basically, there's in my boxers, nothing else. And I don't,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.360
 I don't walk my dog. I blow bubbles for him in the backyard and he just sprints back

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.520
 and forth for 10 minutes. Yeah, same. I totally get it. We basically do the same thing.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.120
 I put clothes on. I wear clothes when I wake up. That's next goal is how long in the day can

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.360
 you go without putting on clothes? That's what I remember how annoying I was when it was cold

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.440
 for two weeks and I had to like put on like a sweater before going outside. Yeah, that does

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.600
 sound nice though. The water, I think what I, what's cool about different places is like the hobbies,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:26.080
 like orient around like the physical environment. And I really should get into water sports stuff.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.800
 I've been here for a while. I've just been too busy to like develop a hobby,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.480
 but I really want to pick up something that involves that because you can't do that in most

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.120
 places, you know? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I talk about that a lot with my kids, you know,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.000
 it's like, and with other people who who visit us is like that, that I also find that really

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.560
 interesting how the lifestyle like, you know, I mean, I guess it shouldn't be surprising,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.800
 but I think that in, you know, like hyper connected, like online world, people just sort of assume that,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.520
 you know, every place in some ways they have this like deep assumption that life will be the same,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.920
 but there's these like ways that it's different and it has to do with like the physical environment,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.600
 you know, like culture, culture like adapts to the physical environment. And like, you know,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.120
 Hawaii is like famous for surfing and blah, blah, blah, but where we live in Hawaii,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.600
 it's always onshore winds because of the trade winds. So like 300 days out of a year,

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.520
 it's onshore winds, which is bad for surfing. People don't surf here on this part of the island,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.560
 and what is the hobby instead is this either like type wording is really popular here,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.680
 those sort of like wind sports or that's what I want to get into. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty big here,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:33.760
 too, or like canoeing paddling. And so I always like laughed at these like old men who are into

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.960
 paddling. When I moved here, I'm like, I'm never going to do that. I'm going to surf, you know,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.280
 blah, blah, blah. And like, you know, I did try to, but then it involved like driving 30 minutes every

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.800
 day. And then I like tried to canoe one day and I was like, wow, this is pretty fun, you know,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.840
 and it's like, I'm surprising. People do it because it's fun, you know? Yeah.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:55.120
 Also, those people, like I follow a bunch of people that are like, kind of fitness space,

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.360
 a lot of them are older, they are so ripped and all they do is paddle. It's like such a good

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.960
 workout for your whole body. Well, that's a workout. Yeah. Yeah, we go to the gym and we try to

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:10.240
 simulate it, right? Like we're in a boat canoeing. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's a workout. You're out

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.560
 on the water. It's beautiful. You know, it's, I think it's like the same reason that people like,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.200
 you know, like backcountry skiing, you know, which involves a lot of walking and stuff and, you know,

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.640
 mostly you're out in nature. And then there's like every so often, there's a little bit of

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.200
 adventure too, you know? Yeah. Nice. Guys, you're making me want to go outside. I just, we've

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.840
 spent the whole winter in the Ozarks inside and it's just depressing. Can't wait to do something

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.240
 outside. Yeah, basically. So a quick little intro now that we were like, you know, 50 minutes.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.200
 So this is Aaron. Aaron's a founder of, is it Rossi Corp or is it Rosie Corp? I remember you

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.440
 were posted yesterday, like laughing at people struggling to pronounce it and that'd be thinking

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:56.720
 about it. I say Rossi Corp. But Rosie Corp is also correct. It's named after the Raul Sonanti,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:06.400
 which is Don Quixote's horse in that book. But it's also the name of the ship in the expanse,

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.600
 the science fiction novel. Oh, interesting. Television series and that word. Is it a good series?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.160
 Is that a good? Yeah, it's very into sci-fi lately. So I need new ones.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:22.880
 Expand. Okay. The expanse, the series is, I mean, it's an investment. You know, those books are

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.560
 big and there's like eight of them or something like that. Oh, geez. Okay. Yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.000
 It's like they explore. It's like a future where Mars is colonized and there's like a third entity,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.720
 which is all like the mining operations, and that's right, Bill. And there's like a crazy political

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.160
 tie between Earth and Mars. And then like these, the Belters, I guess I forgot that were called.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.000
 It's pretty good. Okay, I gotta write it down. Keep going. Sorry. It's been so badly.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.880
 People probably don't recognize that name, but they might recognize, I mean, they'll definitely

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.160
 recognize that I talk about it incessantly. So your company makes initially made replicas,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.640
 that's how I met all of you. And then more lately, working on zero, which has been really fun.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.400
 We've got it into production past couple weeks. Adam just sitting there, like wishing he could

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.960
 yeah, something. I can't wait to learn so many things on this call. I don't want to be annoying,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.360
 but like I have so many questions. And this is the thing I've hovered around just being close to

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:23.280
 you, Dax, for so long. And I need, I need to just take the time to get up to speed. And I feel like

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.400
 a lot of people listening probably do too, because there's a lot of people that probably like local

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.200
 first, yeah, I've heard all this like, I just never done anything with it. And like, we all know we

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.360
 should. Yeah, it's well, it's this funny, tight little circle, because the other day I posted,

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:41.680
 because I wanted to talk to a bunch of AI companies using SST. One, I thought I would get like five

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.560
 responses, we ended up getting like 30 companies that reached out. And a bunch of them were like,

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.280
 Oh yeah, we're doing AI with SST. And also we're using zero. And this is such a funny little,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.840
 little circle bubble. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, the reason I was mentioning that is I think the

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.920
 reason we got in this call was someone asked you a question about some of the previous things you

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.480
 guys worked on prior to this, which I hadn't known much about. So we're kind of talking about like

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.880
 you telling a little bit about that story. I never it's a it's a long story. So I don't I never go

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.840
 like where to start or how? No, just go. We can we'll definitely we had DHH on and he talked for

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:22.480
 like 90 minutes straight. We never said you can really do anything in the audio, the audio bars

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.000
 and editor. It was just him talking and then we had him completely empty. You won't do that. So

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.360
 you're fine. Do whatever you want. Yeah. I mean, so one story I always tell is that, you know,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.360
 I worked I worked at Google for 10 years. I'm actually going to interrupt you already because I

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:43.360
 I want to say one thing before you start. So I actually technically intersected with Aaron when

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:51.280
 I was like 15 years old, because I was a grease monkey user. And I was using it to steal gift cards

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:58.320
 from this site that didn't protect their URLs per properly. So I like didn't know that there's

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.440
 probably better way to do it. But I was like messing with a piece of monkey and I wrote some kind of

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:07.040
 script that just kind of iterated through every combination of URL. And I and I got I think I

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:13.840
 stole enough for like $110 worth of $5 gift cards. And I bought an Xbox hard drive. And then I got

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:20.800
 really scared and I stopped doing it. So that was Aaron's work. Making the world a better place.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:30.240
 Love it. Yeah. So I after after grease monkey, I actually kind of got me the job at Google.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:36.000
 And I didn't work I worked on Blogger for like a very short time. I got thrown off that project

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.760
 like within months. And like funny story about that. But I found myself on this project on this

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.080
 this like group that was like had people that were supporting Firefox. So we at the time,

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.280
 Firefox was like a not the biggest browser, but like a growing important browser. And it was really

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.960
 important to Google that there be like an alternative browser and that the web succeed. And so they

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.040
 were like putting money into supporting Firefox. They had they were paying people to work on

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.920
 Firefox. And they're also paying people to build extensions and stuff like that. So that's how I

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.880
 on that project. And one of the very first things we built, the very first thing I built on that

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:16.320
 team, this was literally like four months into my career, was we were like brainstorming ideas for

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:23.440
 extensions in ways that we could like ways that we could, you know, support Firefox. And we came

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:31.360
 up with the idea of syncing bookmarks in history. So we wrote this extension for Firefox to sync

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.160
 your bookmarks in history between different Firefox instances, which is now like a major feature that

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:43.440
 like a lot of browsers have. And my friend, one of my best friends at the time that worked at Google

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.760
 made this side joke to me one day, he's like, you know, we're going to be working on sync for

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:56.480
 the rest of our careers, right? The funny thing is that like he was more of like, you know,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.600
 right on the edge of like designer and engineer, you know, these types. And he became the lead

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.880
 designer of Chrome and then went on to become the lead designer of Android. Wow. So we've got like,

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.200
 you know, did really, really well, no longer works at all. Forget about the rest of his career.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:20.960
 Never worked on sync again after that. So he learned his lesson.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:31.760
 So I mean, I guess like, yeah, so I worked on that little sync engine. And then at Google,

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.960
 I worked on Gears, which was a way that we were trying to add sync to browsers as an extension

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:44.160
 so that we could build off on Gmail. And then, you know, I sort of came back to sync on and off

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:49.920
 throughout my career. And like after I left Google, I had this friend that I worked closely with

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:56.400
 at Google and we were really inspired by Git, the version control system and how it worked

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.640
 internally. Like if any of you, if anyone, if you've never ever like looked at how Git works,

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.360
 like the UI that is a disaster, the CLI is a disaster, like a famously terrible disaster.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.160
 Internal design of Git is just beautiful. You know, like if you're into software,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:16.880
 it's just a completely inspired idea. It's just one of these, one of these like things that I feel

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:23.600
 like is like discovered, not like invented, you know? And especially if probably a lot of people

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.840
 listening to this have no familiarity with source control before Git, but like it was just this

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.320
 horrifically complicated thing, you know, that didn't work at all. That was like really slow.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.680
 And so we were really inspired by this and having worked on sync like multiple times

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:43.280
 throughout our career and knowing how complicated it was, like we had this intuition like what if,

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.760
 you know, what if you could have something that worked like using the same principles as Git,

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.400
 but it worked for like application data, you know? And so you could have sync, you know, that that

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:59.120
 worked really well. So me and my friend, Raf, we started Attic Labs sort of on this, on this idea.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.920
 And we built NOMS, which was a new database basically that used sync that was very similar to Git's

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:12.640
 internal design. But pretty quickly, after we started the project, we got scared off the original

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.840
 idea of doing like application level sync because of conflict resolution. Because Git doesn't do

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:23.040
 conflict resolution, Git just like, you know, makes me to deal with it. Yeah. And when we started

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.320
 looking at that, we like didn't have any great ideas. And we're like, well, maybe, you know,

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:31.440
 just the core idea of like, you know, syncing structured data without conflict resolution is

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:37.360
 like useful enough by itself. And this useful enough is like a theme I feel like I hope that

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.360
 we'll come back to like in this in this call. And it's something that I've, I've like learned

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.400
 by less alone. And I feel like I've learned a lot from you actually, DAX about this. And so,

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:52.160
 but but anyways, I think that was a mistake that we made early on with with NOMS. And we we sort

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.680
 of like, we're like, what, what can we get away with, you know, rather than like, what's what do

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:03.200
 people actually need, you know? And so we started trying to take this idea and making like a

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.880
 synchronizing application database for it and sort of like searching for a problem, you know,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.240
 that this could solve. And we build NOMS and it's like really cool tech. And we couldn't figure

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.200
 out like how to market it because we didn't start with a problem. We started with like a thing,

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:23.520
 you know, and after like four years, like we built this really cool database and the team was

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.080
 getting tired, some of the team. And so we decided to sell the company and we sold it to Salesforce.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.640
 So just to understand a little bit better, like this database, like how did it fit in

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:39.040
 to someone? Like, is it like ends up being the primary database for your application?

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:44.400
 We didn't know, you know, like, we were like, I mean, this sounds so stupid in retrospect,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.120
 you know, and so, and so cliche, but like, you know, we've all we've all been the exact situation.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.000
 So it's very relatable. It just sounds so stupid when you explain it 10 years later, when you're

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.040
 a lot smarter. So like, you know, we, we were like, we were like, okay, what if you take, you know,

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.280
 the way that that Git works, but you store structured data instead of files, you know,

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.680
 internally, Git has a data structure that looks very similar to a B tree, you know, but it's not

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:15.200
 a B tree. And databases use V trees to be fast. So we're like, what if you combine these things,

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:25.760
 you know, what happens, you know, it was good as a go. Like, basically what NOMS is, is it's like

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:33.760
 an embedded database, kind of like SQLite, written in go. And it has this sort of weird

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.480
 data model that's not relational. It's, it's, it's more like a graph database, I guess. And that

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.240
 was kind of like custom designed again, because we weren't really, I don't know why we went that

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.160
 way. We had some ideas. I'm done. We did have some ideas of how it would be used and that

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.240
 cost us to build this unique data model. But also I think we were kind of scared off by the

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:58.160
 relational thing, you know, and again, we were like, what can we get away with? I feel really

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:05.600
 embarrassed admitting this now. But, you know, it was my first startup. If that was your first

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:11.680
 startup, like, that's pretty good. Yeah. That's, that's pretty good. You should have seen, like,

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.240
 it wasn't until like my fourth startup where I started to sound like somewhat competent. So,

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:22.800
 it's a synthetic database written in go. And it, the sort of key innovation is this data structure

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:29.440
 called a probability tree that we invented, which is like a mashup of a B tree and, and gets like

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.600
 internal content adders thing system. And you can like, I don't know, you can use it like SQLite,

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.360
 except for the difference is that you can like really efficiently replicate it to somebody else,

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.000
 you know, so think of like, think of like light stream, you know, you know, you can kind of do

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 that, but it's like built on these like get data structures. We had a bunch of ideas for how to

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.360
 use this. And I think, you know, if we would have kept going, we could have like found something,

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:54.640
 but, but the interesting story is that like after we open sourced it, so like after we sold the

00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:01.600
 company, which was really just like a aqua hire, but after we sold the company, there was this

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.640
 other company called Dolt that came along, and they actually had an idea for how to like commercialize

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:13.280
 this, and they took and they made like a successful like startup out of it. So they, they, they took

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:19.200
 noms and they made it into a relational database, like a MySQL compatible relational database. So

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.720
 they built this thing called Dolt that looks on the wire exactly like MySQL, you can use all the MySQL

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.880
 tools with it. You can like, you know, you can literally store MySQL data in it and program

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.440
 against it like it was MySQL. But it can also that it also has this really efficient like one way

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:39.760
 sync built into it. Nice. What is this powers powers like regular applications or was there

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:45.280
 like a specific type of thing that particularly? Dolt started out wanting to use it for like

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:51.920
 sharing data sets, like their idea, their idea was that like, you know, we have like GitHub for

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.880
 sharing code and like at the time like AI wasn't really going, but like with like data science

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:02.000
 was like really popular. And, and they were like, you know, you need a place to share like public

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.600
 data sets. So they created this thing called Dolt Hub. And, and they tried to like bootstrap an

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.880
 environment, like an ecosystem of people sharing public data sets on there. Like a big part of

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:20.560
 data science, I understand my understanding is that is like cleaning and like, yeah, it's not like

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:28.480
 the actual like science part. Yeah. It's like removing mistakes from data like manually, you know.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.600
 So there is kind of, I guess there is kind of a need for like a place where you can share

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.560
 these data sets. But then it also turned out that a lot of people wanted to use it like as part

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.400
 of workflows. Like they wanted an application database that like supported branching basically.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:48.960
 So like, I, my understanding is that people, it's, it's popular with like biotech, you know,

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.080
 because they're like working on these big like genome data sets and they want to support like

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.560
 branching internally on these data sets. And it's also popular in my understanding with like game

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.440
 developers for the same reason. It's like, they have these huge like, you know, stores that team

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:08.000
 has been going now for I think like four years. And they have this like crazy slog, right? They're

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.880
 trying to implement MySQL compatibility, you know, on a different database. It's just like,

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.120
 it's just an insane amount of features, you know, to just like crank out, you know,

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:22.000
 and like bug for bug compatibility. And that was another team that I was really inspired by

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.760
 when I went back to do another startup is just like watching like how dogged they were at just

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.400
 like pursuing this vision, you know, and like, and how slowly it took for it to get traction,

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.160
 you know, because like, you know, initially, like just nobody cared what they were doing,

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.040
 you know, and they, you know, and they just kept at it like month after month after year,

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.240
 after year, you know, and it built little by little. And I, you know, I realized like, okay,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.040
 like these things, you know, they take time, you know, like people can't just drop what they're doing

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.800
 and use your thing, you know, like the day they hear about it, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, especially

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:02.640
 and especially in DevTools, like, even if they love your thing, how often are they starting a new

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:08.080
 project? It's like, at best, maybe a year from now, they might have the opportunity. So yeah,

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:13.040
 patience is huge. But yeah, I mean, it's funny. So you were inspired by that. And I kind of similar

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:20.240
 thing with a very similar mindset to you because I think this was just kind of how startups

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:27.840
 were framed and maybe are so framed. It's all about like, chip, the smallest thing possible. And

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.600
 like, you know, it doesn't matter if it's great, like, you know, you try to get traction right away,

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.240
 if it doesn't work, give up on the next thing, that was like the vibe, especially like in that

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.880
 time. But that's, that's kind of how I thought about everything. And it wasn't until I saw a bun

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:47.680
 that this clicked for me, where I was like, his task is so clear, there's no mystery to it.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.600
 It's like, you just need to achieve 100% nowadays compatibility. That's a task very straightforward.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:25:02.000
 It's just going to take a lot of brutal effort to incrementally get there. And I just saw how like,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.600
 something about that simplicity is nice. And then, too, I saw the clarity of like, oh, yeah,

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:13.840
 like, if something can be created within a month, it innately only has one month of value. It takes

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:20.240
 four years to make buns somewhat usable. That clearly is more valuable. So just like a fundamental

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:24.880
 level, like that kind of clicked for me. And a lot of people talk about this, like Paul Graham has

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.720
 something about just do things that are hard because it drags your competitors over the same

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:35.520
 path. So this idea has been around for a while, but yet also took me a while to not shy away from

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:41.520
 stuff that looked too big. And instead feel the opposite, like now I get more excited when it looks

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:46.240
 like it's really difficult. Yeah. Because the easy things are never actually, they're never

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:52.000
 actually easy, you know, it's easy. You go and do it and turns out, you know, it's not really going

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.840
 to hit the way you hoped it would. Or like, there's like a bunch of other people also doing it.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:02.080
 Yeah, I mean, it depends on what you mean by hard to, right? Like my co-founder,

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:08.160
 Roth, an addict, you know, he had, I remember this day where we were looking at some,

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.280
 some problem inside the data structure of blah, blah, blah. And it, you know, I think we were,

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.000
 we were going to try to scale up norms to like run on S3. We actually had this idea of backing

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 norms by like S3, but which is now a thing that people are doing. We were looking at that. And he

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.760
 would, and we realized it was going to be really hard. And he was like, well, that's great, you know,

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:33.440
 like, because like hard we can do, you know, and, and, but there's, and that was true. But like,

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.960
 there's also this other kind of hard, this like really boring, like, like, frustrating hard where,

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:44.160
 you know, there's just like a million, like you're talking about with fun, you know, or like we

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:50.080
 encountered this a lot at Rossi Corp with like making like stuff work with every stupid like

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.960
 tool in the JavaScript ecosystem. Yeah, that's exactly what it's like.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:04.320
 For me, it's Prisma. Prisma has been that they've been scaling me. Prisma Pla, the lambda has

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:10.800
 caused me so many hours. I didn't more productive trying to like dethrone Prisma than like trying

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:17.120
 to get Prisma to like work right. I mean, like, I mean, these tools are popular because they do

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.640
 something useful. So it's like, I don't want to, I don't want to like crap on, you know, these

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.840
 tools and like, I don't know what it is about the JavaScript ecosystem in particular that

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.400
 inspires like seven different ways to do every single thing, you know, but it's just a reality,

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.400
 right? Like, yeah, you just got to get to work. You know, it's a matter of what opinion you have,

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.840
 like, if you're not going to just make everything work, your thing is just not going to grow.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.840
 And that's another lesson I feel like I had to like flip my instincts on.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:48.320
 Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. So anyways, that was, that was nom's. So we sold out the Salesforce and

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.400
 I think like some of the team is still there. Um, and but like I, I stayed for a little while,

00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:00.080
 not too long. Um, and then, and then left and I experimented with a few other like companies,

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.600
 but I think I like still like really in my heart want to do my own thing. And I started tinkering

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:14.240
 with sync again. Um, addicted to sync. Well, I mean, it's worth, it's worth talking about that

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.520
 too. I mean, the, the reason why is because it makes really good UI, you know, um, I started my

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:25.120
 career as a UI developer, you know, and I like making things, uh, I like making you, you know, um,

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:31.360
 and making things really fast. And unfortunately, you know, just the reality is that like all

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:36.400
 software today's client server, you know, um, so like when I started out doing UI development,

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.880
 I was making all these JavaScript widgets and stuff like that. And you can make those

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.280
 widgets really fast, but it doesn't really matter because they have to talk to the server, you know,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.320
 so you can make the menu drop down really fast, but then they click on something in the menu,

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.520
 it has to wait for the server to, you know, this is like fundamental thing. And if you want to make

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:56.240
 really good UI, you need the data local, you know, um, and so that's, that's why I keep coming back

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.800
 to sync. And I think that's why like the industry keeps like coming back and looking at sync every

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:08.080
 so often. Um, yeah. So I was like thinking about it again, um, thinking about norms and like, um,

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:15.440
 and I stumbled across this, um, this paper. Um, I think the, the, there was like a research paper

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.840
 called Calvin. I can't remember the whole title of the paper, but it introduced this idea of how

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.560
 to do a distributed database. It was like a competitor to Spanner Google's, uh, a database.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.120
 It was like totally different domain, but it had this idea in it that was new to me. Um, and that

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:34.800
 idea I realized like, um, could be used to solve the conflict resolution problem that we had in

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.520
 norms. Um, like if we had that, we could add it to norms and then norms could have been used to

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:45.600
 build like something like zeros used for today, you know, or, you know, and that, that turned into

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:52.480
 replica. Um, so replica at a very high level of conceptually is basically norms plus this conflict

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:57.280
 resolution mechanism. Like internally, actually like replica has doesn't use the probably tree

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:02.160
 anymore, but when we started out it used to probably tree, um, it's this immutable B tree, um,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.840
 that allows you to like rewind it and fork and stuff like that efficiently. So like internally,

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.560
 replica is just forking. And that's what makes the conflict resolution part of what makes the

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.720
 conflict resolution mechanism work. And then the other part of it is like replaying functions on

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:19.200
 this fork and that replaying functions idea, that was the idea I got from Calvin. Uh, yeah. So we

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.680
 started building replica on top of norms, but like norms was written in go and that was completely

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:29.360
 impractical for web applications. Um, because like you can theoretically compile go into like

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:34.960
 Wasm or whatever, but the smallest binary is like five minutes of yeah. Yeah. So we rewrote it in

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:40.720
 JavaScript. Or do we agree? No, I think we wrote it, we wrote it in Rust first. I can't remember

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:46.960
 to take that. It's a little bit of Prisma's doing Prisma did that. And now they're going back to

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:54.720
 at the JavaScript. I was a nightmare. Um, so that yeah, anyways, um, we rewrote it. Um, and then a

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.080
 little bit later, we ripped out the probably trees because they weren't really, we have this

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:04.560
 simpler, immutable data structure internally now. And yeah, we built replica hash. Um, and it was like,

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.280
 you know, a lot more popular than anything we had done before. Like a my startup journey, like,

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:15.280
 it was okay. So people are using this, you know, value out of it, you know, and you know, I mean,

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:21.280
 it became like fairly popular, you know, like, um, I think like, I should have had the number,

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.160
 numbers ready, but I want to say like tens of thousands of like individual developers using it,

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:31.760
 like millions of end users, um, you have used replica hash, um, like without knowing, you know,

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:36.080
 as part of the applications that they're using. And you know, last, we built, we worked on that for

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:40.640
 like four years. Um, you know, it was like fairly successful, our biggest customers were sell. Um,

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:46.240
 so, and they're still using it. Um, and like even despite it being kind of like at odds with their,

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:51.360
 you know, marketing, like they, they get a lot better. It's, it's for their, uh, the, the common

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.840
 system on the previews. Is that what it powers? Yeah, that makes sense. You know, I feel a little

00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.080
 bit weird, like saying this, but like, you know, people often tell me that they, you know,

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.000
 that they consider replica hash like one of the leaders or like the leader in this like fledgling,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.760
 like sync industry. Um, and, uh, so like that's cool. And we, we could have like kept going with that,

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:17.760
 but like, you know, we, we just got this like continual, like complaints and like struggles

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:22.160
 with replica hash like from, from all of our users who were serious about it. Um,

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.440
 we, we, we received like the same sorts of problems and they were basically like,

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.200
 well, what do I do as my application gets more popular and there's more data in it?

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.640
 Like I, the replica hash is kind of assuming this model of syncing all the data to the client,

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.160
 and they're, what is ways in replica hash to sync less than all the data, but they're really hard

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.720
 to use. Um, and so like the best, the easiest way to use replica hash is to sync all the data.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:50.640
 Um, and what do I do if my data isn't like, if, if like there's complex granular permissions in

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.720
 my data, where like even syncing the right subset of data that users have permission to isn't even

00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:00.000
 like easy to, isn't even easy to do, you know, and we just kept hitting this problem. Um,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.080
 and, and along this time, like the local first movement was like gaining steam. And so a lot of

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:09.440
 people were like hearing about local first and like thinking, Oh, I could use this for my

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.680
 client server application to like make it fast. You know, they weren't really interested in like

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:18.000
 the, the like data ownership part. They were interested in like making my application fast part,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.320
 you know, and so local first started gaining steam and we were like, you know, at some point,

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:31.360
 we were just like, again, like this design of replica hash, it was like, we purposely,

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:36.080
 you know, we, we, we, we consciously tried to like narrow the problem. Like I, at the time,

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.320
 I wouldn't have described it as like, what can we get away with? But like really, you know,

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:45.200
 if I'm honest with myself, you know, that, that's it, you know, like, you know, just trying to like

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.400
 avoid the really hard problem, you know. Um, and so we like designed it in this way that was like,

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:55.680
 you know, like a smaller like subset, trying to lop off the majority of the problem, you know,

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:03.840
 which was like partial sync, you know, and permissions. And so it was zero. I think like

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:10.240
 around like a year and a half ago, you know, I, I started getting like really frustrated with

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.240
 receiving this question over and over again, and seeing like the local first movement grow and

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:18.160
 seeing like the energy and excitement about using these tools. And like, I also, there were other

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:22.080
 people in the space like who had interesting ideas, like this idea of replicating from postgres using

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:27.520
 the wall was like really cool idea. And I realized that we could put some of those ideas together

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:32.480
 and like really go after this problem and solve it. Um, and maybe do something like really general,

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:37.520
 you know, and bring this, like this experience, you know, at the end of the day, bring this kind of

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:42.560
 UI experience and this developer experience to like the vast majority of software, you know,

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.240
 like we could make something general purpose, like the way that rest APIs are general purpose,

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.880
 right? You know, yeah, and that was a really long story. So no, that was great. It's just,

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.600
 I didn't realize I didn't really put it together. How long you've really technically been thinking

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.840
 about this. Um, in my head, I was just like, Oh, Aaron's like the browser guy, like he likes to do

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:05.520
 stuff with a browser features, but it's actually way more specific than that. I think what's also

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:10.480
 really interesting. And like, I love making this point. You were like, yeah, I'm a UI engineer. I

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:17.120
 wanted to make UI faster. And you ended up having to dig into like distributed systems, like the

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:23.120
 way, like data stored in like little files, like, you know, all that stuff to make the UI faster.

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:28.160
 And people nowadays, it's so easy to just to carve out this. I'm a front-end engineer

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.440
 identity. But like, yeah, you're you're effectively a front-end engineer to this whole thing. But

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.400
 you have to do so many different things that, you know, technically don't fall under that bubble.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.720
 So I think it's cool to like, would I see that in action over over years?

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.160
 Yeah, I mean, there's I mean, there's it's it's actually a really common story in the sync and

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:51.600
 local first base. Like the I would say the majority of people who I really respect in the space

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.760
 are doing really interesting work. Sort of come from this background of like, you know,

00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.800
 being people who work with the pixels, you know, and like, this is so frustrating. Like,

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.800
 why can't he be faster? You know, and then they hear about, you know, they hear about

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.240
 sync or they hear about local first, and they start looking into it and they get really inspired

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.640
 and they become distributed systems engineers. Like solve this problem.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:18.560
 Yeah, it's funny because I had the I had the opposite experience, which leaves me in a funny

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:24.800
 place. So I'll explain what that is. So I did a bunch of the systems systems work and in that

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.880
 I ended up building something that did this kind of similar to solving this problem.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.600
 It wasn't for web. It was for native. So we would we had data model in our system,

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:39.200
 any mutations to we get sink to iOS and Android, Android apps, and it kind of was very productive

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:44.880
 for our team. Didn't handle a lot of the things well. But I was kind of my first introduction to

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:51.440
 that idea. And then I wanted to keep using that pattern just to speed. I mean, it's funny because

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:55.360
 we did we talk about this stuff like it's new, but native engineers are kind of more used to

00:36:55.360 --> 00:37:00.320
 this pattern of like keeping the data locally. Probably mostly because they have to deal with

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:05.200
 offline a little bit more. But like you're used to native apps, like keeping your data around and

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:11.040
 like being able to access it right away. But I shifted back into web and then I wanted to keep

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:17.280
 using it. So I started to explore. All right, how do I possibly achieve this? But like everything

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:23.360
 that's out there. And I went on this like really crazy journey from discovering orbit, which I

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:29.200
 probably come across, which is like a front end tool. And if you're back in as a JSON API,

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.720
 it does some like kind of smart caching with the objects and kind of understand your schema.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:37.360
 Try to use that got to a certain place, hit a wall. Then I was like, okay, let me

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:42.000
 somewhere around this time I did come across replica cache and I remember going to the website

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:49.280
 and I was like, no, I deal with this is I don't get it. And I moved on. I moved on to try to make

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:54.160
 GraphQL do what I needed to do. I ended up using Herkola bunch that also had some like caching

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:59.360
 functionality, a little wall. Yeah, it'll walk with that. Then I was like, let me go look at the

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:03.440
 rebel cache thing again. I was like, Oh, wait, this is what I'm looking for. I ended up using

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.120
 rebel cache. And then now I'm using zero as a with rebel cache, you know, I hit the same walls

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.440
 where like the windowing I didn't put myself and like some of the permission stuff from the error

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:17.520
 stuff. So again, it really focused on solving those problems. And now we have zero. And I'm like,

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:22.960
 okay, all the problems I've been looking for for the past four years are now solved,

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:30.400
 which means the remaining problems for me are, hey, like making sure like the hover animation

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:36.480
 like looks right, which is just not where I came from. I finally achieved what I want to achieve,

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:43.680
 but then I'm bottlenecked by like my, my like just front end detail stuff. So it's down to just

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:47.760
 CSS now. That's like my, that's what's limiting me to get to where I want.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:54.960
 Yeah, we joke about that. Like sometimes we see bugs, you know, as part of building zero early

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:59.280
 on, we decided that we should have a dog food app that we are building, like that's driving the

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:04.800
 development of zero. For like a lot of reasons, like one of the one of the reasons is just like,

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:11.120
 it seemed like poetic to me, like, like I liked, I liked the elegance of it like that, like

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:15.920
 all of these like local first and sync tools, they all make a linear demo, because like linear is

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:21.280
 this famous app that uses that has this really great UX. And we made a linear demo with replica

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:26.800
 cache, right? But it's a demo, like we knew when we built it that it was a demo. And like with that

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:32.000
 word demo, there's like so much loaded, you know, there's always, when you, when if you're a developer

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.240
 and you see a demo of something, you should just take that to imply there is like some drag and

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:45.840
 hidden in this, like, you don't know which ones you don't get to know which ones they are, you know?

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.520
 But you know, but there's some dragons that like the developer skipped over because it's a demo,

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:55.200
 like, and for us, like, you know, with replica cache, you know, like some of those dragons were

00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:00.160
 like fine green permission and partial sync. And like, you know, much other ones like, like,

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:06.960
 like deployment, you know, and so we wanted to like make sure with zero that we were not skipping

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.640
 over the hard problems that we were not making that same mistake, I wanted to make sure that we

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.280
 weren't making that mistake again. And like, that we were really building something that you could

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:20.480
 use to build real software. So like, the best way to do that is to like build something real,

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.160
 you know? And then the other thing was like, we knew that zero was going to be open source.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:29.360
 And so we needed a bug tracker. And that meant, like, bar only option with basically GitHub,

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.880
 you know, or get lab, you know? And like, I just cannot deal with the fact that like, here we are

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:39.920
 trying to build like a sync engine for building things like linear. And we're using like, GitHub,

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:48.400
 this just is awful. You know, like, I literally sync my GitHub issues into linear and just use

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:53.760
 linear as a front end for GitHub. That's how it's how bad it is. We kind of considered something

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.480
 like that. But no, having your own thing makes total sense for the dog fitting.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:02.160
 It's an open source project, right? So there has to be like a public public. Yeah. Yeah. And

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.240
 people need to be all file bugs. And you know, and that's kind of interesting too, because like,

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:12.000
 like linear, I don't I don't know, I don't know if linear linear doesn't support

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.480
 fine-grained permissions within a repo. So you can't create to my knowledge. Sorry if I'm wrong

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.440
 linear folks. I've looked at this like multiple times to my knowledge in linear.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:24.720
 You can't really get private issues now. Yeah. Like, yeah, like, and so, and also,

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.120
 there's no such thing as public issues. Like you can't create an issue that's world readable.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.720
 And I assume this has to do with like design of the sync engine. I don't, I don't know if that's

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:41.040
 true. But, uh, but like we, we really needed this for Z bugs, right? Because like, it's an open

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.880
 source project. You need to be able to see the, see the bugs publicly, comment on them, right?

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:48.880
 And because the bugs need to be visible publicly, that means they need to boot up fast. You know,

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.400
 like you can't wait 10 minute or, you know, five minutes for the thing to sync. You know,

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.560
 that means you need partial sync. You know, so it's just really interesting to like build a real

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.640
 app, because it brings up these questions that real users have. Like when, when we were using

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.400
 rep, when we were doing replica, people would always ask us like, well, what do I do if I have like

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.280
 a public page that people need to visit without being logged in? And we're like, well, you can like,

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.120
 you know, you know, but if we're building it for ourselves, right, we're not going to do any,

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:18.160
 we're not going to do any of those weird hacks that, that we were maybe suggesting that people do,

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.000
 you know, like we were going to be like, no, let's just like fix the infrastructure to work the right

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.920
 way, you know, so that we can do this. Yeah, it's funny just having worked in, you know,

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.160
 building stuff for developers. I've had this experience so many times where someone mentions

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:37.440
 a problem to me and I'm just like, oh yeah, it's annoying. But then I don't think that much of it

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.520
 that I run into it. And all of a sudden, it's like the number one priority and we got to fix right

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.320
 away. So it's just, yeah, like it's like, that's just a reality of it. Like until you hit it,

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.600
 you don't really understand how important it is to fix.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:53.600
 I guess, I guess like, you know, part of it is like we just develop, you know, all of us just

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:58.800
 develop a skill for focus, right? So it's like, you know, there's lots of things that you can work

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:03.280
 on. There's lots of problems, right? And you naturally develop an ability to like focus on the one

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.120
 that you're working on, you know, yeah, that's how you need some mechanism. Because like, there's

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.280
 always a thousand tasks and you just need some mechanism that orders it for you and having your

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:16.560
 own product is a very good way to do that. Because you know, at least you're not making up like

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:21.760
 working on fake stuff, which as stupid as that sounds, like that's like the biggest challenge.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.840
 Like you end up spending a lot of time working on fake made up stuff and having your own thing

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:32.720
 kind of really focuses you the posting demos thing. It's it's funny because I I've always felt this

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:37.520
 way where I'm like, if I'm going to post a demo showing something off, like it needs to be a thing

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:42.320
 that's in production and an idea like even even making money. So I can be like, this is like not

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:48.960
 just me messing around. And I remember once I posted a demo of our search, and it was

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.880
 powered by Replicash, and it was searching through like 50,000 patients. And it was all

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.640
 instant. And I was, of course, in my usual tone, I was very annoying about it and made fun of

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:01.040
 everyone for their stuff not being this good. And so many people got really pissed off and they

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.680
 started making these demos of being like, this is not even hard. Look what I can do. And every single

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:11.200
 one was just someone wiring an on key down to like a query to a server that hits Postgres and

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:18.480
 like round trips. And yeah, like when you just do that on a demo, when everything's running locally,

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.760
 and you can guarantee that the end user is like not too far away from your back,

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.320
 like all those different variables. Of course, you're going to cheat that.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.000
 These are videos of Postgres running locally.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.760
 Yeah, yeah, it was all as all local hosts. Well, what first people accuse my video of being all

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:33.680
 local hosts, which is a great compliment. I get this all the time when I write show off local

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.440
 first stuff. They're like, Oh, yeah, like now I've tried deploying the production and I'm like,

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:43.680
 bitch, check the URL. That's not say local or first. Post local hosts. Yeah. But yeah, a lot of

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.240
 people were just posting these like stupid local hosts one. Some people did ones that were actually

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:53.520
 deployed. But again, like under perfect conditions, very hard to make something that looks similar,

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:58.880
 but an actual app with real world constraints, like we had all sorts of weird problems of like,

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.880
 okay, this, this business have 50,000 patients to look through. You can't sync the whole patient

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.480
 because that's way too much data. You have to sync like a partial of it. And then when they click

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.600
 into it, you have to load the full thing in and then keep track of which patients are interested.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.840
 Like all those just things that come up when you build and polish a real world thing.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:21.360
 So I really like, I really try to post stuff that's real world and I expect people to recognize

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.360
 the difference that people often don't. They just think it's like the same as any other demo.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:29.360
 Yeah. Well, this, this, this goes to like something that also you and I talked about, you know,

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:34.320
 in, in DM about like marketing, you know, it's, it's, this is another thing that I've learned a lot

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:41.120
 about like over my, my startup journey quest. Like, um, I mean, it's not really people's fault that

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:46.080
 they don't see the like, you know, the, the URL is production or they don't like imply that like,

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.520
 oh, this means it's real or whatever, that they don't get the message that you're sending them. I

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:54.880
 mean, you know, I mean, people receive like thousands of messages every day, right, trying to convince

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.440
 them of something, you know, and, and like, you know, and they, and they are looking at it with

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:04.400
 like 10% of their brain, you know, like, it's, it's just really hard to like get a message through,

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:09.120
 you know, it's not really anyone's fault, you know, like, it's, it's just the way the, way the world

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:13.840
 is, you know, like, so, so like, you know, a big part of marketing, I like realize there's like

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:18.160
 something actually, you know, I grew up as like a skater and like, you know, in, in Southern

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:22.560
 California. So I grew up like very like anti marketing, you know, like, and I realized there's

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:26.560
 actually something kind of like, it's actually kind of a craft to it that it's really interesting,

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.880
 you know, of like, if you have a product that's good, and you know that it's good, and you know,

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:35.120
 that it can help people, you know, marketing is just like finding a way to get them to know that,

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:40.480
 you know, like finding a way to do that, you know, like, and there's a lot of interesting craft to

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:44.800
 that, you know, yeah, so I mean, it's like, if they don't receive your message, like, it's not,

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.480
 it's not like something has gone wrong. That's like the expected case, you know.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:54.240
 Yeah, yeah, no, it's true. And to be fair, like, it's always a vocal minority, like that post had

00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:00.160
 a crazy amount of likes on it. And then maybe like, you know, one or two dozen people that replied

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:05.680
 in a way that I found annoying. But it's always like it always ends up working that way.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:10.320
 Yeah, the whole marketing thing is super interesting, too. Like, I'm similar in that

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:16.880
 I just had this, you know, in hindsight, naive view of things of being like,

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:22.160
 well, if the product is good enough, the marketing doesn't matter, then you go to do

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:26.080
 something real and your numbers are flat. And you're like, shit, they're all my deals.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:31.760
 Totally tested by reality. And it turns out like I'm just wrong. So again, my brain just

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:36.400
 looked on that as well. And I was like, I just need to do this marketing thing, because it's not

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:42.160
 this negative thing that's tricking people into something. It's like this totally other thing that

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:47.920
 the reality is you just can't, you just can't operate without. It's been fun and getting into

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.480
 all that stuff. But I think there is like a sort of like a subtle twist on it, which is like,

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:57.920
 if the product is good enough, then the marketing will work. Yeah, it's the market will work. Yeah.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:02.320
 You know, and you know, you have the opportunity to do, at least I like, you know, you have the

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.560
 opportunity to do like really interesting, like creative working, you know, because you're like

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:10.640
 sort of riding on top of this like foundation of a good product. Yeah, you know, yeah, it's funny,

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.520
 because people come to me a lot being like, Oh, can you give me like marketing advice for this thing?

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:22.080
 And the thing that I always have trouble telling them is like, I don't like your product. Like,

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:27.120
 I don't think it's good. So like, I can't really come up with that. DAX, you have a hard time

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:33.120
 telling somebody that their stuff is bad. That's hard for you to your face directly. When they're

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:37.840
 coming to me with such hope in their eyes, like, yeah, you know, it's just like, if I don't like

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:42.640
 the product, I just can't the creative part of my brain isn't isn't activated, you know, it has to

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.960
 align properly. And that, yeah, it just won't work. You can copy paste what someone else did that

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:52.320
 worked. And if your product isn't getting, it's just not, yeah, it's not gonna work. Those are

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.920
 good. It's not it's not two things. But then a day, product and marketing, it's all just one thing.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:01.600
 Like you pick the products that work well, that can be marketed well, your marketing message can

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.640
 work well. That's like, that's like, that reminds me of this, like other coa, this other sort of like,

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:12.640
 phrase that I keep in my head, like, is that like, with, with marketing, like,

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.080
 novelty is like, is like half the battle, you know, like, you know,

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:24.720
 again, it's like, you have to like, you have to get through to people, you know, so like, you

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:29.920
 know, actually copying what somebody else has done is like the opposite of like what you should do

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.440
 for marketing, which is like, which is like a little bit counterintuitive, like you, like,

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.680
 people get really good at noticing patterns. And what they're, I think what they're really tuning

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:42.720
 into is like noticing low effort, you know, which goes back to what we were, what we were talking

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:46.080
 about, right? Like, as humans, we're like, we were like bombarded with messages all the time,

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:50.000
 right? We're trying to filter them out and we develop patterns for like, which messages are

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.160
 likely to be useful. And like, one of those heuristics is like, the effort that went into sending the

00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:00.960
 message, you know, yeah, you know, and if, and if the message is just like a copy of something

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.640
 that's been done over and over again, that's like, that's like a really easy, like, detect pattern

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:08.480
 that is low effort, right? We can probably all, if we just didn't think about it, we can actually

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:13.520
 probably all observe the observes within ourselves. Because I've been around long enough where I've

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:18.800
 seen things that the first time I looked at it, it looked incredible. And then very quickly, I started

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:24.080
 looking at it and literally looked ugly at me. So more recent example is AI generated images.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:29.680
 There was a time where we were like, wow, this is insane. And now it's been like maybe like a

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.760
 year of us seeing it. We like can instantly tell it's AI generated and our brains just think it's

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.880
 ugly. But there's like no objective truth to like what looks good or what doesn't. It's just like

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.320
 whether you've seen it enough times already, which is like kind of mind blowing, saying like

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.320
 monochrome websites, you know, like,

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:52.240
 Yeah, well, my first thought was actually the linear website where I'm like, when I first saw

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:56.880
 that I was like, wow, it's good. And now when I see one of those things, it's like a insane

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:02.480
 negative reaction I get. And sometimes it's not even low effort. It's, there was a recent case

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:06.400
 where I think they even posted they spent like $100,000 on his landing page and like looked so like

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:12.640
 that crazy like nightclub flashy glossy reflective thing going on everywhere, but just looked like

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:18.560
 a variation of linear and it looked bad to my eyes. You know, it can be it can cost money in

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.400
 silly low effort, you know, like that's true. There's hard someone to copy the thing. Yeah,

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.800
 I've just been listening to you guys. And I just want like the people who can nerd out about this

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.720
 stuff to like enjoy the content. But I have so many like super dumb questions and it might be

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:38.400
 helpful for the people like me. Yeah, so I am a front end engineer who did not go further in life

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:42.720
 and did I didn't live up to my potential? I don't know what a B tree is. I can start there. What is

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:47.280
 a B tree? But that's probably not very interesting. I want to know like zero. What part of because

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:53.280
 I'm not, I'm not using it. Dax is so plugged into this stuff. What part of my stack? Like, it's a

00:51:53.280 --> 00:52:01.200
 library. I I install into my front end application. Yeah, and it replaces my API. It replaces my

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:09.520
 database. What how does it all fit? Yeah, yeah, it's zero and in in more general all sync engines.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:14.320
 They they take over the network communication between the client and the server. You know,

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.000
 so like 100% of people who are built who are listening to this are building a client server

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:25.760
 web app, right? You got code on the client, which is, you know, you got code on the server, right?

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:32.320
 And the data is on the server and the UI is on the client and you need some way for them to talk

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:37.760
 to each other. And the sort of classic way to do this all the way back to the 90s is like the

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:44.960
 three tier architecture, right? With like APIs, HTTP APIs that connected, right? And we've gone

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:50.080
 through a few variations of HTTP APIs that are like, I don't know, if you're really old like me,

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:57.120
 you've got like soap. Oh, yeah. Wow. I like soap. I liked it because they integrated nicely into

00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:01.680
 Visual Studio and you could just like click it and see everything. I've never heard anyone say

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:09.680
 they like soap. So I've never heard that. Like as we speak. Things are like,

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:22.160
 that's like soap. And he likes zero. That's a bad sign. So then, you know, we had a show was the

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:27.680
 one there was a short lived one after that. And then, and then, you know, we had rest, which,

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:33.600
 which lasted a really long time and still going strong. And we also had like GraphQL, right,

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.840
 which was another variation on this idea. I don't know. I guess you could say like TRPC is like

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:41.760
 another version, right? There's a lot of smaller ones, right? But they're all sort of like based on

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:47.200
 this idea at the bottom of like HTTP APIs, you know, so the client makes a, at the end of the day,

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:53.360
 makes a fetch request and sends some data, the server and get the response, right? And sort of

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:58.080
 the fundamental problem is like, you know, if you want the UI to do something, the user presses

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.520
 something and in order to do that, it needs data from the server, it has to wait for that request to

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:06.240
 go to the server and send the data back. And like sort of at a minimum, you're bounded by speed of

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:10.640
 light, which is kind of cool. We're like, you know, we're building things where we, we'd care

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:16.480
 about the speed of light, you know, but like, you know, for a lot of practical reasons, databases

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:21.600
 usually have to be centralized. There's a lot of people that are, have been hopeful about like

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:25.200
 distributing databases, but there's really hard technical problems to distributing databases.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.240
 And there's also really hard like political problems to distributing databases.

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:32.880
 And so for a lot of reasons, databases just end up often being centralized,

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:36.720
 usually, usually they're centralized. So that just means like by definition,

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:41.280
 there's going to be people, the majority of people on earth are going to be far from your database.

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:45.840
 And the speed of their UI is going to be limited by the speed of light. But that's just the beginning,

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:50.880
 like if really, if really we were limited by speed of light, like that'd be great, you know, like,

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:57.520
 like the distance, like I think the maximum distance from like any two points, like on earth's round

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:02.000
 trip is maybe a 300 milliseconds or 400 milliseconds or something like that, you know, it's not great.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.560
 It's not great. It's not instant. But you know, that would be fantastic if like our UIs

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:12.400
 were maximally 400 milliseconds, like that is not what we experienced. You know,

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:18.000
 what we experienced is UIs that are like two seconds late, you know, and like, why is that?

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.240
 It's because like the database, the application server when it finally receives this request

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:27.840
 is doing a bunch of work. And that work takes time. It's because often the UI is doing many requests

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:32.720
 to get data, right? It's not doing one, you know, it's like you click on something in the UI and

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:39.840
 then like 10 requests happen, you know, one after the next. And so like, in order to make this better,

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:45.440
 in order to make these UI better, like we like it's kind of funny, but we have to get the data

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:50.800
 to the client before the user needs it, you know, and that's that's what sync is about. That's

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:57.120
 what sync is there about is there about continually pushing data from the server to the client ahead

00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:01.520
 of time, so that the data is there on the client when the client needs it and it can just read it

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:06.240
 locally from SSD, which is instant. And so this is all very long. We have answering your question,

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:12.880
 which is it takes over a GraphQL and rest. And so we have a library in your client that you talk

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:17.440
 to directly that provides an interface that looks like a database. You've got queries, you know,

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:22.080
 you can do full arbitrary queries with like, you know, joins and sub selects and filters and

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:29.280
 soon, someday aggregations and, you know, everything. But that database is like an illusion. There is

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:35.600
 data locally, but like, it's continually being updated by the server who's pushing data to the

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:40.000
 client so that it's there when you need it. And so you have like a package that you also run

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.440
 and install on your server, presumably to run like a zero server or not. What I what I'm super into

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:51.040
 about zero is to me, it almost feels like something in the same level as Redis, where like, everyone

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:55.520
 knows that they have a database and an application server front end. And like, maybe they add in

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:59.760
 Redis to like provide caching in front of the database when, you know, there's too much load.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:05.200
 This is kind of like zero to standalone server. That's kind of like Redis and that it's like a

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:11.600
 cache for your database, but it's entirely optimized for the client to be front ends. So you can deploy

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:16.480
 these servers around your database. And what I'm really excited by is even in other regions,

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:22.320
 right? So you can have your main database and uss one, and you can have a zero replica in uss

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:27.200
 to just serving the users there. It's like taking over the responsibility of a read replica, but it's

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:33.840
 a read replica optimized for the sync engine, engine purpose. So I can see how this just becomes a

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:41.040
 default thing that everyone just deploys around their database. Yeah, so you have the client,

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:46.160
 you have this server that we call zero cache that is basically a read replica, like a very fancy

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:54.160
 read replica of your database. Yeah. And like a read replica, it replicates your data into like

00:57:54.160 --> 00:58:00.320
 its own storage, right? But unlike a read replica, like Redis is a cache, right? There's like a

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:03.760
 difference between a cache and a replica. The words are used interchangeably, but they're not the same

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:09.760
 thing. Like, yeah, you know, like a replica has like a correct snapshot of the database, you know,

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:14.480
 at any point in time, cache just has some random subset of it that's been request, right? So

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:20.080
 it's a zero cache is a replica, it sits in front of your database, but it also sorry, any kind of

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:25.920
 database or like you guys support certain databases currently only postgres, but the way that zero

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:31.120
 cache has been it has been designed, it can work with other databases. And like, in fact, we have

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:35.520
 like an experimental version of Mongo up and running, right? It just requires any database

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:41.520
 with change stream. So I can consume updates in real time and say up to date, yeah, which like most

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:46.160
 databases have something like this for read replicas, you know, because they, they know, right? You

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:52.960
 have a zero cache and the zero cache also replicates data to the client. So you, so you've got your

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:57.680
 primary database, you've got zero cache, which is a replica in the server. And then, and then you

00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:02.000
 have a subset of that data that gets pushed to the client and actually replicated to the client,

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.560
 so that you have a consistent snapshot on the client. And then you read against that, that partial

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:11.200
 subset that you have on the client, you render instantly. And since you're continuously replicating

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:15.840
 to the client, whenever any data changes on the server for any reason, it gets pushed to the client

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:20.080
 and the client reactively updates. You get, you get like real time out of it for free.

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:25.680
 And you get instant UI. And then as like a little flourish on top, we also allow mutability to the

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:31.840
 local data. So you can change the, we have an API where you can change the local data. And those

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:37.360
 changes get pushed to the server. And they use replicashes conflict resolution that we talked

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:43.440
 about earlier, to resolve conflicts. The end result is like you can, you have an API that looks like

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:47.840
 a database on the client, and you can do arbitrary queries to it. And those queries are usually

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:52.960
 instantaneous. We'll get back to the usually, maybe in a second. But like the vast majority of the

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:57.840
 time, those queries are instantaneous. The queries update reactively, when data on the change of

00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.160
 service. And you can change the data locally. All the queries that are open on the client, they

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:07.600
 update automatically, when you instantly, when you change, like that's like a react query kind of

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:13.920
 feeling kind of experience. Does that make sense? Like if you, it's like invalidating the local data

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:20.160
 whenever you change it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And to use the same thing, except you get to just give

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:24.960
 it normal queries, you're like, yeah, you're just interacting with the data, but it's from users where

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:30.560
 time created is within the last week. And that's just a view. And any changes that gets updated,

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.760
 any mutations that would have affected that query, updated it optimistically. It makes your

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:41.680
 front end so stupid. Like, yeah, sounds amazing. The front end side of it just like, it's so dumb.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.640
 It's like you barely need a framework at this point. Also, you don't, you don't need the

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.320
 use optimistic. Like you don't need it. You don't need to write like an optimistic version.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.800
 Everything is optimistic by the, I mean, it's just the nature. Because it understands the exact

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:57.600
 thing that's being mutated. Yeah. Does that answer your question about like, no, it does. It sounds,

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:05.680
 no, it sounds very nice. So that, that zero cache, the server part, you can put those anywhere. And

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.560
 they're sort of like mitigating the issue of the distance between your users and your database,

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.480
 because they're constantly being updated from the database. So even if you don't do that,

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.720
 it's probably fine. Like right now we just have a really matter because you send the data to the

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:22.960
 client ahead of time. Yeah. But if you really want to push things and you want to say like, you know,

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:27.760
 I want it to be even faster across the world. Like, yeah, you can have zero cache applied. The

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:33.520
 same logic you would put a read replica in another region. I think for me now, I'm just like, yeah,

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.360
 my issue with replicas is like, they're still very annoying to deal with. Like you can do a

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:42.160
 read replica of Postgres, but then like now you need an API server there, right? So you'll have to go

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:46.400
 to like the primary date, like all that stuff is just a lot. Whereas with this,

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.560
 I really, that's not the thing I really care about. I mean, I'm, I'm like getting into stuff.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.720
 Like what I do care about, I guess, questions I would have is like, well, the first one would be

01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:01.680
 if you have a lot of data. And I think you said you can partially send down data so you can choose

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.560
 for like given pages, I guess, or routes, you can choose to like only send certain data down. Is that

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:12.880
 the idea? Oh, this is the part that I'm like, I love the most. I mean, so it's query based, you

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:18.160
 know, at the end of the day, you have a query API on the client. You do you do a query. And so

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.880
 the data that backs that query is what gets synced to the client. Like we take that query

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:29.520
 and we send it to the server. And the data that's needed to answer that query is the data that gets

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.600
 synced to the client. And then you do another query and that data gets synced to the client.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.960
 And that's just how it works. Like all the queries that you have open are the data that's getting

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.960
 synced. So you control what data gets synced by what queries you make, you know, you're in complete

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:48.240
 control and you have the full power of a query language to to do that, you know, we say, we say

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:53.760
 a query language. Is it SQL? It looks SQL-esque. Yeah, it looks. Yeah. Yeah. And it's on the front

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.960
 end. This is all the front end that you're writing these. It's inspired. The design is

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.600
 inspired by Kaisley, if you're familiar with that. Oh, yeah, sure. The thing that's really cool is

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.400
 a way this actually maps down on like component based frameworks, because like a component based

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.880
 framework is you just have like nested things, right? Like when you land on a page, the outer most

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:16.320
 component loads. So any queries you put there will get loaded right away. But then when you click

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.480
 into stuff, like the inside changes, right? So let's say you land on the page, you have like

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.400
 a header with like the user info. So of course, the user info is going to be synced right away.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:29.040
 But then if you navigate to a deeper component, there might be queries in that component, right?

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:34.480
 That won't sync right away. But once you navigate in there, then it'll start syncing. So it like

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:40.480
 very elegantly maps back to you don't sync stuff until the users show an interest in it.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.640
 Yeah, because unless they clicked in there, like that query would not have loaded and when I started

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.680
 being tracked. And the reason we switched, so we didn't plan on switching that as the console over

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:55.760
 to zero, because we haven't working on Replicash, it's fine. But then we had a situation, a feature

01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:00.560
 where we wanted to show you the diffs of every single SC deploy has ever happened.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:08.160
 Stinking all of that at a time is way too much data. But if it's naturally with let's just wait

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:14.000
 till you go into a specific deploy to look at it to then sync it. And that's kind of what forced our

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:17.920
 transition of moving to zero, because implementing all that on top Replicash manually, it would

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.280
 just been a subpar equivalent to what zero can can already do. So now we're like really excited

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.920
 to move everything over is now that part of our app is like really nice and the rest of it now

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:34.000
 looks forced by comparison. Well, I'm gonna dig in my my main job, like my primary day job,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.680
 we use Postgres. So I could actually start poking around. Yeah, I mean, it's kind of interesting

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:44.640
 for you, because I don't, I don't like immediately know if there's like a good use case. Yeah, this

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:49.920
 time use use case is like very like antithetical to local first, I feel like. But then I think about

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:54.800
 like, you just it's when you talk about it, actually, you should do both things. Like, I feel like

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.880
 you should probably still use it for any of the interactivity stuff. There's just like,

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:04.960
 our experience is slow, and it could be fast. So it's kind of like, you got to figure out how

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:08.960
 to do both things, we have to serve a million clicks from Google every day. But we also need to figure

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:12.960
 out how to make the people who stick around and use our app a lot, make it fast. Like we kind of

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:16.960
 just have to do both, I feel like. Yeah, there's no there's no downside. There's no downside with

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:22.240
 having a page. It's entirely public powered by zero. Like there's a so work. That's what's nice

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:27.360
 about this moment. Well, there could be like cost downsides for like, for like, I don't know, I

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:32.720
 don't know what your day job is, Adam, actually. But like, you know, the the server is like more

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:38.320
 expensive to run than like, you know, I don't know, like the normal web server. Yeah, if you go look

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:42.720
 at if you go look at his Aurora bill, you're going to be like, nevermind. Because whatever they're

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:48.320
 paying for Aurora is. And I'm not too worried about the compute, I guess. So Adam's a founder of

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:54.000
 stat news, which if you're not familiar with, it's like the sports statistics. Source for like all

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.120
 sports or not all sports, but like most of the sports. And they get like a crazy amount of traffic.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:03.840
 And it's mostly public, mostly public traffic, but they also have like power users that are.

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.920
 Yeah, mostly like search engine. Yeah, that are like logged in and doing more intense stuff.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:12.480
 I mean, I'd like to like dig into it. I mean, the sort of like been trying to think about how to

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.320
 talk about this. I actually need to do a blog post about this or something like that. Yeah,

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:20.960
 we launched zero alpha right at the right before Christmas. So now it's been just about two months

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:24.960
 that has been public. And so we've got a lot, a lot of interesting feedback. People are already

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:31.600
 starting to use an introduction. Thanks, Dax. And I think like, you know, we, we decided, you know,

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:35.680
 as we talked about a little bit ago to take on this really hard problem, you know, like some of the

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:41.200
 stuff we're doing is like, you know, like kind of like leading edge, like software engineering, you know,

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:52.880
 and features. And you know, we're, it's like, we didn't talk about this at all, but like,

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:56.800
 what makes zero possible is this new career engine that we wrote. We wrote our own career engine from

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:02.240
 scratch. Like, like, so it's the API is kind of like inspired, but it doesn't bottom out at

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:07.920
 SQL. Like, we have our own career engine. And we had to do that in order to make this work in

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:12.320
 order to make this efficient. This is why we didn't do this way back with rebel cash. And this is

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:18.000
 all built on this like theory of databases called IBM incremental view maintenance, which is like

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.440
 pretty bleeding edge stuff. So this is all to say, like, we're going after like, this really big

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:28.640
 problem here. You know, I think, I think what bun is doing is, is, is really inspiring too.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:33.360
 I would kind of put us in that, in that category of people who are tackling a really hard problem.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:38.800
 And it's going to be a lot of work. And like, initially, like today, you know, like zero is a

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.200
 good choice if you are willing to run your own servers, if you're willing to run Dockerized,

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:49.360
 like servers in AWS, and you have like, you know, enough skill and energy and need to like deal

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:54.640
 with all the configuration crap of like running AWS, or if you want to use SST. And you know,

01:07:54.640 --> 01:08:00.560
 it's fairly expensive to run. I have to like put together like estimates of like, what the

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:05.040
 minimal like deployment looks like, you know, and there's, you know, there's sharp edges, both in API,

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:11.440
 in bugs, in like costs, all kinds of stuff. That's the reality. But like the value, I think, you know,

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:17.280
 it's already valuable for, for like a surprising amount of applications, you know, it's already

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:22.000
 like a really useful tool for all kinds of products like we have, you know, we probably got like a

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:28.000
 dozen people running in production now. And like, we get feedback all the time about like how like

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.040
 amazing the experiences and like people who are excited about the vision. So I have to find a

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.600
 way to like talk about the vision of where we're going, you know, and the reality of like where

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.680
 we are right now. So people can like understand like whether it's the right time for them to jump

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:47.360
 in in or not, you know, yeah, sure. Yeah, I mean, I think just seeing how much work it is is also

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:51.280
 kind of interesting. That kind of communicates a value like, I mean, even just stuff that I'm aware

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:56.640
 of, which is just like to it's like a subset of all your problems. It's the ones that I've run into.

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:02.400
 But yeah, like eventually, like, you know, this cache needs to be sharded. Yeah, the the the

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:06.960
 sharding plus like, you know, this idea of can each zero cache only replicate as upset that data

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:11.600
 was it looked like when there's like terabytes of data in your database. I'm also very surprised.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:18.000
 I think I just am not going to be be surprised by this. But like you said, like right now, it's

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.560
 the bar of being able to actually use it is definitely higher than where it will be.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:28.160
 I'm shocked how many people still do it anyway. Like I'm surprised by how many people I see in

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:32.880
 there, like figuring out all this container stuff and like, you know, actually feel like this is

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:39.120
 worth my time to, you know, figure all this stuff out, even how bleeding edge it is. Like, I I'm like

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.920
 working on deployment stuff. So I'd like spend all my time with this stuff. And even then I'm like

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:49.600
 running into stuff I don't know. Yeah, it's like, it's like incredible how people already

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:53.040
 want to do that. You know, I have this problem as like the creator of the thing, right? Whenever

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:58.000
 anybody hits like a problem, I'm like deeply embarrassed, you know, like, Oh my God, I can't believe,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.720
 you know, this is, we have this public this way, you know, like, like, and, and, but then I come back

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.400
 to like, we built like a bug tracker, you know, like we built, we built a linear with this thing.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.880
 That's true. Yeah, kind of like all every last feature that linear has, but it is a good,

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.520
 it is a good, you know, partial subset of the features of linear. And in particular,

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:24.720
 like the core feature of linear, its performance, you know, yeah. And, and not only that, it has

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.720
 some features that linear doesn't have, it has public bugs, it has fine grained permissions,

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:35.280
 it loads fast, you know, when you enter a detailed page. And yet, you know, Z bugs, Z bugs has like

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.360
 a thousand bucks and like a total of like maybe 15,000 comments, you know, so it's not like the

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:45.360
 world's most massive, like bug tracker, you know, but that is the shape, the rough shape of a lot

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:50.800
 of real applications, you know, like, and, and so I think, you know, what you're seeing, the reason

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.160
 why there's a lot of people in there fighting to figure this stuff out and, and, and in early

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:58.320
 is because when you step back and you think about that, like, wow, you know, like, you can build,

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.960
 like, you know, a subset of linear with like a few people in, in like, few months with this

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:07.440
 technology, you know, that's like a pretty, you know, like, that's a really hard thing to build,

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:12.880
 otherwise, a really hard thing. And, you know, in a lot of, a lot of people want to build something

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:18.160
 like that, you know, like that, that describes like a wide variety of SaaS applications, you know,

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.960
 and so if you look at that and you say, wow, this is already able to do this, and these guys worked

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:27.600
 on Replicash before, and they're in it for the long term, and this is going to keep getting better

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.440
 and better, you know, like, for a lot of, for a lot of companies that are starting something new,

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.000
 that is roughly like a SaaS shaped thing that needs to be fast, you know, it looks like a good

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.080
 time to get it. I generally don't have much motivation to convince people to use a certain

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.920
 technology, because yeah, it's just what does it matter to me? But the thing with this category is

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:52.160
 I just want as a user to have better software that I could use. So I'm like obsessed with getting

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.000
 more people into this, because they're going to build stuff that I can use and really enjoy. It's

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.520
 like, once you've used enough of these things, you just start hating, like, the thing you were

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:04.560
 saying about GitHub issues, like it feels 10 times more painful when you're aware of what it could

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:10.240
 be like. So I'm really looking forward to even just this cohort of applications, like graduating

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:14.240
 and becoming real products, and like the more that get added on over the next couple of years,

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:19.840
 I just feel like there's going to be a generation of products who just feel finally so good on the

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:24.560
 web. Like, we've been chasing the native feeling for so long, and it feels like I can see that

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:32.080
 happening within view. Yeah, yeah, I mean, wouldn't wouldn't one of my co-founders that added it and

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:37.360
 Rossi Corp is this guy, Eric Arvetson, he's not has, hasn't have a presence on Twitter, but

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:44.880
 we've been working together ever since I was in college, like, and he worked with, I recruited

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:50.160
 into Google. He's one of my oldest friends and collaborators. And when we started doing JavaScript,

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:55.680
 way back in the day, doing those UI widgets, you know, what we were doing was like drop down menus,

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:59.600
 windows, scroll bars, you know, stuff like this, we were making UI widget, because we wanted to make

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:05.360
 the web work like a real, like, like real native apps, the as good as real native apps. And I think

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:11.680
 like there was something way back there really interesting and deep that we didn't totally recognize,

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:16.640
 which is that like web software is client server software. And like those native apps that have

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:21.680
 that feel that you love that, you know, when people, why can't web apps be like Winamp, you know,

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:27.520
 that was like, we're always saying Winamp is amazing. And like part of that is like all the

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:32.800
 stuff about JavaScript, we can solve all that. But part of it is that the web Winamp is Spotify,

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:37.760
 it's client server software, it's not local software, you know, the data is remote. And so

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:43.040
 part people, people always bitch about how bad web software is and part of it is legit, you know,

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:47.280
 and part of it is solvable. But a big part of it is like networking, you know,

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:51.440
 Yeah, so architecture of it. Yeah. Yeah. And a big part of the value of web software,

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.360
 the reason we're using it is because it's client server, you know, and so solving that,

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:59.680
 making that part as good as native software is really deep. And fun problem and like,

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:06.800
 you know, something that I feel like I didn't really like, I didn't really go after like fully,

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:15.360
 you know, before, but like we're doing the zero and, and I'm like, I'm like stoked to finally be

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:19.360
 going for it. And I think like a lot of other people, it's funny, like when you really go for

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:24.080
 something, like when we announce zero, like the amount of just like encouragement from the community

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:30.400
 was like, it was just completely inspiring. And like, like, it felt so good. Like people who are

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:36.560
 competitors were like, wow, you know, this is epic. Like, you know, like, I'm like, so glad

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.560
 that you guys are going for this. And we've got a lot of people involved just like for that reason.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:47.040
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a it's super exciting. And like I said, for me, it's been just,

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:54.720
 and I think I started down this path in 2020, I think, it's been five years. It's been a very

01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:02.960
 long time. And just to see even just the transition from me talking about this and then it just me

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.400
 talking to no one is like kind of going out at the wind and nobody even like knew what I was talking

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:11.840
 about. Everyone was kind of focused somewhere else. To now like everyone gets it and it was kind

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.880
 of on everyone's radar. And yeah, it's cool to be able to actually like witness that transition.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.000
 Because I never felt like I'd been early to anything. I always felt like I arrived.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.160
 It's a little too late. But then with this, it feels like, okay, I like actually was able to see

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:29.840
 something and follow it through. Yeah. Yeah, it's always fun. Anything else you wanted to

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:37.200
 chat about? No, I mean, you know, thanks for having me on. I really appreciate like you pushing us.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:41.040
 Like I've said this before, but actually like you are a big reason we did zero.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.640
 Like pushing on replica and like really getting us to think about like solving this problem for

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.120
 real. But yeah, this has been super fun. Thanks for having me on. Yeah, always a good time.

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.960
 Thanks Aaron. All right.
