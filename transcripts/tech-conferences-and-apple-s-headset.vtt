WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
 But AI, Dax, just like, well, have AI do it, whatever you can't do.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.540
 I do not use AI to do it, so if you want to do that better than me.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.520
 Do you feel really depressed today?

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.680
 I don't know if depressed is the right word.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.680
 Go down.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.680
 You feel a little energy.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.680
 I feel a little low energy.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.280
 Do you woke up like that?

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.280
 Well, yeah.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.800
 I'm out of my normal sleeping habits, so I'm getting up really late, and that's from

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.000
 the conference and all that, and there's just a lot of little things, a lot of little

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 things.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Hey, I fixed my hair for you, though.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 That's good.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Appreciate that.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.120
 I mean, I only did it because I was getting ready to turn on the thing.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.120
 I just started shoving it.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 It does.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.420
 I think it does make a difference as stupid as it is.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.880
 No, I know it does.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.120
 I just forget to do it, and then there you are.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.720
 I think it's a mix of things, right?

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.000
 There's probably actual stuff you had to figure out, which might be depressing to you.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Yeah.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.120
 Which we haven't talked about, and then, but also like, just like being at a conference

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.720
 and like drinking a bunch, I definitely depletes stuff in your brain, so.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.880
 Oh, for sure.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.880
 Yeah.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.760
 I'm physically, I'm still recovering.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.920
 It's been two days ago I got home, not yesterday, the day before.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 No.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.920
 I don't want Saturday.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.240
 It's been three days.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.080
 I still feel physically like my throat, my voice is coming back still, like just from

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.480
 being in loud bars where everybody's yelling.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.480
 Why do we do that as adults?

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.000
 Why is that a thing that we do?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.640
 I don't understand.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.440
 Can we not just like not play music or be in a place where you can actually hear someone

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.000
 if you're going to like spend time with people?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.400
 Why is it have to be so loud you can't hear?

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 I don't understand.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.400
 Yeah.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.400
 Sounds so old.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.400
 No, I know.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 I definitely have felt that too.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.880
 But part of me also kind of likes, like I hate it, but I like it.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.320
 Like it's just like a it's definitely inconvenient and annoying, but also just like kind of like

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.320
 a specific vibe.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.320
 I don't know.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.320
 Do you just not talk?

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.600
 No, I talk a lot about me just like screaming.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600
 Yeah.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.520
 Do you end up with this like your voice hurts the next day every time?

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.520
 Yeah.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.520
 My voice hurts.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.520
 That's what we're all doing.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.240
 I actually don't hear people when they say stuff to me.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.280
 So I just laugh and nod and I'm usually laughing at the wrong times.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280
 Okay.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.400
 So I don't recommend I don't recommend three days of that.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.440
 I don't I don't drink like I don't like put a lot of substances in my body, but then like

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.440
 go to a tech conference.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.920
 It's like this is the time to do it hanging out with people.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.840
 People just met kind of like make it easier to hang out and be more socially.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.840
 Yeah.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.840
 I don't know.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.840
 Whatever.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840
 Yeah, it's too much.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.840
 It's too much.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.360
 It's like a one day tech conference.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.040
 I want a one day tech party because like one day of that.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.040
 Sure.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.040
 Yeah, that's true.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.040
 Three.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040
 Not as much.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.240
 How does it feel like the age range at the conference, like let's be honest, like most

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.960
 people are not their bodies can't handle three days of partying.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960
 Yeah.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.960
 Yeah.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.960
 Like myself included.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.240
 It's like unless you've like are constantly doing that or like yours or an age, I feel

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.640
 like it's just very difficult.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.640
 So yeah.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.640
 Yeah.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.640
 It's tough.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.040
 Again, it's just I think the dream we want is it's not possible like a one day tech party

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.120
 minimal talks.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.960
 No one is going to actually go to that because no company is going to pay for that and just

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.640
 going somewhere for one day is like a lot for people.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.640
 Yeah.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.640
 Can we say all that out loud?

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.680
 Some of the things we've said in private?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.680
 Yeah.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.160
 I just amped it up more than I needed to.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.160
 I just got people there.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.160
 It's parked up.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.800
 But like the idea that tech conferences, there's this whole charade.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.960
 This is what DAX, this is DAX is in sight.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.160
 I'm not trying to blame you.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.800
 I'm just trying to like make sure to give you credit because DAX pointed out that like

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.880
 we have to pretend that it's some educational thing.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.800
 All these talks, everyone prepares for talks, everyone gets excited and submits their talks.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.800
 They get accepted.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.800
 They do the talks.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.880
 All the talks are pointless.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.880
 It's also dumb.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.480
 I'm just learning anything from a talk.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.480
 It's just not.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.720
 Nobody's like going to a tech conference and leaving like man.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.400
 Now I understand that concept so well because of that talk.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.800
 And if you do, watch them on YouTube.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.800
 It's just so dumb.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.120
 It's all made up and it's what's the theory DAX?

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.120
 The theory is that people have to sell it as educational to get their company to pay for

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.760
 them to go because they're not going to pay for them to go to a party.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.960
 These things are okay.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.080
 So one, we all like these things, we like going to a place that is cool and having it's

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.080
 like summer camp.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.840
 It's like three days, structured stuff, hang out with people.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.720
 You relate to people you know from online.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.040
 Have a good time effectively just partying.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.760
 But this is expensive.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.760
 You got to fly there.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.760
 You got to book tickets.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.120
 You got to pay for the conference so that they can pay for the venue, et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:15.240
 And the scam that people figured out is if we make it seem like educational stuff, then

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.000
 there's an argument for your company to pay for it.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.880
 And in fact, most of these conferences actually give you like a pre-made letter that you can

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.600
 give to your boss as to like why they should pay for your payment.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.520
 It makes complete sense.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.240
 But then the day, I have seen incredible talks before, always on YouTube, because I've never

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.880
 like seen them live, but it's like one in 100 and most talks are very mediocre, including

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.880
 the one that I gave.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.760
 So I'm like, don't be myself in with this.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:53.440
 And the reality that nobody says is if you go to a conference and look around, either

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.280
 half the seats are empty because people aren't even showing up to the talks.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.160
 And then people that are there are like listening in and out, but like kind of on their phones.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.440
 And everyone's mostly just counting the time down to like, okay, I'll just do one talk.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.400
 So I don't feel like I didn't do any, then they'll go and they'll hang out with other

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400
 people.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.840
 So it is like a charade, which is kind of funny.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.880
 But then the day we're just there to have a party.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.880
 Yeah.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.800
 And I like all the people that are doing the talks.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.400
 So you go to some talks because you just like the person and you just want to like support

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400
 them.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.080
 But I don't know, maybe there are some people, I realized I said some extreme things.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.500
 Maybe there are some people that have taken something away from talks that they listen

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.960
 to in person.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.960
 I can't overgeneralize everything.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:42.160
 For me, it just feels like a whole lot of like charade, I don't know, just like a big

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.160
 facade.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.160
 Yeah.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.960
 It's obviously not zero because, but I mean, I think about this from like an ROI perspective

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.760
 is as like having a company that is told you're supposed to be sending people from your company

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.120
 to these talks, because whatever your company does, they send people to go do talks about

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.560
 their company, product, whatever.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.840
 But if you just spend like 30 seconds thinking about it, it doesn't make any sense because

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.560
 the reach of your talk is like just going to be the people in the room, which you know,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.560
 was like a hundred people.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.560
 Yeah.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.400
 So you're going to send someone and pay for all that to like reach 100 people.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.640
 Maybe it like goes up on YouTube and maybe it gets like a little bit more.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.920
 But you could just done that on your own in the first place.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.600
 So the ROI for sending a speakers does not make any sense.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.520
 It is funny though, because when I was there, and I gave my talk for React Miami, I had

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.520
 someone come up to me after and they were like, oh, because my talk was about deploying

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.520
 next to AWS.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.800
 They were like, oh, wow, like this is something that my infra team has been trying to figure

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.800
 out.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.280
 And like they're like stuck on how complicated it is.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.280
 I don't know.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.280
 Next to the thing.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.280
 I don't know.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.280
 I see what the thing.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.280
 Awesome.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.280
 Like so glad I heard this.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.800
 Okay, that's really great.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.280
 And I'm so glad that person found like we were able to connect in that way.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.720
 But that's literally one person, you know, like if I made any YouTube video, like I guarantee

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.080
 you, I would have gotten more than one person.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.680
 So the ROI just is not there.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.360
 So it just nobody wants to think too hard about this or say it out loud because we all

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.360
 like it.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.360
 Like we all like it.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.360
 I mean, it's fun.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.520
 It's a good time.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.760
 I don't want to go away.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.680
 I just, I wish there were some way to like, I don't know, feel like less of it was fake.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.440
 And I, all the trappings, all the things that come with the talk side of it just kind of

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.480
 like are annoying to me.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.480
 I don't know.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.480
 It just feels like what?

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.320
 Well, like having to go to any of them.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.160
 And I had to sit, I had to set a couple of them because it's like, everybody's going,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:45.160
 we got to go support whoever and I like these people again, I like the people a lot.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.160
 I just don't.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.160
 I don't need to sit in your talk.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.440
 Like I just don't need to hear somebody talk about something.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.920
 I don't really care.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.920
 I don't know.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.240
 Maybe there'd be a talk that would totally change my perspective on all this.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:00.040
 If I like sat in it and it was like, just cut through, I don't know, it was like something

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.560
 about the emotion of seeing the speaker on stage, like, I don't know, maybe it could

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.080
 have happened, but it's never happened for me.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.120
 I think the angle we should take is we all know we have to do talks because it needs

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.640
 to come for all the reasons we just said, like I need to, the company needs to think

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.400
 it's an educational thing.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.160
 But let's all acknowledge that talks are innately boring and let's try to make them more interesting.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.440
 Yeah, so if I think about React Miami, I did go to, so there were two talks there on the

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.160
 first day that I thought were really good.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.880
 One was Ken Wheeler's.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.080
 The other one was Sunil's.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.600
 So Ken's was about using Chrome DevTools more, which I think foundation that actually was

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.040
 a good topic because it's not like most people just kind of lightly use Chrome DevTools.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.280
 So it's cool to see like all the other features you're missing out on.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.280
 Yeah.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.480
 And two, he's just like an entertaining, funny speaker, like it was just like fun to listen

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.480
 and talk.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.480
 Same with Sunil, right?

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.480
 You know, it's like a fantastic speaker.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.280
 He was had like jokes on every slide, like everyone was, you can just, that was my first

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.280
 day at the conference.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.640
 And really first day of really listening to talks anywhere, ever.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.240
 And I was looking around the whole day and people seemed so disengaged and when the two

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.760
 of them came on, there were lots of speakers to go.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.760
 Everyone was like, no, eyes perked, like focused and like way more engaged.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.760
 So there's clearly like a skill range here.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.440
 I don't think it's, I actually don't think it's like, oh, some people are just good at

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.440
 it and other people aren't.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.320
 And I think it's just, you have, you got to remember that what you're trying to do is

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.200
 kind of inherently boring.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.760
 So if you just acknowledge that, I think you end up making something a little bit different

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.220
 and it ends up doing, but like just acknowledge that everyone's here at a party.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.040
 This is to get to the talks so they can go to the party.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.000
 So make that as least boring as a process experience for them.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.960
 I think you end up with something good.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.960
 Yeah.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.960
 No, that makes sense.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.360
 It kind of like applies to the conversations we've had around like YouTube as well.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.320
 I mean, just the idea that like our industry just gets so serious.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.640
 We just get so serious about all this stuff.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.120
 And I don't know what the dynamic there is, like if it's just trying to like help the

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:04.440
 people who are brand new to it, I don't know, but I feel like it's a little too stodgy.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.960
 All of our talking head videos, I'm never making another like, here's my tag video again.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.960
 Not one.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.960
 I promise you.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.400
 Except for the one that you have recorded, even published, or are you all out?

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.400
 I'm not publishing it.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.400
 I'm all out.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.400
 Wow.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.680
 I'm just, I'm done with making like, here's my shoulders up, talking head, talk about

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.680
 a thing video.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.680
 Yeah.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.600
 That I don't really care to make.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.600
 And no one cares to watch.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.000
 Like I'm not doing anymore.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.440
 I'm not making them.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.600
 It's just like a talk.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.200
 It's like doing a talk, but on YouTube, I'm just done.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.200
 Done.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200
 Yeah.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.600
 I think, I'm trying to think who, I think this might have been Elizabeth pointed this

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.120
 out to me at one point.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.520
 She mentioned that this is probably a big way, probably not even on the topic of tech.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.800
 I think this is more like a general topic.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.320
 I think she talks about how when you're like younger and experienced, you're obsessed

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.800
 with being taken seriously.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:58.760
 So you're like incapable of finding the humor and things are coming across in a way that's

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.480
 not like totally serious, because you're so like insecure, like vulnerable about like,

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.120
 I need to be taken seriously.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.120
 Yeah.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.560
 And then that inherently makes for boring content.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.520
 And then you'll see that the people that are really the people like listening to and

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.520
 are really like fun to listen to, they tend to be a little bit more experienced.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.880
 You can tell like they like truly just don't care about being seen as like someone smart.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.000
 And ironically, that makes them, that like, that's what makes people think they're smart,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 right?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.960
 Like, obviously when someone like doesn't care, you like definitely like buy into it.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.960
 It's more genuine.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:37.280
 And the two guys, this is like Ken and Sunil, like they're not up there trying to be like,

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.280
 I'm really smart.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.280
 Please like walk away from this talk thinking that I was smart.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.280
 Yep.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.720
 And the side effect is it's, it's ends up being the best content.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.720
 Yeah.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.720
 Okay.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.920
 So there's lessons to apply there across the board.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.920
 Yeah.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.920
 So can we talk about the Apple thing?

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.840
 I know this is a big shift from the content talk we're doing, but yeah, what are your thoughts?

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.400
 What's your initial take?

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.080
 I've so, so many.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.600
 So I guess let me set it up a little bit.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.040
 So for me personally, maybe I haven't talked about it too much, but I'm like, I've been

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.320
 a huge enthusiast in this space in general for a very long time.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:16.160
 Like I don't specifically is that we are like all of the consumer electronics.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.160
 No.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.160
 Okay.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.160
 Got it.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.160
 That's the other side of things.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.240
 I own the first development kit of the oculus.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.040
 It's a second development kit of the oculus, then like the, then like the actual full product.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:33.840
 The last one I've bought was a valid index, which I think at this point is one of the best

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.840
 ones.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.440
 You can best like VR headsets you get and I've just been kind of following the space closely

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.040
 and I've seen it develop over time.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.040
 Yeah.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.360
 Pretty much from the beginning of it, I've been hands on with it.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.400
 So I was very excited about this because I can like look at the issues that I've seen

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.360
 and see like where Apple is pushing the bar.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.200
 So I have a ton of thoughts on this.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.160
 But yeah, I want to know like, what was your kind of initial reaction, everything?

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.240
 Well, I've never owned a VR headset.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.560
 Have you tried it though?

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.360
 So I have the opposite perspective.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.920
 I think I've tried it one time at like a jump mania kind of place, one of those trampoline

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.920
 places.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.280
 They had like a VR thing.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.600
 I think that's the only time I've ever done VR and I could be forgetting, but I'm pretty

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.560
 sure and it was like you're like throwing snowballs at each other.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.720
 I did it with my eight year old.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.480
 So I don't know how good that tech was.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.600
 I have no idea, but this headset like shows you the outside world.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600
 Doesn't it?

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.600
 Or does it do both?

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.600
 It does both.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.560
 So it's it's AR and VR.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.320
 It's effectively a VR headset.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.240
 It's like you think of it just a VR headset except it has cameras on the outside.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.400
 So it can show a video of the outside to your face.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.480
 Oh, so you're it's not actually transparent.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.480
 No.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.480
 I didn't watch the keynote.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.400
 So I've just like picked up bits and pieces.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.400
 Yeah.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.640
 And it's a little unclear from their presentation.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.320
 Like it's it's clear if you like read some of the, some of the, a few journalists got

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.760
 like a 30 minute demo of it and they wrote up about it.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.760
 Yeah.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.760
 But okay.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.000
 So let me summarize a few things.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.320
 So from the beginning of this whole thing with the first Oculus that like kind of kick

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.680
 started this, like this, this current push we have on VR, there's been a few like things

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.160
 that have been annoying.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.600
 So one is the raw resolution going to each eye.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.600
 When that is low, you have this effect where it feels like you're looking through a screen

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.600
 door.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.560
 Because like the pixels are so close to your eyes.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.120
 So like when you're looking at stuff, it looks like it looks, it feels like you're in

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.800
 like a low resolution world.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.480
 So if you look at something like text, it's like not very crisp.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.280
 So when people wanted to use these things, okay, replace my monitor with it.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.400
 It wasn't really viable because you're looking at like, yeah, I think a really bad resolution

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.400
 screen.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.400
 It doesn't feel exactly right.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.600
 That's one thing.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.240
 The second thing is field of view.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:56.220
 So this thing goes over your eyes, but it doesn't cover your whole field of vision.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:00.360
 So like the sides of your view, you'll see like, it's black because there's actually

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.360
 no screen there.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.360
 Yeah.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.360
 Well, that kills the effect.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.360
 Yeah.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.720
 So the impact is you feel like you're looking through a rectangle to like look into the

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.720
 world.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:14.160
 This has gotten better over time and it's like, it's not like a deal breaker, but it definitely

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.600
 is something that is very different from what you see in the demos where you see or like

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.440
 the marketing videos where you see like the person being enveloped by some image.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.440
 Yeah.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440
 Yeah.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.720
 And then the third thing is just the ergonomics of putting something bulky on your head.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.720
 You sweat.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720
 Yeah.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.720
 It feels weird.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.640
 And then the motion sickness thing where like, if there's any kind of delay with your

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.160
 head movement and the image moving, like that causes motion sickness for people to varying

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.000
 degrees, the first version of this stuff was really, really bad as someone that doesn't

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.600
 really get motion sick.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.760
 Like that, even that for me, like it was killing me.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.760
 Too much.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.760
 Yeah.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.760
 The latest stuff.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.760
 It's mostly really good.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.600
 I think at least for someone like me that is not that affected.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.200
 Just some experiences, it just depends on like the experience you're having like some experiences

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.880
 like really mess with your head and it's really crazy.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.600
 Like, it's totally fake.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.040
 It's just like an image being projected in front of your eyes.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:13.880
 But you'll feel like like really often sick and it's crazy that you probably can do that.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:21.320
 So with the Apple headset, the Apple Vision Pro, it seems like they fixed the first one.

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.240
 So I think the pixel density is very high.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.080
 All the reviews that I've seen, other people have experienced it have said that text looked

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.080
 really crisp.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.480
 Like you can actually like look and read that's read things.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:37.440
 This has another effect of like this concept of, oh, can I like be in a VR like movie theater

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.280
 and look at a hundred inch or like a 500 inch screen, whatever it is?

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.280
 Yeah.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.240
 I think that's like way more viable because when you try to do that before, it just looks

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.440
 like a shitty big screen.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.360
 I think now it can potentially look like a good big screen.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.840
 So that is fantastic.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.800
 It didn't fix the field of view thing.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.440
 They're still like black on the sides.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.760
 Like I said, it's not a deal breaker, but it does help a lot.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.200
 And then I don't think that I'm sure it's like way more comfortable than all the other

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.720
 things that were built before it.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:11.200
 But then the day it's still a bulky single user device that goes around your head.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.920
 So anything you're going to be doing in it is going to be solo and you're going to be

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.920
 working.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.920
 There's like kind of weird thing on your head.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.920
 Yeah.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:22.960
 Did I imagine that like a year ago or maybe longer when the rumors around their AR device

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:28.160
 would like Apple has had this for years as like a big rumor, right?

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.520
 Did I imagine that it was about like glasses?

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.760
 I thought there were glasses and it's very much a headset.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:39.800
 If you did comment yesterday that I wish they aimed for something less ambitious.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.920
 So it was just like way lower profile, like a slimmer profile thing, maybe just like glasses

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.640
 and it can't really do all this crazy stuff.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:52.440
 It just shows you like alerts or like kind of like watch the Google glass.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.560
 That was like a decade ago.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.560
 Yeah.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.880
 And I've tried the Google glass and again that had the very clear issue of like you're looking

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.760
 through this tiny rectangle and you have like a tiny rectangle in your vision for a yeah.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.400
 So I mean, I guess they could have aimed for something smaller, but I think they're going

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:16.520
 for crazy, crazy high-end, maybe really high-end small niche high-end user base and then kind

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.040
 of build down from there like make it smaller, less featured over time.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.040
 Yeah, cheaper.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.040
 Yeah.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.040
 Yeah.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.320
 At the end of the day, like I said, I have been like an enthusiast in this space.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.200
 When I look at this device, it's still to me feels like an enthusiast device, one, just

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.200
 a price point.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.200
 Yeah.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.080
 I think I want to say that I find annoying is whenever something like big and potentially

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:47.320
 game changer like this comes out, people just like generically apply previous logic as though

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.960
 it like automatically apply.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.480
 So everyone's like, oh, yeah.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.320
 But people said the iPhone was too expensive.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.240
 Like Steve bomber like has that quote where he like was completely wrong about the iPhone.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.240
 Yeah.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.440
 Therefore that like same complaint, they just think that that's going to play out again

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.960
 on that because it's happened once, but that's like missing actually thinking about the details.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:10.920
 It is very expensive, like $3,500 is a luxury item for something that you're just going

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:18.120
 to use alone to do activities that I never do alone like watch movies or like look at

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120
 photos.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.480
 Like, you know, it's like, it's like the demos are so cool, but they were like so weirdly

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.120
 solo to me, like really stuck out like, how would I ever be doing this alone?

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.120
 Yeah.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.640
 So you don't, you don't think we're all going to walk around with them at some point in

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.640
 the future?

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.840
 Like, are we going to all just be interacting with each other through these things?

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.280
 I think that it's going to be like what we're doing now where me and you have a relationship

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.880
 that is very, very digital.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:48.240
 And if both of us have this device, we can like bridge that gap to a, we can like make

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.240
 it a better experience.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.880
 So I think, yeah, I think that's very cool, like creating like really cool social experiences

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.880
 with that.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.440
 But also that was not part of demo at all.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.000
 So they haven't gotten to a point where they're like, here's what multiplayer looks.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.720
 I mean, they have like the basic FaceTime example.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.720
 The FaceTime thing.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.720
 Yeah.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.400
 But like, I didn't see too much of like play a game together.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:12.200
 Like, I want some like crazy killer app where it's like, you get, you put this thing on,

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.720
 you have four friends in different parts of the world, you all put it on and you're playing

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:21.320
 some kind of crazy like quote unquote board game together, but it's like crazy because

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.080
 like, you know, there's like visual stuff that can happen and like three stuff that can

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.080
 happen.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.080
 Like a, like a Dungeons & Dragons person situation.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.080
 Now we're talking.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.080
 Yeah.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.080
 Yeah.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.080
 Do you play like sellers of guitar?

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.600
 Can I start talking about that would be so fun.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.040
 Like, me and you could be like, but like with like real like building, you're like building

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.040
 real walls.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.040
 Yeah.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.040
 Yeah.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.040
 Exactly.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.040
 Yeah.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.040
 Yeah.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.040
 And like you can see like, you know, if you can attack another thing, you let an army go.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.720
 You can imagine some like a demo like that.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.720
 Yeah.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.120
 Would really capture some people's imaginations and make it feel like, oh yeah, I need to

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.120
 have this thing.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.120
 But yeah, I think we're right.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.520
 I mean, I think it's fair that they're just releasing a platform effectively to build a

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.520
 lot of those things.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.920
 So maybe we will see some of those killer applications, but it's just a classic chicken

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.920
 and egg thing.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:06.680
 So the VR has always been the market of people isn't big enough.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.600
 So like really warrants a high end, someone invests in like a high end experience for

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.600
 it.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.560
 Apple of any company, maybe you can can pull that off.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.560
 So that's why I guess I thought Apple would eventually pull this off.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.200
 I didn't expect in 2023 for just be a VR headset.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:28.800
 In the last 10 years, I mean, I remember when VR had a big moment like eight years ago,

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.080
 and there were all these VR startups and they were all getting a ton of funding.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.640
 And I've just always thought like, that's just, it's like a gaming device or something,

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.640
 right?

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.160
 Like we're, it's not going to be like mass market appeal, because it's just weird to,

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.640
 you're not going to like walk around with the thing, but the AR thing seemed like to

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.320
 me, if we could all just have like designer glasses and we can see all kinds of other

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.480
 things in the world and interact with digital stuff in the physical world, that just seemed

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:57.680
 like, I could imagine that being this next phase of computing, like after mobile, there's

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.880
 like this real world stuff.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.440
 And I thought Apple would lead the way there.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.280
 So I guess when I heard those rivers for last three years or whatever, I've just always

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:10.400
 assumed they're working on some cool stylish glass, glass thing, glasses.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.400
 And it's going to be awesome.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.400
 And it's going to be mass market.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.400
 And this is not that.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400
 Yeah.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400
 I think the technologies isn't there.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.840
 It's like so difficult to pull off that.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.320
 That's another reason why people keep comparing this iPhone.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.520
 I don't think it's the right comparison.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:27.720
 The iPhone made bulky technology way more invisible, right?

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.720
 Yeah.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.680
 We went from having these like phones with like keyboard on them that you would type into

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.680
 to like this.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.680
 Yeah.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.680
 Very natural.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.760
 The whole innovation was a multi touch screen and that felt like less technology in a lot

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.760
 of ways, right?

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:46.280
 It was felt like way more touching some natural and intuitive and it made things more invisible.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.280
 This is the opposite, right?

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.040
 This is making, this is like the opposite of invisible, like strapping this $4,000 device

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.040
 onto it.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:56.640
 They kept cracking up something about, they had this one demo where it was like the person

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.000
 on the airplane, like putting this on and wearing it.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 I'm like, that is cool.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.440
 Cause then you can have, you can like go through a flight and have like whatever cool experience

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.440
 you want.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.440
 Yeah.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.080
 But something about sitting on a plane with a $4,000 device to your head.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.080
 Yeah.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.880
 It's like, this is, and like they kept showing people like using it in public and I'm like,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.560
 I don't want to obscure my vision like that in public, like, oh no, it's going to come

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.720
 in, like rob me or like do something to me like you feel very vulnerable, walking around

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.880
 the streets with that thing on your face.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.440
 So I see this as like a home device, but again, anything I do at home, I'm doing with Liz,

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.080
 like, like what do you do?

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.080
 Do you do any kind of like entertainment thing alone, like not with your family?

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.080
 Like, no.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.560
 So an, an apple to me has always been like a very like family company.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.360
 I feel like they're always like building stuff for you to like do with like your family and

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.360
 stuff.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.800
 It feels like real, this feels like Android stuff to be honest, feels like very like single

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.960
 and like bachelor and like you're, you live in an apartment.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.200
 The only thing you have is like a mattress on the floor and then this like headset on the

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.760
 ground next to it, you know, I have two questions.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.760
 And maybe I just need to watch a video, uh, but is it has a wire that like goes down to

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.760
 something?

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.760
 It's just a battery pack.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.320
 So you can you put the water pack in your, I guess next to you if you're sitting on the

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.200
 couch or you can plug it into the wall or like you put it in your pocket.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.200
 If you're walking around with it.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.200
 Yeah.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.200
 Okay.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:23.600
 So I guess my real question is, does this, this format, what is the word I'm looking

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.600
 for?

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:30.680
 Does this, uh, form of the thing evolve down to the thing I wish existed or no?

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:35.360
 I mean, I would like to believe so, but part of me is like, I don't know, I, I maybe I'm

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.920
 just not being imaginative enough.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.440
 I don't know how it could just because like the reason it can't just be cool classes is

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.560
 you need to have something like wraps around your eyes to achieve a certain effect.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.560
 Right.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:51.360
 Those glasses, one of those called the like stunner, one of those called those glasses

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.400
 that take really wrap all the way around the pit by vipers.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.400
 Yeah.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.400
 Yeah.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.640
 Like Ken Wheeler glasses, like maybe like that.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.640
 Okay.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.480
 I mean, maybe, but then the cause you, it can't let like light in, it has to like control

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.480
 the amount.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.640
 And be it like community, sex, image quality, so there's that and there's a whole power

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.640
 thing.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.340
 And this, this device is a hundred percent limited by battery tech.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.340
 Right.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.340
 Yeah.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.760
 Because you want to get higher quality uses more energy, which means a battery life is

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.760
 lower.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.000
 So we're not getting context is what you're telling me.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.480
 This is not evolving down to, I can imagine the future thing we want.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.800
 And I'm like, I think that requires a completely different technology.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.800
 Yeah.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.520
 I wouldn't be surprised if that requires you to like put something in your brain.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.520
 I don't know.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.000
 I feel like it might just end up being a totally different approach.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 Wow.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 I'm just guessing.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.480
 I mean, this is all a complete sci-fi at this point.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.480
 But it's fun.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.560
 It's fun to hear your guesses, your guesses are entertaining again, as an enthusiast,

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.560
 very intrigued.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:52.720
 But even as an enthusiast, $3, $500 for a device that just can exist inside the Apple ecosystem.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:57.280
 Like you can't, I can't like plug into my computer and play like my games with it.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.280
 I don't know.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.280
 It's a bit tricky.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:04.800
 Definitely like a splurge purchase that I just want to like try out and it'd be a cool

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.240
 thing that people come over and try.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.240
 I don't know.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.240
 Yeah.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.240
 Would you, would you have any interest?

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.480
 As a developer to build something for it, like does that sound fun?

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.640
 I think my imagination is definitely like, I'm definitely like having a ton of ideas

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.040
 of stuff that I would love to exist.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.040
 I don't think I have the skill set to make any of that.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.040
 So I'm excited for other people to do it.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.800
 But AI, Dax, just like, I have AI do it.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.800
 Whatever you can't do.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.800
 I use AI to do it.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.120
 So I love people who want to do that better than me.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.120
 Okay.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.880
 Like I said this, I want some tabletop experience where like, like Legos or like just something

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.880
 that like makes.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.120
 Oh, what, what was that?

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.360
 There was a demo of that.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.880
 Somebody doing like a Minecraft, like a table.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.440
 What is that from?

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.000
 This, this always is a thing that gets demoed and never released.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.440
 So there were a few demos of this.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.080
 When was a Microsoft HoloLens?

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.080
 Microsoft thing.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.080
 Yeah.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.080
 HoloLens.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.080
 What happened to that?

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.080
 Did it just die?

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.640
 It ended up getting decent adoption in like military and like industrial uses.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.560
 But again, just, it's kind of just going to niche this whole thing is like a niche market

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.560
 still.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:14.120
 And I think they actually shuttered that division in like the past year or something.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.120
 Okay.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:21.600
 Can I, can I give you like my AR like this is, it's actually my wife's like vision for how

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.880
 AR could fix society.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.040
 So there's like all these jobs that nobody wants to do anymore because they're just,

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.040
 they're awful.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.040
 I don't know if I've told you this before.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:35.360
 This is like a billion dollar startup ideas for whoever wants to, to solve societies problems.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.580
 We constantly, they don't come get our trash because they don't have enough people.

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:43.120
 And like this week, we're just not picking up the trash and that sucks.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.680
 But then it's like, wow, first world problems.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.680
 I feel bad.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.680
 Like, I don't want to pick up trash.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.240
 So I get that like people don't want to do that job.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.960
 But what if everybody had little AR glasses, okay?

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.120
 And you could gamify picking up the trash, okay?

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.920
 And they could get like bonuses or something based on how good they do driving the truck

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.920
 or doing the thing.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.760
 It's this, is this super cringy?

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:05.760
 Should I stop talking now?

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.760
 You're looking at me.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.760
 Kind of funny.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.760
 I don't know.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:13.480
 I, I, I guess I'm not seeing the, I understand the premise, but I don't know why you need

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.040
 AR to like do that.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.520
 Oh, like, I don't know.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.120
 Like what are they going to like hold, pull their phone out?

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.120
 Like it's got a track.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.720
 It'd have to like make it fun.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.120
 Like you're shooting down alien spaceships or something.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.120
 And those are the trash cans.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.120
 I don't know.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.120
 I don't know.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.120
 It's something to make it like actually entertaining.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.120
 Like it's completely different.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.120
 Yeah.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.120
 Yeah.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.120
 Or here's what's up.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.120
 Here's a better idea.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.760
 You can buy, you can buy it for your family and it could just like blur out the trash in

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.760
 front of your house.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.360
 That's like it's not even there.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.360
 It's just living in Phil.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.360
 Yeah.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.080
 I'm going to have some rat issues and disease and that kind of stuff.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.760
 But other than that, it sounds fantastic.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.240
 Well, I mean, assume like someday maybe we could make robots, like humanoid robots.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.240
 I don't know.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.240
 Boston dynamic.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.240
 Whatever.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.040
 I think, I think your issue.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.240
 But this is just that your local government doesn't have enough money.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.520
 Isn't that the root issue?

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.520
 Probably.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.520
 That's yeah.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.520
 There's no money in this area.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:10.120
 So are you saying like in cities, like people get paid well enough to do the job and enjoy

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.120
 it?

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.760
 And I think that the amount for these types of jobs, it just like you just need to pay.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.400
 If people don't want to do, you've got to keep increasing the price you're paying for

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.400
 it.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.400
 Yeah.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.960
 I would, I would pay a lot more for our trash to be picked up.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960
 Yeah.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960
 Yeah.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.160
 It's a version of this conversation before and I think it doesn't go well.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.160
 I'm going to stop now.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.160
 Well, yeah.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.480
 I mean, you brought this up a while ago.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.480
 So I feel it.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.920
 It's funny that this trash issue seems to be a recurring combination for you guys.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.480
 I mean, yeah, it's it affects my life.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.480
 That's really crazy.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.480
 Yeah.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.480
 We don't only have two bins.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.480
 We can.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.480
 And then one, what do we do?

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.480
 Once they're full.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.480
 It's like we're putting trash bags in the garage.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.760
 I mean, it's again, first of all problems.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.040
 I'm super privileged.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.240
 I'm very lucky.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.440
 This is not a major issue, but it just, it makes me think.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:01.880
 It is a major issue in that like dealing with like a cities or a trash, like a foundational

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:07.400
 like, yeah, part of this, that's like a low level, like part of building a society, right?

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.400
 Yeah.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.400
 Yeah.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.400
 If that's not working, like a lot of other stuff isn't working.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.400
 Yeah.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.720
 Maybe this is just where I live problem and small, local economies.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:22.400
 We have this weird thing where, so we don't have an issue with the trash because then

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.120
 people come and get the trash and recycling all that is great.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:31.880
 We, and it works so well that I don't understand this, but when I moved into my house, my landlord

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:36.480
 is like points across the street and he's like, you see that empty spot across the street?

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.720
 You can just dump shit there.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.760
 Just like anything you don't want to dump there.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.040
 And I was like, I don't think I heard him right.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:47.640
 I don't think I heard him right, but yeah, every week, a random truck shows up and they

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.240
 will take literally whatever is there and put on the truck.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:54.320
 And I don't even know if this is part of the city, this is like on top, like this is separate

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:59.120
 from the normal city trucks that you're just like, this is like a separate company.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:05.560
 Just people who want stuff or like, if you put anything that you want to get rid of from

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:09.640
 your garage on the side of the street here in the Ozarks, you can just post it on like

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:14.080
 Facebook marketplace and like it's free and someone will be here within 10 minutes like

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.080
 every single time.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.960
 No matter what it is, like really, you can put anything out there.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.080
 You've got a ton of like scrap wood and people eat up the wood.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.360
 They want wood really bad.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.360
 Apparently.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.360
 There you go.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.280
 There's something you can take care of by the people.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.280
 Yeah.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.280
 Some of it.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.160
 They don't take your trash though.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.960
 I get that's not as attractive.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.360
 Okay, we just need you in this episode because my brain, I think I'm just done.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:43.560
 I've said all the words my brain could say and I have to pee.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.560
 It's been fun.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.040
 I should go a podcast episode where I don't mention that I have to pee.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.040
 We edit that out, Chris.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.560
 Let's just try and get one episode right off every podcast episode of you saying, okay,

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.400
 I have to go accept it feels like that's ever it's the end of every one of them.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.800
 It feels like that's the case.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.800
 I'm bad.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.800
 You're over hydrating.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.800
 I guess so.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.160
 I thought your privacy was helping you figure this out.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.320
 She's giving up on me.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.320
 I'm an adult.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.320
 I can figure it out.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.320
 Okay.
