WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
 Maybe I'm gonna say a little like intro for Chris to cut to like bring Chris on

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.100
 So it's not just me mumbling and looking at my phone trying to find him. Is that should I do that? Mm-hmm

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.500
 Okay, so Chris you can cut out

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.760
 There we go episode 100. It's not like we've done this a hundred times before decks

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.300
 We still do the thing that you do like on a Google Hangout where it's like hang on. Can you hear me kid? Are we good?

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.040
 It's like every single call it will never stop

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.840
 Yeah

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.080
 Is Chris joining us or is he gonna be just us? I figure we start. Sorry. I forgot to tell you this

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.160
 I told Chris this I figure we start just like with us talking through some stuff and then

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.320
 Bring him on to do all the navel gazing after nice. Okay. We'll just make this one short short and sweet

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.940
 Let's talk a cloud strike because I don't know this is a crowd strike. I made this a mistake earlier

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.940
 Did I say the wrong thing? What did I say?

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.440
 You said a cloud strike which I also thought it in a tweet this morning. What is it crowd crowd strike?

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.440
 Okay, yes, because they've hit they've struck the crowd for sure. They have struck the crowd. Wow

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.040
 This one's fun

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.860
 In the way that like chaos is fun. Do you get like really excited when something really chaotic happens because I do it feels

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.040
 Yeah, well one it's fun and that is so universal like we're all affected by the same thing together and I have

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.620
 The same experience. That's always fun kind of like how COVID

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.480
 Yeah, it was chaotic in the same way. Yeah, I shouldn't be smart. Yeah, COVID was very serious, and it's very bad

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.600
 Something, but yeah, but there's something about shared chaos. That's just very enjoyable

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.480
 I do have to get on a plane on Monday. So I hope maybe this all clears up

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.680
 By Monday, I don't know I don't know man

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.840
 It's like the computers are down as in their own even boot which means any auto update process

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.400
 Can't happen even though they quote unquote fix it. Yep our computers that weren't like that didn't go down

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.440
 So if the computer is down you got a boot into safe mode and then delete a bunch of files

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.200
 Which has to be done manually on every single computer all these machines all over the world right now

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.680
 It's just kind of wild like yeah, I know it seems it something about being where we live like on

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.400
 The the very bleeding edge of the web dev whatever like just being on Twitter and just generally being pretty like

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.800
 Advances and threat word but far removed from this like corporate IT world

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.880
 It just feels so like oh wow this stuff still exists. It's crazy because it's most of the world

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.600
 But like all these people doing like traditional IT and the nightmare or maybe it's exciting to them too

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.200
 I don't know if you're like an IT staff guy like works the airport

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.800
 Are you like excited right now is this like every day is so boring and then finally it's like whoa lots to do

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.800
 This is gonna be good. Yeah, I wonder because it's also your chance to

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.240
 Basically save everything and fix everything so you can like just do nothing for the next year cuz everyone's like

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.400
 IT is really useful but like also that you just get blamed because people don't really understand what's happening

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.000
 Yeah, it is weird. I'm just imagining just so one thing like at an airport

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.240
 Okay, you got to go presumably like they have IT teams you have to go and update every single physical machine

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.920
 Which is pain in the ass. Yeah, but the whole world is so remote now like all the end user

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.600
 Laptops that are like in people's houses cuz they're where they work home. Mm-hmm

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.720
 They maybe don't even work anywhere remotely close to tech and like having to can you imagine them talking through it on the phone?

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.840
 Like trying to explain to Sally and accounting that works from home in Wisconsin like okay. We're gonna go into safe mode

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.300
 Hang on stop. Are we talking about on my laptop?

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.840
 And it's all these big companies these giant companies have

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.360
 Internal help tests. It's almost like a it's almost like customer support was for inside your company

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.840
 So you like call them like you're calling an external company and then they walk you through it

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.880
 And so that's gonna get flooded and apply take forever to get through but then what about like

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.440
 medium-sized companies that

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.720
 Where it's like more chaotic. Yeah, I guess it's like I wasn't gonna create weeks of problems

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.400
 Oh, it's gonna be yeah economic prop like impact is it's gonna be a long tail of all this

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.720
 I'm hoping like flights. They're just such a sensitive thing

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.760
 I'm hoping like the ripple effect settles down over the next few days selfishly because literally like Monday

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.000
 I'm gonna be going into an airport and if this gets worse and like the cascading effect

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.280
 I don't know like it might it might all the cancellations create this crazy disruption that just

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.560
 Obviously snowballs, so I don't know we'll see that that sucks to be I just got back

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.800
 I just was on a flight like I dodged this there's all these people in Seattle right now at the hero summit that we're flying out today

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:16.080
 Oh, sorry guys that sucks. I'm glad I left really planes. I went down few planes that exploded in mid-air

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:23.440
 Yeah, it's just it's just so funny cuz all of these companies are so

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.840
 annoying about

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:32.600
 Security and compliance and like like doing anything at these companies is impossible and like they install antivirus on like

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.000
 Everything including like server. It's just like really crazy how annoying they are about this stuff

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.720
 But they like because of their annoying this they create this

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:48.120
 crazy central point of failure which wouldn't exist otherwise and it creates this like massive thing so yeah

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.240
 Yeah, it's just it's a classic thing like chasing perfect stability ends up exposing you like you do like a black

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.120
 Swan thing. I already sought to let tweet this morning. Oh, really?

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.500
 Like yeah, it's basically just like all his work just

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.560
 Codified into like a single single thing. Yeah, I don't want to get distracted and look it up

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.700
 Can you just tell me kind of what he said? No, I think he just look at just a quick comment on like yeah

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.240
 It's like the fragility of deprivation or something. Yeah, yeah

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:25.160
 Yeah, it does make you realize like I feel in my personal life sometimes like I've got things that are to house the cards

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.320
 The like it's just all very fragile with my whatever my work set up or my yeah, likewise just different stuff

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.380
 Yeah, but then you realize like on a global scale how easy it would be for these kind of events

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:45.240
 It's actually surprising. They don't happen more often like just the whole open source meme like the little little like peg

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.680
 That's holding up the giant stone right sculpture. I'm surprised. We don't see more

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.080
 Like negative effects of the realities of open source because the whole world's both on top of it at this point

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.480
 Yeah

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.400
 It's surprising how competent people are like, you know how there's always this is a commitment to sound really random

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.160
 there is a lot of

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.640
 fiction content about

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.920
 People piloting giant robots. Mm-hmm. Right like you've seen this before like Pacific Rim or like any of the anime things

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.000
 And then like in these things you see like the robots get hit and damage and stuff and I'm like

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.520
 I'm pretty sure of one wire gets removed like the whole thing doesn't work right like isn't that how yeah

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.000
 Like if I remove one thing from my computer the whole thing doesn't work

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 So how do you even build something like that huh?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.760
 And I think about like data centers and stuff and it's like are there really no singular wires

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:41.760
 It's a monkey just like trip on like pull that just shuts off the whole thing like every single thing is redundant redundant or like

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.040
 You know like that cell thing. We're like yeah, maybe stuff entirely goes down

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.040
 But it's like a small unit in the larger. Yeah, it's really wild to imagine stuff like that

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.640
 I think you compare it to our bodies, which are so different. You can literally lop off someone's arm and they could be fine

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:02.800
 Yeah, you can have it. It doesn't really work properly and it's like so different than anything

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.760
 Technical that we build it's like so much more resilient. Yeah, I make some realize like it's like a totally different thing

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.080
 Yeah

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.440
 Wow, it's so different. I do feel like I mean I just came from an AWS hero summit

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.760
 So I've been drinking the AWS clue a pretty hard

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:23.400
 I do feel like modern cloud stuff has done a good job with redundancy and with resiliency like it's really amazing

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:29.840
 It really is like how much I mean we joke about USC one going down and that can create real issues for businesses and it does and it has

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.800
 But largely the multi-region just a crazy

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:39.200
 Infrastructure that AWS has built this point. It's pretty resilient for I mean

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.160
 I'm a big fan. I don't know. I build everything on it

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.400
 So it's hard for me to have an unbiased opinion, but like that we have these tools in 2024 feels pretty good

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:56.240
 Yeah, and it's it's I think it's interesting that the big like they're able to maintain that despite growing more and more and more

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.800
 Like you think of any startup that people have worked at

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.880
 Experiencing hypergrowth like everything just starts like unfastened and like

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.280
 Yeah, loosen and like things are really chaotic and kind of broken you might go from really polished

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.680
 Customer support experience like much shittier customer support experience cuz like everything's on fire

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.760
 So like they're growing at a pace at a crazy scale

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.000
 but

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.240
 Things are relatively like kind of stable for yeah, the end user like of course

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.040
 I still like downtime or whatever, but the scale they're operating at it is kind of wild and you look at

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.920
 some like next gen competitors like fly who have struggled a lot more like they're

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:43.000
 Operating a much smaller scale, but I've had like much worse. Yeah, reliability issues and and things like that

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.280
 So yeah, it is wild that like every single day there's a chance for it to completely go wrong and like on most days

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.440
 It doesn't yeah

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.440
 Yeah, so it's a I don't know. This is so far removed from that like I mean

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.640
 Just this situation is just a reminder that like

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.640
 Most of the world is operating off cloud or most of the world is operating on these like very traditional IT practices

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.920
 I guess I don't know they might be using cloud stuff, but like they all just have big fleets of Windows machines and

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.560
 They install stuff on it probably in traditional ways and then stuff can go wrong

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.800
 I guess this situation with CrowdStrike was it was like an over-the-air update kind of thing, right?

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.940
 These are connected systems that just got some update that

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.160
 Just borked everything. I've looked at like a little bit of the technical details

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:35.480
 We're just kind of understood what's happening and I thought like this is actually a tangent. I've considered like doing TikTok stuff

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.360
 Where I just tried to explain because I live in the Ozarks like I talked to a lot of non-technical people most everyone I interact with

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.880
 Here in the Ozarks is non-technical and I feel like I've developed the ability to speak to

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:52.720
 Non-technical people about technical things and I thought about like doing TikToks where I try to like break down events that happen where there's IT stuff or

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.240
 Technology developer stuff involved that are in the pop culture and like try to explain it

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.520
 And with this one, I just don't know if there's an interesting thing

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.360
 Like this is the first event that's come up since I thought I might do that where I'm like, hey

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.400
 The world is thinking about technology. I could talk about this and I'm like, I don't know

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.200
 Is it really anything interesting to describe to a normie like you just have to get into the weeds

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:17.960
 I think so. I mean people might literally think that this is like a hack, you know, that's true thing is like it's so I

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:24.800
 Can see how if you don't know anything about this world it feels so like an intentional hack is like

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:32.680
 Everything is down that it feels like how can everything be down. Yeah, it's kind of interesting to learn that. It's actually just due to an accident. Yeah, which is

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:38.280
 Yeah, that's the point to imagine that accident can create this big of an impact. Hang on. I'm gonna make you TikTok. Bear back

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.200
 I just realized I have funny stories from when I did IT work

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.560
 Like I used to work in an office before I got my first real programming job

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:54.320
 I was doing like normal networking and IT stuff like managing active directory and all this nonsense at like a little office with like

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.320
 25 employees and

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:02.600
 I joke about Sally and accounting there really was a lady in accounting that did some of the most hilarious like

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:09.680
 Just its stories from the IT front lines that you just can you can hardly believe but she one day she came in and said

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.760
 That her computer ate her

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.440
 The disc she was trying to put it like some kind of CD

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:21.000
 Rom kind of like software disc, but it ate it. I was like, what do you mean? What do you mean it ate it?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.240
 Like she's like it won't it's not there like it ate it. She's stuck it between the two drives

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:32.820
 Like there's a gap between it's like she didn't open the drive and put the disc in she like shoved it through into the computer case

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:38.160
 Yeah, so it really did eat it. It's just like they will do any and everything. We're able to get it out

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.160
 Yeah, I had to like open up the case

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.560
 Dig out the CD round there or disc

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:49.480
 So people are not smart about computers. Well, it's funny cuz I think we can all

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:57.120
 Relate to that to some degree cuz I think the underlying thing is you're directly using this thing every day for your work

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.560
 but you have no idea how it's working under the hood at all that's the most basic degree and that feels really weird like how can

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.160
 How can you operate like that? Aren't you confused or curious but then you think about?

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:14.400
 Being in a big building. You're not like I understand exactly how this floor is being suspended, you know a hundred feet off

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.800
 You never even think about it. So it's probably how people feel about computers

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.920
 I mean, there's lots of stuff in software that I would say is true like that for me

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.360
 Like just things that I just assume they were if you go lower level

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.200
 Yeah, and I just don't consider that at all

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:28.560
 Yeah

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.560
 But I think you can probably like guess how they work or like you don't know the technical details like it's yeah

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.760
 Because it things work the same way no matter how

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.440
 What level is that you're in it's like maybe simpler, but yeah, hopefully the rules are the same

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.120
 But yeah, we just assume that things are gonna work and it's only the bill and building collapses, you know

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.560
 Why am I laughing at buildings clapping?

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.800
 You say like horrible things and I'm like

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:58.720
 Haven't told you this annoying thing. Do you remember that building collapse in surfside floor in Miami here?

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.520
 No, yeah, there's a good there's this recent a couple years ago. It was funny

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.400
 I was on a plane when it happened going to Miami flying over it

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:14.480
 It there's a building by the beach that collapsed like a hundred percent collapsed. We just went down to a lot of people died

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.480
 And it was it was pretty horrific

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.080
 and this has happened a bunch of times in

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.360
 Miami, there's just like a weird dynamic with

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:29.480
 People cutting corners and the difficulty of building stuff in like a very salty environment on the beach and stuff

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:36.720
 But it was so horrifying that it triggered inspections like around the

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:42.440
 world like literally all these buildings were like oh shit like we got to check our stuff and

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.160
 Our apartment in New York the building was like okay. We had doing inspection

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:54.880
 They didn't inspection and it's now my monthly bill was in my monthly like maintenance fee got increased by like two or three hundred bucks

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:02.480
 Because they were like some of these balconies have like a little bit of concrete where some of the concrete like maybe you could like

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.200
 Fall on like someone walking by and I was like

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:12.600
 God damn it like now I'm paying more money because of this random building that fell down in wow in Miami

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:20.280
 So again another example of how interconnected everything is yeah, it's entropy. It's it's a we talked

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.440
 But it should be a little bit last time, right? Yeah. Yeah, it's a the boys

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:31.160
 I want to know that they don't want to stay together. They want to yeah, everything's moving towards all part chaos

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.720
 Yeah, yeah, it is kind of a wonder but

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:39.040
 We don't have more giant events that shake our foundations

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.120
 I mean, this is like one of those kind of things where it's like

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.760
 I don't we have no idea what the ramifications are gonna be I feel like

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.760
 The the global GDP and fact or whatever is probably insane

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.880
 Yeah, it's wild like if you're at one of these companies you are not working today, right?

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.240
 And that's like so many companies

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.420
 Yeah, I know this is a reminder to that Windows has this crazy like footprint in

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:08.640
 The enterprise or whatever and it's kind of always gonna be there. I still just feel like most of that is fake

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.640
 I just feel like most of the economy is fake

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.500
 Like all these people that are sitting around the office like laughing about how they got a blue screen and they don't have to work today

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.620
 I don't know. Are we really gonna notice what they didn't do today? Probably not

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:24.120
 No, I think I think that is largely true

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:30.000
 it's just that all this like security and like spyware stuff that these companies install it's so funny to me because

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.740
 So these the latest M3 MacBook Pro like part of the one of the fastest machines you can get

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:43.280
 That exists period you take one of those and put it in a corporate environment and they install all their stuff on it

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:50.000
 It literally becomes the slowest machine you have ever used. It's crazy. How like like horribly

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.680
 Intrusive and performance impacting these yeah, these things are like it it is

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.640
 impossible to work on this stuff and

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.720
 Yeah, you know working on SST

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.880
 We're like so obsessed with the back loops like we got to make sure we change our code like stuff was reflected

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:12.160
 and like if you have to restart something that really sucks and like we like it's it's like such a focus and then we talked to

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.280
 some of these like giant enterprisey companies that are using

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.160
 SST and they like don't even use live lambda because they're like

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.280
 That doesn't even make sense for them. They're like, oh, no when we make a change

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.760
 We just push it to an environment and someone else like checks to see if it works

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:37.200
 Yeah, and that's a feedback loop. It's a good several day feedback loop for every code change. There is no like a local development

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:43.640
 It's just like it's it's really wild how different a lot of the world will operate and for me

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:49.720
 I'm just like if I don't if I can't get a feedback cycle and like an under one second. It's like unusable. Yeah

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.200
 It's nuts

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.680
 Yeah, the tiny team thing I think like the contrast between

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:02.920
 These giant companies and what I know little tiny teams can do today is also brought to mind just I

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.380
 Mean like that situation you just described. I just can't even imagine working in a

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:14.980
 Working for most of the day. Yeah, which is kind of awesome if you don't want to work at all. Well, yeah, I guess there's that

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:21.760
 It probably used to suck when you had to be in the office because then you don't have any work to do all day

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.840
 You're sitting at your desk being like, oh, yeah, yeah, what do you do home and you can do whatever you want?

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:33.040
 And this is like this is like wow what a it's like a snow day. We've gotten to as a species. Yeah, it's a good snow day every day for them

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:41.200
 I just if the hero summit sitting around like at a table with a bunch of other heroes talking about

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.680
 Their work or consulting or whatever

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.040
 It was interesting to hear the contrast like so few people work

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:53.520
 With or on little tiny teams and it's just the vast majority of people

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.480
 They're used to oh, it's a different person that deploys your infrastructure

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:05.200
 It's an ops team or whatever and you're just a little programmer and you write the application code and I that's just so foreign to me

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.280
 It just seems so bizarre that everyone doesn't know

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.600
 It's just better if like one person does all of it or like three people do all of it

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:19.920
 Like that just seems objectively better to me and it's very hard to imagine a scenario where like I'd want to be in an environment like that

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.520
 And we run to this problem at SST because we will never sell

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:31.120
 DevOps person because we're really taking away their job. We're saying like stop doing your job and get your responsibility as someone else

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.400
 So like no like bigger companies are very resistant to something like this

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:42.880
 It's okay if the only way it can work is if the application developer finds SST on their own

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.000
 And they like start to do stuff and realize they can do this stuff and at that point

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.560
 It's bottom up and there's really no stopping it

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.280
 But like yeah, you're never

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.760
 Like these teams want to stay the status quo to say the same

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.240
 Yeah, like, you know, that's that's how the jobs are allocated

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:06.320
 Yeah, it is really weird, but I'm reminded that like there is a place for giant. No, there is like teams

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.880
 Yeah, like SST you guys the three of you couldn't make AWS like there's just like no

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.840
 We couldn't there's problems that can't be solved with small teams

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:20.640
 And maybe AWS is really onto something with their little two pizza team thing like they do have small teams within the broader organization

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:25.440
 So they can all kind of like can be smaller though. I think every company can be smaller. Yeah, sure

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.240
 uh

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.840
 I think yeah, it's funny like the counter to this. I think

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:40.320
 The small team thing is um, there's so much focus on building tools for other SaaS companies like other companies like building SaaS products

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.760
 Like yeah, almost all the dev tools stuff focuses there, but that's that's like a really stupid market

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.160
 and it's like

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.840
 It's so speculative like most of it doesn't work out like it's being impacted a lot right now with

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.920
 I don't know. It's just such like a fringe market

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.000
 And then you think and I look at some of our ST users like some of the bigger ones and they're just like

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:06.880
 Not related to SaaS at all like yeah, people keep building these SaaS starter kits to build more SaaS

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.960
 but like most of the audience is like

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:16.480
 some random insurance company some like mid-size insurance company in the mid-west like they're using SSC to

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.440
 do their infrastructure and like

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.480
 Yeah, they're just like not in this world at all and they're tied to like a physical

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.760
 Real-world need that's not going to shift so violently when when stuff changes

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.840
 So yeah, the money you get from serving those customers is like is is like much more stable and better

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:40.080
 There's been murmurs of I mean you've talked about on twitter just the the zerp era the the long tail effects

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.560
 It's like this whole dev tool space is sort of like trailing behind but

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:50.880
 Feels very much like it's all built on a house cards. That's gonna collapse. Yeah, I got I got some confirmation that

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:56.400
 The theory that a lot of these like dev tool companies that have raised a bunch of money

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.800
 It's kind of painfully obvious on the outside that yeah, they're doing

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.480
 They're just getting like casual hobby users

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.440
 Yeah, and even even if you include those the numbers don't look that great in terms of adoption

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.680
 Yeah, but you imagine okay, maybe you're wrong and like there's actually is like

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:21.600
 Better traction than you think but there isn't like it is as simple as I've gotten some confirmation from a few internal company numbers that

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.600
 They're having a very hard time converting this group because it's very early stage

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.960
 Engineers that are like at the top of their funnel. They don't they're not really making a big decision on like

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.760
 Yeah, actually buying this product for a meaningful company

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:41.920
 If only 1% of your users actually fall into this monetizable bucket like you have to be so so so big to justify all this and it just

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.400
 Yeah, it's just not happening. Yeah, I I saw someone tweet. It's like a notable

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:54.080
 We'll say email startup that tweeted like they're statistics for deliverability and how they beat their competitors and it just cracks me up

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.480
 Because they're literally it's just ses. You're just like quoting ses numbers

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.040
 You're quoting the ses deliverability numbers like you don't need to exist people

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.800
 Like all these like third layer. I call it third layer. I don't know. It's not actually that's made up

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.680
 But like this next level of abstraction on top of cloud that just feels so

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.280
 Unnecessary to me. It just feels like

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.800
 There's so many startups now that have wrapped a few AWS services and I used to think that was a good idea

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.520
 I no longer believe that's a good idea. It just feels like

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.920
 Those startups are going to be the first to go when it all crumbles. I don't know

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.160
 There's no point anonymizing them if you're going to say

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:37.840
 Start up built a ton of ses like it's you're talking about recent like everybody knows

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.360
 Well, so what was funny about them is they also released like their handbook

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.520
 Which is like is it how we build companies and think about customers and didn't whatever

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:50.880
 This is like one of the most the biggest signals of like, oh, this is the first time founder

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.280
 You start to do these like company things where you're like, this is how we build stuff and

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.160
 Oh, this is how we think and this is our philosophy and everything

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:04.000
 What's interesting about that stuff is if you hit it out of the park people are going to look back on that and be like

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.600
 Wow, that's amazing. Like look at all this stuff and like whatever

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:12.320
 And if you don't which you likely won't it's going to be really embarrassing because you're like

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.800
 Why were they acting like such a real company when they like we're not anywhere close to pride market fit?

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.080
 And I think once you get experience you're like

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.720
 Okay, I want to make sure that I'm never going to look back on it and be like I was such a

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:30.080
 Stupid idiot like I was so naive. Yeah, because I know I've done stuff like that and oh, yes

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.520
 Acting like a company thing. Um, yeah, and I'm a first-time fan

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.480
 I feel like I'll never not be a first-time fan or because I'll probably never have another startup

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.400
 Like we've had a startup going for 10 years

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.280
 But I'm still a first-time founder is just over 10 years

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:46.640
 I guess you start to like learn some things. Yeah, see previous versions of yourself, uh, and it's really embarrassing

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.320
 Hey, could you could you now go into the thing?

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.400
 It's been shelved in my brain like I get stashed. It's it's funny because like we keep it out

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.960
 There's like build up. I was just stupid comment. Oh, okay

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.000
 I was gonna say I kept imagining this hero summit thing

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.320
 I've like and like the image I got was like all of you like around a big round table and some kind of like

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:11.360
 Big like fancy like it kind of it was like futuristic and modern but has like throwback to like the roman empire

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.400
 So like that kind of like vibe. Uh-huh and then I imagine just like

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.960
 breaking through the ceiling in like a spaceship and being like just like

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:23.920
 I don't know. Just kind of like villain situation around like laughing people. Yeah

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:29.920
 Uh, it had to be a pretty big table. There were 190 of us. So I mean that is a lot. Wow

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.400
 So many heroes it was a lot it was surprising to see us in a room like there's a lot of them

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.480
 Yeah, and they all went yeah, and there's people I know in the heroes program

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.360
 Like have met at reinvent spent time with enjoy and didn't even get to see them

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.080
 We all went to Seattle. They were there and there's like a handful of people. I'm like I didn't even see

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:55.120
 I'm like I say names, but like literally just it was that many people and there's just that little time

00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:00.880
 I guess that's another topic, but no, you know what they say if everyone's a hero. No one's a hero. That's true

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.080
 It's true

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.600
 No heroes. Let's let's uh is it time to bring chris on? I feel like we're budgeting here an hour. Yeah

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:16.000
 It is episode 100 and I don't know. I've made a big deal of it. I'm trying not to be weird and make a big deal of it

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.600
 You're being weird. It's a big deal. Well, I've not been weird because I'm holding back

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.680
 You should have seen like things I could have done like this is me being normal

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.200
 So we're gonna have chris on just uh, I don't actually know what we're gonna do

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.280
 I've thrown out some ideas and to be honest

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.760
 He's probably asked me some questions that I didn't answer

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:37.440
 Uh, but he's gonna come on and we're gonna do a little I don't know a little episode 100 look back if you will

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.440
 While we're waiting for chris just a reminder this episode is brought to you by terminal coffee

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.480
 Go buy coffee ssh terminal dot shop. Did you see our tweets from the account this morning? Yeah, they're so good

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:55.520
 That was so fun. I love having this as a thing that we do. It's just so funny to watch like when you're like

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.080
 Okay, need good ideas

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.800
 Go and it's just like a hundred good ideas

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.760
 Chris is here. Hello. What's up, chris how much what's up with you guys?

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:17.920
 Wow, chris's mic sounds so good not much. Uh, this is this is long overdue. His mic sounds so good

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:22.080
 Is that he said he's a professional? He's a professional. Yeah, we're not professional

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.520
 $60,000 worth of equipment out of my thinking

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:31.280
 I have one microphone. This is a little bit about 10 years ago

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:38.160
 and you can you can't play silver like junk on the floor the one Ted lasso poster

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.200
 That's like my office is being torn apart right now. So

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:47.680
 That's awesome. I have so many questions now like about Ted lasso, but i'm not gonna do that just yet

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.960
 Uh the other podcast

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.760
 I was just telling you I was just telling dax that I don't actually know what we're gonna pull off here

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.480
 Because you probably like asked me questions and I didn't answer them or something

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.880
 Like I just kind of threw some stuff at you

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.000
 Either way I wanted to have you on if we do nothing if we just like talk

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.240
 This is just kind of a moment where you've now edited a hundred episodes of ours

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.600
 You've had to listen to us so much more than any other person really

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.240
 There's no way anyone else is listening every minute. Oh, I thought you meant more than any other person in my life that i've listened to

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.320
 Oh, no, no

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.800
 I'm not trying to say that just that like nobody has heard me in dax talk. Well, I was doing the math. I mean

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.120
 Yeah. Oh, yeah, what's the mask? It's possible

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.880
 It's possible you i've listened to you more than i've listened to my wife, but

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.920
 I hope not

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.560
 I'm so sorry

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.200
 At least you pay me to listen to the episodes pretty quickly

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:42.560
 Like what's your process? Do you like listen to it on 2x speed like yeah, generally like especially audio only podcasts

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.880
 It's like 2x

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:51.040
 And then scrubbing through obviously and jumping back and forth like river side is either really good or sometimes bad

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:55.120
 It's like lining things up even though it's you know local recordings and all that kind of stuff

00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:00.720
 And so with your guys's show it's generally there's like the odd noises or cough or whatever they cut out

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:07.040
 But generally it's like shifting things just so that when adam tells a bad joke and dax laugh 30 seconds later

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.520
 Slightly better

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.560
 Awkward delay

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:22.240
 So it's like fixing that kind of stuff or I was collecting some of the clips and like are just looking listening to some of the random stuff and like

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.840
 They're running meta commentary on like you guys saying chris cut this out and then I include it

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:33.680
 Always and then I was like I think we need like a safe word where it's like no actually really this part

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.800
 No, no, no, no, we don't we don't

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.480
 Just it just never never listen to Adam ever about that

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.440
 Oh

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.640
 What if i'm like i'm gonna get fired if this makes it in the podcast, please

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.840
 Please don't how about that? That's a safe word if I say i'm gonna get fired

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.240
 No, but then you're gonna be

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.120
 Just like there's clips of you like saying you're dying and like

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.800
 It's true. There's not a lot. There's not a lot on this podcast

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.160
 Going back. I kind of forgotten

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.280
 I was like almost like we need to tell it like if back in the old days of podcast

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.360
 And they used to be like fans who'd make like wikipedia pages for a podcast like over that hardcore

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:14.560
 And there'd be there'd be like a running tally of like how many times adam has died and then a reference to the time code

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.400
 Sadly we lost that to the yeah

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:23.680
 But we we did stuff like that. I know I just feel bad that we don't have a wikipedia page. I really wish we did so

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.640
 Full on wikipedia. I think you meant like a private wiki not like

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:36.800
 Maybe one day maybe some day another hundred episodes. We'll see your confidence is always inspiring

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:44.560
 Like when I said in like 20 minutes we could bring you on and then it was like an hour. Yeah like that

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.080
 I'm so sorry

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.520
 I didn't even say like chris is our editor chris edits our podcasts

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.280
 And other podcasts lots of podcasts actually if you're doing a podcast

00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:01.040
 If you listen anything in tech you probably are listening to yeah, you've probably listened to his edits something that chris's fingers have been on

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:07.040
 Yeah, definitely

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.160
 So did chris did you actually like it was there something we were gonna do like did you have

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.440
 You said you you looked through clips. Did you actually find any or are you even able to play them over the podcast here?

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:22.240
 Well, I mean you did ask me to do that. So I I did. Oh wow, that's how this works

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:27.520
 I don't know that's funny

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.320
 It's it's a it is a funny dynamic. I was reflecting on this with a friend

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:34.480
 This sounds like I'm being like passive aggressive like, you know complaining, but I was like, yeah

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.640
 Yeah, yeah, they were like eight o'clock my time. Whatever like eight thirty. Uh, we're still waiting or whatever

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.120
 And then and I was like, but it is this odd dynamic of like I'm you're my client

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:50.000
 So like I can't just like be like hey assholes. You said 80 o'clock. I'm not showing up and then you're like, okay

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 I guess we'll go find a new editor

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.280
 We have all the power

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.920
 It is a funny dynamic experience a little bit over but it's yeah anyways

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.560
 Can I just ask you a question while you're trying to favor this out chris

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.600
 It's a hundred episodes a lot. Have we like reached an actual milestone?

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.160
 I feel like this is a lot. We've done like a lot of episodes

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.400
 It is like a big milestone and it's definitely

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.960
 Like it's it's one of those things like chris coir or one shop duck show often will be like

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:22.240
 It's just kind of fun like round numbers. Whatever it means like 100 500 250

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:27.120
 They're just kind of fun milestones, but obviously it's really meaningless in the big picture. I know it's arbitrary

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:32.000
 So many podcasts don't make it past 10. So it's kind of like that's the like first marker

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.200
 Like you've done, you know, whatever the comparison would be to a marathon or I don't know whatever I don't exercise so

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.480
 I was gonna come on and make a joke about I've done my uh, my ice bath and my sauna. Yeah

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:52.480
 Okay, yeah, I just realized that some of my lights aren't on. You know that kind of stuff bothers me a lot

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.560
 Like a lot

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.560
 But you were like looking at a ghost

00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.960
 No, it's just noticing all four of them are often unbothered. Yeah, okay. Let's see if this works

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:06.640
 Can you you can see look at this doing work? It looks don't don't be so impressive. It's not like I did that much

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.040
 It was just 16 hours of work

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.360
 I think Adam said he's like you can do two hours and we're paying you five bucks

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.600
 Get it done. I'll find someone overseas, chris. You better

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.120
 Better figure it out

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.880
 You get it. That's joke. Actually, you are overseas. You're in Canada, right? I mean

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:30.400
 I don't

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.400
 Over the lake ery or something

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:39.760
 Man, I'm surrounded by so many Canadians. Oh, it's true. They're everywhere in florida. Oh, yeah

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.080
 Florida, especially so many well it used to be like the that was my grandparents were like, yeah

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.000
 We always go to florida. That's where we go in the winter

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.320
 But uh, it's kind of tapered off a bit like we started going to mexico now

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.680
 I think is the how we say we we've gotten richer we can for the flight past because usually the drive down to florida or it's cheaper

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.480
 Wait, we're we're in Canada. I'm in Saskatchewan is the province. So like the rectangle one right in the middle

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:06.880
 Where should I say my city? Yeah, yeah, don't you go ahead and edit that out. Yeah, would you please cut that out?

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.280
 Now you can't

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.280
 Docs you. Yeah, sorry

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.880
 There really are a lot of Canadians in tech like I feel like

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:23.120
 The tech community my whole business Canadian. Oh, that's actually a ghost is a good segue. This is a good thing

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:27.600
 It's creepy man yesterday

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.840
 Liz went to the bathroom

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:35.760
 And then she went back to the bathroom a minute later to get something and she was like the toilet seats up all the way

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.360
 There's no way that I would have left it up. So that must have been a ghost

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:44.480
 Okay, it's a ghost update

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.200
 I totally forgot about that

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:54.000
 I literally have no memory of that outside of listening to that. That's really funny

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:01.600
 Like all this stuff because you just like cavalies memories that you would have found otherwise. Yeah, I mean, I don't think we've seen the ghost again

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.320
 But still, you know, obviously liz could not have left the toilet seat up that could not have been hurt. It's impossible

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:12.640
 So it must have been a one-time ghost does your dog zuko? Does he go into the toilet for water? Oh?

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.840
 No, can he lift it up with his nose and take a drink?

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:19.440
 Our cats like doing this crazy maneuver where they like

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:23.680
 Strouded the toilet and then try to drink and then they drink from it, which is very annoying

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:29.040
 Uh, but no none of them can love the toilet. So no, I got another follow just wait

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.440
 Maybe you're gonna ask this Adam because I just let me play the clip

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:39.920
 Is that a list thing? Let's just say that's a list thing. No, it's not. You know, it's like it's explicitly not a list thing

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.600
 Uh, these are two cats. I had with my previous girlfriend

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.480
 That's I retained

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.480
 Well, now you definitely need to get rid of them

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:54.960
 No good reason to have cats especially now to tie to a previous relationship. Well, what am I gonna do?

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.680
 Kill them

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.840
 Cats just like they wander around just like don't let them back in the house. They're not

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 Never been outdoors really they're indoor cats

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.760
 Was like eating that's classic if I was just eating and had a cold

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.400
 What's really funny is

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:18.640
 Without any context Adam sounds like a horrible person. I do. I don't even with context really

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.440
 Just leave the cats outside. Yeah

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.920
 Oh wow, that's really

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:30.880
 Can't tell you're joking at all. Yeah, it didn't sound very jokey. I did so I was eating eating something

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 You said and you had a cold yeah

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.320
 I have the podcast episodes you get on. I'm like, are you okay?

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.080
 Are you not usually not? Yeah, that's what I had a note on that one who's like

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.840
 Adam has a cold and I feel like Adam is the one who gets sick more often decks

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.760
 Which is funny because Adam is perceived to be like this hyper vigilant

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.480
 Yeah, you know cold plunge dude

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:56.880
 That's where he gets a cold front

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.800
 But I know as a parent I know it's kids because they're like this this awful vector

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:08.160
 I'm assuming cats and dogs don't bring sickness to humans the same way that kids managed. Oh, yeah kids

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.880
 It's crazy. I've got three kids at camp this week that I'm picking up today

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.600
 And I know I'm gonna be deathly ill on Sunday. So yeah, you can just predict my case thing

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.120
 I talk about all the time. It's like uh, he's been playing all day with the kids like well

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.920
 Let's just get ready. Everyone's getting sick in like three days

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.160
 It does get better like my kids are older than yours

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.200
 And so they do learn how to like wash their hands or it's nice. You know, the people snotted whatever they do

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:43.600
 I've seen things. Let's see things like that. Oh, okay. This is one. I wanted to ask you about okay episode 66

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.600
 We're going back to uh, I don't have the date put it ever

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:50.400
 13,000 tweets or 13,000 views on this tweet. Do you know what it might be?

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:55.520
 Adam's tweet. Is it a coffee one? Not the coffee. Oh, I forgot what the coffee one

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:59.840
 They're using coffee wrong one. No, it's not that one. That was like an early one. That was really bad

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.440
 Anyway, okay

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.600
 It's funny. You should be saying this out of the photo. You posted yesterday

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.640
 All right, close on

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.280
 There's a lot of implication is all

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:18.000
 What is that? I don't know what that means. Okay. Here's the thing. It was drying off of the towel

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.480
 But it was like a sexy photo because like you knew you were naked but it was okay

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.120
 Here's the thing

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:29.040
 The implication of being naked is more sexual than being naked

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:32.720
 But it wasn't an implication of being naked because I'm very clearly clothed

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.880
 Do you have a photo?

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:39.440
 I have like a a speedo on okay. It didn't look like you had any clothes on you were just like

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.920
 You didn't think I had anything on but even a speedo Adam is like the implication of being naked

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:50.880
 No, I just that's how I get myself. I get it, but like you get what I mean, right like the implication of being naked. I see

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:56.640
 Yeah, it's funny that I'm trying to defend that I was clothed when I was wearing a speedo

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.720
 Like I really hammered that I had clothes on

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.680
 Why would you think I'm naked in a speedo?

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.640
 Oh my word

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.440
 As funny as I was listening to the clip of that like the audio and I was like I forgot what the tweet was the picture

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:11.680
 And then I look a little picture. I'm like what how did you just look took

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.520
 I feel like this is what listeners may be it. Maybe it may be just me

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:20.800
 But like listeners might be wondering like there's like naive adam sometimes on the show

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.680
 Is that a character or is that legit?

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:28.960
 I don't I look at that picture. I'm like there's no way you didn't know you're like googled

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.920
 How do I post thirst trap after ice plunge and they're like, this is the picture

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:39.600
 And then you come on the podcast you're like

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.640
 That's full of shit. I

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.160
 Don't think it's a character. I mean, I don't think I'm like pretending to be naive

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.480
 I think I am very naive in that particular instance

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.440
 I think I was just hung up on him calling me naked like that I was completely naked and I wasn't naked to be fair

00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:01.200
 My points like the point one that you yet no in retrospect. I get the point I do

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.040
 I don't know why I went through that era. I did go through an era of posting a lot of like

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:12.000
 Body photos and I don't know that it's kind of embarrassing now for some reason that it wasn't embarrassing then and now it's embarrassing

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.480
 I don't know something changed. I've grown. That's all

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:21.280
 Scrolling it was fantastic and the whole world is glad you went through that phase. Okay. I know he's upset about that

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:27.440
 It is funny when I was looking at the tweet now. I don't know if you I'm sure you you've gone back every month or so to see if there's

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:36.640
 Every like there's like there's three replies. I think that it was shown and then everything after that was like possible spams possible

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:41.840
 Whatever and they weren't like anything bad. It wasn't like people were like actually saying stuff

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.920
 I was just like even Twitter algorithm knew it was like this is a first trap

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.040
 We might get some nasty

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:55.120
 I gotta say about the thirst trap thing and that this is not me being naive

00:40:55.120 --> 00:41:01.520
 I posted a photo of just I was wearing a new rash guard I got for jiu-jitsu and people there were several people that were like

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.400
 Just like this is a subtle thirst trap

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.960
 Can I can you be fit and post a photo yourself and it not be a thirst trap? Like I'm just I'm in good shape

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.200
 It's fine. Like if I post a photo of me. Is it always a thirst trap? Just because I'm in good shape. Is that it?

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:19.200
 I did laugh really hard at milky's comment on that one when he was like chadam who was his content for?

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:28.480
 I don't like to me. It's just like it's a cool looking rash guard. I don't know. I think if you're like

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:35.760
 uh without context it comes off like tech tweet tech tweet astra is great and then like here's my chest

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:41.760
 And like I hate tailwind or whatever like so if you're like muscle dude

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.480
 Instagram influencer dude like nobody would be like oh thirst trap but like yeah

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.200
 context is everything

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.760
 Yeah, I just want to be myself. I just want to be a whole person. This is what uh joe hook says

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:57.040
 It's okay to be a whole person and I'm I never think about like

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.360
 I don't know filtering to like a certain group of people that care about certain things

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.680
 I just like I want to say what I want to say you know what I mean?

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.760
 Is that weird? No, it's not and you shouldn't change because this is perfect

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:11.600
 You get to be yourself and everyone gets to enjoy making fun of you

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:18.480
 It's like beautiful. I guess it's a symbiotic relationship. Yeah. Okay. Like nobody wishes you didn't post that. We wish we would do that more often

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.640
 Okay

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.360
 All right, this is not talk about my thirst traps or whatever

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:29.760
 Um episode 30 is back like june 2023. I don't even actually remember what the clip is

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.080
 But it says adam finds out something shocking about dax. Do you remember what it was?

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.920
 Do you have any

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.440
 It's like if you're any clue

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.960
 2023

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.560
 It's like a year ago

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.560
 Yeah, damn

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:46.160
 I can't I can't think of what it would be this for the wikipedia entry

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.000
 This is the first appearance of lara bars. How did you know how you say that lara bars?

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.120
 Yeah, lara bar bar bar bar for the first like 20 episodes

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.680
 If you'd mentioned that I would be like so confusing because I didn't I'd never see

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.880
 I think I remember tweeting you a photo at cost goes like they have them here now or whatever

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:04.480
 And I was like, yeah, this is what you've been talking about. I had no idea what you're talking about. Okay. So this is what's uh adam finds out about dax. Let's see

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:09.120
 TV going on all day all day. I have tv

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.160
 Wait a minute seriously. You didn't know this maybe

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:17.440
 No, wait. Hang on wait wait wait wait like cable tv

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:22.400
 No, no, no, just like tv shows. I'll have tv shows going like what kind of tv shows

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:27.280
 Tell me or what channels that's what I remember from tv is like there's channels. Yeah, what channels are you on?

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.280
 No one

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.280
 Okay, so it wasn't that shock

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:38.160
 I don't remember being very surprised that dax watch tv it just seems so not dax

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:44.320
 Like dax is so like sitting in a corner with a book and like just be wise and typically never read

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:50.400
 I like the most not well read person ever

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:55.520
 It's just so seems so against your character. I don't know. How do you get so you know what's great

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.920
 I get this is actually awesome. I get the perception. I get the little benefits from reading

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.200
 Which is people think I read and i'm smart but i'll actually do the reading which is very boring

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.560
 It's pretty cool

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.000
 the tv thing though

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 Yeah, people always find the shock like I was talking with my team about this because frank and j

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.760
 Also recently just kind of understood that that i'm always I always have tv going

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.640
 They found it really weird

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:19.680
 So the way I perceive tv because it's all about quantity because I need something that just fills the whole day constantly

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:24.560
 Like I love when I find a tv show that I can background and has like

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.640
 200 episodes because i'm like okay i'm off to look for a new tv show for a whole week

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:34.560
 My current thing that i'm watching is a show called below deck, which I actually found out later is more popular than I thought

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.840
 It's a reality show about people that work on these like super yachts

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:45.200
 The ones that are for rent so people will come and rent them for a week and you get like seven star service

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.600
 Like you can ask for anything and they're supposed to do it

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:52.400
 And it's like this reality show about the people that work there and like what goes on behind the scenes

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.360
 Just super random but now I know so much about

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.720
 Yachting and boats and like different kinds of knots

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.200
 Like you're actually different kinds of knots

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:05.760
 You're actually like cat you're catching stuff from the show. It's not just in the background like okay

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.320
 So if I like break this down here's why

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:15.120
 This works for me when I work and this has gotten really bad ever since I started doing AWS stuff

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.000
 There's so much pausing because i'm waiting for a cloud formation or whatever

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:23.600
 Oh, yeah, there's moments when I work where there's opportunities for distraction and some waiting for something

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:30.160
 There's some kinds of distraction that is like potentially endless and you'll get distracted for where you tended for five minutes

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.720
 It's only an hour goes by for example like opening twitter

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.840
 And there's other kinds of distraction that's very easily controlled

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.800
 So

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.520
 If I constantly have tv going when i'm waiting for something I just turn my head and then watch the tv

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:46.560
 Yeah, and it's not like so engrossing that i'm like gonna forget what I was doing. I could see that

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.800
 Yeah, but I've also gotten very good at just listening to it on the background and like also

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.840
 Ingesting i've been doing this for like super long now

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:59.440
 I gotta ask if you tried music that's like the typical thing that developers do music works too

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.920
 I guess you can't really focus on it. I don't ever like

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:07.920
 Distract myself with it in fact I still open browser tabs to distract myself while i'm listening to music

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:13.920
 Waiting on something so yeah, I get it. Okay. I guess me. It's like a mag is a good channel for my distraction. That is safe

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.960
 Yeah, no, I get it. Let's see quickly on speaking movies

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:21.520
 Our movies good. I think movies are bad now. Okay. First of all, I watch movies all the time

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:27.280
 You know, I like just consume a crazy amount of stuff too. Do you see you watch them? I thought you never watch movies

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:31.440
 This is like I don't and my wife and I decided last night to watch a movie

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:36.960
 Yes, and it was it was just a giant waste of time. What was it like an hour in she was on her phone

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:42.000
 I don't know what it was called. It was a it was a netflix movie. It was like, what's the girl?

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.480
 She's on the office. I think

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.720
 Unbreakable Kimmy shimmy shimmy shimmy. Yeah, what's her name?

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:52.960
 I remember this something she was in it. They went like hiking. This made me sound. I don't know

00:46:52.960 --> 00:47:00.320
 You watch a movie like once a year and you just chose some random netflix movie

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.400
 So, okay, here's the thing from my point of view

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.040
 I've seen a lot of movies

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:09.840
 So when I want to watch a movie, it's a struggle because like there's not all the stuff that's really good

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:14.320
 I've seen you on the other hand. You haven't seen anything. So you have you have this gift

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:19.120
 You have this gift where there's just like thousands of incredible films for you to watch and then

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:24.240
 I remember that one. I do remember so then that conversation. I don't have the clip

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:28.560
 So we won't go into it, but like the 60 hundred thousand dollar balance system TV

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.320
 Thing you talk about and I'm just like is there any amount?

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:37.120
 Is there a bigger waste of technology on someone who is like

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.040
 This is where I lose you as a client I guess

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.920
 I'm gonna burn it down as I go

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:48.640
 I've since watched some good movies on the equipment

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.960
 I mean, I've taken advantage of it a little bit

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.400
 But mostly just because dax made fun of me. That was a turning point for me

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.840
 I started filtering my content. Wow saying I'm only gonna consume good stuff

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:04.720
 So lives have been changed by the podcast. It really has at least mine. No, but you know what happened that happened and then he was like

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:10.560
 Okay, I'm going to watch some good stuff now, but before I watch good stuff. Let me build this like absurd theater in my house

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.400
 And then I can watch the good stuff of course

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.120
 You're very close in between. Yeah, yeah trajectory

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:20.640
 Got to rebuild my blog. You're like the guy who would go like you're about to go skiing for the first time in your life

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.000
 So you order like whatever the most expensive best year is

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.800
 You can show

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.960
 I hate it. I don't want to be that way, but I am

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:33.600
 It's true. Okay one more clip and then uh, we'll run off. I guess but like you're okay

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.560
 Like my twitter, uh, I've always sounded

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:46.240
 Like a jerk in writing versus like if you meet me in person like i'm a mid-westerner. I'm pretty like low

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.200
 conflict iq

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:59.360
 That's classic bags right there

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.360
 Oh, that's good

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.600
 Like again now you guys have met was that the first time in Miami you guys actually met in person?

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.560
 Or was there something before that we met in re-advent in las vegas

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:13.920
 Yeah, that's first time. Okay, which episode was that was that we met three times total super early was from no

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.920
 That clip was from the 70s somewhere

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:20.480
 I forgot a lot of here the going back to the character versus reality question

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:26.240
 And this is often podcasters how they work like you definitely have a persona when you're recording a conversation with somebody

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.400
 That you know someone else is gonna list or you can have a persona

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:35.840
 So is the jerk on the podcast the reality or which where's reality if I if I was to interview your your wife

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.800
 Let's say this is for both of you actually yeah your wives

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:44.560
 About you and the version they hear on the podcast would they be like that's like divorced from reality?

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.800
 Yeah, no

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.000
 Somewhere in the mix

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 Casey actually wanted to come on

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.720
 Soon to do this same thing when I told her what we were doing with you

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.000
 She's like i'd like to have some commentary on things you've said that you just forgot

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.760
 Like i'll say something like I just learned this and she's like no you've learned that like three years ago

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.680
 So there's definitely like parts of me that are way more overdramatic

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:09.200
 And that's what she would say is just i'm like i'm more dramatic, but it's mostly it's me. I think it's me

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.440
 Dax. I think for me. There's no difference. I think this is literally how I am

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:18.160
 I actually agree. I agree 100. This is how you are. I've been around you enough now

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:23.440
 There's always looking for the opportunity to make fun and i've been very consistent in that across all mediums

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.640
 So yeah, it's true twitter

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.280
 Twitch all of it. Yeah, the podcast

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:35.040
 It's true. Yeah, I mean the comment list had the other day and we replied to something and she was like for her

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.120
 It's frustrating to listen to the podcast because

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:41.840
 Uh one is extremely boring because i'm like rehashing things that i've talked to her about

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:45.680
 It's like i've heard people say that about our podcast too. It's i don't know

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:51.200
 Yeah, but i like refined something with her and then

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:57.600
 I like present it in a more polished way in the podcast. So it's kind of boring or she'll want to interject and be like

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:03.040
 Yeah, actually Dax is saying this wrong or like she has a thought and it just she just doesn't listen

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.120
 For that reason. Yeah, that's kacie

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.840
 She said the same thing that she just can't because she drives her crazy

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:12.800
 She just wants to like correct things i say that i misrepresent or things i forgot or i lie about or whatever

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:16.960
 She's just like screaming at the podcast like no, don't say that you said this

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.960
 Yeah, she can't she can't i feel watching you on twitch also watching

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.760
 I maybe i am just an actor maybe i'm just pretending to be something i'm not your ei

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.240
 Maybe i'm not sure

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:34.080
 It's possible that the real adam has put on the podcast right now to make us think have you guys seen x machina?

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.800
 No, it's on my list though. Me too. It's on my list. Yeah

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:43.280
 I just can't even tell us antidote now. I'm like something this movie is very old people

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:49.440
 I'm ashamed that i haven't seen it yet. I i'm ashamed for you chris canadians

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.720
 It's a good movie. I think it's a little overrated but it's it's worth watching okay kryptic tweets

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:59.200
 One question kryptic that's out of dax sorry dax is the one with kryptic tweets that adam

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:03.600
 There's recurring segment adam asking dax about tweets. So i put a thing in the chat

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:08.880
 Dax replied to something i was like trying to channel my best dax tweets

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.360
 style tweet about like

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:17.440
 I forget what my original tweet was something about like mocking programmers who are complaining about using too many video editors or something like that

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:23.040
 Or i can't remember what this thing was. I was trying to like be a little bit snarky because my persona on twitter is definitely like

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:26.400
 I'm friendly, but i'm a little bit sarcastic, but not never mean or whatever

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:30.800
 Yeah, and dax like the only person who replied to it was dax. He just said wtf

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:37.360
 And like i literally sat there for like this is again i guess putting to the uh wisdom or whatever of dax's like sharp thing

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.840
 He's just like i don't know how much thought you gave to that but it was like i sat for like 20 minutes like

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:46.720
 Did i just piss him off so badly and i don't even i wasn't even thinking of him at all

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:49.440
 And i was like do i like

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.480
 It's kind of when it was crisis of like did i just lose my client

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.960
 And i like

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.520
 Through that to like oh no that's just his let's just make that

00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:01.680
 Oh, I literally thought you were making a joke about our coffee thing

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.200
 Because you were like

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:08.480
 Sometimes the cool kids are software developers who really need their interface to be difficult or to use your counterintuitive

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.960
 I'm like oh that sounds like terminal

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:16.960
 This is a really good example though

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:23.120
 Just text communication is not the best yeah impossible in my head like this is so clear like this is so clear

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.560
 Obviously i'm like acting really offended about this

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.720
 That's the only reason i needed to come here so i'm good now

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:36.080
 You're not going anywhere chris another hundred episodes you're not losing any client

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:42.880
