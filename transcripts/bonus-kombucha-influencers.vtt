WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 Oh, do you want to do the thing where we stay on after we say bye?

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.040
 OK, don't you have to pee though?

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.920
 I do have to pee.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.920
 It's like it's when you have to pee, but then it kind of goes away a little bit.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.760
 But it's still there.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.640
 It's not completely gone, but like I could go a little bit longer, you know.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.920
 Did I tell you that I swear I'm just going to change topics entirely?

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.680
 Well, sort of it's about liquids still.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.280
 Did I tell you that I changed kombucha brands?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.520
 What?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.200
 Yes, I'm no longer drinking BT's pineapple.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.600
 I just had the thought the other day, looking at the kombucha aisle, like who buys

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.000
 these other brands of kombucha?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.040
 Like it's GT's.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.920
 That's all there is.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.120
 What are these other companies trying to make a dent?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.320
 Well, one, I don't know who buys it period.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.840
 I feel like it's literally just me.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.320
 That's going there and just buying like large amounts of.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.840
 I never see anyone else in that out.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.520
 Yeah, it's like its own little section.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.400
 Yeah, same, but what are you?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.320
 What are you drinking now?

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.360
 I went to a burger place by me the other day and they had kombucha as an option.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.760
 And I was like, okay, I might as well try it as brand called radiate.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.760
 And it was green apple flavored.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.960
 It tastes like radiate.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.440
 I don't think you're going to be able to get it.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.560
 It's like their headquarters is like a mile away from me.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.080
 It's local to Miami.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.520
 Oh, oh, it's one of those exclusive.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.720
 Yeah, because you know what?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.160
 It's cold pressed.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.480
 It's cold pressed people in real places.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.200
 We have stuff like this.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.960
 I'm buying it.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.600
 I'm going to buy it.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.200
 You can shop on their website.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.840
 Don't think I'm going to be like this green apple flavor.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.000
 I would really enjoy it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.560
 It tastes like a Jolly Rancher almost.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560
 It's just delicious.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.120
 I've already got a 24 pack on the way.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.760
 My friend thinking you're exclusive with your Miami company.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.560
 I get the yeah, I get the 24 pack now.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.920
 I get the 24 pack once a month.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.680
 Me too.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.680
 Turns out.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.120
 Well, I get it same day delivered.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.240
 You only drink one in a month.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.320
 Same day.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.960
 They just walk it over your house.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.160
 It's literally like it's like down one road.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.280
 If you let go down one road for two miles to hit them,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.760
 I actually just want to go pick it up.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.160
 Okay, here's what I want to do actually.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.840
 So they have a wholesale option, right?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.440
 Which I imagine maybe might be like 50% cheaper.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.640
 Well, it's $84 for a 24 pack.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.480
 So I hope so.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.320
 Go ahead.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.320
 $84.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.160
 Is that what it is?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.000
 It's $24 a cans.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.440
 $84.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.920
 Yeah, $34 a can.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.760
 I want to ask them like, hey,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.760
 can I upfront give you cash for like a year's worth?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.680
 Like whatever the minimum wholesale amount.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.520
 Can I give you that?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.040
 But except instead of like selling,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.960
 giving it to me all at once.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.600
 Can you just deliver it like once a month?

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.780
 Like I'll have front play for like a year's supply.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.240
 Like if you can give me like 30% off.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.080
 That's committed.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.440
 You're basically just a retail usage pattern,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.520
 but you want to get the discount, yeah.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.920
 Yeah, but they get the money upfront.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.080
 So, you know, it's a good deal for them.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.400
 I would do it if I were them.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.240
 Well, you think it's half off?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.640
 That's, that'd be incredible.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.480
 I guess.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.080
 This caboose cam was cost like 10 cents to make.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.920
 Like not even.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.760
 Right.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.680
 It's so cheap to make.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.600
 Huh.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.920
 Yeah, I'm like, yeah.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.840
 I'm really curious.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.160
 I'm going to order a case of this.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.920
 Cause this sounds, oh, I mean, anything that's exclusive.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.760
 I get immediately.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.600
 It's not exclusive.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.240
 I never meant to imply it was exclusive.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.080
 I just meant it's local.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.520
 Well, you made it sound like it was only for Miamians.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.760
 Miamians?

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.600
 Miamians.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.680
 Well, it's just convenient.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.480
 Cause here's the other thing.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.360
 I think GT's mastered the shipping.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.720
 Cause like they ship everywhere.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.600
 Like even to the middle of nowhere where you are, you got GT's pineapple.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.600
 Okay.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.120
 Uh, somehow he managed to get it there and it's so fizzy when you drink it.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.120
 I imagine.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.120
 And like it's not.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.120
 It is.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.120
 Not a problem.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.120
 Yeah.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120
 No, it's good.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120
 We have good, we have good GT's kombucha here.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.120
 It's not.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120
 Second rate.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.600
 So I don't know if radiate has figured that out.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.600
 I don't know how.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.000
 Oh, so it might not be as good when it gets here.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 That's what you're trying to say.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.320
 I'm saying if you don't live a mile away, that's fresh, fresh from the tanks.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.120
 When they drop it off, they don't ring my doorbell.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.720
 So there's leave it in the front and it's like warm at that point and I'm like, is this

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.720
 okay?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.720
 It's been fine.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.600
 Like they don't ship it with I drink anything with floating bacteria in it.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.600
 I want it to be cold.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.420
 I get in the fridge pretty quickly, but I wonder if they ship it as far as they ship

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.420
 to you.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.320
 Like are they making sure it's cold the whole time?

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.320
 That's a great question.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.920
 Like it can't leave at room temperature or like outdoor temperature for like two days.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.920
 Can they?

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.920
 No, no.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.640
 Well, we ordered lots of food like we've done meal plans and stuff and they send them in

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.200
 like the big, like dry ice thing, like dry ice.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.200
 Yeah.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.960
 The boys love playing with the dry ice.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960
 I know me too.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.960
 I put in the sink.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.960
 It's a flop.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.960
 You too.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.960
 Yeah.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.960
 I love it.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.960
 Just billows all over.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.960
 Yeah.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.960
 Yeah.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.960
 Yeah.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.960
 I've been playing with ice for a long time.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.960
 There's one review on the green apple radiate online.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.960
 Is it by me?

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.960
 Did I write it?

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.240
 Maybe Clifford G. is that you?

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:52.000
 In a topsy turvy world of five stars, by the way, in a topsy turvy world, radiate green

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.080
 apple kombucha continues to be my north star capital in capital S. Joking, of course, that

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.080
 would be my wife.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.060
 This guy totally hangs out on LinkedIn, but radiate green apple is by miles my favorite

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.960
 kombucha of all time.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.960
 Clifford G.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.960
 That was a recent review.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.760
 I just pulled it up September 29th as a month ago.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.880
 I feel like I feel like that's fake, but maybe not.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.000
 So they have other flavors, but I'm like too scared to try them.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.800
 Because I like the green apple one so much that I don't want to have a better experience.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 If I have a good thing at a place, I will get that thing for the rest of my life.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.280
 I'd never try anything else.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.600
 If I know I like a thing, I don't go to that place very often.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.440
 If it's a restaurant or something, like I'm going to get that same thing repeatedly.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440
 Yeah.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.080
 They do have a pineapple which I've tried.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.160
 And I think the GT's pineapple one's actually better, but the other ones are a little like

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160
 intimidating.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.640
 They're called mermaid magic, black rose, black rose, flower power, no about this pollinator.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.640
 Pollinator.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.640
 What is that supposed to mean?

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.640
 Poppy poppy.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.640
 The green apple sounds delicious.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.640
 I'm going to try it.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.640
 We'll see.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.640
 You went for the 24.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.640
 You didn't even go for the 12.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.640
 You like all in.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.640
 Oh, I'm going to straight for the.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.640
 You got to get enough time.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.200
 I'm going to have to really, you know, two a day for the lips, and I sure I really liked

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.200
 it.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.200
 I got the cans.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.200
 They look small.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200
 They are small.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.200
 Okay.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.200
 That's another thing I like.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.560
 It's the GT's one when you open it.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.560
 It's a big commitment.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.240
 Like to drink the whole thing.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.240
 Yeah.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.960
 No, it's a, it's like a pretty big drink yet to have in one sitting for sure.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.400
 I don't actually, I just drink half, but then it like the fizziness goes away pretty quickly.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.520
 So that's why I'm like, okay, this is the right size.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.520
 This is like, I can always.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.520
 Yeah.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.520
 Oh, look, you got one right there.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.520
 Have you been holding it up the whole time?

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.280
 Have it just been staring at the website and I said, I don't remember, but yeah, it's

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.280
 real.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.280
 No joke.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.280
 Okay.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.280
 Okay.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.280
 I really do have to pee now.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.880
 I think we're going to have to actually get off.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.880
 All right.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.880
 Cool.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.880
 Thanks for your world.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.600
 This, this podcast has been my North Star.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.600
 Yeah.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.540
 It's the only consistent part of my schedule.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.360
 It really is like the only consistent thing I've done most this year.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.680
 So, but we're just taking a holiday break.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.680
 Everybody calm down.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.240
 It's not acting like we're never going to see each other again.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.360
 I'm going to call you like tomorrow and I'll be like, we got to talk, listen, but I'm not

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.360
 going to pick up.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.360
 Okay.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.360
 We'll find.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.360
 All right.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.360
 See you next.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.360
 All right.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.360
 Bye bye.
