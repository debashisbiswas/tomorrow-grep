00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 I mean, I get choked like every day.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:28.240
 So now explain why you sound like you're dying.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Because I am dying, Dax.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 No, I lost my voice.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 I got choked.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 And I didn't tap quick enough.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 I mean, I get choked like every day.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 I mean, that's just part of the gist.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 It was like you're getting choked.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 But this time it was kind of a sneaky Ezekiel choke.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 I didn't realize how good he had it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 He's a brown belt.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 His name's Lane. Thanks Lane for the choke.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 He just got in there real good.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 And I didn't tap quick enough.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 And I think I don't know if it damaged my vocal cords

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 or my larynx.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 I don't know what's in there.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 My esophagus, something is damaged.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Did it hurt?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Yeah, it hurts really bad.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Just wallow. Yeah.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Oh, damn.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Yeah, it feels like when you get sick.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 I mean, it feels like a cold, like a real big knot in your throat.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 But I'm not sick.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 I have no other symptoms.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 It's just I got choked.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Is this something that happens often?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 And you did too?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 You know, I don't know.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 I was telling, I was talking to my coach this morning.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 It's gotten progressively worse like the last three days.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 This actually happened on like Friday.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Oh, it's been a couple days.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 And it just the next morning was like, oh, wow.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 My voice is actually going immediately after it was like not in the throat hurt.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 But it was the next day that it's kind of gone and then it's just gotten progressively worse.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 And I was telling coach today, like, oh, man, I'm not sick.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 I just, this is from getting choked.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 And he's like, oh, yeah.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Yeah, that happens.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 I don't know.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 I guess it's semi normal.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 It sucks.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Are you going to see a doctor eventually if it doesn't get better?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Oh, I assume it's going to get better.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 What do you mean if it doesn't?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 It's not going to get better?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 No, I mean, I'm just saying you said it's gotten worse over three days.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 So for me, the way with injuries, it's always like, I give it a little bit of time.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 And if I see any improvement, I'm like, okay, it's fine.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 I don't have to go to the doctor.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 But I, and mentally, I'm like, okay, if this is, if this doesn't feel better after X number of days,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 I probably need to go.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Yeah, there hasn't been a day where it's gotten better yet.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 It's only gotten worse.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 I mean, at some point you get worried, right?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Yeah.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Yeah.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Okay.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Well, yeah, that point is now.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 I'm worried now.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 What was Casey's reaction to your voice?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 She seems pretty fine with it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 I mean, she doesn't seem too concerned.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Just like, oh, yeah.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Got choked?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Cool.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Okay.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 It's pretty normal at this point.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 She's just, she's so used to me, like, coming home every, every day and just being like, oh,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 I can't move my arm or my shoulders ripped out or like something hurts so bad every day that the voice is like us and so bad to the voice.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 It's crazy.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 You just sound like a different person.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 I even remember what your normal voice sounds like.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 I know it sounds, it sounds awful.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 And I'm recording a podcast, which is kind of stupid.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Is my bar moving?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Is it actually recording?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 No, I think it filters out ugly voices.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 It is moving.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 It doesn't move on my end anymore.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 So I don't even know.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Yeah.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 I mean, I can hear you.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Do I sound totally different?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Do I sound kind of more like a radio voice?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Hey, everybody.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 This is, I don't know more when you do that.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Yeah.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Yes.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 That grabliness is something that I would like.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 So Liz's dad has his really great, like, like voice.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 Yeah.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Yeah.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 I mean, we talked about it already, but it's the frickin cigars.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 And I'm like, I don't want to smoke cigars, but I guess I need to.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 That's bad for your health, but you could just do it too.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Good joke.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 I can show you.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 We'll just put on the gear.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 I'll just show the joke.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 I can give you some gravel real quick.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 I wonder if people are listening to this episode for the first time.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 And you opened it just by saying, I got choked.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 I got choked.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 I get choked every day.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 And then it took you a while to stage it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Yeah.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 That's a good point.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 The thought I was just saying this is like weird kinky stuff.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Yeah.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Yeah.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 And they just think this is more voice sounds like.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 I don't know.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 This is not my voice is not very low.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 I have a pretty high voice.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 So this is different.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 It really hurts to swallow though.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 That is concerning.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 I'm a little concerned.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 Yeah.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 I mean, give it like to the end of the week.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Maybe you're a couple more days.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Okay.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 I actually got the doctors and get better.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 We'll see.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Yeah.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Because I feel like most things that aren't a big deal start to feel better within a week.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Okay.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 So I've still got a few days made up made up here is sick.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Yeah.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Then it works for me.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Thank you, Dr. Dax.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 And I haven't been to the doctor in like 12 years.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Yeah.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 I was thinking about that.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Do I tell you that I dropped my health insurance?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 I heard you saying that.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Yeah.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 And then it just occurred to me like two days ago.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 It's like, I got into jujitsu right after I dropped my health insurance.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 That was really stupid.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Like I'm going to get some kind of injury and need like some weird surgery.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Yeah.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 And I don't even have health insurance stupid.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 I just health insurance is just a racket.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 It's just such a joke.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 I don't know if we've talked about it before, but it's pretty simple.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 If you are like decently young and decently healthy, you just do it.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 And it's what probably we were doing before.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 You pay for the disaster insurance, which just progressively has gotten more expensive.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Like all the past couple years, I'm paying double what I used to.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Basically, it means you pay for everything yourself unless there's something crazy.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 That's over $10,000 that they had you covered.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 That's only for emergencies.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Even here in those we've got the self pay doctors like that are like oriented toward it.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 So I go ahead.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Yeah.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 So that that's a big thing that's happening now where I think a lot of people are in the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 situation where there's like, I'm just paying for disaster insurance.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 I'm going to be paying out of pocket.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 I'm like comfortable with that.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 I expect to do that when I go to the doctor.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 So now there's all these doctors that are coming up and all these services coming up around

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 the self paid model, which I just think is better overall because the doctor's office

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 themselves, they know how much they're going to make when they call you in.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 They're not like calling insurance a month later.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 And the insurance company makes it extremely difficult for doctors to collect.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Obviously, you couldn't incentivize it.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 It's just like a stupid broken system, but this like they all every doctor's office has

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 this giant room just full of people that are just like on the phone with insurance people

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 all day.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 It's just a mess.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 And they have no idea how much they're going to make.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 They have no idea how much to charge.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 And then it just trickles down to all these good places.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 So yeah, I'm just hoping a lot more places are just like self pay standard.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 And boomy is actually oriented towards that because we serve.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 We specifically don't do insurance, but we don't bother doing any insurance stuff.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 We're going to put any effort into insurance stuff because we're hoping that the pool of

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 doctors that are just like screw it.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 I'm not taking insurance.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Just continue to grow.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Gross.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 I bet it does.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Yeah.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 And I think that actually fixes everything roughly like hospital is still a problem, but yeah,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 if there's more doctors doing that, the price transparency comes out.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Like everything just gets fixed.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Insurance kind of gets pushed out of the way.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Yeah, it gets more competitive.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 I guess like.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 And it gets cheaper.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 The prices aren't crazy.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Like you expect them to be like insane, but as this stuff is gone, become more popular.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 The prices have actually come down while insurance just keeps getting more expensive.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 I heard something.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 I keep me looking to this.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 I also like, yeah, the amount we're paying for health insurance.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Just I'm just not happy about it.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Someone mentioned something called a health share.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 And they're like, I dropped my health insurance and I switched to a health share.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Like a time share.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 It sounds like a good health for two weeks out of the year.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Which is kind of all I need to be honest.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 It's I haven't looked up exactly what it is, but I find it very confusing because it just

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 sounds like insurance, like a group of people have gotten together and formed a health share.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 And we agreed to share.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Yeah, that's what insurance is.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 I'm like, that's what insurance is, except.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Yeah.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 It's it turns is so weird because in some ways it's like.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Some of the most it's like if you look at it in a certain way where it's the most like altruistic thing that society has come up with.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 We collectively all agree to give up some resources so that people hurt the most.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Can get taken care of.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 It's like really cool that exists.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 It's a cool concept and it makes sense like.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Like from a social perspective, from a mathematical perspective.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 Sharing risk, right?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Like exactly.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 You're kind of all collectively.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Deluding down your risk.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Assuming the risk is infrequent enough for it to make sense mathematically.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 And I'm generally really in favor of business and like, privatizing things in general.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 But this category, I'm like, I don't know if it really makes sense that businesses built on top of this concept because it seems.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 It just seems like something else.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 And as soon as a business gets involved, like one of the best ways to increase their revenues and make claims harder to claim.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 Like that just.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 It just happens.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Yeah, the incentive scene.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 Yeah.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 So I'm in a lot of countries do have like they've made health care public, right?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 They take it into the government.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Yeah.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Yeah.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Yeah.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 And there's problems with that too.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 And I think our country is like pretty different.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Like we actually spend.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 We spend a lot of money on health care, like more than most people.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 So I don't think just making our like if you include.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 Like publicly funded stuff, probably funded stuff that Mount we spend per person.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 It's like twice as high as a second highest.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 That's like a made up stat, but it's like a crazy order, magnitude difference.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 And why?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Do you know why that is?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 It's a competition issue.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.040
 Like we've had some like weird history with with hospitals in America where we had this

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.680
 like inverse policy, a lot of states, most states actually have probably still have some

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:59.600
 formulas around where if you want to open a new hospital, you had to prove that you were

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:05.120
 not competing with an existing hospital in your area, but you have to like show that

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.320
 you weren't taking away.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.840
 I forgot the rationale for it.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.200
 Which is like some stupid like government, like I'm going to design the perfect.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.200
 Yeah.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.000
 I'm going to make this rollouts going to result into perfect outcome, but like backfired,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.200
 like everything like that backfires.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.160
 So that just set up for like crazy consolidation of like of hospitals.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.920
 So not enough hospitals are around.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:32.560
 The ones that are around merged each other this time, these giant hospital groups now.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.760
 So we spend way too much.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.040
 So it's not that we get it's not that we get sicker than other people.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.480
 It's that our price, you're saying just the prices are higher here for the same.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.240
 It's like the there's like some factor from like ROP stuff in America.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.760
 But I think the point I'm making is if you just take our system and just say, okay, we're

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.520
 now going to publicly fund the whole thing, you probably end up.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.600
 You're still spending like way too much per person because you never fixed the underlying

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.360
 yeah, like ecosystem of stuff.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.880
 So yeah, it's like this multifaceted problem, like all things are.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.600
 But yeah, like it's the insurance thing is just annoying as soon as like you're paying

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:18.360
 with someone else's money, it's like all these stupid things start to come into play.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.360
 Yeah.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.360
 It's a mess.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:26.440
 And then just state by state, the different legislation and yeah, I've worked like on

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:31.640
 the software side for the insurance industry, like did some stuff for Well Point and Anthem

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.080
 and all that whatever.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.080
 It's a mess.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:40.360
 Just their workflows like individual employees within that ecosystem.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:46.640
 Just a lot, a lot of red tape, a lot of a lot of paper and forms again, it's like it's

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.000
 a weird incentive where in every other industry, you're like, we have a business process,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.040
 the more efficient we can make the process, the better it is for our company.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.720
 The insurance is like reversed, like the more complicated we can make the process, the more

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.160
 money you make, because there's fewer claims that make it through, so yeah, yeah, it just

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.160
 doesn't work.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.160
 It's a mess.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160
 Could I shift gears?

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.160
 Yeah.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:15.640
 Does it sound like I'm going to start singing or something like no, because okay, here's

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.640
 the thing.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.400
 You sound like deathly ill, like you sound like you're clinging on to life.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:27.520
 So nothing exciting, like singing is expected.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:36.360
 So someone called me a tech bro and I realized I have a problem with this idea of tech bros.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.400
 One, I just don't think I'm a tech bro.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.840
 I think I know what people mean when they say, look at this tech bro, like I know what the

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:49.920
 perception of tech bros is, I don't think it has anything to do with technology.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.920
 Like no, it doesn't.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.320
 But it has nothing to do.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.400
 It's just a lot of people, a lot of technology people have made their money or they're doing

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.400
 pretty well.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.160
 They're comfortable, comfortable enough that they can think about things in their daily

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.520
 life that suck and that they want to make better.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.880
 So anybody who like tries to do things better is a tech bro.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.880
 And that's just stupid.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.880
 Go ahead.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.880
 Let me.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.880
 So I don't know who called you.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.880
 I'm going to take a guess.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.880
 All right.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.880
 Okay.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.880
 You posted that tweet about coffee.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.880
 Yeah.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.960
 Unless it replied to you being like, look at this tech bro.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.960
 Yeah.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.960
 A bunch of anonymous people.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.960
 Okay.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.960
 But I don't know.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.080
 I'm going to tell you why they said that and I'm going to tell you why it's maybe a

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.080
 little fair.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.080
 Oh, no.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.360
 Did I say a tech bro thing?

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.360
 Oh, man.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.840
 The thing you posted was you posted something about like, if you drink coffee every day,

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.080
 you like lose the ability to like use it as a tool where you can take it on certain days

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.080
 when you need to get a lot of.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.080
 Not just coffee.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.080
 Like caffeine.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.080
 Just caffeine in general.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.080
 Yeah.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.800
 The thing here is you've thought really hard about something, perhaps too hard.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.520
 Perhaps it wasn't worth thinking about and you've kind of taken something that and the

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.720
 question is, is everything in life worth thinking that hard about that's really all

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.720
 what people react.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.520
 Well, they know they're reacting to that or like they might just be annoyed and like

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.800
 not really thinking too hard about it.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:13.240
 But the fundamental thing that I think is fair is I get why people will see that and they're

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.800
 just like, fuck you, Adam, and they just call you a name.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.800
 Yeah.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.400
 I wasn't trying to say like you're a bad person.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.320
 If you drink coffee, I feel like there's this gift that I've discovered and I want to

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:32.160
 share it with other people like every day and you just you never get that high anymore.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.280
 Like once you drink coffee every day, you lose that forever.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.880
 You'll never have that like special day again.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.880
 Yeah, I know.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.600
 And people are like, Oh, just drink more.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.600
 I don't know.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.600
 It's a losing battle.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:47.560
 Like 15 cups of coffee a day, like the literal thing, you know, there's there's like this

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:55.400
 feeling of life is kind of like this unstructured like amorphous thing and people like that,

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.240
 like parts of it should stay that way.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.240
 Okay.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.040
 And then when you structure it in that way, it's like, okay, so what am I allowed to think

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.040
 hard about?

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.880
 No, you do whatever you want, no, no, no, no, I need to know on behalf of all the Twitter

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.040
 anonymous people, could you please let me know?

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.080
 What am I allowed to think hard about and not be in tech, bro?

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.080
 Nothing.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.000
 I just got to glide through life and go to my nine to five set on the couch when I get

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 home and watch TV.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.200
 No, but I mean, here's the thing, like you can, you can either not offend anyone in the

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.600
 whole world or you can do something, right?

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.480
 Like that's, yeah, you can't think about anything because people are going to feel like you're

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.480
 ruining something.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.560
 So do you think tech bro, you, you agreed that tech bro is a dumb term?

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.880
 Could you just kind of share what you think about it?

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:43.480
 I think, I think it's an, I don't think it's dumb, I think maybe people get called it unfairly.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.120
 But if you look at what's the most fair way to use that term, I get what they're talking

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.120
 about.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.800
 They're talking about people that like obsess over like these little parts of their life,

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.520
 like when they go to sleep, when they wake up, when they like, how do they spend their

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.520
 time doing this?

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.520
 Like what books are they reading?

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.520
 Like just kind of doing all those like ultimately superficial things, like a lot of those things

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.520
 are superficial.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.920
 So like a way to feel like you're controlling something and you're improving, but you're

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.760
 just doing the same thing that literally everybody else in your bubble is doing.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.760
 Yeah.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.240
 Like it's kind of, it's like a very superficial exercise.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.880
 I think it's like that spectrum, there's some people that just aren't doing anything with

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.520
 their life and just criticizing anyone that's doing something.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.960
 So that person should not even be saying anything.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.080
 Then there's people that I think have passed that phase in their life and they're kind

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.280
 of looking back on it being like, okay, I remember when I was like, I went too far with

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.320
 that stuff and they're calling you a tech bro or someone a tech bro for that reason.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.080
 So yeah, I don't do a tech, but let's be honest, like that what I just described that persona

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.360
 does show up and tech a lot.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.360
 Yeah.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.840
 And I think it's because I just think it's like the further you get away from survival,

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:58.200
 the more your needs are met, the more you look into how could I make my days better?

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.680
 I don't know.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.680
 Is that so bad?

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.440
 I think that it's not bad, but like if you step back and look at the person you're like,

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.960
 are they happy as a result of that?

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.280
 And usually they're not.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:14.640
 So like I said, it's a lot of it tends to be superficial or like, it's like acting.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.640
 It's acting.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.640
 It's like an identity thing.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.320
 Like I do these things again, not saying just because you said that one thing about

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.960
 caffeine puts in this category, but like I get what they're not I hear you.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960
 Yeah.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:32.200
 Like I do obsess over some of this stuff because I'm 37.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.720
 I'm trying to get into an active sport.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.760
 And I want I want to I want to do anything I can to help feel better each day.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.080
 And I do think these things have helped me.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.960
 So does it all come from Huperman?

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.960
 Yes.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.960
 Does that make me a tech girl?

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.960
 I don't know.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:55.480
 I just I do feel like yeah, everyone who listens to his podcast is annoying and we all talk

00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:00.800
 about getting in, you know, chest freezers and whatever.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:06.600
 But like if it works, I guess like, I don't know, I'm not trying to push anything on anybody.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.160
 It's more just like, no, I know you're not.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.160
 Hey, this works for me.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.440
 But your mirror existence is annoying.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:17.560
 When I think tech, bro, I think of like the Silicon Valley stereotypical founder, like the

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.720
 kind of meme, I mean, Silicon Valley, the show, like the meme of a founder.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:29.120
 But like someone who's just super into like, life optimization, I just don't think I see

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120
 the tech.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.120
 I don't know.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.680
 If you're going to make fun of me, at least be accurate.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.480
 What's a better word than to call you?

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.880
 Because I think I think you're right that it's not literally true, but you know, it just

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.400
 has nothing to do with my tech background.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:48.480
 I feel like the things that people are seeing in me and pointing out or poking at have more

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:55.960
 to do with, I don't know, my age, my social status, my listening habits.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.960
 Yeah.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.960
 Yeah.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.960
 Has nothing to do with literally tech.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.960
 I know that.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.960
 But it's just an arbitrary word.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.960
 They can.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.960
 I know.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.960
 I'm hung up on it.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.960
 Gooberman.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.960
 Like it's just like, they can call you anything.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.960
 Like what?

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.960
 The point is like, we know what they're talking about.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.960
 Yeah.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.960
 Yeah.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.960
 Okay.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.960
 Fine.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.960
 I feel like I haven't even more annoying take that.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.960
 Oh, I want to hear your really annoying take, please.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.760
 I don't need caffeine ever.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.680
 You guys are all losers that need caffeine.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.680
 Like what is wrong?

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.680
 I don't need it.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.400
 I feel months without it.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.400
 I don't need it.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.400
 Yeah.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.400
 But you need it for your special day.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.400
 You need it.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.400
 You need it.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.400
 I like it on my special days.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.920
 It creates a crazy with the last time you had caffeine because maybe you don't remember,

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.920
 but like what?

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.120
 It's just like, I don't need to do any of these things and somehow my life is great.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.720
 I'm not saying you need to.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.720
 No.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720
 I know.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.720
 When was the last time you had caffeine?

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.720
 Have you not had it in a long, long time?

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.360
 Uh, I think I had it like maybe two months ago, I figured I had something.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:53.720
 The amount of like mental clarity and just like hyper focus, because I've got pretty

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.720
 good focus.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.720
 It has no effect on me because I'm like that every single day, Adam.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.720
 Oh, I see.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.720
 Every single minute.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.160
 I am just firing on me.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.160
 Okay.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.160
 Well, there you go.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.160
 What can I say?

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.520
 If I tweeted something along that category.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.520
 Oh, please do.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.520
 Hey, I think it would have surpassed me.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.520
 It would have surpassed whatever happened to you.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.480
 My question is you look at literally haven't been on Twitter.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.480
 I haven't.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.480
 I come on.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:24.160
 I'm like, hey, to just post this like missile targeted at the heart of everyone's like,

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.080
 it's a curious and annoys us.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.440
 It's just how you write.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.720
 It's just how you write on Twitter.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:36.120
 But the heart of it was I had a dream, not a dream, but I was like, I was up every night.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.120
 Okay.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.920
 Listen, every night I've had a hard time at like three am, I've been waking up and I can't

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.080
 seem to fall asleep.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.320
 And there's like this 45 minute window where I'm just trying to fall asleep, but my mind's

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.480
 really active.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.880
 That's been for like a week.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.080
 And this particular night, the thing on my mind was, why is everybody drinking caffeine

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.080
 all day?

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.520
 Everybody's just like, God, I have my, I haven't had my coffee yet.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.520
 Don't talk to me.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.520
 Like that whole trope.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.520
 It's so dumb.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.840
 Like everyone's just so rundown and needs their caffeine just to like exist.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.640
 And I just have that thought like, how many people do that?

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.640
 And I did it.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.920
 And I wish people didn't.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.920
 It's better this way.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.920
 I mean, I was my thought.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.920
 I do feel that way.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.920
 I do feel that way about other people.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.920
 Yeah.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.360
 So I happened to like get on Twitter for the first time in two weeks and decided I'd ride

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.960
 a little something.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.280
 And then I'm not on Twitter because you gave me that stupid app that like, I don't want

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.280
 to use it anymore.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.480
 And then I'd check it two days later and like that tweet blew up and everybody's yelling

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.760
 at me and calling me a tech bro and it hurt my feelings.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.760
 Okay.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.760
 I'm done.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.760
 So I'm done with Twitter again.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.760
 I don't know.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.760
 I don't need it.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.760
 It sucks.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.520
 If you're going to use it in that way, yes, I see why it sucks.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.080
 Oh, yeah, right.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.120
 The right way to use it is just like hang out with your friends.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.120
 I do miss everybody.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.120
 Do you?

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.120
 If you did, you'd be there.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.120
 So we don't believe you.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.120
 Not true.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.120
 I'm just busy.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.960
 Are you upgrading to Astro three?

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.960
 Oh, yes.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.920
 Stagnets will launch with Astro three.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:05.720
 I mean, we haven't done it yet, but I mean, it doesn't sound like it's hard, just like

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.720
 bumps and dependencies.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.720
 Yeah.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.720
 I don't think it's hard either.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.880
 Are you guys going to use any of those new features?

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.760
 So like view transitions, we had been using them in preview, off and on.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.160
 I'd turned it off twice.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.360
 Right now it's off because we keep running into some new weird issue.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.440
 I want to turn it back on and see if everything's good now, like you have to use like some

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.440
 event handlers.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.840
 You have to do some stuff to like reinitialize JavaScript because I'm not using a framework.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.480
 We're not using any kind of JavaScript framework because we just have so little JavaScript.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.720
 We have to like make sure all of this stuff in your script tags is like wrapped in this

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.640
 Astro load event or whatever, so that when the view transition happens, it's not a full

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.120
 page load, but that event fires and it initialized all the JavaScript, but we had some issues

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.520
 with stuff double loading and I don't know, those weird little odds and ends and they

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.520
 just go away.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.280
 And when we turn off view transitions, I don't know.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.600
 What other features are there, Astro?

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.200
 I thought it was mostly just it's faster.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.480
 It's faster in the view transitions.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.000
 I think those are the two major things.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.400
 So maybe they fixed some stuff.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.920
 Maybe we ran into bugs, I just didn't report on the view transition stuff.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.360
 You have an existing site, an existing design.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:16.080
 When you say you turn on view transitions, like can you, is it like easy just to turn

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.080
 it on?

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.960
 Or do you have to like design a product specifically with this concept?

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.760
 No, you just literally just turn it on.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.760
 Okay.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:30.320
 And then suddenly links prefetch and it animates between, like you can customize the animations,

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.600
 even if you don't, it morphs, it does this kind of like default animation.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.240
 And when you turn it on, it like looks nice and everything feels faster.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.240
 Works surprisingly well.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.240
 Yeah.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.480
 There was just some little edge cases we had, but like overall, it's a better site.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.040
 I mean, it feels way better.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.680
 We just got to iron that stuff out.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.400
 I'm looking at some of this stuff and it looks really cool and like, you know, the demos

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.320
 that they put out really smart of them, that music player one, that was brilliant.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.320
 Yeah.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.320
 The Spotify.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.920
 No, the Spotify one was I think like user made.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.080
 They made their own like music player before.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.080
 Oh, it was.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.080
 Yeah.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.080
 Oh, they made one.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.080
 Yeah.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.080
 I think I thought it was brilliant because you can like navigate between pages and the

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.080
 music keeps playing.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.280
 I was like, oh, it's a perfect way to demonstrate a podcast player kind of thing.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.280
 Yeah.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.280
 Exactly.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.160
 It's a perfect way to demonstrate like what the technology is because you would expect

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.320
 it to get interrupted.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.320
 Mm hmm.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.320
 That's smart.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:24.760
 I see all this cool stuff and people from these demos, they all look really great.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:29.900
 It's so different from how I build anything where I'm like, wow, I actually feel completely

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:36.640
 out of touch at this point because nothing I built and work on works this way.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.400
 I see the value in it.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.520
 Am I ever going to work on something like this in the future?

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.600
 Like, I don't even, I can't even imagine it right now.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.600
 So, yeah.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:51.760
 So I'm trying to think like, is it just, does it just come down to the type of site or application

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.000
 would be better suited for either?

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.080
 Because I do feel like both worlds are trying to like solve the same problems.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.720
 It's just very different approaches.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.720
 Yeah.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:07.000
 What I've always had with all this SSR stuff is when most of the site is stateful and needs

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.920
 to be around between page loads and all that stuff, it just becomes really tedious to like

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.560
 work around the SSR stuff and like escape hatchet of being like, this only runs on the client

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.040
 or like, yeah, this needs to like be around between page.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.320
 It's just, it's too optimized for the other thing.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.040
 And they built this nice bridge that you can kind of have both.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:33.620
 But in my head, it's always, even if you can literally do both, both the SSR stuff and the

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:40.780
 SPA like behavior, it's not exactly the same as doing an SPA because it's, you're still

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.940
 like, escape hatching.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.000
 It's not really an escape hat you're using this feature, but you're like wrapping everything

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.840
 in as additional functionality.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:51.120
 And it's great when you have mostly a site that you would just like to feel faster and

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.120
 snap here.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:58.240
 But if it's mostly an app, I don't, like, I don't see that, but the point I guess the

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:04.080
 point I'm trying to make is building a site has gotten so advanced, so much more advanced

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.360
 than the last time I've built something like that, where I feel like a huge gap with my

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.360
 own skillset.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.520
 Like I just haven't done something like that.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:20.880
 And I'm wondering, is that something I need to fix or like realistically, am I ever going

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:26.440
 to work on like a big, heavy Astro site, like maybe, is it better just to focus on what

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.680
 you've always done and not really branch into that stuff?

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.680
 Yeah.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.320
 Because I don't see myself building anything in that category, but who knows?

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.320
 Yeah.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.440
 I mean, the project we're working on, I mean, this use case is, I think, really well suited

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:44.480
 to it because most of the page is static or it's generated the same for every user and

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.680
 there's just kind of sprinkling some customization stuff in.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.680
 Yeah.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.520
 I think it works out for us.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.640
 I don't really have a lot of experience with spas, like real spas, like the kind of stuff

00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.240
 you do and like the client first or what is it called?

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.240
 Local first?

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.240
 Yeah.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.240
 Local first.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.240
 I have no experience with that.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.880
 I do think if I were building something like that, that's the way I'd go.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:07.880
 You've convinced me.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:14.120
 But yeah, it's amazing how differently you could build two properties that are deployed

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.680
 to the web today.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.680
 Yeah, exactly.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.240
 I feel like there's like very little overlap now.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:26.560
 It's also interesting to me because I've worked at a lot of companies and especially the consultant

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:32.240
 I've interacted with a lot of companies and these large like public facing like content

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:39.560
 driven sites, I would say like less than 5% of the places I've worked for fit in that

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.560
 category.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.560
 Yeah.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.240
 You're like primary experience the last couple of years has been on like one of the biggest

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.440
 in that category, so it's like really extreme.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:54.760
 But I do wonder like is that what half of engineers work on is that like I have no sense

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760
 of that at all.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.760
 Yeah.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.040
 I feel like it's a smaller like less than half kind of thing.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.040
 I would think.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.040
 Yeah.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.040
 Because I personally haven't run into it.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.440
 And then I think about like, how do I use the web?

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.440
 I mean, you think of like stack overflow fits into that.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.600
 Well, I guess yeah, I don't really do that anymore.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:37.000
 Okay, I'm looking at my tabs right now I have the arch wiki open, which I always have opened

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.200
 in some form.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.200
 That's awesome.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.200
 You're such a nerd.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:45.400
 It's such a tech bro, I'm just because I'm trying to figure out how to run Android apps

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.560
 on my desktop so I can do the Twitter space.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.560
 So we can do the Twitter space.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.560
 Yeah.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.560
 We got to do that.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.560
 We'll get that figured out and we'll do it.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.960
 I have a lot of GitHub tabs open.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:54.960
 Yes.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.400
 GitHub in my opinion should be way more of a spa than it is.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.400
 Yeah.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.400
 But yeah, GitHub, I don't know.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.120
 I use a bunch of like little like a bunch of productivity apps and those are all spas.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:11.240
 But yeah, I think for me, the web is like Google to random sites back to Google to random

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.840
 site back to Google to random site.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.240
 And I guess all of those should just be like astro type sites.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:22.840
 Yeah, like the the random sites are typically like articles, blogs, stuff, right?

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.920
 Like if you're researching something and I guess that does I guess now that I think

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.000
 about it, I don't use a lot of spas, but is that where your job would be?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 Is my question?

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 What do you mean?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.880
 If someone is working as a software engineer, they're not like professionally working full

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.880
 time on their blog, you know, no, that's true.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.880
 Yeah.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.880
 What do most people work on?

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:44.880
 What are you all?

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.880
 There's so many developers.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.360
 There's like 30 million developers.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.360
 What are they doing?

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.680
 So many companies, so many of them.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.640
 Well, I think about this all the time though, because I'm like, okay, I got these like random

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.280
 headphones that I needed for privacy reason.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.480
 And yesterday I installed the app and I'm like, there's someone out there that just works

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.960
 on this like random headphones every single day.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.960
 Yeah.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:04.960
 Yeah.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.080
 Just it's like, not great app.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.520
 It's actually better than I expected, but it's so like not great.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.840
 But yeah, like there's just everywhere you look, there's like some software.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:20.120
 Yeah, zooming out, like, has anyone other surveys or breakdowns of like global trends

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:26.440
 in terms of the bigger buckets, like systems developers versus like native mobile developers

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.960
 versus web developer, like, where does all that fit in?

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.640
 I wonder what the breakdown looks like.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.640
 Yeah.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:38.920
 Like whenever I always ask people where they work and it's always, it's always really legit

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.440
 in that, okay, that's a good real business.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.800
 I see why that exists, but it's also something I literally have never heard of or would have

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.800
 never thought about.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.360
 So it's just, there's just so many companies out there.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:55.000
 I think the story I keep going back to is that React Miami where I had a bunch of people

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.320
 come up to me and being like, oh, we use SST and I was cool because I've like, I've never

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.420
 had that conversation in real life prior to that.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:06.640
 And one of them was like this oil company in the middle of nowhere that had like a hundred

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.800
 plus software engineers and everything that I'm using SST.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:14.920
 And I was just like, this is so random, like a hundred people working together, like looking

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.860
 at the stuff that we make.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.360
 And they like think that way and they build every day that way that is like a company you

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.960
 would have never heard of, I mean, hedging up bumps into this person.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.960
 Yeah.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.960
 Yeah, it's crazy.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.800
 And now that we have the console up, we're seeing, we can see like people's invocations.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.520
 Like we're seeing, because we track the number of vacation people have and we've, we have

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.360
 like a, I like look at the top 10 every day.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:43.440
 And man, we have some like giant user, like some people are doing a lot of, of traffic

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.440
 and vacation work.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.440
 Yeah.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.440
 It's like, like they'll be someone in the lead, number one, I'll see them every day, number

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.080
 one, number one, number one, and then all of a sudden, someone will just double that and

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.440
 then be like, you know, signed up and they're doubled and it's, yeah, it's really crazy

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.920
 that there's just, and I've never heard of any of these companies.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:59.920
 I'll look them up.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:04.000
 It looks like really, okay, clearly it's a real business, like it exists and it's crazy

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.080
 how big the world is.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.080
 The world is big.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.960
 That's exactly what I was thinking.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.280
 It's just really big.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.280
 How's the console going?

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.720
 And where are you guys are right now?

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.720
 What are you working on?

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.720
 Yeah.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.720
 It's, it's good.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.600
 We're about to launch our issues features, so this is in, in our old product.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.840
 But the fact that like Sentry, you get alerted.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.360
 The big thing that I did though, that we didn't have the old one, is like all the automatic

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.640
 source map support.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.640
 So when you get...

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.880
 I thought you'd tweet that.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.880
 Yeah.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.440
 The issue, it's actually like, the sacrifice looks correct and you can expand it and see

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.440
 the code that...

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.440
 Yeah.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.280
 How'd you do that?

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:43.000
 I think we have this really interesting positioning and I want to like go at this angle a lot

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 more with everything we build.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.080
 We deploy your app.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:51.240
 Because we deploy your app, we can do all kinds of things automatically for you.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.240
 That is like a setup process in other places.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.360
 So if you think about when you sign up for Sentry, they have like 90 plus percent of the

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.360
 market.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.880
 Like everyone has used them before.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.680
 But it's like, okay, I'm not to go to production.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.680
 Oh shit.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.840
 We need to set up Sentry so we know if anything goes wrong.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.280
 You like go to their docs.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.280
 You figure out which one of the three ways you need to integrate.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.640
 Can you wrap all your functions?

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:18.360
 You realize you forgot one function, you got to go back and wrap that one.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.680
 All these steps, right?

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.160
 But that process takes care of shipping everything that Sentry needs to give you half of these

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.560
 in experience.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.360
 But because we're deploying it, we can just do all that automatically.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.560
 We know all the functions you deploy.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.460
 We build your functions so we can generate source maps, ship them to...

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.040
 We actually don't ship even ship them to ourselves.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.720
 We just keep them in your account.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:46.520
 The console will use that to correct fact traces and pull out your code.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.520
 That's pretty cool.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.520
 Yeah.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.520
 The angle I want to go is no setup.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.000
 Every feature we release, it should just kind of work without this additional thing.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.720
 You have to go integrate or set up.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:01.600
 That way, it doesn't really matter if we're never going to meet anywhere close to as good

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.120
 as Sentry because it's not our full-time focus.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.120
 Yeah.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:10.200
 In the default option that just works automatically, that ends up being a business perspective.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.760
 Being the fault is crazy, crazy powerful.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.760
 Yeah.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.720
 And if all else fails, you could always just spin up crypto mining VMs or something and

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.720
 people's accounts.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.560
 I mean, you've got full control.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.560
 You deploy.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.280
 So I didn't mean to seed that into anybody's.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:28.240
 Is that the best thing we could do given we have?

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.240
 What is the best thing you could do?

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.240
 Yeah.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:35.080
 If you've got admin account on a bunch of AWS accounts or admin access, what is the most

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.240
 lucrative thing you could do?

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:43.280
 Probably sell access to the people who think that they can make a lot of money.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.280
 Yeah.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.280
 That's brilliant.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.080
 Let's make the shovels.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.080
 Yeah.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.080
 That's funny.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.280
 You probably have to go like the dark web.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.720
 Do you even know what the dark web is?

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.680
 I have to go talk about the dark web.

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.520
 I have spent my time on the dark web.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.520
 Yes.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520
 You have.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.520
 Yeah.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.520
 How do you get there?

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.520
 I don't want to use a browser.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.520
 Can I use a browser?

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.520
 Well, you typically use Tor.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.520
 Do you know what Tor is?

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.520
 No.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.520
 Like torrent?

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520
 No, it's.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.520
 Hey, I don't know what it's answering.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.520
 I mean, I did download some torrents.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.520
 I'm going to, I'm going to out myself.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.160
 I did steal some music in the late 90s.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.160
 Oh man.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.840
 Was it like, what kind of, do you remember like a specific?

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.000
 Well, it wasn't even a legal when it was a Napster, right?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.200
 Like Napster was like, this is legal.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.200
 Or maybe.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.200
 Kind of like DraftKings.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.880
 I don't really remember what happened with that.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.880
 I feel like it came out.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.320
 I then later they were like, hang on, this is all not allowed.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.320
 Yeah.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.320
 Yeah.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.800
 But I think I did a lot of that.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.960
 I want to say I downloaded like you torrent and maybe got some stuff that way.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.960
 Yeah.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.960
 Some music or something.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.960
 I don't know.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.960
 I don't remember.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.560
 But, but now you're saying the tour is like a tour is this.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.920
 It's kind of like a, it's like a distributed VPN, if you think about it.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.440
 So you can like computers can join the Tor network.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.400
 And when you make a request through the Tor network, it gets bounced off of a bunch

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.400
 of them before going to the target.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.400
 That's okay.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.000
 Is it physically though happening over the internet?

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 Yes.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 It is physical network.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.800
 They have their own like protocol.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.520
 So it's not like TCP IP or whatever.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.760
 So it is, I forgot what layer operates on.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.760
 So it is TCP.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.920
 It is HTTP.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:19.920
 It's all like very normal.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.440
 You can build a very normal deploy in Azure sites.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:26.120
 But the domains are like dot onion domains.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.120
 I'm sorry.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.120
 What now?

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.120
 Yeah.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.360
 Or whatever exists on dot onion domains.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.360
 Yeah.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.360
 Yeah.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.360
 Yeah.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.360
 Because the Tor is like an onion network.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.360
 They call an onion network.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.360
 So it has like layers.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.440
 Oh, it's funny.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.760
 I just expected something way creepier and like, I don't know, sinister dot onion.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.440
 If I may, it's super sneaky dot onion.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.040
 Well, you should think that's a lot of things.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:55.680
 You don't get nice domain names and I don't exactly understand why or how this works, but

00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.760
 you get like, it's like a, you, you, it's like a, you lit, it's like a bunch of letters

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.760
 dot onion.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.720
 And so your request bounces through a bunch of different computers and then lands and

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.480
 then goes to the end server.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.600
 So it just makes it harder to trace.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.560
 And what, what makes the dark web so dark?

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.000
 Tell me more about the dark web.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.480
 What would I find there if I went to your, well, well, you can host, you can, you can

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:23.540
 host an illegal server on the normal internet, which is completely fine.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.440
 You just put on all the internet and like, I'm an illegal server.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.440
 What do you mean?

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.420
 A server serving illegal or illicit.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:30.420
 Okay.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.560
 So it might be something where you're selling something that's illegal.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.560
 Okay.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.560
 You're going to go shop.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.560
 Like drugs.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.560
 Yeah.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.560
 Shop.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.560
 I own a shop.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.560
 I account.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.560
 And then start to sell drugs out of there.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.420
 And they're going to shut you down eventually.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.420
 Probably very quickly.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:47.640
 So that's why people end up on the dark web is they don't get shut down.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.000
 From the serving standpoint, you can't use something like Shopify as you have to self

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 host it.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.680
 You just have your own servers kind of do everything yourself to minimize the chance

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.680
 of it getting these, whatever.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.680
 Okay.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.940
 And then you want to protect the end users because you don't want their traffic to your

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.680
 site to be very easily traceable.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.400
 So that's why I want to go through this tour thing.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.400
 Okay.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.040
 Here's the craziest part.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.040
 You know who invented tour?

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.760
 I'm pretty sure it was a US government.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:18.200
 I think it was like a CIA or so it was like, I think it was originally built to help like

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.800
 dissidents and other countries that communicate without being being traced.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.600
 But this just makes me wonder like, it's not fully not traceable.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.240
 Like if you put in the work, you can trace it.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:33.800
 I was going to say, I feel like it's still, yeah, it's still got to be like reversible.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.760
 Like somebody could take all the activity and I don't know.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.920
 I think the government, the idea is it makes it annoying enough to track an individual that

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.640
 they don't bother going after customers.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:49.840
 They just go after this or serving, which I think is makes sense for everyone's point

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.840
 of view.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.840
 Interesting.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.120
 So there's these marketplaces like eBay that are there.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.840
 They're effectively just like eBay and but you can sell anything.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.840
 Yeah.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.560
 But you can't go from a browser.

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.200
 You got to go from a browser, which is just Firefox, which is Firefox.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.200
 That's like forked.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.200
 Oh, okay.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.200
 Yeah.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.200
 Okay.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.200
 But it's fine.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.720
 It's just like all the same concerns happen.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.320
 There's like UX concerns, like you have to build like a nice product that people want

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.320
 to use and everything.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.320
 There's a good ratings.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.320
 For the dark web.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.320
 Yeah.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:22.200
 There's like some of these websites have like the merchants have ratings, but instead

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.120
 of normal ratings, like of course you'll have a normal like how to five star rating.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:32.040
 They break it down and one of the categories is stealth like four out of five on stealth

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:38.200
 because you know, the package was like the drugs in like a DVD cover and they like mailed

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.200
 that to me.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.880
 That's why you get stealth.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.240
 You even know a lot about this.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.840
 You've really you've done your homework on the dark web.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:54.760
 Let's just say I watch a documentary on the dark web that could help me with this voice.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.480
 It could maybe like heal my throat.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:01.720
 They sell all sorts of funny stuff on there like like they sell cash, which is a funny

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.720
 cause.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.720
 It makes complete sense.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.720
 Wait, what?

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.520
 You can buy cash, but like you're just laundering money.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.720
 How do you pay how do you pay on the dark web?

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.720
 It's all Bitcoin.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.720
 I'm not a manero.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720
 Yeah.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.720
 Yeah.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.720
 What did it do?

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.720
 What did they do before cryptocurrency?

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.720
 I don't know.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.840
 Actually, because I feel like it only really got big once once Bitcoin was an option because

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.180
 Silk Road, which is the most infamous one I've heard of that.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.180
 I think they came out.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.160
 They came out after Bitcoin came out.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.160
 Did they get destroyed?

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.480
 Did they get like taken down or something?

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:34.000
 Yeah, it was like a huge it was like a huge thing where the guy got caught and now he's

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.480
 in jail for life and people kind of think it's like overly people kind of do feel like

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.400
 it was an overly harsh, harsh punishment.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.680
 There's a lot of messed up things that happened with the trial.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.720
 Like it seemed like the government was like, they entrapped him into like saying that he

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.040
 was going to assassinate someone.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.120
 It was like a lot of stuff happened with a bunch of the agents stole some of the Bitcoin

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.120
 that they seized.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:56.360
 It was kind of a huge huge mess of a process.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.360
 Wow.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.360
 But yeah.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.360
 Dark Web.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.960
 So the dark web still thriving.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:01.960
 It hasn't gone away.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.960
 I don't know.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.320
 I mean, I haven't looked at it in a while, but I'm just like the thing is these marketplace

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.200
 come out, they last for a while.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.480
 Sometimes the person making the marketplace just let's it get big enough big enough and

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.240
 they like just steal a bunch of stuff might disappear.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.240
 Oh, geez.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.240
 Makes sense.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.920
 Sometimes they get taken down by the government.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.920
 New one pops up.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.920
 It's kind of an infinite.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:21.920
 Yeah.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:22.920
 Loop.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:27.320
 How do a is your communication channels like I always hear about IRC and like, I know like

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.160
 old school programmers like I started on IRC.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:35.120
 Well, it's funny because the UX a lot of these sites has to suck.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.320
 Because they optimize for crazy security over ease of use.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:44.200
 So you have to like generate your own PGP keys and like upload your public keys to the

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.200
 site.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.840
 And then all your messages is like end to end encrypted.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.840
 So the site doesn't even have access to the data that they're serving.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:57.040
 So yeah, usually a messaging platform will be on the site and they just make you follow

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:02.480
 all these steps to keep it encrypted and yeah, people like boot up into like those secure

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:06.280
 Linux operating systems, like tails or whatever, wait, what?

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.280
 Tails.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:12.200
 There's like these, there's these Linux OS's that you can boot off of a USB that are optimized

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.480
 to like be really stealthy.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:18.200
 Like they don't like leave any cache data on the disk and they're like kind of equipped

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.200
 everything and do all that.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:24.560
 So people will boot into that, wow, use the tour browser, access the dark web, do whatever

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.560
 they need to do.

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.600
 Oh, man, I would love to know one of these people.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.600
 Apparently it's you.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.840
 I mean, I'd love to just like sit in the room and watch what they do.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.240
 There's like Reddit's that like tutorials as credits.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.240
 You can go.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.240
 Oh, really?

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.240
 Go explore.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.240
 It's just like a funny thing that exists.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.240
 Like I said, you just, you feel a selling like all sorts of funny stuff on there.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.840
 Sometimes people sell like tutorials and books too.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.080
 They like sell like how to steal it.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.080
 It's like a product.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.120
 It's like grifters over there too.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.560
 Oh, man, it's funny.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.000
 You can't escape it.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 It's everywhere.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 Oh, it's funny.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.200
 So when you boot into tails and you're setting in your dark purple room.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.920
 Do you wear like a hood?

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.300
 Are you always in like one of the anonymous masks?

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.300
 You have to.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.300
 Otherwise, you know, it's not something.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:09.300
 You never know.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.480
 If you're not in a hood, you got to have physical security too.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.480
 Yeah.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.320
 If someone saw you, they need to not know who it is.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.320
 Yeah.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.960
 There's a whole thing around this concept.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.600
 I forgot what's called a dead drop.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.680
 It's called some kind of drop.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.120
 So there's, I don't even know if this really happens, but the thing everyone's paranoid

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.520
 about is when they're getting a delivery, people claim that sometimes that delivery

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:33.960
 gets intercepted and then the FBI will dress up as or whoever whatever you see will dress

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:39.080
 up as a carrier and they give you the box and they wait five minutes and they raid you

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.840
 to see if you've opened the box.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:41.840
 Has this ever really happened?

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.640
 And I'm just like, I don't, it's one of those things, you know, where like the average person

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:49.840
 thinks about how the law works and they like, it just sounds like that to me.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.720
 It's like they bust it and they see you with the box open.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.320
 They're like, because you open the box, you know, you're in trouble.

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.520
 But what happens if you just don't open it for a day?

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.360
 Like you somehow not in trouble, like it just doesn't make any sense.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:06.960
 But there's a, there's a story that just goes around where someone's a someone said

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:12.480
 that they claim that their friend went to the post office to pick up a package because

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.840
 it wasn't delivered.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:17.320
 And the post office was having a birthday party for one of the employees and it was

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:21.600
 like the woman's wearing hats and everything and he picked up the package and it turns

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.160
 out it was a fake birthday party and it was like a stealth operation and a bunch of like

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.560
 seriously agents were dressed up as a birthday.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.760
 It was like employee birthday and it like came out and they like arrested him.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.480
 I don't understand why they would need to pretend it's a birthday.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.480
 Like what?

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.120
 Yeah, there's a lot of ways that could have gone that seems like extra work.

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.120
 Yeah.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.120
 Like how did he not?

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.120
 I don't know.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:45.880
 I feel like he was surprised in other ways without pretending to be celebrating a birthday.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.400
 You just been behind, you just been in the back office.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.440
 Like, you know, I would have said anything.

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.000
 That's, that's a true story though?

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 No, I don't know.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 There's these stories going around where I just feel like.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 People, people like this like role-playing element of like, oh, I'm doing this, this

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.480
 is like the thing that I'm avoiding the government and it's like dodging, you know, it's more

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.800
 fun that way.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:05.800
 They're breaking the law.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.280
 I just assume that they never go after a buyer.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.280
 It just feels like a waste of time.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.280
 Yeah.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.280
 I'm assuming that's too many others.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.280
 Yeah.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.280
 Yeah.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.280
 Yeah.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.280
 That makes sense.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.280
 This is not that.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.280
 But have you seen the, is it Mark?

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.280
 Mark Robber.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.280
 Robberson.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.280
 Robs?

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.280
 I don't know.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:27.560
 It's the YouTuber that does the like, he makes the crazy like packages that explode.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.560
 Oh.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.560
 For like, porch parts.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.560
 Yeah.

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:31.560
 Yeah.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.560
 Yeah.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.560
 I've seen that.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.560
 Yeah.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.560
 But there's a camera in there and then it like explodes.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.560
 Yeah.

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.560
 And they're smelling really bad.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.560
 And they're like, explode.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.560
 Yeah.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.560
 That's why.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.560
 Man, that's a huge problem.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.560
 Everyone always complains about that.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.560
 I've never had that happen to me once.

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.560
 I saw one of them.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.560
 He did.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.560
 It wasn't for the porch.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.160
 It was like, they're putting stuff in a bag and just putting it in the back of a car

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.320
 in San Francisco or something like that.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.680
 And how quickly the window gets busted out.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.640
 He smashed the window, jumped in and grabbed it.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.640
 Yeah.

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:56.640
 It was like less than 10 seconds.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.640
 They just come grab the bags.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:58.640
 It's so fast.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.840
 Like they leave it there for no time at all and there are people busting in or looking

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:02.840
 in or.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.840
 Yeah.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:08.840
 That video was weird to me because were they targeting that car specifically because they

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.800
 seem to go straight for the back seat.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.800
 They knew there was something in there.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.160
 They pulled up, smashed it, ran out.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.160
 So efficient.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.160
 Yeah.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.800
 Makes you never want to go to a city again.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.280
 Oh, that's just me.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.280
 That's just me.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.280
 Okay.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.280
 Yeah.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.680
 I mean, we have a it's so it's weird because we in the street, we live on.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.800
 Most people have these like their whole property is like gated.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.720
 Like all the houses are next to each other that I get adjacent.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.760
 It's not like in the suburbs with those like space between the houses.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:42.320
 Like we all live right next to each other, even the houses would not live in the suburbs.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.720
 It is not a DAX move, say.

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:48.760
 Everyone had these like big gates that go all around.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.360
 So it's like everyone's a completely shielded.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:58.120
 Like you can't target even like into into the house, but we have like like a waist level

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.200
 like white picket fence and we're just like, I just feel like we're crazy exposed compared

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.920
 to everyone else on our street.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:09.120
 Oh, no, but I actually wonder if there's some kind of reverse psychology going on where

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.640
 someone's like, oh, well, that looks too easy.

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.640
 Yeah.

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.640
 That's got to be some catch.

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:16.640
 Yeah.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:24.400
 Yeah, the other day, well, Zuko has his friend that comes over a lot and she's a German shepherd

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.560
 and they both play in the front yard like really crazy.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.600
 They like really nuts and I'm like, I hope, I hope that people are seeing this all the

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.960
 time so that they're like, oh shit, there's a good door of men.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:34.960
 Yeah.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:39.840
 The German shepherd and the Doberman rolling around on the ground biting at each other.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.840
 Yeah.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.720
 I think if you look at her, it's very normal, but it's just a fact that everyone else has

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.680
 these like our merge.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:53.160
 Yeah, these compounds that makes me think like, is that there for a reason is everyone's

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.160
 overreacting?

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.160
 I can't tell.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.160
 Yeah.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:01.760
 We've got the, so we've got like perimeter cameras around the house and it's the ring.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.640
 I don't know if you've looked at it.

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.680
 We have perimeter cameras too, but we have the nest side of things.

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:07.680
 Okay.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.680
 Nest.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.680
 Yeah.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.680
 I've used messed up in the past.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.760
 So we have the ring ones and they have this option that when the, when you'll arm the

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:20.080
 alarm, you can have this virtual security guard where somebody watches any motion detection

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:24.360
 events because we get a lot of false, like it's supposed to just detect humans, but it's

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:31.560
 like a spider goes across and like, so they any motion events during an active, like when

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:37.720
 your alarm is armed, there's an active person watching it and determining if there's any

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.200
 real threat and then dismissing.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:45.100
 So like every event that happens and you pay for like, it's like buckets of number of events

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:51.560
 that they'll admire or whatever, but we just had gone to Kansas city and I just decided

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.640
 to like actually arm it while we were gone.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:58.720
 We, we are at night every night just on a schedule, but armed it for the whole trip.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:04.640
 We were gone for like three days and our neighbors brought our trash cans back to the house.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.640
 And that's nice.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:06.640
 It record.

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:10.560
 Yeah, it's super nice, but they're all on a walk and they're just walking by and like,

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.320
 we'll just take the trash can to the house.

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:18.240
 And as she's walking it up the driveway, this like security guard comes over the audio

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:22.640
 and you're like, set the garage, or set the trash receptacle down and leave the premise.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.240
 This is private property.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.840
 And they thought like, oh, maybe it's just an automated message.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:30.240
 That was kind of like, they've heard our cameras like at one time we had the setting

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.320
 where it was like, you're being recorded.

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:37.800
 So that she turns to her husband, she's like, it said something about the trash cans.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:41.480
 The whole thing's recorded, like we can watch all day back.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:44.880
 But I get this alert while we're in Kansas City, like somebody showed up in your garage,

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.280
 but the situation was deescalated and we didn't have to call it the rest of it.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.280
 Yeah.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.280
 And then I watch it back.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.960
 It's like my neighbors bringing the trash cans in.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.960
 That's really funny.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.240
 But she told them she said we've called the police like because she kept coming after

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.240
 that.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.240
 Like she brought them to the house.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.400
 She's like, we've called the authorities, leaves the premises.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.800
 They totally bluffed them.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.800
 Is it?

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.640
 Are they like hitting a button to play that or is it someone speaking live?

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.120
 They're speaking live over the cameras.

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.760
 The cameras have like two way, like we can do that.

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.760
 We can talk over.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.760
 Okay.

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.760
 So do they add the sound threatening?

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:15.760
 Is that part of their like?

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:16.760
 I don't know.

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:20.640
 She did a very the security guard did a very good job of being intimidating.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.960
 It was like the whole bluff on calling the police and everything.

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.960
 Wow.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:28.200
 I don't know if that's an attack vector if people like want to steal stuff.

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:32.680
 They like bring your trash can to the house like just all sneaky like I'm just returning

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.840
 your trash bins and then boom.

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:36.840
 They go for the hit.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:37.840
 I don't know.

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.320
 Is that how people say things like that?

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.840
 I don't know what that was.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.840
 I don't know.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.320
 I know what the dark web is.

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.320
 I don't know.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.320
 Yeah.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:49.040
 We have we have a cameras around to again, like I said, because I feel exposed, I like

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.920
 set up cameras everywhere, which makes me feel yeah.

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:51.920
 Oh, I feel way better.

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.840
 They don't really trigger by accident.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.240
 I feel like they only ever catch before.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.240
 Oh, really?

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.240
 But maybe we just I don't know.

00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.240
 I don't know.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.240
 I have no idea why.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.240
 Have you never had an issue with that?

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.240
 No.

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.680
 It's like whenever you're going to alert, it's a real person.

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:06.520
 So what's annoying to me on the ring ones is they have they literally have a setting.

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.800
 It's like human only motion events.

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.800
 Yes.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.800
 Exactly.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.800
 It doesn't work.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.800
 Oh, okay.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.800
 I mean, it just gets a lot of false.

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.800
 Yeah.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.440
 I guess it's better than whatever the true negatives.

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.440
 I don't know.

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.240
 What's the opposite of the false bother?

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.800
 I guess it's better than missing events, but you don't want like your alarm going off

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:29.080
 because a bug flew in front of the window at night, like that happens, like you get

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.080
 those events.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.080
 Yeah.

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.040
 We might just have like we might just have less noise going in front of cameras.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.040
 Okay.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.120
 I will say there is just one.

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:42.120
 This is this conversation reminded me I need to put a camera in a specific part of my backyard.

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:48.840
 So if you if you are sleeping in our bedroom, if you wake up at literally any time at night

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:53.520
 and you just start listening for one minute, you will be convinced there's someone's breaking

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:58.160
 in and like about what because this is super weird.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.840
 And I'm telling you, it sounds every happens to me all the time when I wake up and no matter

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:06.120
 how many times it happens, I still am like convinced that this is what's going on.

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:09.880
 We have these really tall bamboo trees, right?

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.320
 Like in the window of our bedroom.

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.320
 Yeah.

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.600
 At night in the wind, they like Creek.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.600
 Okay.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:22.160
 But the way they Creek sounds exactly like our side door opening and literally sound like

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.680
 the latch opening.

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:24.680
 Okay.

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:28.400
 So first you hear that and you're like, okay, maybe which is a Creek, then you start hearing

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.240
 footsteps on the rocks on the side of the house.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:38.520
 But when it creaks, the lizards jump off and like land on the ground and like run around.

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.000
 But it sounds exact.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.080
 If you just like there's been so many nights, I generally sleep really well, but if I randomly

00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.840
 get woken up and I start to listen to that, I'll just be up for 30 minutes because I'm

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:48.840
 just like tense waiting for.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:49.840
 That's terrifying.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:50.840
 Yeah.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.760
 But it sounds exactly like a gate opening and someone walking constantly through the

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.760
 whole night.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.280
 So like I need to put a camera on the side of the house so that I can just get it and

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.200
 be like, okay, it's definitely not a person.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.200
 Just the lizards.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.040
 Just the lizards running around.

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.040
 Nothing to worry about.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.040
 It's really creepy though.

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.240
 It is very creepy.

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.800
 I had a singular event the other night.

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:17.000
 I got up pretty early at like 4.30 or 5 and I'm in my office and my door was shut.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.200
 So like often my oldest will get up in the middle of the night, like I don't know, he

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:26.020
 has to pee or something and he'll come down when he knows I'm awake and tell me of his

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.020
 issues or whatever.

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:29.680
 If he's got something he needs help me of his issues.

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:32.440
 I mean like dad, I'm scared or dad I need something.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.440
 Yeah.

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.600
 Just like he'll come into the office.

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:41.920
 I swore I heard him or somebody like up and around upstairs and come down and I was just

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.800
 waiting for my door to open and nobody opened the door.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.160
 So I pulled up, we have all interior cameras as well.

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:53.000
 So I go to like the interior app and it's like no motion events.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.800
 Nobody has moved a mouse.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.800
 Yeah.

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.840
 And I swore I heard like it was so sure it was a creepiest like ghost story kind of thing

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:00.840
 I've ever had.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:01.840
 Everyone wants to answer.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.840
 Yeah, it has to be a ghost.

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:03.840
 It has to be.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:04.840
 It has to be footsteps.

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:05.840
 That's right.

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:06.840
 Or lizards and wind or something.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.840
 Bamboo.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:08.840
 We don't have any bamboo.

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:09.840
 So I don't know.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.840
 It's creepy man.

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.600
 So Liz went to the bathroom and then she went back to the bathroom a minute later to get

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:18.760
 something and she was like the toilet seats up all the way.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.080
 There's no way that I would have left it up.

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.800
 So that must have been a ghost.

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.280
 Oh my word.

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:28.120
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, sometimes there's why is there no way you would have left it up?

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.920
 No, she was saying there's no way she went to the bathroom.

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.280
 Oh, like you hadn't been in there.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.280
 No, no, no, no.

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.560
 And she was like toilet seat and I was like, is it possible you left it up?

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.880
 I was like, no, impossible.

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:37.880
 Why would I ever do that?

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:38.880
 Yeah.

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:39.880
 Why would she do that?

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.800
 No, I wasn't in the bathroom.

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.800
 Okay.

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.880
 What I'm getting at is I sit when I peeked you sit when you peek.

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:45.880
 Yeah.

00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:46.880
 But only because Liz told me I have to do that.

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:47.880
 Yeah.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.080
 Casey too, like five years ago and it's better.

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.080
 Now I'm convinced.

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.080
 I'm just used to it here.

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.080
 There's no reason to peel over the floor.

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.080
 Like I used to peel over.

00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.040
 You were going to make fun of this one or a screw.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.040
 I don't care.

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.040
 You know what?

00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.040
 It's better.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.040
 It's just like.

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.520
 Is it better?

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.520
 It's less messy.

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.600
 It's way less messy.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:07.600
 There's just no way you're not going to splatter all over everything if you pee standing up

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:08.600
 every day.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:09.840
 And why do that in your own house?

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:10.840
 Why create that mess?

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.640
 It's just unnecessary.

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.760
 I still do standing up every once in a while.

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.160
 It's a little treat for me.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.160
 You know?

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.160
 Oh, really?

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.160
 It's a little treat.

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.040
 Oh, you enjoy.

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.680
 I don't think about like not enjoying sitting to pee.

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:27.680
 I think there's like a little amount of friction of like turning around and then squatting.

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:28.680
 I guess.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:29.680
 Yeah.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.680
 And sitting down.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.360
 So skipping that to one second as I like treats.

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.600
 I guess I am a little excited when I'm in a public place and I pee in a year and all like

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.760
 oh, I just get to stand here and pee.

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:39.760
 It's kind of nice.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:40.760
 I guess I get it.

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:41.760
 Yeah.

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.760
 What percentage of people do you think sit and love men?

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.760
 Do you think sit and pee?

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:48.120
 Well, isn't it like I want to say internationally, it's a much higher percentage.

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.280
 Like I want to say in Europe, they do that.

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.280
 It's normal.

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.280
 But here in the U.S.

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.280
 You stand up.

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.120
 Europe has that poop shelf thing going on.

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.960
 I'm just like a shelf.

00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:05.560
 Have you seen their their toilets where like no, there's like a ledge in the toilet bowl.

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:07.520
 And like the water like comes out and like goes around.

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:08.520
 I'll send you a picture later.

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:14.120
 And they call it a poop shelf because sometimes like a poop gets on it and then just kind

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.120
 of gets stuck.

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:16.120
 And I'm like, what is this?

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.120
 Is that a feature?

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.120
 Why?

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.120
 Why?

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.120
 I don't know if it's an accident.

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:24.120
 I'm sure they have some European reason where it's like it's better for society or something

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.120
 like that.

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.120
 Wow.

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.120
 I had never heard of this.

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:35.480
 I mean, I'm going to look up pictures now, I guess of I'm not going to search that though.

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.840
 I'm just going to search European toilets.

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.640
 No, search poop shelf.

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.640
 I think that's part of the right thing.

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.720
 I'm not doing that because it'll have pictures like proving why it's called that now and

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.720
 not done.

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:44.720
 I'm proof.

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:51.080
 I'm pretty sure they said when they pee though, I think it's a American thing, like inches

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.080
 and down.

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.080
 I'm pretty sure.

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.640
 I mean, I'm not a European.

00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:57.800
 I had no idea.

00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:58.800
 I don't know.

00:56:58.800 --> 00:56:59.800
 I'm googling it.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.800
 Do you hear me?

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.800
 Are you googling?

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:02.800
 Do you hear me?

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:03.800
 Yes.

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:04.800
 European man.

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.280
 I'm going to sit to pee.

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:11.200
 I'm telling you, Germany was by far the leader in men who sit while peeing.

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.400
 62% of German men.

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:15.920
 I knew I liked the Germans and knew it.

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:20.040
 Sweden came in a distant second with a country split 50/50 on the issue.

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:25.040
 American men prefer standing with only 23% saying they sit most of the time.

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.600
 Disgusting Americans.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:27.600
 What are we doing?

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.600
 We just like cleaning up pee on the floor.

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.600
 What's the deal?

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.600
 There's just Google poop shelf.

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.600
 Just do it.

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:33.600
 Okay.

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.600
 Do it.

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.600
 Do it.

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.600
 It's just a weird design.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.600
 I don't get it.

00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.600
 What in the world?

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:39.600
 There's no...

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.600
 Most of the pictures are not gross.

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.600
 Some of the pictures are gross, but...

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:42.600
 Okay.

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.440
 I don't actually see the shelf though.

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:45.440
 It's not like it's a shelf.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.880
 The point is it's not like...

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:47.880
 Oh.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:48.880
 It's not full of water?

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.800
 Or like the water level is really low.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:51.800
 I don't understand it.

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.640
 Why is the water level so low?

00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:54.640
 Yeah.

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.320
 Most of the toilet is not full of water.

00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:57.320
 That seems wrong.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:00.800
 Well, this picture has a duck sitting on it.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:04.160
 Oh. Okay. I just got into the grass once.

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.160
 Okay.

00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.160
 I'm done.

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.160
 I don't understand that.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.160
 They're just filled with water.

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.360
 Is it just water conservation?

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.360
 Probably.

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.360
 I don't know.

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.360
 The water conversation...

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:15.640
 Conservation thing is funny because it's so regional where like...

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:16.640
 Where I live.

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.280
 Like there's water everywhere all the time.

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.600
 It'll come to get a ground coming from the sky.

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:22.600
 Yeah.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.600
 I like it.

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.600
 You need less water.

00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.600
 I have a water shortage.

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.600
 Yeah.

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.600
 Like New Orleans.

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:28.600
 And then California.

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.140
 They take all the water they get, right?

00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.140
 Yeah.

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.140
 It wasn't a big storm.

00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:33.140
 Did you?

00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:34.140
 You didn't get hit by the hurricane or anything.

00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:35.140
 Yeah.

00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:36.140
 What's a Tampa, I think?

00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.140
 Oh, Tampa.

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:42.480
 The Native Americans put a reverse curse on Tampa that prevents hurricanes from hitting

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.480
 there directly.

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:44.480
 So they're protected.

00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.480
 What?

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.480
 Why did they do that?

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:49.520
 Did the Tampa people do something?

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:52.320
 I think there's like burial grounds there.

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.320
 Ah.

00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:54.320
 But they got hit.

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.320
 So the reverse curse wore off.

00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.320
 Yeah.

00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.320
 But it's been a very long time.

00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:03.080
 The hurricane was hit there from last year just veered off last minute and hit, hit closer.

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.560
 So it works for us.

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:05.560
 Interesting.

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:06.560
 I love stuff like that.

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:08.600
 It worked for a while.

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.600
 Interesting.

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.600
 I don't know.

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.280
 How do we know Native Americans didn't put a reverse curse on every city though?

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:16.560
 Like there's probably some Native Americans that reverse cursed every city because they

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.560
 live there.

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:18.840
 Do you're being a tech pro right now?

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:19.840
 Oh, am I?

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:20.840
 Oh, no.

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.440
 I don't want to be a tech pro.

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.440
 Okay.

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:29.600
 I opened up Twitter on accident that's something we were talking about and while he's notification.

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.600
 Just enjoy the mystery and don't don't analyze it.

00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.600
 Don't analyze it.

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.600
 Okay.

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:35.600
 Why are so many people quote tweeting this tweet?

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.920
 It was not that good of a tweet.

00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:37.920
 People.

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:38.920
 The coffee.

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:39.920
 Just leave it alone.

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.920
 There's 308 quote tweets.

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:42.920
 Yes.

00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:43.920
 The coffee one.

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:44.920
 Geez.

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:45.920
 Calm down people.

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:49.320
 Can we just can we talk about who are the people that are just like, I'm so mad just person

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.320
 tweeted.

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.320
 I'm going to write about it.

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:52.320
 Yeah.

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:53.320
 Who are these people?

00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.320
 Oh, my word.

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:56.040
 Well, whatever you did that was wrong.

00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.440
 The people quote tweeting are worse.

00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:58.440
 So you can.

00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.440
 I agree.

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.640
 I mean, it's me, so I'm biased.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.640
 Okay.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.640
 I'm over it.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.640
 I got a good option.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.680
 Like I think I saw Aaron reply.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.680
 You should double down.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.680
 Double down.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.360
 Like, if you drink coffee, you're probably a Satanist.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:21.880
 Probably hate babies and no, no, no, no, to be to be the most annoying.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.880
 What would it be?

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.880
 I'll do it right now.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.880
 You can't be that extreme.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:25.880
 Okay, give me something.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:26.880
 You have to just give it.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.880
 I'll do it right.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:28.880
 Literally right now.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.440
 It has to be something that seems like it's serious, but I don't know what it is.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:36.800
 If you drink coffee, you probably gave up in life.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.560
 Is that too much?

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.680
 I had an idea the other day where I was like, if I ever want to just piss everyone off,

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.080
 I went up close to no real work has ever been done on a laptop.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.080
 I guarantee.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.880
 I guarantee you think that would do worse that people get more mad.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.880
 That would be good.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:57.360
 No, that would be good because that's not one people get called out for, like working

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.360
 on laptops.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.360
 So that's a fresh wound.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:04.320
 Everyone does it and everyone loves working on laptops and everyone thinks that people

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.960
 that work on desktops are trying too hard.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.520
 So it'll be a perfect one.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.520
 Please do it.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.520
 I'll hit send.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.720
 If you hit send, what's something better than gave up in life?

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.200
 That's too obviously like I'm just trolling.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.680
 If you drink coffee, you probably don't do any serious work.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.000
 You probably work.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.520
 Isn't that serious?

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.600
 Oh, man.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.960
 People are going to think I'm serious.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:26.960
 I don't know.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.960
 I just want you to.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.960
 I want you to.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.960
 I'm kind of done with Twitter.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.880
 If you drink coffee, your work probably isn't that serious.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.880
 Okay.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.840
 I'm doing it.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.840
 Whoo.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840
 Done.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840
 I don't know.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.840
 Nobody's going to see it.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.840
 That's the way Twitter works.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.760
 Like the million people latch onto one tweet and then they should see it.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.760
 Yeah.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.760
 You never know.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:53.240
 I think today that I thought was funny, but now it's like, okay, I noticed once a tweet

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:59.120
 gets passed a certain zone, that's when all annoying people come in and it's starting

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.120
 to reach that zone.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:05.360
 And now I'm a little nervous, but is it your graduating that one?

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.360
 Congrats on graduating.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:10.640
 You're now a real adult come join Big Tech where a bus will take you to campus.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.640
 Bring back back.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.640
 You were assigned a level.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.640
 Do you mind me reading this?

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.640
 This is okay.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640
 Okay.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:19.400
 We're going to have a level and given a checklist on how to progress meals provided every quarter,

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.400
 you get a report card.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.400
 You're told you're extra special.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.400
 Wow.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.400
 That's pretty true.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:31.880
 I mean, I've never worked in Big Tech, but that sounds accurate.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:32.880
 Someone is going to be mad.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.440
 There's going to be at least one person reply.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.440
 Thank you for sure.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.440
 Yeah.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.440
 It's just how Twitter works, right?

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.440
 Yeah.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.640
 When you follow trash, you're saying, yeah, it's like this.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.640
 All right.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.640
 Let's do it.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.640
 Okay.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.880
 We should probably get off here.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.600
 This one's been kind of long, but you know, we didn't, we didn't record on Thursday.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.600
 Yeah.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.000
 Makeup for it.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.600
 Make it up for it.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.760
 One big old episode.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.160
 Your voice sounds better, by the way.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.240
 Ooh, I just needed to talk more.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.240
 It does sound better.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.360
 I think it sounds basically normal.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.840
 Oh, it's that if you don't use it, you lose it thing or what is it?

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:07.840
 Like you hurt your ankle.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.120
 You got to keep walking on it.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.120
 Don't just sit around.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.120
 Yeah.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.120
 It's going to atrophy.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.920
 Your voice, you got to just do some podcasting.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:19.040
 Get on the mic and prescribes you.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.040
 Start a podcast.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.040
 Yeah.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.040
 Exactly.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.280
 You need to work on your throat exercises.

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.280
 Okay.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.280
 All right.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.280
 Gonna get some water.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.280
 See you.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:28.280
 See you next.
