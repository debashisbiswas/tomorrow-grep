WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
 Well, this episode is not gonna come out till Monday. So oh, so I'll be in Miami when this episode comes out. How weird. Yeah, wait

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 No, I won't it'll be in the morning

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.760
 Close enough. I'll be on the plane. I'll basically be here. If you listen this podcast Adam is basically here. Yes

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 I

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:43.120
 Thought you sounded sick again. Okay, am I sick? That's why I need to understand right now because

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.560
 It's been three weeks and

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.120
 Honestly, I feel as bad as I felt at the the peak of it

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.520
 I thought there's like three or four days where I was no symptoms and it's bad

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.080
 So I got sick again or I got pneumonia or something

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.600
 I don't know. Can you describe what you feel? It's mostly head congestion

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.160
 But now I've got it in my head that it could be something in my chest because of pneumonia

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
 Like I'm like, oh, do I have a cough?

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.520
 I'm shortness of breath my heart rate like my aura sleep tracker has said my heart rate's been elevated every night

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.960
 And it's like 15 beats per minute higher than normal all the time

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.800
 So my heart is doing stuff struggling. I don't know

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.120
 Yeah, I really I

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.720
 convince myself that I'm better because I have competition Saturday next week's Miami

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.160
 Like I'm fine. I'm like so nervous for everyone right now because I'm like nobody better get sick

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.480
 There might be like nothing needs to happen. Nothing should happen this week. There's so much stuff coming up. Yeah

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.960
 Yeah, I mean it could be like a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.560
 The one time I was sick for what felt like a very long time was

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.160
 What the first time I had covid I mean first or second time I had covid

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.720
 I felt like it took me forever. I like got back to 80 pretty quickly, but then it took me like

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.520
 Like a month to be back to a hundred. Yeah, that's describing me like yeah

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.040
 I mean it might be that and then um the other time was a science infection and that was like

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.120
 That lasted a very long time

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.640
 Why do I I dropped my health insurance and I've been to the hospital twice and now I'm sick for a month like what is going on?

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.360
 Big big pharma conspiring against me. They've somehow made me sick

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.800
 There's a I'm like I this get more convinced every day that irony is like a property of physics

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.680
 at this point

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.880
 Just guaranteed exact insurance. I knew you were gonna yeah

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.440
 Not only did you go to the hospital you went to the hospital with like some really random of

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.440
 You would never you would never guess like those sepsis in your knee

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.000
 I've never been to the hospital in my adult life like I went once in high school

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.640
 Uh, but like mostly

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.400
 I've had a pretty like clean slate in terms of my health and adulthood

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.000
 And then literally months after I dropped health insurance. I was in the hospital with first time was

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.480
 Uh, what was the first time? Oh, I had like a viral infection in my

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.520
 Gut and it like yeah, it was excruciating pain and then the second time yeah a weird infection in my knee

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.680
 Anyway, I'm just I'm dying. We're all dying, but I'm dying a little a little faster

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.560
 But we can't be dying because we have so much cool stuff going on. I'm so excited. I'm manic. It's all it's good

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.760
 So much fun. Yeah, I was telling Liz yesterday. I was like, I think adam's mania has been activated

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.920
 Anytime there's something new like a new project or something man. I just don't sleep. I'm just

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.080
 Maybe that's why I'm not getting better because I'm not sleeping. Do you know is that like my color is changing like constantly?

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.640
 It does seem different

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.640
 What is my character like the light from your monitor?

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.320
 No, I haven't changed anything. I think I think I fucked up some studying my camera

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.080
 Yeah, you've not had like normal jobs

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.680
 So like the people you're on calls with are your friends that you work with

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.840
 Uh, but maybe you can't relate to this, but there's that like I'm on a zoom call with a bunch of people and I don't need to be on it

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.680
 I'm just listening

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.280
 What your color change? Yeah, it's yellow now. I'm like super yellow again. What? Yeah, well in the world

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.320
 Okay, but like you're you're you're kind of paying attention

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.640
 But not really but then you realize like everyone can tell you're not paying attention because the screen flashing on your face

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.640
 Like you're clearly browsing the web

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.520
 It's very obvious

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.520
 But we're all just gonna be okay. Well, I think about that with my mic because my mic picks up my keyboard typing. Uh, yeah

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.560
 Pretty well. I mean your fake keyboard sounds

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.960
 No, my real keyboard sounds. Oh, I forgot about the thank you. I think I

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.840
 Think I like accidentally turned that off at some point and forgot about I gotta bring that back

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.800
 My fake keyboard noises that reminds me uh, just a quick question before we get into serious stuff

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.800
 Why is sound on the web bad like I so badly we just made a thing that we teased out

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.840
 And on the website, I it's like it's supposed to be like a terminal prompt

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.240
 I want to make it like make clicky sounds when you type but I'm like, yeah, I can't do that sound is bad

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.080
 On the web people don't want sound why I feel like it should be a whole multimedia experience, you know

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.960
 Wait, what do you mean people don't want sound? Do you think people would have been upset?

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.360
 I feel like websites. Yeah, people don't want or they can't be on by default. Like if you have sounds that go off

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.920
 Because of advertisers the advertisers are in the web. Yeah, I know this because uh

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.720
 Back in my ad ad tech days. Okay. Here's a really funny thing that I built

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.240
 At one point. So when I was an ad tech, I was basically like

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.640
 You know how you're like

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.240
 Oh, man, there's always evil people in history. How did like millions of people follow them?

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.560
 That was me. I was just like doing my job doing evil stuff, but it was fun

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.280
 And I was just kind of caught up in like the engineering of it

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.880
 uh

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.240
 So

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.080
 You can't autoplay videos when a page loads of course. That's like unless it's a background video

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.000
 Like it's some cool trendy like hero background video that's playing behind your hero text

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.040
 That's okay, but it's just visual. It's not audio, right?

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.160
 I don't know exactly what the limitation is, but I know that

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.960
 And especially something served in an iFrame couldn't

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.360
 Oh, you're saying literally you couldn't I thought you were just saying it's frowned upon it

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.320
 No, no

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.320
 There's like a browser. There's some

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.120
 That thing that makes it or there's some like the fault behavior browser that makes so you can't auto play video when a page loads

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.680
 But for advertisers, I was like, oh, okay. I guess we keep we have to wait from the tap the video to play

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.680
 But who the hell is ever gonna tap? Yeah, right. I'm gonna click on this ad to see what happened

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.400
 I built this system where you could

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.080
 Uh pre-process a video and get it streamed over web socket and have it render as canvas

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:31.360
 Canvas you're so yeah, so it would autoplay the video, but it wouldn't really be a video just be like a canvas streaming

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.360
 like

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.240
 And this was worse because like the compression obviously wasn't as

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.960
 I didn't like some crazy compression thing

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.560
 Um, so I was like it would just send you a lot of data

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.240
 But it would uh, you know auto play and that was a product that we marketed

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.120
 Oh, that's another thing that I uh that reminded me I need to ask you about because you're smart

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.400
 Uh, my I feel like it's dns

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.960
 Something like speed tests on my computer. Fine. My network speed test like my internet connection is fast

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.560
 Uh, it's in my office closet. By the way, the fiber terminates environment. Sorry

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.280
 It internet is fast, but there's like this crazy latency right now browsing the web in my home

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.280
 And I it lines up with I got a bunch of notifications from my synology

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.600
 Uh network storage device that there have been login attempts from like russia and china and all these places that there

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.120
 Shouldn't be people trying to log in to my uh network storage device

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:34.560
 So some somehow and I know I exposed some of this stuff on the internet because I want to access it outside my home

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.720
 But is it possible to me hacked me and they like

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.800
 Slow down my dns because it is my dns server as well. My synology runs

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.240
 It does my dns stuff because I use like ad guard or something

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.600
 Is it possible to me hacked in and they they're doing something they're like intercepting all the traffic and making it slow

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.920
 I mean, it's definitely plausible

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.760
 Especially because you have like an exotic configuration that would allow for that kind of thing

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:03.120
 Uh, why do you expose anything on the internet? They have you, uh, I used to try setting up tails. Okay, so

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.760
 Got a head of your nails

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.920
 All right, you asked the question

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.560
 Yeah, well hillskill doesn't work for everything. There's what what did I expose uh?

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.840
 Uh, it has to do with my I made a little like

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:24.320
 IOS app for myself when I stream iRL stuff so I can like do stuff to my OBS and some things like that

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.720
 And rtmp streaming or hls streaming or something. I don't know. I mean, it's totally possible

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.600
 And I'm also maybe less than things completely open without passwords or anything

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.280
 It's possible

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.080
 I'm just you think it's you think it's just your dn

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.520
 Nes because your speed test. Yeah, like speed because like the bandwidth of my internet is fine

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.720
 The the connection to my internet, but it's just like when I hit a website. There's like a 10 second delay right now

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.920
 For everything and it just feels like

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.840
 If you do like it if you do like a dig is that slow and your terminal? I haven't tried

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.240
 You always come up with the super obvious like you could try this yesterday. You did this with me

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.480
 You're like wait. Have you tried just like running it locally and seeing it?

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.600
 Nevermind got a fix

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:19.840
 Yeah, sorry. I'll try I'll try if it's just dn s I should be easy to like pinpoint, but it might be something more nefarious

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:26.160
 Yeah, it feels pretty nefarious my whole web experience just got really slow just wipe everything and restart just start over

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.320
 Yeah, I could just block all this stuff

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:35.760
 I should probably set up a rule or something in my ubiquitous hardware. That's like don't accept any connections from Russia

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.840
 Just probably don't need any connections from Russia. It's just block those

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.640
 No inbound connections or outbound

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.800
 Do you like do you really take advantage of

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.000
 All that stuff like but why do you have all that?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.520
 You know, I think I went with the ubiquity stuff after we when we built our first home

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.680
 We had a contractor do all the like

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:05.520
 Networking and home intelligence if you will it's the same person like they did the theater

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.480
 They did all of it and they used ubiquity equipment

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.920
 So I just kind of got used to like using unify console and all that

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.760
 Uh, so yeah, so I did that and then like whaps in the attic the whole thing just to make a nice

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.680
 home network

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.880
 Uh, yeah, I just when we built the new house. I just decided to draw on myself

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.960
 And I went with ubiquity stuff, but I don't take advantage of it. There's so much you can do in there

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.040
 Yeah, because like I'm thinking about like

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.680
 I don't know what I need would need to add like I just use like a consumer

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.600
 Router and consumer networking. Yeah, how how big of a living space

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.480
 Are you in? Yeah, I mean we just have mesh mesh Wi-Fi and that's good enough for

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.400
 Yeah, like I think with our with our especially our first home was like 5,000 square feet on two levels

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:54.800
 And there weren't like really good just consumer router situations that covered the whole house with good coverage

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.200
 Well, yeah, I mean, I think for a big house you would definitely have need like multiple like wired

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.320
 Set up. Yeah, I guess the mesh thing. I guess like you can

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.800
 You can buy those google mesh. There's probably a lot of options for just mesh routers

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.200
 It works surprisingly. Well, like I have I have the google one that I only bought it because when I was staying

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.880
 We were saying it is so funny

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.720
 So we were staying in a house in Miami when we used to visit here in the winter

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:22.880
 And I show like the late the whole time every time we did this what I was always nervous about was like

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.400
 Am I gonna show up? Is that you're not gonna suck because I have to be here for three months and that would be disaster

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.560
 So I show up and I like immediately want to speed test and it's horrible and I'm like

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.920
 Like this is this or bad situation

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.680
 But then I plugged in to the wall and it ran a speed test and it was like literally 10 times faster

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.200
 And I was like these people were paying for such fast internet. They like messed up the Wi-Fi situation

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.000
 Yeah, so then I bought a mesh system for that house and I use it and I like completely fixed it

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.360
 But then now I moved here and I started using it again. Yeah, and it works really well

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.960
 Like I mean my house isn't huge

00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.640
 But it covers like all the way into my backyard and and everything nice. Yeah, yeah, they do work really well compared to how like

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.080
 Like my parents house. We had like so many random dead zones that we could just like never really fix

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.400
 But now this much definitely fix it. Yeah, hey, we got a lot to talk about we do

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.880
 Uh, you've got some cloud flare stuff you want to talk about

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.440
 We we leaked our our secret project that people on the podcasts know about I mean

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.200
 They listen to our pocket. Wait, the people who listen our podcast know that we have a secret project

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.440
 They may not know that we leaked it

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.400
 We didn't leave it. We didn't leave it. I don't know

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.920
 It's not really a teaser because we teased it. I haven't told people what it is

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.600
 We've just been like hey, here's a little something a little something for you

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.160
 I told a couple people what it was. Oh, you did? Yeah, because a few people told them told them. Yeah

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:46.400
 Oh, I told trash. Well, no, I mean I told some because I remember I was like whoever first were people that find

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:53.280
 Oh, yeah, you did them. Yeah, and they're all like whoa, that's such a good idea. Oh good. They're excited about it. Yeah

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.800
 Yeah, every single person I've told I told a bunch of people here in Miami in person

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:02.240
 Uh, yeah, so if you're listening to podcasts, you can uh, you can get the same teaser and just go to twitter

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.560
 No, should we do that? Should we just say it?

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:11.920
 Like SSH type in SSH terminal dot shop. There you go. And that's the keys. You've been teased

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.720
 along with everybody else

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:20.000
 Okay, let's talk cloudflare stuff. Yeah, so I guess last time we recorded that was in the middle of cloudflare dev week

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.040
 Um, what a mistake should wait till it was over. Yeah, it's funny because our recording schedule is tough when news doesn't line up perfectly

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.960
 I know like all news needs to wait until wednesday

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.800
 Like drop all your stuff on wednesday so we can talk about it right away. Exactly

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.120
 But it also gives us time to reflect and like I think give it maybe a different perspective. So

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.160
 Oh, I've been reflecting. Yeah, that's all i've been doing for the last week

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.800
 Uh, so it was on thursday and then so friday they acquired

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:54.720
 You know two of our friends companies two of them. Yeah, it's kind of crazy. So they acquired party kit and baseline

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.600
 Uh both people that we know. Mm-hmm now it's on the same day, right? Yeah

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.320
 Uh, the party kit one

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.320
 That one is I guess a little less surprising because he

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.080
 It's a product built so around the cloudflare ecosystem and

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.240
 So you're like worked at cloudflare pyre. So that makes a lot of sense. I think he just got his like

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.400
 The way I see it. It's like he took this funny path where sometimes you're you're at your at a big company and you're like

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.920
 Man, we should be doing this but like you can't convince

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.000
 Whatever to like you can't convince a company to let you work on that

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.320
 So he just left and worked on it anyway

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:36.080
 That hired him back and he gets to work on it. So it's like this really roundabout way to get your way

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.200
 And then baseline, which is a you know, an observability tool

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.520
 And they're like very early ST users. So their app isn't actually an SST app

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.320
 Uh, nice and they're gonna acquire

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:54.960
 Yeah, and they've done like really cool things and so they got acquired to basically build observability for a cloudflare

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:01.120
 Which I think is going to be crazy because every cloud's logging product is bare minimum

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.000
 Which kind of makes sense because most

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:10.800
 Serious companies are going to go pay to a dog anyway. Um, but that just means that if you're not

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.640
 A company that like necessarily is going to automatically pay for day a dog

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.560
 You just have like a really weak default experience because they don't really care too much

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.000
 So if i'm imagining cloudflare getting as a baseline

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.880
 an observability experience on par with like baseline

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.360
 Yeah

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.360
 That's that's pretty crazy. That's like a pretty crazy

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.800
 Floor and they could obviously you can grow out of that

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.480
 but

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.920
 Yeah, I'm excited to see what comes out of that way having all that stuff turned on and working by default with nothing to set up

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.200
 Like that's pretty appealing. Yeah cloudflare gets more and more

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.680
 Appealing. Yeah, not just from your investor standpoint, but like

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.240
 from a

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.240
 I'm building modern web applications

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.560
 Is it missing anything now?

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:02.240
 Is there anything with all the latest announcements? No, I think it's funny because their dev weeks have been like increasingly increasingly more

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.600
 interesting and I think this dev week just hit it a whole new level

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.800
 Like I feel like everybody was talking about it and there's so much excitement around it

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.480
 And I think yeah, you can build real stuff on it

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.400
 You know our secret project that we just built is mostly on cloudflare

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.600
 Cloudflare for sure doesn't have containers and we do need containers so we mix cloudflare and it together

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.000
 um

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.480
 And yeah, I mean it worked well and really

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.200
 No, no real issue just it's still you're still an early adopter if you're using it, but

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.840
 It's all totally possible possible

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.360
 The other thing was because party kit and baseline got acquired everybody was like

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.880
 There are so many tweets asking if that's the season getting acquired or like telling cloudflare they should acquire the season

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.000
 It just like fun, you know

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.280
 Kind of does

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.720
 Yeah, that would be such a crazy like team to put together like all the cloudflare people who are already like

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.840
 Very good at what they do and then baseline and then party kit and then us two like

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.640
 That like comes together really nicely

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.800
 But we basically already get that now without actually having to join them

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.080
 So we're seeing how far we can go just working together

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.240
 Yeah, because it would be it would be a bummer for me

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.200
 Personally, if sst were acquired by cloudflare

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.880
 I mean I'd be happy for you, but like the AWS picture would probably change on sst

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.960
 and

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.480
 I very much rely on that for many reasons. That's another reason why like

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.040
 I mean we talked about this last time where I have like very mixed feelings about acquisitions

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:35.200
 But this is a very pointed example where we have this vision that's very large

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.160
 But if we were acquired by cloudflare

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.000
 It would get scoped down to like yeah, a much smaller thing

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.720
 It could be better because it is scoped down, but

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.320
 Yeah, that's why it's not like immediately very appealing

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.600
 So I just remembered what it was that uh, you had some stuff to talk about about cloudflare

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.480
 It was some next JS vercel stuff

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.160
 Uh, in terms of the vercel infrastructure to our listeners that are sick of hearing about vercel

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.720
 I'm sorry, but we gotta do this one more time

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.600
 I said the words next to us the vercelle. I was like, uh, I can just feel people like really are we gonna talk about them again?

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.080
 Do we have to talk about them again? Yeah, I think

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.000
 So in this case

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.080
 I mean if people have asked us to talk about it, um, and I think I have some information that's or maybe just a perspective

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:24.160
 That's a little bit different. So another thing that happened this week, which was funny is

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.000
 Oh, wait, man. There's so much that happened now. I'm remembering. Okay. Mm-hmm. So

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.640
 cloudflare dev week is going on

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:36.720
 You know, they're getting a lot of attention in the background the whole ver uh, you know, vercelle had like a little mini drama where like

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.000
 They increased pricing, but they said they decreased it, but it increased for a bunch of people. It was very confusing

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.320
 Uh-huh, so people were like some people were

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.880
 Quote unquote. It's upset by that. You know, like fake upset is

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:54.240
 You know how people are yeah, I know people and there was like, you know, manufacturer drama around all that

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.640
 And a lot of people were talking about how like you can just use a vps and cloudflare

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:04.640
 You can just like this and cloudflare cloudflare's name kept coming up in that conversation. Mm-hmm. And I always found this interesting because

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.600
 I knew that

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:15.120
 So if you if you go back a year ago if you look at vercelle's messaging, they were doing a lot with building on cloudflare, right? They launched

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.400
 Um

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:22.320
 Like middleware they launched uh, they're like edge run quote unquote edge runtime. All itself was built on cloudflare

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:29.040
 To run on cloudflare workers. So in my head, I was like, okay, vercelle has a good relationship with cloudflare

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.280
 And they're like trying to be partners do's together

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.080
 But at some point and so if you go back a year ago vercelle kept talking about how

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:41.440
 Everything is gonna move to edge. Like you're gonna put all yourself on edge your code is gonna run edge edge edge

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.240
 There was kind of obsessively hammering that that forward and you imagine that's like a technical

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.920
 Presentation, but really it's a result of like, you know, then like seeing opportunity and building on top of cloudflare

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.920
 So they're like pushing this direction very quickly. They were taught the lesson that

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.160
 Just asking people to run all their stuff at edge doesn't really

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:06.880
 Work because if people are making round trips or database or database in the region, you know, that's like it's not that simple

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.680
 Um, so it didn't like land at least with our bigger customers the way they expected

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:17.520
 Um at the same time. So this is a rumor. So I don't want to like say this as though it's a fact. Yeah

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:25.200
 We're we're good journalists over here. Yes. I'm acknowledging say stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I think at this around the same time

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:32.320
 They I heard a rumor that they signed a deal with AWS like a very serious deal of being like you're gonna build more

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.080
 On AWS. They wouldn't give you better better pricing

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.600
 But like everything you build is gonna be very hws focused

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:46.080
 And I found and at the time I was like that's a weird because it seems like they were like super into cloudflare and doing cloudflare stuff

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.640
 It's weird they would accept this deal

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.920
 uh

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.040
 To um, you know do more stuff on AWS. Yep

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.600
 And then rsc's came out

00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:00.240
 Right, I'm sure you have to rsc's going out and also the messaging switched messaging switched to

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.960
 rendering at edge is bad never render at edge rsc's render at the region

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:11.840
 And like like it totally it totally pivoted and like all of their technology started to focus on like a complete different architecture

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:18.480
 But the way they free they always phrase it as like this linear progress of like now. This is the next best thing

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.320
 Now this is the next best thing

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.560
 But to me, this is just a reflection of

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.920
 They made this deal with AWS, you know rumored

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.240
 Yeah, and now all their stuff goes back to rendering at region inside

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:35.360
 You know runtimes and all the stuff they're like blabbering on about ppr like all this crap

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.360
 It's all just weird workarounds

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.840
 For that specific architecture

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.120
 um

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.160
 So that's like the transition i was witnessing then on friday

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.640
 Like gromo finally snapped and you see this stuff he tweeted about

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:53.760
 Yeah, so deep in some again these stupid annoying people being like

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.880
 Oh, just five dollar bps and throw cloud flare in front of it, which yeah, yeah, I'm a huge fan of cloud flare

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.240
 But again, these people don't it just do with a super conversation

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:07.200
 I think after a week of having like all this like a bad launch week, basically

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.520
 Uh gromo snapped and started like shitting on cloud flare

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.440
 He was like, oh really?

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.960
 You guys don't know how misleading their pricing is like they're lying about this

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.840
 Oh, I did see this

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.720
 He like he was like matthew is like cleverly rebranding this stuff to trick you

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.920
 Yeah

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:29.760
 He's like first name calling like the CEO of like a public company. It was really hard

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.240
 Yeah, he started to say stuff like

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.200
 Performance on our network is better like we have better reliability on our network

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.040
 I'm like I sort of roll my eyes here. I'm like

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.160
 What do you mean your network?

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:48.720
 Shit, like this is you're just talking about it for cell global network. You can use for cells global accelerator

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.040
 You can use for cell WAF

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:59.200
 For cell lambda how deluded are you to like claim that you have better performance than

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.720
 Right

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.760
 A company sitting like at a much lower level on your net and the cloud flare is at its issues

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.080
 It had downtime this past week, you know, that stuff happens of course

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:16.320
 But it was such a weird call-out where like they're like calling out this much larger

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:22.640
 Like more legit company on this thing and so to me, I was like, okay, clearly something

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.960
 This is like confirmation like that relationship is sour. Mm-hmm. And

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.920
 They're not really betting on building more of their infrastructure that way

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.200
 Yeah, and from the cloud flare perspective, I'm sure it's frustrating on their side because if we're so never really properly

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.400
 Demoed what's possible through cloud flare workers because

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:46.880
 Their architecture was so weird that they would always like route through AWS first so they never fully took advantage of workers properly

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.400
 Yeah

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.400
 So yeah, like all this stuff is kind of happening in the background but from the end user's perspective

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:57.920
 They're just seeing the quote-unquote progress of like next year's the new features and like here's what you should care about these

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:04.800
 We should recap, but these are just like they're factoring in the constraints they have from yeah from these deals that they're cloud deals working out

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:10.720
 Yeah, when you're a cloud reseller. We've spent a lot of time and a lot of mental energy goes into

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.160
 Working with different clouds because you don't have a cloud

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.840
 Yeah, yeah

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:22.560
 So there's juggling all this stuff and figuring out workarounds and this whole PPR thing is so stupid like they're like people are obsessively repeating it

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:29.120
 And literally everyone that's tried to tell me that it's important. I tweeted this the other day not a single person could explain it correctly to me

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.240
 And yeah, it's really it's not because they're dumb

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.440
 It's actually a really confusing concept because it's actually doing

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:41.760
 So little it's doing so little but being positioned as this big thing that it's very confusing

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.320
 and it's only the result of the fact that

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:50.400
 A very versatile specific infrastructure like it starts to make sense to have something like that. Yeah

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:57.920
 And it's not just for sale, but there is this problem when you're kind of a layer on top of the necessary layer

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:02.480
 Where you have to like invent things that are like this is important

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:08.560
 Just because you have to have a reason to use your thing like what what is the if you're just reselling someone else's service

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.120
 you got to invent all these like

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.240
 higher level

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.040
 Concepts that don't necessarily they're not rooted in like real problems all the time

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.840
 Yeah, especially the thing where he like started like try to pick a fight with cloud flare like the thing

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:27.040
 He was like posting screenshots of like their argo pricing which really has nothing to do with anything

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.160
 An end user of cloud flare will run into yeah, that's something vercell probably ran into it

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:36.240
 Try as someone trying to build something on top of cloud flare, but he was kind of positioning it as like no

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.240
 they do charge for bandwidth and

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:43.040
 Uh, yeah, it's like extremely misleading and it was interesting to see that like snap

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.840
 Because when I see a snap i'm like there's real fear there

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.240
 Um, so he's like afraid of to some degree of the growth of cloud

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.640
 If he wasn't afraid of it, he would want to send anything, you know if people just build on cloud flare they don't need

00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:01.120
 For sell, I guess um, they could still use next to s and deploy to cloud flare, but but like vercell

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:07.680
 If if next to s does really well and the vercell commercial products tank vercell is a company does not do really well

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.480
 Right. They don't make money on people using next JS

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:16.240
 Like that's their funnel into vercell services. Yeah, no. No. Yeah, it's not good if people don't

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.840
 If a large percent of people don't use use vercell, but yeah, I think the other thing that's interesting is

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.040
 I think people forget that the world is not static

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.800
 so

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.800
 there was probably a time where

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.400
 Uh using vercell was probably like

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:39.520
 A massive difference from not using it. Mm. But the world is not static. There's new things that show up new products

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:45.440
 That show up things get easier like things get figured out and you can't assume that this 10x benefit

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.760
 Is there forever. Yeah, it's right. You got to constantly find new things and I think that's kind of what people are realizing. They're like

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.720
 Yeah, like compared to five years ago

00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:00.000
 This probably is like much better, but compared to now other we have like, you know, it does know there are options that are

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.200
 Maybe not as good, but like the gap isn't really there. Yeah

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:09.520
 And it was crazy about building stuff and tech like any advantage you have or just business in general any advantage you have in a good market will

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:14.560
 Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's tough. Like just thinking vercell strategically

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:20.880
 like they're they're fighting that the infrastructure battle like having to worry about all these infrastructure providers or

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.920
 Open source tools like sst things eating them on that side

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.680
 Then also just the framework side like astro can come along and be the bigger thing

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.560
 Or it could be on some path that gains more adoption and and that eats into next day

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:38.800
 So it's like they're fighting on all fronts to stay relevant. That's tough. Yeah, and that's what's tough on open source company

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.640
 You have two products to defend

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.240
 Yeah, so that's like, you know twice as hard. Yeah

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.840
 The other thing from this week is you see the benchmark i posted

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.040
 Yeah

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.280
 Yeah, that one like that actually went pretty viral and people are starting to like expand on it

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:59.360
 Okay, so my first question is how much does it matter in like a on-demand functions environment like

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.080
 in the world where

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.280
 I mean it's still slower

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.280
 So like rendering your pages or whatever is slower in next js than a react

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.960
 Do you want to explain the benchmark first?

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.400
 Yeah, so the benchmark was comparing the number of requests per second

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:17.360
 You could get through just a simple hello world versatile app and it's not interesting on its own

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:22.720
 It's mostly interesting compared to just using react to server render stuff directly

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.560
 Which of course it's something like this

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.920
 I had a bunch of idiots in the replies being like this doesn't matter like what do you mean?

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:34.000
 You're comparing reacting the browser to next in the server and like people just didn't understand that yeah react on its own

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.440
 Can take JSX and spit out like a stream to send down from the server?

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.400
 Yep, that's the best performance you can possibly get because there's no overhead

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:49.440
 The interesting part was a gap and actually it is so much slower. It was getting my and that setup was getting 400

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.760
 requests a second

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.360
 It was like 170 times slower than just using react directly

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:59.760
 So all the overhead that next adds like that's the bloat and I found it interesting because it's like

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:06.640
 Okay, this is that gap is what represents all the stuff that next added and the question is like is that sound

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.240
 Right like the features they add require that much

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.880
 bonus

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:19.120
 That was a benchmark and yeah, I the same thought as you like request per second like how does that translate to like a serverless world

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.280
 It's tricky

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.280
 So it matters and it doesn't matter

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.160
 It doesn't matter in that the parallelization is happening at a different layer in lambda

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.720
 Like there's a lower level system. That's like spinning up things that are running

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.320
 Um, but that lower level system is always

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.720
 More inefficient than like something that's scaling within

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:45.920
 Each thing. Yeah, and there is talk about having like allowing lambda functions to

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.440
 Handle more than one request at a time

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.000
 Like oh right now

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.720
 You go ahead. Yeah, so right now there's a problem where

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.080
 A lot of people spent by lambda function. It gets a request

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:04.560
 Let's say there's 50 milliseconds in that request where it's just waiting on IO. It's waiting for third party service or database

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.120
 Uh that container is not doing anything

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.760
 It's already up. It's already warm. It's ready to take another request if another request comes in AWS

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.280
 We'll spin up another container. So that's inefficient on

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.880
 Yeah, ground level you're putting in a bunch of work. So the lambda scaling thing is just inefficient in general

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.840
 It's very generic and works for anything

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.840
 but like

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:31.600
 In a focused way in terms of like efficiently using resources, it's not efficient. So I know world where lambda allows you to have

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.760
 Reuse existing container for the second request. This sort of some matter again

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.960
 Okay, so it and it does matter anyway because like you said

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:46.080
 I mean still less efficient use of resources if it takes longer to render your page more compute

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.120
 Yeah, it makes sense. Yeah, yeah, it's interesting

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:53.680
 I mean like they build so much stuff on top of react all these features that they build I guess

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.400
 Makes sense that there's a trade-off

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.160
 Well, it's sort of then people were like, okay, let's go check the other frameworks

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.240
 And remix

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.800
 Is also slower than react, but it's five times slower not 170 times. Yeah, you know

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.040
 And they checked like spellkit. They checked solid. They checked a bunch of these things

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.440
 So the interesting results were kind of interesting

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.080
 It's fun to see

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:20.240
 But yeah, man like those like those are really surprising numbers

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.040
 I could like 400 requests a second is like really bad

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.360
 Yeah, do you ever wonder like

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:31.680
 Does it feel like we pick on I don't know. Are we picking on resell in next year's like why are they so easy to to dislike?

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.520
 Because so things like this. It's like objectively numbers bad

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.880
 But you say it and it's like just feels like we're beating up on them all the time

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.280
 and it's like why do we do that but

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.360
 Oh, I feel like it's their fault. I don't know

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.760
 I don't feel like I just make fun of people for no reason

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:51.600
 Yeah, if you want to play if you want to play a brand where it's like where the best were elites

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.640
 I guess all this shit

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.880
 They were saying how they're better than cloud flare if you want to like play that game. You're gonna get you got to back it up

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.920
 A proportion of her response, right? So yeah, I uh

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.880
 Yeah, I don't I don't feel any like weird about that

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.800
 I feel like cloud flares in this this is totally kind of tendential. They're in such a great position where

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:16.640
 Everybody loves it. It's public like they've made it like they're a big company with all this crazy infrastructure and advantages

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:21.280
 Uh, but like still people like me love cloud flare and don't really use it

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.600
 So like I didn't know there was downtime. They don't get any of the like downsides of you know

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.760
 I mean like when you have tons of people depending on your stuff

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.240
 It's like still so early but yet not early where they get to like if a tree falls in the forest. Nobody here sees it

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.200
 Does it happen? Was there actually cloud flare downtime? I don't know

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.440
 I love cloud flare

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.840
 It's funny because like that is a because they have

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:46.640
 They have a successful business has nothing to do with anything that we really touch right?

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.320
 Yeah, that's like where they that's why they've got big and now they're expanding to this new market

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:57.120
 And they're like early like they're treated like any early company there where like it's mostly excitement people aren't using it enough to

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.600
 Know the rough edges know the pain points are getting have gotten screwed by it to some degree

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.600
 Eventually, I think people will land in a more reasonable place. Yeah

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:10.800
 My goal it's funny. Like I was like, okay, our goal with all the sst cloud flare stuff is

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.480
 You know every month someone posts a tweet about how the AWS console sucks

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.720
 I want that to switch to a tweet about how the cloud flare console sucks because that'll happen

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.800
 Like with more people using cloud for other people like what the hell's wrong with this console

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.680
 Yeah, so is it possible to have like for one of these

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.960
 cloud providers to have a good console because I feel like

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:33.600
 That it's like two separate problems and I don't know what the like first principles

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.680
 like

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:42.640
 Grounded in physics reasons for this is but I feel like there's got to be a company like AWS and cloud flare that has all the underlying infrastructure

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.600
 They have all the physical stuff deployed and all the people swapping drives out and doing all that stuff

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.040
 the they're like the electricity provider or whatever

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:58.320
 And then they're fundamentally going to have such a wide surface area that there's no way to build a single like

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.880
 unified

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:06.560
 Console that makes sense unless you just built multiple of them for each of the specific types of use cases like

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.040
 These these like utility provider level infrastructure companies like AWS

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.600
 That can handle like millions of different use cases because they have millions of different customers

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:22.640
 So I feel like there's it's like this untractable impossible problem to build a console that like everyone loves

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.600
 On top of AWS because they've got 200 plus services, whatever

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.760
 So it feels like there has to be this next layer of companies that build

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:34.160
 a shrink wrapped experience for a specific use case on top of

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.400
 The the underlying thing or do you think there's some way that they could solve this problem?

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:42.240
 I mean they have all the resources in the world. I guess they could just hire enough teams to build enough consoles

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:48.400
 That one i'm good. I don't know. Okay. So I think they're I think a lot of what you're saying is true, especially in the AWS case like

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:53.200
 AWS case is the console is basically a one-to-one reflection of their public API

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.480
 Like it just maps things directly which makes sense like that

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.200
 Makes sense for what you would build a console with

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:04.480
 But there's so like a range of how well you execute even on that like in the cloud floor case

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:11.280
 I think the ux of their console is not bad. I do find some their stuff confusing. I think it's that's just they have like

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.160
 Quite a few products a lot of them are like

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:18.080
 Still kind of early so it's kind of confusing what they are the documentation is sparse

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.600
 If you ignore all of that because you can assume that it's better

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:29.920
 Yeah, the console's slow as shit like there's spinners everywhere anytime I try to do anything that is spinners and that is a pure execution thing like

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.880
 uh, the effort wasn't put in to be like

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.640
 Let's pretend to power users using this like where they are frustrated

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:42.080
 And yeah, like when i'm clicking through there like why is every the amount of data i'm looking through is probably like less than a

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.480
 Megabyte for everything i have deployed in there

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:52.080
 Yeah, like why is there just spinners on every single page transition i think i don't even notice because i'm not like

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.800
 uh extreme

00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:00.480
 Web performance peeled like you are i feel like you've looked at so many like the five good web apps in the world so much

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.600
 That like you see everything else so much harsher and i just don't even feel it because it's like yeah

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.920
 This is most of the web you do feel it i don't feel it but i just i just don't feel it

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.400
 You might not even consciously register it but yeah

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:17.520
 It's at the end of the day. It's like you do feel like as if i asked you the question

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:22.480
 If i told you oh, can you go fix one two three things and i go use a cloud threat console to do that

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.720
 Are you excited to do that or you're like fine i'll do it. It's like a task, right?

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:33.360
 So that's like that's kind of where you end up feeling it. Yeah, I know it's a problem. I just think like

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:39.440
 I probably am more in the camp that when i use a really good one of the like five really good web apps

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.720
 It's more like a positive wow, this is really great versus like feeling the pain

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:50.240
 I know i definitely feel it extremely just because i've started these apps too much

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:56.880
 Uh, yeah, it's actually i think of as a sacrifice i've like sacrificed my ability to enjoy

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:03.920
 Can't be internet tool like i hate every single thing so much but in exchange all like, you know

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:09.520
 Help people understand how to make stuff really good. It really comes down to just caring a whole lot right?

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:18.560
 Alluring about that dimension. Yeah, yeah, and it's like these providers typically don't do a good job with last mile tooling

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.720
 Like we've seen that with AWS cloud flare i would say is like 10 times better

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:28.480
 But it's still challenging for them. It's like i think it's tricky to get the right people

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.240
 To do that stuff who also understand all the rest of the things

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.760
 That's what the acquisitions they made are interesting because i think it brings like that type of person

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:42.560
 Into the company and we'll see if the company's structure allows them to actually do what they do well

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:48.480
 Uh, if they fail to deliver something good, then you kind of know that it's like a corporate structure thing

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.520
 The company is too big and because you see people deliver well

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.720
 Okay, so uh

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.880
 You just cemented you cemented a theory that i'm just going in my brain right now

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.720
 And if you can see the wheels turning like when i'm thinking hard, it's pretty visible in my face

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.000
 You can just tell me if this is something like paul grams already tweeted like 10 times

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.120
 But there's this theory in my mind now that shaping up where

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:13.600
 There's only like 0.001 percent of the population that cares a whole lot about everything they do

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.880
 There's this tiny amount of the population on the earth

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:23.200
 That like sweats every little detail and just cares about like they're very in just intense about everything they do right

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:30.080
 And the bigger an organization so startups filled with these people and there's like a 10 person startup

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:34.240
 Maybe half of them are like that. Yeah, but the bigger the organization organization gets

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:39.600
 So a to bus a to bs the size you're just deluding down the amount of cares that your organization has

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:46.000
 The amount of f's that it gives right because there's only so many people so when a company the cloud player size

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.480
 They're smaller than a bs they have a higher percentage of caring

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:58.080
 Right or just high output individuals or just good at what they do people so when they acquire little companies that are

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.640
 chock full of the cares

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.840
 Right and they're just improving that. Okay. So is it all tied together? Did I make any sense?

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:13.280
 Yeah, no, I mean that that makes sense. The other flip side though is there's some stat where it's like 90 percent of mna is a failure

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.880
 I think I know we talked about before. Yeah, I believe that. Yeah. Yeah, this that is so ridiculous that i'm just like how

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:25.280
 How are people still acquiring companies when it's this bad? It's like it's mostly going to be something that doesn't work out

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.440
 So yeah, I guess my question would be how do they measure that and what I mean is like

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:36.160
 There's no way to measure the impact of those individuals that they acquired because so much of it's just buying the people the team

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:41.680
 Is there really a way to I guess like sales revenue there's ways to quantify it, but like

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:47.440
 Can they really capture? Yeah, I think there's like a subjective thing you can ask people involved in the deal five years later

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:52.000
 We'll do the deal again. Gotcha. That's a good signal. Yeah, I think that encompasses everything

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.960
 Yeah, no, I don't know if that's how they do it, but I I can see some something like that

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:02.000
 Uh, yeah, yeah, it's a part where I'm like it's crazy that people still acquire companies like yeah

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.040
 It really is what you think about that. I don't want to say that a lot too much because

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.920
 Yeah, I've done it people

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:14.800
 Yeah, I think it's like it's especially it's usually like bad companies that have good market positions acquiring

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.760
 Decent like competitors

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.920
 Mm-hmm and then like that I can see why that doesn't work out because a company sucks and that people

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.520
 Company gets acquired and like most of people quit after

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:31.200
 Six months. Yeah or like just fail to like even be able to be effective in the new company like I totally got that

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.600
 but

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.240
 Yeah, so I don't know like we'll see we'll see what comes out of it

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.840
 And it's like a good reflection of what their culture is like and and how they can kind of preserve. Yeah

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:48.080
 People's care ability. Okay. I've got this super strong urge to talk about literally anything else

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.520
 Do you ever feel like we talk about the same like five things just over and over?

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:56.400
 I mean it makes sense because we're not really thinking about like a podcast or an audience

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.400
 We're literally just having conversations

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.840
 And I think this is something people probably do and they keep having conversations every week with somebody

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.200
 Just keep talking about a lot of the same things because you're kind of refining your thoughts and all that

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:10.800
 But I just really want to talk about literally anything else. I was gonna talk about our plan for next week

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:16.320
 That's exactly what I was just thinking. I was like, oh, that next week because I'm totally healthy and I'm gonna make it and it's gonna be fine

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:22.800
 Okay, so we were flying out on monday monday and you're gonna land around 1 p.m. Eastern

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.320
 Uh-huh

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.400
 So then prime and teach can we talk about like

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:32.960
 That we're all gonna be together. Well, this episode is not gonna come out till monday. So oh, so i'll be in Miami when this episode comes out

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.840
 How weird? Yeah, wait, no, I won't it'll be in the morning

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.560
 Close enough

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:42.640
 I'll be on the plane. I'll basically be here. The reason is podcast adam is basically here

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.520
 Yes, and so and prime is gonna be here in the evening. I think he's landing at seven

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.280
 Uh, and then tj is getting here around the same time as you i think around noon

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.680
 But i think i'll be able to pick both of you guys up

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.600
 Um, but i'll see

00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:00.160
 Some we've got the first two day first day. We're just gonna be setting up and figuring out

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:04.880
 Our structure because we're gonna be streaming on tuesday and wednesday. Oh, that's right

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.920
 So we're not streaming till tuesday. So we've got all monday to get everything set up

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:11.280
 all the equipment and like just grab whatever lost many things we need to

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.680
 We need to buy

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.120
 How are we gonna do this?

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.920
 I think we need to actually play in a little bit on this call and i'm sorry podcast listeners

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.440
 You're just gonna have to hear it, but because you don't actually know what we're doing, but like

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:28.480
 We're gonna set up a spot in your house. Yeah, like a desk

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:34.320
 And we're and then your desk that you're setting up right now. We can use that desk too. I guess it's already set up

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:41.280
 So I have this outdoor patio area, which I think is gonna be really good for that because we can all sit around this big table that I have

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.480
 Can I take a nap in the hammock if i'm not feeling well? Is that a yes?

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.360
 Okay, we can have a camera on the hammock. Yeah

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.400
 For the sleeping person

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.680
 So I think that can be the main area and it shouldn't be too hard to set up

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.560
 The only thing I got to figure out is and this isn't this is not a problem

00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.720
 We would have the mosquito candles going all day. They're pretty effective. Yes, please. So that's fine

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.120
 Um, but also I found what actually works really well is if in the morning

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.880
 I just spend five minutes killing them all with my electric racket

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.680
 Like what

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.680
 An electric racket is like an electric tennis rack. It looks like a tennis racket

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:23.040
 But it's electric and you're swinging and it makes the loudest most satisfying noise. It like explodes when they kill some contact

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:27.280
 Yeah, it's like it's like you're you're gonna hear it and you're gonna understand the satisfaction

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:31.680
 And there's like a whiff of smoke. They like explode and disintegrate

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.120
 Have you ever considered like life from like an insects perspective

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.920
 Like think of the things they have to worry about and just introduced electric

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.040
 Tennis rackets into that like these giant monkeys

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.680
 Swing these flaming instruments at them that just disintegrate them

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:54.080
 Like can you imagine them telling their kids about how not to go outside the the like tree or something because this is what you'll have to

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.160
 Anyway, so I'm just gonna get more into this. So I don't kill anything except mosquitoes

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.200
 Like the rest of the like the moths and stuff like they don't really bother me

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:07.360
 Um, but mosquitoes like I wasn't trying to make like an animal rights. No, no. I know. I know but my point is

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:13.600
 Uh, it's not there. There's usually just like four or five that are around and if you just you can freeze to get them all

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.200
 Uh, the one that my technique is I sit in one chair

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.520
 And I put my feet up on another chair and eventually mosquitoes come to the bike bite my legs

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.840
 And then I just fuck them up

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.600
 Uh, then i'm also really this on camera

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.800
 The other thing i'm setting up is I had this I got the stuff for this a while ago

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:39.600
 But I never set it up. There's like a trap you can build you build like the perfect the perfect place for mosquitoes to lay their eggs

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:43.840
 Like their dream place to have babies. It's like a bucket of water

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:49.040
 Full of a bunch of like leaves and stuff to make it like release carbon and it's like their dream spot

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:55.120
 But you put these things they're called mosquito dumps and like they're not even toxic and they happen to only kill

00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:01.760
 Mosquito larva. So you set this up and you're like oh, fuck. Yeah, it's best place to lay my eggs and then

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:06.880
 It kills the children and get killed. Oh my god. They just stop and eventually they just stop, you know

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:13.440
 Like they're not around. I don't know where this mosquito empathy is coming from because I hate mosquitoes so much

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.040
 And yeah, if there's anything in the world like brutality of what i'm talking about

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:23.600
 Yeah, it's just starting to sound like a sadistic. I don't know like you're getting some you are getting some enjoyment out of murdering

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.640
 You suck in my blood. So I know yeah, they deserve it

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.120
 It's if there's any creature in the world that deserves it. It's mosquitoes

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:34.400
 Why do the sea does exist like what purpose do they serve from an evolutionary standpoint or whatever?

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.640
 How does that? I don't know. I just feel like they're knowing this for disease

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:43.360
 Not not so much in America, but in other places. Yeah. Yeah, there's a truck that drives around in our neighborhood

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.360
 Like on Wednesdays and it sprays this like gas. You have you seen that

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:51.200
 First time it happened and I didn't know what it was. It's like oh my word

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.640
 we're being like 11 in your memories

00:45:54.640 --> 00:46:00.800
 Like this truck comes by just shooting gas is like a foggy all over

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:07.040
 Wild but kills them skittos but that the problem with if that is it kills a lot of stuff. I think oh really

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.360
 I'm surprised they do that without like

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:14.240
 Asking yeah, because here you like higher city to come do that on your property

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:19.680
 Oh, interesting. Yeah, it's just the city that has this truck and they drive it around the boys love to watch it

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.280
 But we run inside because I don't want to be exposed to it. I don't know what it is

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.680
 So aside from that, I'm sure we can get those under control

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.280
 There's some days where we spend most of the day outside and it's very comfortable

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:32.000
 The weather is really good. It's not going to be hot or anything if it does get hot

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.360
 Yeah, what is the weather right now? I can always look it up, but I just like to ask someone

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:40.160
 It is like this whole month has been like the best weather ever. It's like

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:47.120
 Exactly a little under 80 degrees with like a nice breeze. Nice. Perfect. Yeah, it's like

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:51.840
 80s then it's a little warm for my taste getting hotter every day

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.440
 So I don't know what it'll be like next week, but it's generally been very comfortable

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.280
 So we're gonna we're gonna set up some cameras

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:01.840
 We're gonna stream multiple time like multiple people streaming at once. How are we doing?

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.880
 I don't know what we're gonna do. I think we have to get there and play with some setup

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.120
 I figure you have multiple cameras and we'll rotate between them, but I don't know what happens when

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.280
 Is there it like?

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.720
 Someone's gonna be working on the thing which I assume prime will be

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.400
 His screen should be shared. So yeah, I don't I don't know how much

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.080
 We'll probably like rotate between a few different setups

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:27.200
 Yeah, and then so prime is working on the front end so to speak

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:33.680
 You've already built the back end. You're gonna build the back end. Almost is basically done. Yeah, and yeah, so a few more things

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.680
 an API

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.680
 the front he's working on

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:42.800
 We'll see how it goes. There's like you're speaking to my my slight trepidation

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.440
 my anxiety over this

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.760
 because like

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:53.040
 The tools we're using to build is quite unique front end are very good, but

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.960
 There's a learning curve

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.360
 It's like a very different mental model and yeah

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.200
 If I take a little bit to understand what the fuck did how the fuck we're doing

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.680
 Yeah, um, but I built something with it

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:09.200
 So I have like some sense and I'm like a little bit familiar with the programming model from something I've worked on before

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.520
 But even then it's like you might need to be sitting with prime and breaking my brain

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:19.360
 I have real work to do. I'm working on real stuff. Wait, not related to our project next week

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.440
 Well, I mean, I don't know what we can't walk off. We can't hold his work on this

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:27.520
 Together like it doesn't really make sense. That's true. But there's so much to do

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:34.080
 Physically the manager is gonna be me and you I think yeah, I'm very excited. I'm very excited about it

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.200
 So the bizarre stuff. Yes, I can I can work on that

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.640
 um

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.000
 So we'll do that

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.200
 Hopefully that gets set up. We're gonna probably have to buy a few things

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.240
 So we streamed Tuesday and Wednesday and then thursday is a conference

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:51.440
 Yeah, thursday is my my party which is around two p.m. Oh my god. I had a dream yesterday that

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.280
 uh

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.280
 like my party happened and like

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.520
 Eight people showed up

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.080
 And nobody was talking to each other was really awkward

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.440
 I was just kind of sitting around and I was like waiting for like my friends to show up

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.680
 Like the people I like wanted to come

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:10.800
 Like I just kept in the clock checking the clock and just kept getting closer and closer to the time that the party would be over

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.440
 And I was like dreams are awesome

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.840
 I woke up and I was like

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.600
 Oh my god, like what if that happens and I was like that's so unrealist

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:24.160
 That's the most unrealistic dream that like nobody would show up and it would just be completely boring. Nobody talking to each other

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.200
 And I was like that would be really bad if that's what happened

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.560
 Can I just say it sounds kind of awesome actually I kind of hope that happens now

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.480
 I know something about the awkwardness of it sounds kind of great like eight people

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.680
 I don't know we'd have some great conversation by the end there'd be like camaraderie

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.920
 We'd all bond over this weird shared experience sounds fun as long as I'm one of the eight people

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:47.600
 I think what in my dream what happened was so I basically invited a bunch of people I knew and then I invited a bunch of people that like

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.400
 I don't know that well

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.920
 Or like don't know as many people of the other people and only those people showed up

00:49:53.920 --> 00:50:00.080
 So there was no like there wasn't anyone to like connect everyone together. Yeah, everyone's kind of standing around like not

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:06.160
 Yeah, very detailed dream. Yeah dreams are awesome. I don't always have dreams. Sometimes I have dreams

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.000
 Yeah, I really have dreams. I was uh

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 I literally have them when I wake up and go back to sleep

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.040
 Which is what I did this morning

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.280
 I did that this morning wait when you say wake up and go back to sleep

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:17.200
 What time did you wake up and then go back to sleep like around the time I should have woke up and not

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.920
 Oh, you went back to sleep like in the morning hours

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:23.280
 Because I always wake up in the middle of the night like literally every single night

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.040
 Two or three

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.040
 Uh, and it's uh, it's just like a 50/50 shot if I'll be able to fall back to sleep

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.760
 And last night I woke up that I fell back to sleep

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.480
 So not the same thing. Do you have a dream? Uh, I did have a dream last night. I don't remember what it was

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:40.160
 Why is it that you can't remember as soon as you like start trying to think about it?

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.720
 It's like going away falling out of your hands. It's like you're grasping at it. The more you grasp the more

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.960
 Uh-huh. It falls out. It's like I feel like the whole dream was in my memory just now

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.800
 And then it just like the more I tried to find it

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.000
 It just went away

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 What's happening is when you're asleep

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.520
 Uh, your brain goes into a state where it connects to your alternate lives in other dimensions and you witness

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.920
 Oh, you witness what's happening to them

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:08.320
 And then when you wake up interesting you lose that connection and you can't really remember what happened

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.640
 Man every time I think about like multiverse stuff

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:16.400
 I spend like three days just like in an existential crisis thinking about all this and then I forget about it and I live

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.160
 I'll move on

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.840
 Oh, I learned about the grossest thing. I hate when I learned about something like this

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.840
 So I'm gonna share it with everyone. Uh, if you're heard of like these skin mites

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:30.720
 They're like just living in your face. Yeah, they're like they run across your face while you sleep

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:35.520
 Yeah, there's like little pictures of like every pore on your face and like these little mites or just they're a little tail sticking out

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.360
 It's disgusting

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.800
 But I forgot about it. So there's hope you guys I just taught you about it

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.040
 And you're gonna look it up and Wikipedia or whatever

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.680
 But then you'll forget and a few weeks you'll forget and you're good. It's cool. Okay. Thank you for that

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:51.200
 This is a good transition

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.920
 So I have to ask you a question

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:59.200
 So logistically, how are we gonna feed you because you eat weird stuff? Oh man. I hate this

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:03.360
 This is top number one reason or top three

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:05.760
 Uh that it sucks to be a vegan is

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:10.320
 People just have a different stance toward you as soon as you come out and you're like i'm plant-based

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.360
 People they just feel bad when they

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.880
 I don't feel bad. I just want to figure it out

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:20.400
 Eating eating is such a like fundamental part of our social fiber. Yes, it becomes more fraught

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.760
 Well, okay, so maybe you don't have any weird feelings, but everyone else in my life

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.160
 It's just this is no uncomfortable tension. I get it like adds it adds

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:33.360
 So eating together is like so fundamental and straightforward and basic and there's like yeah

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:38.400
 Like we all know the protocol for that, but then would people when people have varying diets it like

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:43.440
 It like puts a kink into something that's very like tough. Yeah straight forward otherwise

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.880
 So to make it tougher, I'm not gonna give you any answers. You're just gonna figure. I'm just kidding

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.240
 Like like can you they're using a order of food for yourself

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:54.320
 I'm gonna say if you don't mind when I travel I love to just like explore

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:58.080
 Uber eats in the area and like find all the cool vegan spots

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.840
 If you don't mind I just order some food in and I'll eat it while you guys eat other stuff

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:08.160
 Okay, if that's cool with you. That's great. Yeah, because I figured uh that we would I mean, I don't know like

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:13.680
 Primary tj are describing like they're gonna be streaming for like 40 hours straight, which i'm just like

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:21.920
 Is that what's gonna happen or like i'm very skeptical like everyone is not young

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.840
 Yeah, yeah, that's a great way to call us old. That's not young

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:31.760
 I'm pretty sure people are gonna want their sleep, but I figured we just we maybe order food for lunch

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:35.360
 The lunches and then we maybe like go out somewhere in the evening

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:40.480
 Um and most places here have like good vegan options. Anyway, yeah, but i'm also not

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.360
 Worried if we go out to dinner at normal

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:49.360
 Normal uh human dinner times and I don't eat because I usually stop eating pretty early in the day

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:52.800
 So it's it works out if you guys want to go to a place and I don't have vegan options

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.240
 I probably just don't need to eat in the evening. Anyway, if that makes sense

00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:01.360
 There is that place that vegan place by me where i'm like, i'm never gonna go here unless adam's here because like oh, yeah

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.400
 At some point. Yeah

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:08.480
 I think they deliver stuff so we could order from there

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.160
 um

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:16.720
 Okay, so that's that we might like barbeque one of the evenings. I'll bring some of my uh mycelian mushroom steaks

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:22.240
 They're delicious. Do you have to bring them? Can we just come here? I'll find some at the at the whole foods or something

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.040
 Yeah, we got some good good producers here

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.320
 Um

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:31.680
 Yeah, figure we could we could do that. So that's a food situation. Yeah, and then yeah thursday

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:36.880
 Is the opening part of my party then the opening thursday is gonna be one big party

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.960
 We got so much stuff like for the party like just a ton of alcohol

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:46.160
 Yeah, yeah, I posted a picture that I realized my license plate was just like fully visible so I deleted it

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:51.520
 That's awesome. I was like I think i like think harder about these things

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:59.360
 Um, but that picture was only like half of it because it was obscuring all stuff behind it like liz went nuts at costco

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:04.080
 Um to look like a giant box of blow pops like it's blow pops

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:10.240
 Yeah, just like the suckers with gum in them. Yeah, it's always weird when you realize like

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:15.760
 Yeah, products still exist. They wouldn't go away if people keep buying them. I don't I don't know why I thought they didn't exist anymore

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.600
 But that's so wild

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:24.000
 This green pops still a thing. Yeah, they are and baby bottle pops are a thing like it's it's it's funny

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.080
 Well, we were

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:29.680
 We were at a grocery store the other day and we were like walking through the island

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:33.920
 I'm like who the hell is like coming to this fancy as gross store? I'm buying like

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:38.640
 this really like over the top like single-use candy

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:42.400
 And then she pointed out that all of them

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:47.760
 Everything in that category was at like waist level on the shelf

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.640
 Which is I level for children kids

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:57.520
 So she's like it's just like optimized to like a track there. I can't explain how hard it is to go to the grocery store with kids

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.160
 Just

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:04.400
 What's that? Oh, they're just like can I have this? Can I have this? Oh, yeah, we're just grabbing stuff

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.360
 And like there's glass and you're just it's it's terrifying

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:12.400
 I just don't take them to the store anymore. We just we order stuff into cart grocery

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:16.880
 Like three times more expensive one into cart something stupid like that two times. I don't know way more expensive

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:21.680
 It's kind of ridiculous, but it's so convenient every time I do it. I'm like, I shouldn't do this

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.760
 We should just go get these things as the store

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.800
 But it's just so convenient when they just bring it to your house

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:31.280
 I love it and I'm supporting the gig economy or something. I don't think it paid well. They probably don't

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.520
 We overall find it a worse experience to insta car to go in there

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:41.520
 No, no, we we find getting gorgeous delivered to be a worse experience

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:48.560
 Why because there is just like there's decisions that they can't make for you and sometimes they have your decisions fruit like

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:52.320
 We don't give any produce. Yeah. Yeah, it's like yeah, like produce

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:54.160
 You like want to be able to pick out

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:57.040
 Sometimes they like replace things in a weird way and you like miss their message

00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.600
 It just like adds at least for us it adds a lot

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:05.120
 Stuff yeah, I get that and like going to the great store is like extremely convenient for us

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.560
 Like there's one that we can really walk to then there's like there's like another

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.120
 Cool place across the street that we drive to

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:16.080
 Uh, and there's like a whole foods. I know yeah before kids. We loved going to the grocery store

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:20.960
 Like it was a there's an experience when we get some food and they have smoothies there and stuff like that

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:26.080
 It's a good time. Yeah, so we generally like going but we'll see if that changes. Yeah someday. Okay

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.000
 so

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.320
 the party we

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.520
 So I think you guys will you're gonna be at your hotel

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:37.200
 Wednesday night

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.920
 You can probably come over whenever you want thursday morning

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.600
 And then we can set up you can help us set up for the party

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.440
 Yeah, I don't know if there's too much like we have a cleaning person coming and we're gonna have like tear down

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.560
 I guess all the streaming setup. Yeah, because we'll be done streaming at that point

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:53.440
 Yeah, so just like putting all that up and and getting it ready

00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:57.440
 But there's not there's not too much to do and hopefully people start showing up people will show up

00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.640
 How many people signed up? Okay, I was gonna say here's what's gonna happen

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:05.040
 It's either going to be that 10 people show up or a hundred people show up

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:09.520
 It probably all depends on travel like people will want to be there. It's just

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:12.320
 Work out. Yeah, where they get in on time

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:17.760
 But it's just it's this thing where like I started inviting people and then like like very early

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.160
 You're gonna kept inviting more and more people

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:24.240
 Because like you know, there's a certain level of like yeah, you gotta make it

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:28.880
 But then I guess in the last week like no one's really thinking about this up to the last week

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:33.920
 This past week. I've had like a bunch of people being like, oh, hey, can I bring this person or like no

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.360
 I use other people. Yeah, I can make it now. So now it's like really

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:43.680
 Inflating it's like you're like an airline. You just overlook the flight and you're just hoping half the people show up

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:48.480
 It's like you have to do it that way, but it's like if everybody shows up. We're screwed

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:54.320
 Not nearly enough blow pop. That's true. Actually, no, I'm like oh and we have catering coming. We have like this really good

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.720
 uh

00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:02.080
 Mexican place that's gonna deliver stuff nice, but me and lizards talking yesterday and we're like

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:05.680
 Looking around our backyard. We're like what would it be like if there were 50 people here?

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:13.200
 Then I noticed that uh, my patio has like tile on the ground. So I was like, okay, imagine each person standing on a tile

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:17.040
 Let's see how many tiles we have and you know like

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:22.160
 It could it's like actually not that many people like we definitely handle like a lot like when I thought about it in terms of tiles

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:29.040
 Like every person sitting on a tile like 50 people only takes up like two thirds of the patio and then we have the whole backyard. So so okay

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.960
 Yeah

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.960
 Anyway, we're really excited. We should try that when everybody's there. We should all stand on a tile

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.200
 Just for this experiment to see how

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:41.040
 First I did one tile per person and I was like this might be too cramped

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:45.920
 Let's try like four tiles per person and see how that works and I like took up the whole patio

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:50.560
 Uh, but people were more space apart, you know, you remember during covid. It was like six feet apart

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:54.560
 Like that. Yeah, there's still places. You'll go like and they've got the little circles in the ground

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.800
 like social distancing

00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:02.320
 They're so embarrassing. They fucking put those all there. Oh my god. And not just that. Okay, so

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.960
 they also had like

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:11.280
 Traffic flow stickers the grocery store where it was like you need to be walking in this direction in this aisle

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.880
 And if you like want to use this aisle

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.600
 You gotta like come in from the other side and walk straight and of course

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:21.440
 I gotta pay attention to any of the acts. I'm like this is so stupid. Like what are they trying to avoid like collages between people?

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:28.480
 It's so funny that your mind like immediately goes down stupid it is and I'm just such a like

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.200
 Rule follower and I have this big weird hang up with authority

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.880
 Like if anybody tries to take charge and like being command of a situation

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.480
 I want to follow them. I'm like I will follow whatever they do

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.160
 So when a business does stupid stuff even if it's stupid, I'm like, yes

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.600
 Yes, sir. I will follow your lines and your circles

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:53.120
 And I just don't even question it and then I hear you talking like yeah, that is stupid. Why did I do this?

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.400
 No, so I think my brain works a little bit differently

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:01.920
 So when someone asks me to do something I naturally don't want to do it because I don't want to do anything that I'm not already doing

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.240
 Yeah, so if my first thought is

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.760
 What could happen if I don't do this like one can they even notice can they even catch me

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:15.360
 Two if they do catch me, are they actually going to do anything about it? And if those two things are not very

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.120
 Impressive then I just don't yeah, then you're just saying okay

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.400
 That's fair

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.960
 But that's only because 90 percent of people follow it and I get to like take advantage of you guys by

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:28.480
 By being the one person that does that's me. I'm a sheep

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:36.640
 I'm a sheeple a sheep person. I'm not a sheeple. That's multiple. I'm just a sheep. Just a sheep a sheep person

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:41.680
 A sheep person. All right. I gotta go. I gotta pee and my kids

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.560
 Are done with screen time. They need to be done with screen time

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.640
 I've just had them on screen time this whole time. I'm solo-dadding. I'm a terrible father

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.040
 I can't just let them watch TV all day

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.240
 Now they're gonna come out stupid

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.200
 Were they watching like bluey? They're like

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:03.200
 Bluey? I don't think that's still a show. I think you need to catch up on where kids meet is

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:09.360
 I like just found out about bluey in the past like six months. Is that wait, what is that blue clues? No, that's different. That's not blue.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:15.600
 Bluey is like the new thing. It's very similar as I was like a I'm kind of animal my kids

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.840
 So I have to pee really bad, but I'm gonna try to stay really fast

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:24.000
 My kids watch some of this dumbest show like not like oh, yeah, it's a dumb show like if I watched an old kid show

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.280
 I'd probably think it was dumb, but these days there's so many shows on Netflix. There's no words

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:31.040
 Like it's like animals just doing stuff to each other and there's no words

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.400
 I feel like that's terrible. Like you're not they could at least learn some language or something while they're watching

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.320
 I've been so curious about this because a lot of you describe this

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.000
 Can you like send me a name of one of these shows because I like people keep describing it to me

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.920
 I need to like know what it actually is like I will send you. Yes. I will send you one

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:52.000
 You should check out Netflix kids sometime and just scroll through it. It's a train wreck. Okay. I gotta be okay

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.400
 It's been good. Thanks. Thanks. See you next week

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.760
 You
