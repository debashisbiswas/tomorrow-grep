WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
 I got a pea. Ooh, sounds you make when you got a pea. Oh my God.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.760
 How's the nanny? Fantastic. It's actually a team. We have a small team of nannies.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.600
 We have two. Okay, so one of them can't do

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.880
 enough of the hours. So we found somebody who does want more hours. So we're kind of shifting

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.160
 the one into more of a babysitter ad hoc role and the other into the full-time nanny. Anyway,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.160
 it's a group effort. We have special needs children, literally. But in the other way,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.600
 I could mean that, I guess. I don't know. You're also special. You're also special needs.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.160
 I'm also special needs. Okay. Yeah. Let's talk about that. I'm bipolar, which I think I knew.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.880
 I even found a tweet where I like tweeted something about hypomania. I've probably talked about on

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.280
 this podcast. My memory is very obvious. It's very obvious. Yeah. In retrospect,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.200
 I should have always known. But the thing that's not obvious or the thing that I'm now that I

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.360
 actually have the official U.R. bipolar diagnosis, it's not obvious how life should work or how I

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.160
 should be. Like, I enjoy being manic or hypomanic. I'm not sure that I'm actually manic. I'm just

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.560
 new to the bipolar Reddit. I'm catching up to speed. It turns out lots of people that have lots of

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.120
 similar life experiences. That's the great part about diagnosis is I never would have thought to

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.400
 look up like a community of people with bipolar. And like, what do they have to say about things?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.720
 And it's amazing. Just immediately. How many threads on Reddit I've read that I'm like, wow,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:07.200
 that is so nice to see. I am not just weird or whatever. There are people who have navigated

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.760
 this and found good solutions. So the main crux of the problem is, if I were a single man,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.640
 and I didn't have a family, and I just was a lone wolf, like I seem to want to be at times,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.920
 like I, I tend toward lone wolfness, just very isolated. I enjoy autonomy. I don't seem to need

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.280
 people. If I were that person, I would just be manic all the time. And that because it feels

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.240
 amazing. I mean, it is a high. And there's a lot of like societal acceptance of people who get a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.280
 lot done. And I get a lot done when I wake up at three in the morning. And when I don't want

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.720
 to do anything, but set up my desk and produce things, like it is rewarding in so many ways,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.480
 mostly career, and just feeling really good like I'm on crack all the time. But it's like also

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.920
 terrible for my health. Like, so I would probably live a very short, intense life, if left to my

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.080
 own devices, because like sleeping because like you don't sleep. Yeah, you don't sleep enough.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.840
 Like I sleep four or five hours a night. That's not enough hours. Yeah. But it feels like it's

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.640
 enough. That's what's always been weird to me. I've always said like, I just don't need that much

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.360
 sleep. Like Casey sleeps like almost twice as much as me. And I'm like, it's whatever. I just don't

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.640
 need much sleep. I'm an abnormal adult. But that's just the mania talking. And I did know that I have

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.360
 these like periods where I'll go two, three months where I'm really not sleeping enough.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.400
 And I'm up and very excited. It's like Christmas morning every day. And then I crash for like two

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.000
 weeks where I just don't want to get out of bed. And I sleep like 10 hours a night. And it's like,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.040
 this is weird. What's this about? Is this depression? Like I've always been like this back and forth

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.720
 and never thought about like, maybe, maybe there's a happy middle. I just don't know how much my life

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.160
 I've lived, not in one of those two states. It feels like most of my adult life. I've been

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.440
 one of those two things. And so now as a married man with children, I have to figure out.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.080
 I am my best self, my best father and husband self, maybe not my best

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:22.720
 coworker slash cog in society. But I am my best like human being to be around when I'm not

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.880
 in those extremes, when I sleep enough and I'm healthy. And I'm not just like jittering all over

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.840
 the house, you know, like, I actually think about other things when things slow down. Like I don't

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.680
 just think about my work. So yeah, trying to figure all that out. I think I'm in the normal

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.920
 state right now. I don't know if the podcast listeners can tell or if they've seen, if they've

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.040
 seen my bipolar over the years easily tracked with your commit history. Like if we just chart

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.280
 that, it's probably very, you probably perfectly correlate it. That's funny. You get that data.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.840
 I mean, it feels like anecdotally, it feels like I spend a lot of time in the upper state.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.600
 And then crash into the lower state for shorter amounts of time. But that's, I mean, my memory

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.760
 is not very good. I think that's probably another, like, when you spend a lot of your time not

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.920
 sleeping enough. Yeah, it's really hard to tell what actually, I mean, that's with everything. It's

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.280
 like, unless you're literally writing it down every single day, it's really hard to self assess

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.360
 anything. Even from just like, what did I eat? Yes, you're like, am I like eating enough protein?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.800
 It's just impossible. Unless you're right, anything like that, it's just hard to get

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.760
 extensive. So are you doing something different? Or are you just like naturally in?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.840
 Yeah. So the number one thing I can do to keep from going manic, well, one, I can't consume caffeine.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.960
 Sorry, terminal. I really can't, like, it 100% of the time shoves me into mania. I'm pretty sure.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.120
 Yeah. So I have to avoid caffeine, which is fine. I've been drinking decaf and enjoying it.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.680
 But the number one thing I can do is just sleep enough. If I just don't let myself get out of bed

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.920
 before five and I go to bed knowing I'm not allowed to get out of bed before five,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.360
 like put me in a straight jacket, tie me to the bed. Like, I cannot get out of bed.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.960
 It's really hard to go into that hypomanic state when I'm sleeping enough. That's, that's the best

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.760
 thing I think I can do to stay normal. The hard thing is to not slip into depression,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.160
 which is where I just sleep a lot. And I don't feel like doing anything.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.920
 Yeah. How'd you figure both of those out? Was that something that you just self assessed,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.360
 or did someone help you figure that out? I think my therapist said something about

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.240
 like, I need to like sleep is the biggest tell, uh, or my psychologist or whatever she is.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.080
 But I think I just kind of put it together. Like, I know, I know that it's not good to be

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.360
 getting up at three in the morning or two 30 even. I got, it just makes sense that that's not like

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.200
 some weird, unique superpower I have. It's like, no, it's just not good for me. And I, it's just

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.280
 hard to imagine if I'm getting eight, nine hours of sleep and I having that brain state,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.320
 I don't know, outside of like drinking caffeine, I guess. Yeah. Interesting.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.200
 I mean, I don't know that it works. You say, how did I figure that out? Like,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.040
 this is like, I've tried it for a week. So we'll see. We'll see if it actually works, but.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.840
 Yeah. I mean, those, those two things seem pretty extreme in that, like, I can see how they would

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.720
 explain like a large percentage of what's going on. Like, you're not getting enough sleep and

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.200
 you're drinking caffeine. Like, yeah, that definitely just puts you in like, like a biologic,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.600
 just like a pure biology. Then it's like, I put you in like a really weird place.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.120
 Yeah. Yeah. How much do you sleep? Like, what's your night? Like, do you have like a pretty solid

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.600
 routine? I've been in different phases in my life, like ignoring my younger face because

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.200
 that's obviously, I think everyone when they're younger is just like crazy about that. But like,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:46.080
 in the past five years, I've probably fluctuated to some degree. It's never like that extreme,

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:52.720
 though. It'll be like a go for a period where I'm getting like one to two hours less than

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.880
 yeah, I should. It's never like half. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I think,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:08.080
 one of the observations about me is she's like, you just don't change. Like, I'm just like the

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.880
 same all the time. Yeah. In terms of like my mood or like my energy or like, you know,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:19.520
 so yeah, I guess I have, I don't know if that's because of that's not really stemming from

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.800
 really consistent routines. Like I actually, I've gone in different directions in my life where I've

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.560
 had like no routine at all. Then I like saw the miracle of like, what having a really strict routine

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:38.320
 does like just just a consistency of every day, like just has just makes up gel into place more.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:48.800
 But then I also had this other feeling of like, I don't know if that's where creativity

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.480
 really comes from when like every single day is the same and you don't like meander and like

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:00.400
 have things that are unexpected or do things that you wouldn't normally do. Sure. So now I'm kind of

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.640
 in and in between where I think I'm still a little off bounce. I think I've gotten like too much

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:10.720
 in the unstructured direction. Yeah. But yeah, I'm just trying to like find this balance of being

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:17.200
 like decently structured. But you know, you just think of like great people in the past, like it's

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:23.040
 not like they were just adhering to something rigid structure every day. Yeah. Yeah. So I want

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.920
 to like make sure I don't lose that. Just given, I think modern society really pushes the idea of

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:34.080
 like hyper routine. I know I need to like reject that to some degree, even though there is like

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.920
 wisdom there. You think about that a lot, don't you? You just like run your life based on how

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.840
 did great people live? You want to be a great person, don't you? Not faulting you for it. I think

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.280
 we all do. We just don't all put it in practice probably. Yeah. But I think, I think for me, I have

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:58.000
 a very, I think for me, it's more that I have a very narrow particular personal opinion of like

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.400
 what I consider a great person that I would like kind of look up to. Sure. And because it's so narrow

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:10.560
 in particular, I think I'm like, I really admire them. Like really, really admire them because it's

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.520
 like a tense choice that I've made to like them. Yeah. I got to ask more questions now because I

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:20.880
 just assumed like that made sense to me. But it's not necessarily lined up with what like society

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:27.280
 views is great people. So it's not like the like default answers to that question. You have a

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.080
 different set of great people. I think it would be a well, it's not I'm not going to be like,

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.440
 it's Hitler. I love Hitler. That's another topic that's very hot right now.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:44.240
 It's not really contrarian. I just think it's a subset. I think everyone that I it's fine. I can't

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.240
 even really name people off top of my head is more like a vibe that I think of. But

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.280
 I don't think I'm thinking of anything that's like anyone that's like underappreciated or like,

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.720
 you know, lost. It's more just all the great people. They don't all check your boxes.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.400
 Like there's people who are considered the great people of our time and you don't.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:10.080
 Yeah, I got you. I tend to like people that seem like weirdly good in a lot of different

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:16.800
 domains, including being really enjoyable to be around. I think it's like it's people like that.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:23.360
 Yeah. Yeah, which isn't like, you know, most most great people. Yeah. So it made me think of Einstein.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:30.560
 Like Einstein wasn't known for being a good hang like kind of miserable to be around or is that

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.720
 not weird. Maybe that's maybe that's like maybe that was too strong of a statement. Like because

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.560
 I like I like greatly admire Steve Jobs and people think he's a dick. But when I say great to be around,

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:46.560
 I'm like, I just feel like he had such a interesting way of like phrasing things or like looking at

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.560
 things or really good perspective on stuff. So gosh, I'm like, like, that seems like a pleasant

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.400
 person to be around. He would keep you guessing. Lots of interesting thoughts.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:00.960
 Yeah. I'm not super into like this, like the more like autistic. You imagine like a great autistic

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.160
 person, like kind of a stereotype we have of that. That's like not what I'm super into. I'm a huge

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.440
 fan of Richard Feynman. I think he's like, Oh, same. The best. Like in this category. Yeah.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:18.960
 So it's like he just seemed to enjoy every single facet of life and try to like pull the most out

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.680
 of all of it, whether it was like the intellectual science part or like the emotional part or like

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:29.280
 the appreciation of art's part. It's yeah, I tend to really, really, really like people like that.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:37.360
 And I tend to dislike people that achieve greatness through like overly specializing in

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:44.560
 some area. Yeah, I could listen to Richard Feynman. Feynman, I can listen to him talk all day long.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.400
 Sometimes like when I get tired of whatever book I'm listening to, I just pull up a random

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.080
 YouTube video of his where he's lecturing. I don't know what he's talking about, but I just,

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.840
 I love listening to him talk. Like somebody who really knows what they're talking about and

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.760
 is very passionate, even if they don't necessarily communicate in a way that I can understand,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:07.680
 it's just very fun to listen to. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah. And I think, I just think society pushes

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:14.160
 you into all these like narrow, overly specialized ways of living. And I like to remember people like

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:20.480
 that because it serves as a counterbalance. Yeah. Yeah. So this is off of what we were talking about,

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:26.640
 but that just, I do have consistent routines. I just try not to go overboard with it.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.640
 Yeah. So I guess I do want to, I want to go back to the bipolar thing briefly. I wonder,

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:37.040
 so it's mostly like working adults that have bipolar. It's not like a thing I've had since I was a kid,

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.240
 or maybe I had that, I don't know, I don't understand it all fully. Maybe I had the predisposition,

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:48.560
 the genetics somehow. I do have someone in my very close family that has had some pretty intense

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.520
 manic episodes that kind of led all this, brought it all to a head for me and my wife. Like, I need

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.440
 to get diagnosed just because we want to know, could I ever have one of those situations where,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:04.560
 like psychosis, extreme kind of like disassociation with reality. And like, just knowing some of the

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:12.560
 things about bipolar, it sounded like I might have said disorder, but it's basically like largely

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:18.400
 working adults. And I look at like tech, and I wonder if it's, I guess what I would say is this,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.240
 if you find yourself not sleeping near enough, I feel like there's got to be one listener out

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:28.240
 of all of our listeners. Yeah. That's like, Oh, shit, that could be me. That sounds kind of like me,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.320
 not that it needs to change your life. I'm not looking to get on medication. I'm not looking to,

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:38.640
 I just wanted to understand it and kind of curb the main drawbacks that people with bipolar die

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:44.240
 like 10 years earlier or something makes sense. If you don't sleep, that would add up over time.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.680
 So yeah, I think if you don't sleep enough, and if you find yourself real excited about your work,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:55.440
 like more excited about it than anything in life all the time, and you can't sleep because you want

00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.880
 to wake up and work on it. And then sometimes you're kind of depressed, just maybe look into it,

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.480
 maybe DM me sometimes to get a DM when I talk about stuff. And they're like, Hey, I didn't know

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.440
 that was me, but that's me too. So that's nice. Yeah, maybe it's you too. And I'm going to provide

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:16.400
 a counter thing here, which is if this sounds like you, but you're not getting a lot done,

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:23.680
 it probably isn't you. You're a fan bipolar, you're failing.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.920
 Actually, you're probably just like not disciplined. Like there's just,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.480
 there's a lot of ways to sleep and not be bipolar.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.800
 Because I think that was me when I was younger. Like I definitely like didn't sleep.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.680
 I was like, kind of all over the place in the same way, but like it wasn't, it wasn't related to

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.400
 this at all. I wasn't really getting. Yeah, for me, it's like, it's like every morning feels like

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.800
 Christmas morning. Like when I'm hypomanic or manic, whichever it is, it's like, I cannot stay in bed.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:58.080
 I'm too excited. I got to get up. And sure, there's like projects at work that that's probably normal

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.960
 for people. But when it's like every day for three months, I don't know. It's probably a sign.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.960
 You should get, get it checked out. Yeah. Yeah. Like I said, it's a having been around a few people

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:15.680
 now that have fallen under this. It's like easy to just be like, oh, that's normal. But then when

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.600
 you like actually think about it for a second, it's actually extremely obvious when someone's

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:25.680
 bipolar in the way it really is that you are. So you also like mentioned to me that I just want

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.920
 to tell you this. You mentioned to when you got your diagnosis, you mentioned to me like,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:36.800
 oh, they recommended one aspect was like kind of routine social interactions. And I was telling

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:43.520
 that to Liz and Liz commented that, oh, he's going to like someone legit because that's like very

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:49.920
 tailored advice. That's not like the generic stuff you typically typically get. So yeah,

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:56.720
 whoever you're going to. She seems she seems legit. She costs as much as a lawyer. So she better

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.880
 be legit. It was like an eight hour evaluation. I sat in there all day with this woman. I mean,

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:07.840
 she had seen me twice before. Like this was kind of like, she recommended we do a full assessment

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:13.760
 for a few things. And it involved sitting in there with her all day long. So she got to,

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:19.360
 I couldn't hide any bits of me by the end of it. It was just me. So did you know that there are some

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:26.560
 therapists that specialize in treating other therapists? Really? Yeah. Who watches the watchmen?

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:33.600
 And then who do they go to, right? Oh, yeah. There's got to be a point of failure at some point

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:39.680
 up the chain. Yeah. Yeah. It's just like, it's that's interesting. And again, having known some

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:45.600
 people that are like professionals in that space that are like really good at their career. Yeah,

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.200
 it seems like a cursed career in a lot of ways because they're just thinking about this stuff

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.080
 so much. And it's just not healthy to have to think about this much. Yeah. They all are like,

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:04.640
 like way too analytical about every little thing that they do. And they like treat it like,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:10.800
 they're like, what would a good patient be like? And then they like try to act in like they try

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.760
 like assess themselves in the way that what kind of patient that them as a therapist would want.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:21.120
 So it's like this really complicated thing when you're a therapist and you yourself need

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:27.280
 the therapy. It just seems like, yeah, like a special kind of hell. That's tough. Yeah. It feels

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.520
 like, I mean, if you really believe that what you're doing is good, like you're doing something

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.800
 for other people, you're sacrificing a lot of your life to live that life. Because yeah,

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:42.240
 sitting in a room every day with, I can't imagine like it's hard for me to spend an hour in therapy.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:48.800
 I can't imagine doing it all day long every day. Yeah. So we have it. So Liz's best friend has

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:57.520
 has had the dream patient scenario happen because I think every patient to some degree is self-conscious

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:04.320
 that, am I just super boring to this person? Like is this person just like hating the hour they're

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:10.080
 spending with me? Yeah. And you know, the reality is is like, yes, most therapists find most their

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.440
 patients and like boring. Sure. And it's just it's just like very boring work for them. But Liz's

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:24.160
 friend had this crazy situation where therapists is like, I am done. I remember what she was like

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.560
 not being a therapist anymore or like she was retiring. And she was like, but I want to be your

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:34.320
 friend. Like, let's like continue to hang out. So she got confirmation that she was like not a

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:39.120
 boring patient. And she's now, Oh, now I want to win over my therapist. I want her to want to be my

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.480
 friend. But that's also like not that that like is like a fundamentally unhealthy,

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:49.280
 just like relationship to have to your therapist. So yeah, yeah, these dynamics are funny. And the

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:54.800
 way that the things I have to think about are, yeah, are really funny. So we're professionals.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:02.000
 You spend like, as a person spending like on the patient side, you're spending time with this person

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.880
 every week. It's a friendship, like it becomes a friendship, but like, they can't just have all

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.360
 their friendships be their patients. So they have to like, look at it very differently, right? Like,

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.400
 just becoming friends with everybody that walks in the door. No, no, yeah. And they can't,

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.680
 they like have to be really explicit about certain things to avoid you seeing them a certain way,

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:28.480
 which then like, can disrupt what they're trying to do. So it's a funny thing. And then, and then like,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:34.480
 our friend I was talking about who is a therapist, he does, I think couples therapy mostly. So then

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:41.200
 that's like even crazier dynamics. Two people. Yeah, it's, it's interesting.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:47.280
 It's very interesting. Anyway, enough of mental health, my brain,

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:58.640
 et cetera, I'm as depressed. Everyone sent him money. I did just come out of a little, a little

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:04.080
 slump, a depression. I, I, as I did to call it depression, not because I'm like, it feels vulnerable

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.720
 or something, which I want to get back to that, what that word means. Not that like, I don't want

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.400
 to be viewed as weak or something because I'm depressed, more just like, I don't know if it's

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.200
 actual depression and I don't want to make light of like people who have depression, capital D, if

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.560
 that's like a separate thing. I don't know. I don't know. It might be the same exact thing.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.440
 Okay, but I will say like you're, because we interact mostly digitally,

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:31.520
 I weirdly get a more shallow view of you, but the shallow view has less noise. So it's like

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.880
 really clear when you're in one mode or the other. Hmm. You know, I could tell for the past couple

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:43.040
 weeks. Yeah. That it was, you were in a different mode. Mm hmm. I've been sleeping like 10 hours

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:49.760
 a night. If nothing else in my life were different, that's crazy. Like tell Brian Johnson. Yeah.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:54.480
 Oh, I want to talk about Brian Johnson in this episode too, because he, he's kind of like made

00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:00.320
 the leap after I feel like we talked about him before. He was definitely in like the public light,

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:05.440
 but then the Netflix series came out and I feel like I see constant things about Brian Johnson now.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.920
 And he's also like in our little bubble, like he replied to Madison yesterday. Yeah, he's like,

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:15.440
 and I saw him reply to Theo, like he's, uh, he's kind of like in our Twitter circle in ways.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:20.000
 He's touched it and it's very interesting. Uh, where do you want to go next? What's going on?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.640
 Uh, Twitter, you want to talk about something? There's, there's lots of news. There's an inauguration.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.680
 There's lots of meetings. Yeah, I watched the inauguration. I don't know if you did. I actually,

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.840
 I don't think I've ever, I don't think I've ever watched one really before, but I just had it on

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:37.600
 the background while I was working. Yeah. And man, how do you watch something like that? Was it on

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.840
 YouTube or was it? Yeah, it was, it was everywhere. I was like on Twitter. It was on YouTube. It was

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:47.280
 a bunch of buses, but uh, Twitter, of course. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. It was, uh, it was pretty

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.800
 boring. Like, I don't know, just like a lot of staying around and waiting. It wasn't like, uh,

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.760
 back to back, like we got stuff going. This person shows up. There's a lot of like downtime and

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:03.120
 took forever for to start. Um, I thought, so if I'm being honest, like seeing a lot of the clips of

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.600
 people speaking and like there were speeches, all that stuff, I didn't know. I just thought it was

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.440
 like hand on the Bible, hand up, say some stuff and that's the inauguration. I didn't know there was

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:17.840
 like a whole thing about it. Yeah. I mean, there's definitely speeches, but I don't know if it's always

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:25.440
 to this degree where there's just like a slew of people talking about, uh, about things. Yeah. So I

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:33.840
 think the few things that stood out to me were, uh, one, just it's crazy how intertwined with religion

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:41.040
 a lot of this stuff still is. Uh, I mean, hand on the Bible. I just said, like, yeah, I mean,

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.240
 that part is fine. Like I think the whoever's getting sworn in can choose technically choose

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:52.720
 like what they're swearing in on. And I think it like, I think, uh, I think in Trump's case,

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.640
 he like chose his mother's Bible or something. And then you actually didn't even put his hand on

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:05.600
 it when he swore in, which was probably was an accident. Yeah. So but like just, you know, the

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:11.200
 people that speak, it's people that are like reverence and there's also like a rabbi. And that

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:19.040
 one is just to me like, okay, like the president isn't Jewish. So there's like no explanation as to

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:25.840
 why a rabbi is speaking. Besides they're intentionally being, oh, we need to represent, you know,

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:32.480
 these ex religions as part of our government swearing in ceremony. So yeah, yeah, it is like,

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.040
 just kind of increasing in the world that's increasingly like fewer and fewer and fewer people

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.240
 are like involved in religion. It's, uh, yeah, increasingly secular. Yeah, it's a word. Yeah.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:48.320
 It's bizarre stands out. It just, it just interesting to see that that show up, show up again. Um,

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:55.120
 and it's not just like, it's more of the way. Okay. So the one thing is across all the speeches,

00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:00.720
 everyone was just like crazy sucking up to Trump. That was like a, I don't know if that's normal

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:06.560
 when a new president comes in, everyone is just like, yeah, I think there's like an above average

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:11.600
 amount of like, you know, showering the new, yes, candidate and praise. I didn't, I didn't

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:17.040
 watch the inauguration, but I've sensed there's an above average amount of sucking up this time.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.160
 I don't know what that's about, but, and I think it makes sense just because it was such a

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:26.640
 contentious election and like people saw as a very important one. Um, but there's like this whole,

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.000
 so when the religious people talk, they do it in their flavor, which is like,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 like God guided his hand. God is protecting him. Like he's like touched by it. Like there's like

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.040
 this essence of divinity attached to it. And that's so interesting to me because I'm like,

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.800
 this is how police it like, this is how like kings and emperors were spoken of, like they were

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:54.880
 seen as literally, yeah, well, there's a, there's like a terminology for this, like, uh, when like

00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:00.400
 your role is like God, like authorizes your role. Yeah, yeah, divine right or whatever divine right

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:06.000
 to hold something like that. It's like, cause I like, you know, ordained, sorry, I've been

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.120
 trying to think of words. Yeah. And that one just came to my head, like in certain cultures, like

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:16.320
 the emperor, they literally saw them as like a literal God. And I'm not saying we're anywhere

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:22.240
 close to that, but it was, it was funny to see that. And, uh, you know, they were talking, and

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.520
 especially because he survived this assassination attempt, there's not a whole angle of like,

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:31.040
 you know, there being like a divine intervention and making this interesting. So yeah, it is

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:38.080
 interesting how much that is a part of everything. Uh, and it's not like, like I said, there's like

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:43.360
 an increasing percentage of the population, but that just doesn't live their lives that way.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.680
 So it's kind of out of place. Do you think that was the case four years ago? Like, do you think

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:54.160
 that there's a party divide on how much the, uh, religious aspects come into the presidency?

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:59.840
 I mean, I don't know because I think my gut feel is Biden is probably more religious than Trump,

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:06.400
 like in his heart. Yeah, sure. I imagine that like, I, like, just the way Trump is spoken about this

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:11.680
 stuff. I feel like he fought it's like so clearly he forces it in and like he just, he just seems like

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.720
 just a guy from New York. And like, I know, I know what that vibe is. It's not, you don't like

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:22.640
 view life through religion, really. Um, that's my read on it. So that's my read as well. And it's

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:29.840
 very funny to me how much like Christian America backs Trump and is like, I mean, it's just a huge

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:35.680
 part. You can't separate religion from politics because it's like so many people in America

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:44.400
 align with some religion specifically evangelical Christianity. And it's just like this thing

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:50.720
 that everyone knows they all vote for the Republican and like Republican and Christian are just kind

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:55.440
 of like this weird amoeba thing that's mashed together. Amoeba wasn't very word. This weird,

00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:00.720
 like molecule that's been mixed together. And it's just, I can't talk about it without getting

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.520
 really like grossed out because it kind of bothers me. But yeah, I mean, just like when I was part of

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:12.880
 that belief system, I saw it in like the mega church in Springfield, Missouri has like the

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.520
 politicians come through during that season. It's like September, October, they all stop in the

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.840
 church and the pastor like announces them and they stand up and wave. And like everybody claps.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.880
 And like, it's just the whole thing is so dumb to me. Like, I mean, just the idea that like,

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:34.000
 I don't know, if you believe in something like Christianity, just show me the overlap of those

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.840
 beliefs with like Republican Americans. I don't get it. Yeah, it's just like, I mean, like, yeah,

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.800
 it's just obvious that Trump isn't isn't like a Christian. Exactly. But there's you in this like

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:52.800
 this messianic figure that's like come to say. I mean, yeah, it's just the thing that overrides

00:28:52.800 --> 00:29:01.360
 everything is like, there's alignment, like, you know, if someone is aligned with goals that you have,

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:06.400
 then it's very easy to overlook a certain character. And to be fair, I think a lot of people don't

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.480
 do that. I think there's probably a lot of Christian people that are very upset by

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:16.880
 the way some people sure in power that are technically representing them, you know, represent them.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:23.440
 But yeah, it's just just a reality of just power and all these like all these dynamics.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:32.160
 But yeah, there's like no way that Trump just I just can't see it. Like, I mean, it's not like,

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.920
 it's funny because it's like, this might sound like I'm criticizing him, but I'm actually not.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:41.360
 What I'm actually saying is, I know how I am. And like, I feel like he's kind of like me. So,

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:47.120
 I don't know how much he pretends that he's not. I just feel like it's more on the like,

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:52.960
 religious people side that they've wrapped this thing onto him and decided he is this thing.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.840
 I think he does whatever politician does, which is like, say the amount you have to say to like,

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:03.680
 get the vote for that, you know what I mean? Like that constituency. Anyway, yeah. I feel like we

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:09.760
 can't not talk about Elon to just how much he's played a role in this presidency and the inauguration

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.800
 and all of it. I don't know what's the deal. He donated a ton of money, I guess.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.520
 Yeah, I thought money and like, yeah, just do whatever you could to put weight on the scale in that

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.840
 direction. Do you think that weighs in on why people like Zuckerberg are now so pro-Trump? Is

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:29.280
 it like, we're not going to let Twitter and X have some edge? No, I've already, I've already done

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:35.440
 my rant. Oh, really? I've already spoken. He's just a lizard man. Yeah. He what? Yeah. He's just

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.320
 trying to be cool and he's just following whatever is cool. It does. It does seem like I don't remember

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:45.600
 last time when Trump had his first term. I don't remember all these like corporate tech giants

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:52.960
 getting so behind. No, that's that's definitely a new thing. Yeah, I think it's just, it's just

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.840
 an incentive thing. I think, okay, let me actually talk about very specific thing. Did you see the

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:03.440
 Stargate announcement yesterday? Yes, I want to talk about that too. Perfect. Okay. So I'm convinced

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:09.920
 that that's a fake announcement. Yep. And I'm open to being wrong about this, but they're just a

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:18.960
 quick comfort context. Trump got up there with Sam Altman, Larry from Oracle, Larry Ellison,

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:27.440
 and then the soft bank guy, a masa, right? And they announced, hey, there's going to be a $500

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:34.320
 billion investment in infrastructure for AI over the next, I think they said five years or four years,

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.840
 something like that. And they listed who's involved. They were like Microsoft and video,

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:45.840
 Oracle. Now, soft bank, obviously, MGX, which is like a, I think it's like some some some fun

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:51.200
 in Saudi, like one of the like public fund from like managing their sovereign world or whatever.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:57.760
 So I was like, huh, okay, this is one a crazy number. So I did some digging and I was like,

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.360
 let's see if I can like make these numbers make sense. So obviously when they list

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.920
 Oracle and video, whatever, I don't think those companies are contributing money. Yeah, they're

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.680
 actually the ones going to be receiving money. I'm assuming for the GPU. Oracle has some capability

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.440
 and building data centers, whatever. And obviously in video, two pews, et cetera. So ignoring those

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:21.680
 people. So Microsoft was listed. And Microsoft already announced six months ago that they had some

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:27.120
 Stargate AI thing and they were like planning on spending a hundred billion over the next five

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:33.680
 years or something. So there's a billion. They're already doing something. Are they just like counting

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.560
 Microsoft's effort as like, Oh, yeah, it's like under the Stargate umbrella, but that's they're

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.720
 like counting it as like, Oh, this is general AI infrastructure, even though that's just Microsoft

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:47.760
 doing that for themselves kind of irrespective of it's not like they're going to be giving this

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:53.680
 infrastructure to like, you know, their competitors. It's probably more than just AI, just any, any

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.720
 like cloud business that they have is probably part of this. Okay, so ignore. So 100 billion there.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:08.320
 Okay, gotcha. Softbank only has 350 billion assets managed. So like if they literally liquidated

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:13.760
 everything they had and they got like exactly what they wanted for it, that still wouldn't be enough

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.800
 to cover this 500 billion. And realistically, they're not doing that. They probably will maybe

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.680
 raise a new round for this. That's what I was going to ask. If it's over four years, is the argument

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.360
 from them just it's 125 billion a year. Yeah. So is the argument from them that they're just,

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.320
 they're going to raise 500 billion over four years? Like, yes, okay. So I think they're basically

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.800
 saying like, Oh, we're going to this is our target. We're going to raise 500 billion. But like the

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:41.520
 people they listed, like the MGX fund, the whole fund is 100 billion. I don't think they're going

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:49.360
 to yolo the whole fund on like this one project. Yeah, right. So like for what they listed, I'm like,

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:55.120
 this isn't really like adding up like numbers on add up. And they do technically say up to 500

00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:00.000
 billion, they claim they're going to deploy 100 billion immediately. Maybe they're just counting

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.200
 Microsoft thing plus whatever else they raised, I don't know. So I'm like, okay, I think what's going

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:11.520
 on here is they went to Trump and they were like, Oh, let's do his announcement. It's going to be

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.800
 sick. Yeah. And of course, from just one of you, great, that's great PR for them. Second day in

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:22.960
 office or first full day in office, like he's got this really impressive sounding thing. And then

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.520
 they can like kind of make it seem like, Oh, we're established as like the market leader.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:32.640
 Google and Facebook aren't just going to see that and they'll be like, Oh, okay, we lost. Yeah,

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.840
 it's just like it's that's not what's happening. And then Elon tweeted today,

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:41.040
 because he has this whole thing with open AI. He replied being like, this is fake. They only

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.960
 they have less than 10 billion committed, which I'm sure he's probably making that up to some degree.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:54.400
 So, yeah, to me, it's just like a marketing PR thing. And I also thought, Oh, this is exactly

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.720
 what I would do. Like I would go and make some big official sounding announcement. If I had the

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:04.080
 capability to that just like creates a bunch of noise in the market. It was always good to do.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.280
 If they really set up to 500 billion, that's a pretty hilarious marketing gimmick.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.800
 Like they did say that. Yeah,

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:15.120
 I'm going to spend up to 500 billion on cereal this month up to likely not going to reach those

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.680
 levels, but I've been up to 500 billion on my house mortgage payment this month.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:27.200
 Yeah, so I don't I don't know. And the other thing is that's kind of crazy is like that is such a

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:37.040
 crazy bet to make on this root singular. All boys on to a root thing, which is scaling all we need.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.280
 Are we going to be able to spend 500 billion and get like 100 x yeah, the

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:46.640
 four is going to be two x equality. That's like the question. Can you speak to just like what

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.880
 they've announced with Stargate? Like it's just data centers or what are they saying? And it's just

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.680
 for open AI to use to build new models. It's a broad statement. It's they're just saying we're

00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.800
 going to there's going to be 500 billion invested in AI infrastructure that we need to do all this

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:06.160
 stuff. And technically they're saying Stargate itself is a new company. And then Masa is going to

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:11.200
 be the chairman of it. But like, what does this company actually own? Like, I don't think they're

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.800
 necessarily owning the data centers. It's just like, I don't know, they they're just going to raise

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:20.000
 money and like direct it towards different things. So they might like give it to open AI to then

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.360
 do so they might give it to someone else to go do so they might directly give it to NVIDIA to do

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:31.200
 to do stuff. So yeah, it's like very vague. But if you imagine that some percentage of it is for

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.080
 training, some percentage of it is for inference. It's a lot of money. That's a lot of money.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:42.160
 It's kind of hard to even fathom 500 billion dollars. Yeah, I think I think Grok has the largest

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:49.760
 investment so far. And that's only like in the like under five billion, I think, if I if I

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:54.160
 remember. Yeah, something like that. Yeah, I find it really interesting because I think

00:36:54.160 --> 00:37:00.640
 I think they effectively killed the the perplexity category of companies,

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:08.320
 which is like a modern search engine that basically just like ingesting real like real-time information

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:13.520
 because it's doing all that like it does real-time stuff, right? Yeah, yeah. And I find myself using

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:19.200
 it like in my head, I said a mental block of, okay, I basically go to LM's for everything.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:27.200
 But if I'm asking something like, when does the severance show premiere? What time I can't go to

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.480
 AI for that because it doesn't know anything upcoming. But now I realize like, oh, Grok like

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:40.880
 almost always knows the answer to that. And it effectively, like basically, that's the last

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.480
 part of the last time I go to Google. So now I'm trying to go to Grokmore for that kind of thing.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:49.120
 Yeah, now, you know, sports stats that are the latest, you know, stuff like that.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.320
 It's always it's always going to have the advantage of having all the tweets, like,

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:59.120
 yeah, and tweets contain all the current events, answers to all the current event questions.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.000
 There's a tweet out there with any current event question you have. There's a tweet out there

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.960
 answering it basically. Yeah, open AI like going to chat GBT for like a you just don't even think

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:11.360
 to ask like a current events question because you just know like, I don't think it can do that

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:16.320
 stuff, right? And then the question is like, okay, technically, open as models are better,

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:22.080
 clouds models are better, but that just seems like a temporary gap. If Grok just gets that good,

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.160
 why would you use two things? You probably wouldn't. You probably would just use Grok for everything.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:31.920
 So as of now, there is really interesting position, I think, and it was kind of not very predictable.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.600
 Yeah, let's talk. Let's talk about the whole AI landscape right now, because there's so much

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.640
 going on with like deep seek are one came out. I guess people are very impressed with this model.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:47.840
 It's open source. And where is open AI sit in the landscape? Because cloud, I mean, there's all

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:52.560
 these other models that people use that pay for subscriptions for like an open AI behind.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.960
 Are they still because for a while they're leading? No, they're still leading because

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:03.520
 their models are still the I mean, the best is such a fuzzy question, but like on certain evaluations,

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:09.440
 their models tend to do well, and they tend to release them first. So yeah, deep seek thing

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:15.840
 came out, but you know, it was after a one and presumably like, you know, they like open

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:20.320
 as advanced since they released it, and they have. So I think they're still in the lead. It's just

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:27.360
 that lead is just more and more marginal. And it's just becoming very clear that I mean,

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.800
 it's been clear ish for a while that the winning company is not going to be it's time they related

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:38.720
 to like who has the best raw model, because that just becomes a commodity that's just everyone

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:43.440
 eventually hasn't been good enough or around the same. So you asked an actually really interesting

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:49.440
 question I just glossed over earlier, it's like the Stargate thing is scaling it really the problem.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:56.560
 Do you have thoughts on that? Like, can we scale this current thing? I have no clue, but I think

00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:02.400
 that's just a fundamental question, right? If it turns out just doubling the power 10xing the raw

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:12.160
 power is gets you like brute forcing to like AGI like, yeah, that would be crazy. Yeah. Like,

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.560
 that's that's well, that's how the bets are aligned, basically. Not entirely. I'm kind of

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:21.280
 exaggerating like there's other obviously also inventing new techniques like optimizing things,

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:30.400
 but roughly they're betting that the 10x bigger data center you get like an exponentially better

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.680
 model, like the amount of effort you've invested, which if it's that's not true, and it's actually

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.080
 the opposite where it's, you know, longer than the mic and it likes to taper off. This is a

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:44.480
 complete like, a bad bet, waste of free sizes. Yeah. What do you think about quantum? Because

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:49.440
 there's been all these headlines to Google had a big, we didn't talk about this. They had this big

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.800
 breakthrough with quantum computing, which has always just kind of been like this thing that

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.840
 is coming, but not really coming. And like, we don't actually know how to do it. And but think

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:03.120
 about the possibilities. Now it seems like there's actual potential for commercialization in the

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:08.880
 next some number of years. Do you do you think about that, how it relates to AI? Because like,

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:14.320
 all this stuff that we're doing with the types of LOM, the approaches to building these models

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:19.120
 would all be completely different in a world where quantum computing was like a part of modern

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:26.640
 infrastructure, right? Maybe because it's not like it's so possible that okay, so just on a

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:31.120
 quantum computing itself, it's like, I don't know the number, but it is like six moonshots that need

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:38.560
 to happen for quantum computing to be usable. And that Google thing was like, we got past one

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:43.600
 of them. But they got, they got past one of them. But there's still like, there's still like many

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:48.560
 of those left to get to a place where it's usable. And then even then, it's not like it's a general

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:55.120
 purpose computer. It's like insanely useful and going to transform society, but not, it's just not

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:59.440
 clear whether like, it's going to be in a shape that like meaningfully impacts AI and also on the

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:05.040
 timelines. Yeah, a lot of stuff can happen. It's just it's so like tantalizing when you read the

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:10.480
 headlines with quantum computing, like the stuff it can do, maybe it's just super specific stuff.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:17.600
 But those things, it does like trillions of times faster than a computer or just like does it in a

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:22.000
 computer, couldn't like a classical computer could never work it out before the heat death of the

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.240
 universe. And it can do it in like five minutes or whatever. You just can't hear those headlines

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:32.160
 and not think like, well, what could that do with AI? Like what could that do with these approaches to

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:38.000
 like synthetic intelligence? I feel like the potential seems crazy.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.040
 That's true. But the other dynamic to consider is it might be that, oh, it is true that scaling is

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:49.040
 all you need. But it turns out the other thing you also need is more input data. And you can have

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.560
 like the biggest data center ever. And it turns out the results are not any better because we've

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:59.760
 exhausted input data for the system and like synthetic data, like is not making it work any

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.680
 better. But then, you know, that could also be the bottleneck. And then we won't know how to really

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:09.040
 really address that. I think fundamentally, it's just this thing where

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:17.760
 clear like, even if this stuff works, we've just created a parallel way to get to some level of

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:26.080
 intelligence because this biological brain we have is still superior in like every single way.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:32.160
 Like, it doesn't need a billion examples of what a dog looks like to look like a dog. It needs like

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:38.000
 two. And it doesn't need this crazy amount of power. It doesn't need all this stuff. So

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:47.760
 I still feel like there is still maybe a totally different approach to AI that might end up being

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:54.880
 the thing that actually makes it happen. Because what we have now feels so divorced from what nature

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.800
 invented. And a lot of things in life are that way. Like the more efficient thing is like,

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:05.280
 not the way it works in nature at all. But when it comes to intelligence, it feels like

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:10.880
 the nature version is really, really good. So it is really, really good. But there is,

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:16.880
 I take issue with the idea that this thing, we've created a parallel version that's just a shittier

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.320
 version of our brain. There are things it does that I couldn't do.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:25.600
 Like has infinite memory. The memory thing. Yeah, like the ability to like pull context from

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:31.760
 areas I've never heard about and like put a coherent answer together. That feels very useful,

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:37.360
 especially in our line of work, like as a knowledge worker. How do you explain that

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:42.800
 in terms of like, it's just memory, it just has more memory than us, or it has more a wider.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:49.040
 Yeah, but I think what I'm describing is, I'm not saying if you built the nature version of it,

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:53.360
 that you could just also have that. Like if you built it in a virtual environment,

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:59.200
 there's no reason you couldn't give it more memory while still retaining what's good about

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.440
 the way our brains are. We were saying like, if we built a whole different approach to AI that

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:08.640
 was more like our brain, you could also give it the memory. Yeah, you can still untether it from

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:13.920
 the downsides of our brain, which is like, it experiences time at a certain rate. So you can't like

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:19.760
 teach it at a faster rate than we want. And like, you know, it like forget stuff and it's

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:23.920
 unreliable in certain ways. And it might turn out like a lot of those things are important. Like,

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:28.480
 if you build something else that's a human brain that remembers perfectly, and it has any kind of

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.840
 negative input, and it remembers it perfectly forever, it might just end up being traumatized

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.280
 in a way that is hard to correct for. Yeah, I can relate. So

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.360
 maybe the forgetting is like actually really important. So yeah, I think it's

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.760
 it's just so clear when I started talking about things in this way.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:57.520
 The thing we have is quite different than a brain in a box. It is so this is such an interesting

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:03.040
 moment in time where all these companies, you think of Nvidia, and then all the major tech

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:09.920
 companies, Google, Amazon, OpenAI, whoever, they're all pouring so much money down this path because

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.680
 they have to. They have to like assume it's going to work out and they're going to beat the other

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:18.720
 people. They have no choice. They have no choice. They have no choice. And a trillion

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:23.440
 dollars will go in this space in the next five years. And it's like, could be wrong.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:31.600
 Oopsie. Like imagine someone that has just like, what would it look like to make a contrarian bet

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:38.240
 today? It would be betting that they're investing in the wrong place. Like not entirely wrong. Like

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:43.200
 you still you still go for AI, but you're like, the architecture they're following is like totally

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:48.800
 wrong. Yeah. And if you make a contrarian bet there and you're right, this is like the best bet

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:55.600
 ever made in the history, the bigger, the bigger short, the biggest short, you would build a business

00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:01.200
 that eats all of them. So how, how do you make that contrarian bet? Not like I'm actually going

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.840
 to try and make this contrarian bet me in my middle America. I mean, you would have to have the idea

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.280
 for it first. That's just like, I don't, I'm like, not smart enough to say you're saying the

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:14.320
 contrarian bet is the person who makes the alternative that goes hard down that path. It's not just like

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:19.840
 shorting all of their stocks. No, no, no, no. Yeah. That's no shorting is not actually a contrarian

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:25.120
 thing. It's a you have to bet on the thing that actually wins where everyone's betting on a thing

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:31.200
 that ultimately loses. So there's like a crazy opportunity for whoever is able to have clarity

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.040
 on that. And maybe there isn't nothing turns out they're right. Yeah, it could be right. It's

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:39.120
 just, yeah, it feels like it could be really hard. If you're like a founder type, and you actually

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:44.240
 have the credentials to do this, to like get people excited about, I mean, maybe not. Maybe

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.640
 there's people excited about everything. But to be like, we're going to go a different direction.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:55.440
 Forget the whole LLM's and what are what's the underlying thing that transformer architecture,

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:59.120
 like we're going to do a totally different thing. I guess there probably are companies doing that

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:03.760
 and getting funded. No, if someone had that, and they had like a compelling story around it,

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:07.920
 they would easily get funded. Yeah, that's true. Like there's still, most VCs are not contrarian,

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:13.360
 but they're still like true contrarian VCs out there that like make sure that they don't miss

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:17.280
 those things because that's their job seems like a noble mission. Seems like somebody needs to be

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:23.040
 building the backup plan because yeah, it would just suck if this really did all kind of it feels

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:27.280
 like there's no way to know if it's a dead end or not. It's just like you have to build these giant

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.840
 data centers. You have to stuff more and more GPUs and more and more training data into these

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:40.560
 things to figure out the limits, right? The thing that's unclear is ultimately all humans operate

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:45.360
 the same. And we're a lot of us like we're all like pretty faith based when it comes to a bunch

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:50.160
 of things. And we do a good job of distorting ourselves so we could we could operate that way.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:57.520
 It's possible that some of the people in charge, if they sat down and looked at it

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:07.040
 really coldly, they would not make this bet. But the enticement of this actually working out is so

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:13.520
 large that it's overriding that analysis. So as possible, Sam Altman is just like, actually,

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:19.280
 that doesn't fundamentally believe that scaling is all we need, but he hopes it is. And there's

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.800
 like a small chance that it is. And there's a small chance that it is. And of course, he's going to do

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.840
 whatever he can to like direct as many resources that the world has added.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:32.400
 I mean, I think the worst case, I guess, is I think about it, like the floor is still pretty good.

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:37.920
 Like the stuff is useful. It's just, is it useful enough to warrant like the biggest investment in

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:43.760
 history in any one thing? Did we already talk about how he said 01 pro was not profitable?

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.080
 Yeah, you said that last, I think last episode maybe.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:49.920
 Yeah. So I mean, that's the problem though. It's like the stuff is useful.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:56.000
 But can it be sustained? Yeah, I saw a video of someone like stacking five Mac minis to run deep

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.160
 seats at like a really shitty like slow rate, get like a really like crappy like token per second

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:08.080
 rate. And I'm like, what the fuck? That's what it's anytime every time I hit them. Like that's

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.600
 of course, they're using more optimized hardware. And like I'm sure some stuff is better. But

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:18.400
 that like gave me a visual of like a window into it. Yeah, holy crap. Like I'm consuming

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:23.680
 the quote in the five Mac minis, like 100% dedicated to just answering my question when I'm

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:30.320
 using this thing. So yeah, it's possible that it's just, you know, the optimizations just can't happen

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:36.480
 forward to get there. So interesting times we live in. It really does feel like

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:41.200
 kind of feel lucky sometimes just to live in this timeline. I mean, I know some people hate

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:46.080
 this timeline, but like feels nice to like get to see all this stuff unfold, like in our prime

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:50.480
 of our career, like one of the odds. Or maybe it'll be crazier stuff that our kids get to witness,

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:55.280
 but I don't know, it feels pretty cool. You think about how how little the world changed? Oh, sorry.

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:59.520
 Yeah, I was gonna talk about it. It's like, I always think about, wow, it's so crazy that I could

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:04.000
 have been born like in medieval times. And like, I wouldn't have seen any of this. But the same time

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.440
 that there's a weird dynamic where there's more people on earth than ever. So it was actually

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:15.840
 most likely that I would be born this time. Interesting. Yeah, that's a good point. Most people to the

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:21.360
 concept this time. Yeah, it's actually really rare for you to have been born in a medieval time.

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:27.280
 So maybe, yeah, maybe not many times, but think like 150 years ago, like the world didn't change

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:33.760
 a lot in your lifetime. Right? I mean, I think about people like grandparent age currently.

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:38.720
 And it's like, or maybe even like a little bit older than that, like people that were like,

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:42.320
 yeah, it's older than that, because they saw like electricity come into being like, that's pretty

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:48.080
 crazy to go from like candlelight to like, there is electricity. You can just feel it with just by

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:54.080
 looking at clothing. Okay, so imagine someone in the late 1800s. Okay, like, imagine like what they

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:58.400
 would be wearing and kind of like the imagery of them. And then realize that they probably died

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:03.920
 in like the 70s. And then imagine what the people are wearing in the 70s. Like, how do

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:10.720
 we miss all that experience? Both of those situations, right? Interesting. Yeah, it's really mind blowing.

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:15.920
 And like, of course, the clothing implies like massive change across the board. Yeah, like to

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:22.720
 all culture and life. I don't really notice the clothing changes anymore. Do you? I don't pay

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:28.080
 attention enough. I'm probably so out of touch with my dress, how I dress myself. Well, I was

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:33.280
 complaining the other day that I really think that we're at like a low in terms of aesthetics

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:38.960
 across the board. And I don't think it's a subjective thing that I'm just like old and out of touch.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:45.280
 I think it's, I think there are times in life where the society is in a better place, aesthetically,

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:50.320
 other times they're more lost. So I think we're in like a lost phase right now,

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:55.760
 everything just kind of ugly. Well, yeah, I don't know if I pay attention enough to the world.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.120
 I thought you just met like software. It's not just clothing. It's like everything. Yeah, I thought

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:05.680
 you just met. Yeah, no, software too, just like everything. So we're in a low. And I think everyone

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:12.240
 feels as with like furniture interior design, like, we just haven't seen anything better than

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:19.200
 like the 60s, the mid-century modern stuff as a cliché and tired as it is. Like you just look

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:26.080
 at any scene in Mad Men and you're like, Oh, this is really good. This is really nice. And we've

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:31.760
 tried other stuff, but most of it hasn't really been better. It is interesting that like,

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:38.240
 I have a ton of mid-century modern stuff. Like where is the last 60 years of furniture change?

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:44.000
 What is the new stuff? Yeah, like the Eames chair is still everywhere. Everyone wants

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.160
 still wants a Eames chair as their centerpiece in their room. I mean, you can't you can't walk

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:52.400
 around in a city. Like we were just in New York. I mean, I guess not just New York, but it was

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:59.200
 a few couple months ago, whatever. Just like seeing buildings with crazy architecture, just like

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:04.960
 the ornate stuff on the facades. Oh, yeah, the older stuff. Just like, we don't we wouldn't do

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.440
 that anymore, would we? Is that just like an old man yells at cloud thing? I don't even understand

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:13.920
 because like you'll like walk by a building and there's like a sort of random mass intricate carving

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:20.400
 on like some corner of it. And you're just like, how did they allocate someone's time to bother

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:26.720
 doing that? That just like doesn't make sense to me at all. And I mean, like New York is crazy. Like,

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:33.200
 so the modern stuff in New York is also very crazy. So that's going to extreme to look at.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:40.320
 But like outside of extreme places like New York, the modern stuff just feels like so lazy.

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:44.320
 It just feels like we try to build like the easiest possible thing.

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.800
 Why is that? There's something there.

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:51.040
 There's some deep psychology to be on earth or it's really simple. I don't know.

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:55.040
 I think it's a mix of I think there is like a real cultural thing. Like we don't put in a value.

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:58.720
 Yeah, we don't we don't we don't put in a value. And then also there's a practical side of it.

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:03.120
 There's like all these like zoning complexities, which I've learned about recently that

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:09.120
 our why a lot of these buildings are are pretty ugly. There's this whole thing about like buildings

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:15.040
 need two sets of stairwells now. And that forces like all these constraints on what types of buildings

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:20.800
 people can build. And the side effect of that is it's almost never the kind of stuff that

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:26.800
 would want. Things are ugly. Can I bring up something else? It's completely unrelated.

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:32.800
 Twitter. There's a thing there's there's a one last relic of LinkedIn that lives on Twitter.

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:39.840
 And it is what it is. I'm a parent who just loves my children. And I love playing with them. If

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:45.920
 anything takes me away from my kids for an afternoon. If that I'd rather play with my kids. You know

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:51.920
 what? Shut up. Stop it because I'm a parent. No, I'm glad your brain is up because I have felt

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:56.240
 I've had like strong thoughts about this recently, but I'm like, I can't say anything. Okay, well,

00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:00.560
 I have kids. And I'll say this. Yeah. And I don't know what I've said about my kids on the podcast.

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:08.880
 I love my children. I honestly believe it's the greatest and the worst part of my life. Like it makes

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:12.800
 all the highs higher. I don't know if I've ever said this on the podcast. I'm sure I've said it to

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:17.840
 in person or something. All the highs are higher. All the lows are lower. Like life got way more

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:23.600
 intense since we had kids. We've got a 10 year old. So it's been a decade now. I love my kids.

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:29.680
 I would not say that like on a Saturday afternoon, my favorite thing to do is play with them. There

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:35.280
 are some times where I just miss playing with them. I haven't seen them. And I I want to just that's

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.440
 what I genuinely want to do. But a lot of times I play with my kids because they need to be played

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:44.080
 with because they're bored or they're whatever. And like, it's an obligation at times. And that's

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:50.320
 okay. It doesn't mean I don't love my kids. But to act like, yeah, I don't know. Like all I want to

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:55.840
 do in life is be a dad. Maybe it's my bipolar speaking. But like that's not the case. No, no.

00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:02.880
 I have this different perspective on this where I don't have kids. But seeing people talk about

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:09.040
 this, I'm like, I'm actually, I want to make a commitment to never speaking about my kids in

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:19.840
 that way. Because it sounds really positive. But in a lot of ways, you are saying that you're not

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:25.360
 doing a bunch of things because of your kids. And you're kind of putting, you're like basically

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:29.520
 saying that you're kind of like, and this is an extreme way to put it, but adding illustrates a

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:35.680
 point, which is you're blaming them effectively for you not doing a bunch of things. And the reality

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:41.040
 is, is there are people that always do both. There's always someone out there whose kids are like,

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:45.280
 my dad was great. He spent a ton of time with me. And they also did all this other stuff that

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:50.480
 people are like, I don't do that stuff because I want us from time with my children. So I just

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:55.520
 don't want to ever feel like, of course, people don't raise it in a way where it seems like they're

00:57:55.520 --> 00:58:00.720
 using them as an excuse. But I don't think I'm a hundred percent wrong to say like, there is some

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:05.440
 aspect of that. And I feel like I don't want to ever position them that way.

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:10.320
 There's definitely some kind of like, we all want to be good parents. We all want to like,

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:16.000
 be viewed as good parents and people who value our kids. I think our generation too, like,

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:23.200
 I think there's some amount of we were shaped by our parents, our boomer parents who maybe didn't,

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.960
 they wouldn't have said these things if they had Twitter back then. They wouldn't have been like,

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:31.360
 man, I just love to play with my kids. There's a bit of like, millennial identity that is,

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:37.360
 we love playing with our kids. And I don't know, I just, I don't want to like, I'm not trying to

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:41.920
 shame any individual who says that their favorite thing to do is play with their kids or that they

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:46.000
 hate activities that take them away from their kids. That's fine. Maybe you actually do. But I do

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.200
 think there's a bit of like, linkedineness to it where we all just want to be viewed as like,

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.480
 amazing parents. And it's hard. Being parents is hard.

00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:59.280
 I think there's this natural dynamic of you say, like, it's going to be a millennial identity thing.

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:06.320
 There is generally a culture that we want to be true. And then we will engage in rituals that

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:13.680
 reinforce that whether it's like this thing of saying like, all I want to do is spend time with

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:19.680
 my kids is because we want a world where you could just do that. But everyone just says it over

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:24.560
 nowhere and reinforce it. And maybe they don't say that, Hey, like you said, like you just said,

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:29.760
 sometimes I don't sometimes doesn't want to go do a thing on my own. Because even though that's

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:35.360
 true as totally fair and no one would be upset at that, it's not in service of this larger culture

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:40.560
 that I think we're trying to make happen. Put that very smartly. Thank you for making that sound smart.

00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:43.680
 You took what I said and you made it smart. I love it.

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:48.320
 I'm just glad you like I said, I'm glad you said it because I feel like I felt this way and I felt

00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:52.240
 really unfair for me to again, because I'm just not in that position.

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:56.080
 I think you should just respond to tweets like that and be like, listen, from someone who doesn't

00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:06.000
 have kids shut up. I think it'll come really, it'll come through really hard if the fact that you

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.040
 don't have kids. I think it's also, I mean, just you saying it is also just important because the

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:16.880
 downside of this thing where we like, you know, it's good to have this ideal and strive for it,

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:22.160
 but the downside of it is people take it too literally and then they like find themselves in

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.880
 situations where they feel the way you do where you're like, oh, sometimes I don't want to, you

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.960
 know, I want to do my own thing. And they might feel bad about that or they're a bad person.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.400
 So everyone else around them is professing like some kind of purity around it.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.200
 And that's why I call it out, not to shame the people who say it, but to like push back on this

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.400
 feeling, because I have the feeling when I see stuff like that, just like the I'm a dad, I can't

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.320
 believe I'm a dad, I'm the, it's the best. When I see those kinds of things and I have any bit of

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:54.000
 like, oh, but it's also like so hard. I feel bad about, am I just a bad dad? And it doesn't help

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.600
 like being bipolar and honestly, like, I wonder like, do I just not enjoy my kids as much as most

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.200
 people because I just want to be working because I'd rather be manic and at my desk all day with

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.600
 coffee. Like there's that fear. So I definitely have all these self-conscious, like bad feelings.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:11.680
 And then I come back to it and it's like, no, you know what, it's just, it's hard being a parent.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:16.480
 And we don't all feel that way. It's, it's like a ritual. Like you said, it feels like one of those

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:21.520
 things, like everything that's posted on LinkedIn, like we just say it to get the claps and then

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:27.760
 yeah. Yeah, the LinkedIn thing is funny. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know, it just for me, I don't

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:36.000
 me personally, like that identity is not the one that I am going for it to me. Like that feels,

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:42.960
 I have this thing about like, I'm like, and I guess it's entirely a personal thing. I feel like

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:51.200
 when you say certain things, it cheapens the reality of the actual thing. So I feel like,

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.800
 just a personal thing, if I feel like I like really like love my kids and love spending time with them,

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:04.560
 it feels wrong for me to like say that. It feels like kind of cheapens. Yeah, like the sentiment

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:09.280
 behind it, it feels like, okay, some part of it is just because I want other people to know.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.000
 Yeah. Which is fine. Like everyone, that's true, but like actually saying it like makes it too real.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.720
 If we all just constantly say how much we love next year's, then when we actually do love next

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.880
 year's and we have that feeling like, man, this is a good framework, it cheapens it because we've

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:28.960
 just been, it's a ritual now. It doesn't sound real. So we have to actually be real. Yeah.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:34.320
 And this is the thing I have with a with the whole wife guy thing too. Oh, what's the wife guy thing?

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:40.560
 Oh, no, I'm probably this guy. No, no, I don't think you are. It's a so there's this dynamic of

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:47.520
 like publicly being like talking about how like, great your wife is and you know, X, Y, Z. That's

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:53.440
 like a trend that is a thing on social media. And I felt the same way about this where I'm like,

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:59.920
 I do feel that way. Like, I really do. But if I ever posted publicly for other people,

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:05.840
 to me, it feels like I'm like taking something away from the from how genuine that thing is.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:12.240
 And Liz feels the same way. She's like, don't be a wife guy. She doesn't like that concept.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:19.600
 And the funniest thing is a lot of times it tends to be kind of projection or like cover for

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:26.240
 things aren't actually are as perfect as as people are trying to make it seem. So

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.720
 it's definitely very similar to the whole kids thing. But yeah, it's reality of social media.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.720
 There's a lot of a performative aspects of it. It's unfortunate because I'd love to like be

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.920
 super relatable and share all the actual difficult things in life. But like that stuff doesn't really

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.000
 go on social media very far. So it's like, you can't really help that many people. It's like,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.200
 No, I think it does. Okay. So did you I finally had my first ever like truly viral tweet.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:54.720
 Oh, really? Wait, what? When did I miss it? Like it ended up in like newsletter.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.720
 Oh, geez, what was it? What was this? What? How did I miss it?

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:03.280
 It was a dumbest tweet ever. It was it was dumb. I would say if I would rank it

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.840
 on my tweets, it's like not particularly good. Okay, not screenshot a potato. I'm still scrolling.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:13.680
 No, no, no, no, here. It's a recent. I wrote the only the only career advice I have

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.840
 is make every decision that moves you closer to not having to be on LinkedIn.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:26.240
 Okay. Yeah, yeah. That's a good one. It has 95,000 likes. Okay, what's that like?

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.520
 Does it even give you notifications? I always see those tweets and I wanted to like, what's it

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.720
 like to get 95,000 likes? I've muted everything. I always mute things like very soon after they

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:38.640
 like go above like a couple hundred. So I don't know what it would have been like maybe Twitter

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:44.800
 sauce. I mean, notifications, but it was really crazy because like all these like professional

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:49.760
 social media people were like including in their newsletters and like, you know, it was just like

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:56.640
 this funny dynamic. It was on some like random blog spam article being like top tweets this week.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:06.400
 But the point of bringing it up is why did this tweet do well? It's not particularly insightful.

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:11.280
 Like it's not particularly good. I see where this is going, but it is the most relatable tweet

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:16.640
 cause what everyone loves sitting on LinkedIn. And we all know like it's fake. It's that thing

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:21.440
 where we were doing it, but we know it's it's so fake. So there's something about that that we

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:29.600
 all just like, yes, thank you. I hate it. Yeah. So I think the things that go the most viral are

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:34.880
 things that are contrarian in a shallow way, where they're like counter to what's currently

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:39.840
 happening. But technically, that's a very common thing. Like everyone hates LinkedIn, but it's

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:44.880
 counter to like everyone is on LinkedIn trying to do LinkedIn thing. So the thing you're describing

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.880
 probably if you talked about this, it would probably do pretty well because I think a lot of people

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:54.160
 do feel the way you feel, but it is counter to what you're supposed to be doing. Yeah.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:58.880
 Yeah, I gotcha. Yeah. I just scrolled forever. You tweet so much. I was trying to find the tweet.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:02.480
 So I could like it. I want to join 95,000 people and liking your tweet.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:06.720
 Did you just open my open my page and private browsing?

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:10.400
 Oh, because it shows you your top, like the public view of people's profiles,

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.800
 like their top tweets. Oh, that's so funny to think about like, what are my dumb top tweets?

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:20.880
 And that's not a great view of it. It's crazy because that one is 95,000 and number two is 9,000.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:26.080
 Wow. That's a big leap. It's crazy. 10x. Yeah. A step.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:39.200
 Something crazy. Nobody knows that. Nobody knows that. I don't know. It just means 10x.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:46.560
 Yeah. Just add another zero. That's funny. Yeah. It's it's also funny because like,

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:52.640
 I tweet so much and I've been on Twitter for so long. It's taken me so many tries before I got

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:58.560
 in here. And there's people that like do this. People that we know that do this. Yeah. Like,

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:03.920
 very frequently. Like, you know, like, you know, Vic. You mean like pop off? Vic? Yeah. I know Vic.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.560
 Me and Vic go way back. He pops off. He has like, he has so many of these.

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:13.280
 I feel like every other week he just going crazy viral for Annie has a bunch of them.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:17.840
 I've seen a bunch of hers. And yeah. And then Annie's like, every single week,

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:21.840
 she's got something going. Yeah. I got a piece so bad. Are we done? Should we just be done?

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:25.520
 Okay. It's going to be done. It's been an hour. Isn't it? Okay. Yeah. We should just be done.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:30.320
 I got a piece. All right. All right. See man. Sounds you make when you got a feeling. Oh my god.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:36.000
 Okay. All right. See you. All right. Bye.
