WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Yeah, i don't know what the voice thing i was doing there was not about who i'm being but angry web standard person actually i do yeah i do know who i'm being but i'm not going to say i know you're being.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:59.980
 What is that what are you cracking open it's a melon glad you asked what's that is that the watermelon drink yeah they're so my god i don't know where you can get them i get them at mama jeans and i've never seen them in any other place whole foods nowhere i don't know why they exist here in the Ozarks you look really really.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:21.040
 The cute with your little pink drink the little children's good yeah this is the passion fruit flavor which is pink i also have a pineapple you're like i don't care never mind there's pineapple there's a there's a ginger one that's delicious we're not even sponsored by them.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:29.340
 We should be i'll reach out now i would love to get fun sponsored by random food companies just be hilarious to me.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:39.520
 Like most tech companies are sponsored by you know tech things you try with a lot of tech podcast i did try you know what i tried really hard it's still annoys me.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.400
 It's a huge missed opportunity for them it's general mills they bought lara bar.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:59.340
 I don't know lara herself she wanted to answer me yes i agree with that and did you see me post that picture of what you agree with what what is that they should sponsor us the people should sponsor us yes i think sponsor us i think sponsor us i think.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:12.640
 I think the ry is higher than expect so the other day i posted that picture of that bill tom i don't know if you saw me posted you probably know because of the meeting thing yeah yeah so i posted about that and end up getting like.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:23.780
 A ton of views and then like a week later a ton of people were posting like hey just ordered mine or just got in the mail is delicious and i definitely sold a bunch.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:36.600
 I know a few people that bought mode keyboards because of my streams and expensive yeah i got nothing out of it i need to get a referral code or something i know.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:45.180
 Yeah it's like at least one person will buy anything that you talk about i've been talking about that the head shaver i use once and then someone bought it.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:56.340
 This is how our economy works isn't it yeah i mean like yeah let's point this out to me she was like.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:12.700
 Every single thing she sees in stores now is like a celebrity thing like when she goes to like Sephora to get makeup and stuff she just sees it's all celebrity branded yeah stuff cuz like if you have reach is such a crazy competitive advantage so.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:26.400
 Yeah that's like kind of a recent phenomena right like the last ten years i feel like the individual has become way more powerful than or like as a representative for brands it happened in sports to i follow sports pretty closely with my company.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:42.900
 And like the athlete became empowered over the teams and now like you see this wave of like players is like i want to play with this team anymore and they forced themselves to get traded like that didn't happen twenty years ago so interesting i don't know if it's social media what it is but the individual has so much more.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:53.800
 Pull and they did yeah on some level kind of sucks because i feel like we're seeing dynasties show up and that's like i think fundamentally dynasties are bad like i you see.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:11.600
 Kids of famous people just in everything now it's like her passion is that what you mean her actions are one but i think we watch a bunch of movies lately and we're like who's this actors and every time we looked it up it's been that their parents were.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:20.660
 Actors are actresses themselves like it's yeah i feel like he's half the time that's the case if not more it's like pretty surprising to see someone like break through.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.900
 Yeah and the Kardashian examples another one like that's just.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:35.460
 They're on the like the grandkids are now like starting to enter their teens so we'll see if it just continues where yeah so it's just like it kind of sucks in a way like dynasties aren't great.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.340
 It's like nepotism is more it's more easily pulled off when the individual has power yeah i feel like people figured out and there are.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:56.660
 I think i think historically celebrities would just get rich blow all their money and maybe even not very wealthy and now they're all really savvy and they know that they can leverage it like create businesses at last.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:06.900
 Beyond them even the NBA right that's a common story where people would return and then they would have no money by the time they were yeah in their forties.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:16.300
 And that doesn't happen anymore which is good on that side but like the dynasty thing is something i don't like and there's something i really want to talk about with the school like.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:31.180
 Why we can't it's it's something i really want to talk about that there's a little teaser for somebody or there is something that we want to talk about we can't but we can't talk about me index are starting a dynasty.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:45.180
 Know that you said you said general mills earlier so one of our at previous company one investors had this house.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.660
 I'm in the at a rondex on this lake just like a rich person like in the what now the add a rondex it's in like northern New York.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:11.120
 Say one of the new york at a rondex just want to see if you can say consistently hard word i don't know i've never heard of it i think you know i can add a rondex chair like you know if you ever heard it said or you only ever read it cuz this could be really embarrassing for you when we find out how to pronounce no no this is not one of those things okay.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:21.820
 A rondex did i do right at the wrong tree yeah and around and around what was it at a rondex at a rondex i think you said and of the first time i'm on the slide okay.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:41.120
 I see what it feels like to be on the other side of this and i don't like it yeah i don't know okay and he had a pretty they call them camps they don't come houses is a really like rich person little insight because they are kind of like camps it's usually like one property is several houses.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.440
 Like they had a main house and they had like two other cabins that we stayed in.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:07:10.680
 Okay and there's was like you know a nice house and was built you know a hundred years ago pretty crazy then they took us on a boat tour like around the lake and these people are so funny because they were like old money like the guy the investor was in his sixties and his parents is like grandfather was rich like they've been rich for a while and the house have been their family for a while and they were going around they were pointing out like that's new money like we don't like them and it's always like.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:26.160
 A much flashier house and theirs and then we drove by the biggest one there it was insane it's a gigantic property it had literally 40 buildings on it is a single property in the woods on the lake with 40 buildings on it like you could.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.880
 How's everyone you know it's pretty insane yeah and it was like the aris of general mills or something.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:53.960
 All back into general mills okay yeah so they got the money if they want to throw down here is that the play if you if you like came into a hundred million dollars is it like build a village and just move all your friends and family there you just get like this perfect life where you have all the people around you I would try and you hire them all to do random stuff.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:02.200
 That's kind of what was a lot of it yeah yeah everyone in the family works for him and oh yeah I know several stories like that like.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:15.960
 Seems like the move it doesn't take what's the what's the amount of money where like you're just you're good for life and you said this amazing easy life I think 10 million probably enough 10 million is.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:31.120
 At low risk what 5% interest right now that gets you 500k a year doing nothing yeah that's yeah that's pretty close arcs that'll do yeah I know actually I had dinner sorry and that.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:46.280
 There was a person a friend of a friend here in the area that we went and had dinner with them once they sold like a medical tech company or something for 10 million dollars I've seen what that life looks like they're in probably like their late 50s they're kind of older.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.440
 But yeah they just chilled like play card games with their friends and had wine and dinner and whatever it's like that was their life.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:09:00.320
 That seems nice what kind of car they have I don't remember this has been like almost 10 years ago okay I guess it wasn't memorable.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.080
 No what I want to talk about is there's actually a few things but.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.600
 The main one that's top of mind is.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.240
 I don't want to frame it as bundle sizes because that sounds boring.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:25.000
 This is not that is not where I think I was so surprised I thought it was going to be some like something not related to tech at all and to have you bring up something so zoomed in like the bundle.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:39.960
 I know it's what I said I didn't want to frame it as bundle sizes because it's actually about the anaeron Dax and I have this this this conundrum that I'm in the middle of and I think I've already talked to you a little bit about it.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:56.960
 But I'm no more settled than I was when I last mentioned to you and in fact I have more questions and more random obscure technologies I've run into and I want to just throw all this at your face and hear your visceral reaction yeah and if it ends up being just use react.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:09.240
 I'm going to be upset because it's going to end up there but I think it is to and I'm going to be upset but at least I guess I'll have a reason to go react Miami now I won't feel quite as weird okay so.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:31.600
 Big project or I mature product okay website lots of people hit this website every day like Wikipedia in terms of the use case millions of pages that are unique but they're largely just static pages with very little interactivity think like drop downs to filter data.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:41.880
 Like type ahead in a search bar some menus I mean it's very little like tab control like there's just not a lot of it's mostly like looking at data okay.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:48.480
 So that's the stage this website now is being kind of re.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:55.480
 Visually designed just going to be like putting a new coat of paint on it right and with that.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:09.320
 It there's sort of like a design system being created and for the first time we're going to need to like have some consistency across a bunch of of these interactive pieces and we kind of know what they should look and feel like.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:20.360
 And it feels like a moment to say hey maybe we should pick like a UI framework or library or whatever to use it's an astro site by the way.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:34.360
 So it's already Astro and to date we've just sprinkled in little bits of JavaScript mostly in script tags just like vanilla JavaScript because I don't know Astro kind of like tells you how to do that and then it's like oh yeah it's just JavaScript I can do this.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:41.360
 But then we did start using we have like a handful of spelt components because I randomly wanted to see what spelt was like.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:56.040
 Okay, so so now I found out don't love it just I just looking at it's not familiar at all it doesn't remind me of anything and it just kind of feels gross I don't know it's not spelt fault it's just my lack of familiarity with spelt.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:10.080
 Additional data point or consideration I guess this is going to be an open source repo it is open source we haven't talked about it to anybody yet but we're going to be promoting it is like hey you're a fan of this product and you happen to know how to code.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:29.720
 Join the open source community and you can be a part of it whatever or even just for learning purposes so there's going to be like potentially friction introducing obscure technologies on that front like if it's something that we would like other people to or even just within our own team just get up to be quickly and contribute on the front end.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.720
 That kind of matters so like path of leisure distance would be nice.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:50.240
 All that said it just feels bad to me just feels so gross to drop react in for a drop down like this page that a million people will hit today and I'm going to throw the react runtime on this page so that I can create a select that I can style.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:58.760
 Yeah, first of all that side note why can't you style the drop down part of the technology we don't have the technology we don't have.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:23.160
 30 years to develop what's it called what's a new thing that's coming out like menu but it's actually now select list I think yeah why okay this is not my point and I got to get back to it but why is it so slow why is the web browser standards process so incredibly slow can we not move faster there's like four browsers can we not like as a group be like you know what we've taken a decade to do something that could be done in.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:40.360
 Three months let's just do in three months I'm not that I'm not talking about select list I'm just saying like what is it about the process that is inherently slow yeah so I think here so I watched this podcast with Aaron booedman the founder of replicash and he used to work on chrome and he was giving a little bit of the history of.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:47.040
 Like data in the browser like storing data in the browser it was so interesting to hear because.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:59.000
 He goes over a bunch of technologies that they like tried to put in the browser like at Google they would like try to put something in and then no one else would adopt it so they would like tweak it and try to put it in and then no else would adopt it.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:16.360
 It's super super slow I think because everything is it put in has to be a hundred percent backwards compatible forever but why you can never deprecate anything can we not I get okay but you could still introduce new fun stuff without deprecating the old stuff right I guess.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:34.360
 Well if you introduce something new and it ends up being a bad idea or bad implementation but there's websites out there that ended up using it it's there forever you know I see so there's some hesitancy to move fast because you're creating stuff that's going to live on in perpetuity yeah I think so I think it's like the most conservative.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:15:00.520
 Being in the world in terms of adding stuff okay that makes sense and this sort of politics you're saying like there's this got to get consensus from all the major players yeah just imagine getting to engineer to agree in general like any two engineers yeah but like I feel like every engineer in the world I can get him in the room right now and we'd always our hand if we wanted to build style every piece of the select control yeah but then the question is like how like what's the right abstraction for that and I think that just ends up taking literal years.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:28.680
 It's a fan why does it seem so easy from the outside I'm sure it's not I respect all of you people working on browsers I'm not trying to gloss over how hard it is he was talking about ASM or sorry web ASM wait was him what am I saying I couldn't find a word was him web ASM sound like a friggin I literally never heard it called web ASM but that's what it is that like the anaeron that says that oh my word.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:42.680
 Wasm which also you know doesn't sound great and from our point of view I feel like being outside or it's oh yeah browsers added wasm and now we can do like you know you can put compile native code and run it in the browser great.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:53.680
 You saw how there were like three other attempts at this before like they launched something I forgot what it was called it was like blah blah blah and people didn't like it because it wasn't portable enough.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:16:01.680
 They said he blah blah blah which is like portable blah blah blah blah and they're like actually no just fuck all that.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:17.680
 It just went it just keeps going and eventually you know it's something makes it through but that seems like it was like a six or seven year effort maybe I'm just guessing from the way he told it I could see how I could see how wasm would be a big one I mean web

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:29.680
 wasm web ASM but for some reason like I don't know something about the select control thing.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:36.680
 It's just it feels like a bug that doesn't feel like a new thing he's been released it's like fix the bug make it where we can style select that's all just make that please.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:46.680
 Yeah but then the question is always just how like so Liz is doing this is doing an HTML course because she's getting more hands on with stuff and she was showing me some of the stuff you made and I was just like what the hell is all of that.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:17:00.680
 Like she was all of these like native HTML stuff that I never heard of like yeah all these like weird things that I guess are useful and correct but like I kind of use those but let's be honest we're just like divs all day for the most part.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:15.680
 Yeah it's that I think it's probably more the front end like spa philosophy is like you're going to build all the stuff anyway just a bunch of divs but I think the people care more about the semantic HTML stuff when you're like web standards and I'm just going to generate pages

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:22.680
 on the back end and yeah yeah I don't know what the voice thing I was in there was all that.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:34.680
 Angry web standard person but actually I do yeah I do know who I'm being but I'm not going to say I know who you're being.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:48.680
 I don't listen and how they don't know exactly anyway so I think I'm down for those new components when they have a lot of behavior that are that are built in we just rated us.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:18:02.680
 Like what those newer component elements I can't find my words today.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:10.680
 Those newer elements when they come with behavior that we were like manually creating like the new like model components.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:23.680
 They're like a dialogue now is there a dialogue to be properly accessible is like so complicated like you make sure you have the escape key to closing it to make sure you focus traps you can't scroll while it's open.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:39.680
 But the native one does all that stuff right does all that accessibility so if you could just style it if you just make all that can you style that one well okay so it's just select the new elements coming out that handle all these common cases are also very

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:48.680
 styleable so I think that's what select menu is it's like probably behavior wise it might even be better than the existing select component and it's also going to be styleable.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:54.680
 Yeah so but you know it takes takes time back to my problem at hand.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:19:06.680
 If I can't style select element which I can't I can either drop react into this page that again is like it's like if Wikipedia had react on it Wikipedia doesn't have react does it.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:12.680
 So this example is going to break down if they do maybe they have a article called react.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:22.680
 Well you know what I meant like they don't use react on Wikipedia I wouldn't know yeah it's not a good fit right just doesn't feel right.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.680
 So then there's like all these other things I want to get into other options I ran into.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:39.680
 The web components custom elements and HTML you can like define custom element you're already shaking your head now if we break this down from ground up like what are you trying to do.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:49.680
 You're trying to create some non native behavior that like in the browser basically you have a few cases where you need stuff that is non native right.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:56.680
 I guess so yes yeah I just feels like it is native because there is a select element it's just it looks terrible.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.680
 Yeah like you outgrew that so you need to do some non native stuff.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:10.680
 You don't want to actually build that completely from scratch because doing non native stuff is complicated like a properly accessible select thing is.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.680
 Yeah there's a lot of.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:18.680
 Yeah so like a web component doesn't solve that because what you're actually looking for is someone that's already implemented.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:23.680
 The JavaScript that does this really well and has packaged it in a reusable way.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:35.680
 Yes but I guess like I'm saying the alternative to using react and to or to using any front end framework with a bunch of custom JavaScript stuff is like use the standards.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:43.680
 And there's this web component thing where I could find something that wraps up all that functionality which I have found and I'll tell like there's Microsoft fast.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.680
 Have you heard of this I'd never.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.680
 I saw someone reply to you without it.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.680
 It's interesting.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:21:01.680
 I don't think we're going to go that way because of a few things but it's like it's based on web components so it's like not it's using this new thing within the browser that works natively.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:06.680
 Yeah I don't know and it gives me that radix like accessibility and stuff built up.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:16.680
 So that's what I'm talking about like that's just a packaging format so you just first you think you look to see who has implemented this well and how they chosen to package it and that's like a secondary concern right.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:22.680
 So obviously a lot because react is so big there's like react Aria and then like the Adobe.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.680
 Or maybe that was the same thing.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.680
 Well yeah there's so many options on the react side.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.680
 Yeah so they've implemented but the downside is a package it as a react component which feels like really heavy for you.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.680
 Yes right exactly that's my problem.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:45.680
 Someone could package it and someone could have just written it in like pure JavaScript and like given you some jobs for like a jQuery type thing from back in the day like someone could that's also.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.680
 jQuery for just came out maybe I should add that to my decision matrix.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.680
 Yeah.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:55.680
 Like those jQuery things right like that was like another way to package complex behavior.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.680
 I don't think web components are inherently better.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.680
 I think they're just a way to package they're technically standardized but.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.680
 Yeah I don't think it's like and not any different than just a JavaScript library.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.680
 But is it less is it less JavaScript that has to run or it's no I guess it's.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.680
 No you can talk about that right.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.680
 People can.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.680
 Oh yeah okay.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.680
 It just comes down to implementation.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.680
 So then I think.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.680
 But I don't have to have the react runtime.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.680
 Yes exactly.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.680
 There's a lot of extra stuff that comes with react.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.680
 If I'm just building literally a drop down.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.680
 Yeah but I'm saying like a pure JavaScript library that just.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:32.680
 Implement the interactivity and like mutates a Dom is not worse than the web component.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.680
 I gotcha.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.680
 Because those are like similar in terms of.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.680
 Yeah they're both just JavaScript packaged up different ways.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.680
 Yeah.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.680
 Then I think you probably saw like that zag thing which is kind of.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.680
 I did.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.680
 Just a pure JavaScript thing.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.680
 No UI stuff.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.680
 Just.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.680
 The complex logic to.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.680
 That you can like you know bind to certain UI elements.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.680
 Yeah.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.680
 Then there's like other frameworks that are maybe not as heavy as react.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.680
 But maybe that's why you play with felt cause.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.680
 For small apps.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.680
 The bundle size tends to be the smallest.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.680
 And like solid is like very close to that.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.680
 I think solid scales better like if your app gets bigger.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.680
 Solid ends up crossing spilt in terms of.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.680
 So I think I think I have a misunderstanding of something though.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.680
 So other options that'll help frame my misunderstanding.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.680
 There's like alpine people pointed me to.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:25.680
 And Caleb from alpine reached out and told me he's got this alpine components.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.680
 Which are basically like radix but with alpine.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.680
 Yeah.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.680
 Alpine's a little heavier than something like spelt or solid I think.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.680
 Yeah.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.680
 Their latest version is anyway.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.680
 Someone pointed me to like lit.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:40.680
 Which is just a framework that's a little bit higher abstraction on top of web components.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.680
 There's stencil.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.680
 There's that family of things.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:49.680
 I think my misunderstanding is like I look at certain options like alpine versus solid.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.680
 And I think of solid as being like fundamentally philosophically about generating DOM elements.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.680
 In JavaScript.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.680
 Whereas I view and don't correct me yet.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.680
 You're probably already like you have the right answer.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:08.680
 But I view like alpine as philosophically modifying existing DOM elements that we created in our Astro templates.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.680
 Like our like we have some kind of server side way of generating a page.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.680
 And we have a bunch of HTML and then we just want to sprinkle stuff.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.680
 I just want to sprinkle you know.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.680
 Yeah.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.680
 That philosophically I want to sprinkle JS.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.680
 I don't want to start with JS.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.680
 And I don't want it to feel like a client side rendered thing.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.680
 But then you said something yesterday about well yeah Astro will just server render.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.680
 It'll like server render your react components.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.680
 I was like oh I'm done.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.680
 The drop down is not going to like be generated on the browser.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.680
 It's generated and then hydrated.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.680
 That's what the word hydration is.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.680
 That's what they're.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.680
 Did I figure it out?

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680
 You got it.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.680
 Look at it.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.680
 This is the best way to understand something you like discover it on your own.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.680
 So then solid.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.680
 I had put in the camp with react where it doesn't really fit what I want to do.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.680
 Which is again I want to sprinkle JavaScript.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.680
 I just want to sprinkle interactivity on my static page.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.680
 But it doesn't matter because Astro is going to server render solid just like it was.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.680
 Well is it?

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.680
 Does it server render solid?

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.680
 Yes.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.680
 Okay.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.680
 Yeah.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.680
 So it would fundamentally we could use solid.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.680
 And I could be cool like you because you use solid and I've always wanted to be cool.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.680
 Thank you.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.680
 And you solid.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.680
 Yeah.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.680
 So that's kind of why I'm saying I think the primary decision is you want someone to have

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.680
 done this work of building these interactive reusable things.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:28.680
 And did you find a project where you're like I really like the way they did it.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.680
 And it clicks for me.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.680
 And then secondarily you consider the way they packaged it.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.680
 Yeah.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.680
 So I've always loved radix on the react side.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.680
 And I know now react areas getting a lot of love.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.680
 Like I know there's even other options.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.680
 The headless UI.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.680
 There's all these different options.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.680
 Solid I know there's an equivalent right to radix or something pretty good.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.680
 Yeah.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.680
 We've been using cobalt.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.680
 Okay.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.680
 Felt.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.680
 There's actually a few things in spelt world too.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.680
 That's a pretty big community.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.680
 I don't know if you've noticed.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.680
 So there's a lot of filters.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.680
 Selt.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.680
 Selties?

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.680
 I don't know.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.680
 Sounds like Swifties.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.680
 Svelte has melt which is what we're using today.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.680
 Selt has melt.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.680
 Yeah.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.680
 So they have a radix port.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.680
 And the guy that was porting radix was like actually this is dumb.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.680
 It doesn't fit spelt model.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.680
 So he abandoned it.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.680
 Just maintenance mode or whatever and get hub and built melt.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.680
 And it has a ton of components actually.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.680
 Maybe even more than radix.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680
 And I like the way it comes together.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.680
 I just don't like the way spelt looks.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.680
 So I kind of want to abandon spelt.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.680
 And now you're really making me think we should just move to solid.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.680
 Well, okay.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:38.680
 So there's also another thing here where solid is in my head it's two things.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.680
 There's the templating language which is what lets you like.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.680
 Create like right.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.680
 Yes.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.680
 And I might have those elements get created both on the server and the client.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.680
 But then there's like the low level reactive primitives that let you like.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.680
 Find stuff.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.680
 Yeah.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.680
 I talked about this a little bit before.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.680
 So a lot of my solid components.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.680
 I actually just use document.query selector.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.680
 Select elements and like add data attribute.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.680
 I don't.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.680
 I'm not really like doing the whole solid thing.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.680
 So really like writing like pretty normal JavaScript.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.680
 And when I do need some kind of reactivity and like binding like I will use.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.680
 Some of those, some of those things there.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.680
 This is so surprising to me because you were so early on solid.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.680
 Why would you not embrace the solid?

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:27.680
 This is the best part about solid is that our just normal DOM elements.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.680
 Okay.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.680
 It's different.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.680
 Right.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.680
 Right.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.680
 The solid part like really melts away.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.680
 It's really just a templating language.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.680
 There's some primitives for reactivity where you need it.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.680
 And then you can just grab the elements and then like treat them the same way.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:47.680
 We used in the jQuery world and I find it really, really simple.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.680
 And you can do that and react to, which is you're fighting the paradigm a little bit more.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.680
 But this, I actually got this idea initially because Ryan Florence posted a combo box.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.680
 He built and react and he didn't use like any react.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:03.680
 He just had like document.query selector and just how we would do it back in the day.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.680
 Yeah.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.680
 So I don't think these things are that heavy.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.680
 I think, yeah, I think you just have to like measure what heavy actually means.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.680
 Yeah.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.680
 I really don't.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.800
 I said I don't want to frame it as bundle size because I don't know if I care about the

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.680
 actual kilobytes going over the wire or being run when the page initially.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.680
 Oh, like.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.680
 Oh, then what do you care?

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.880
 Well, I mean, I don't know how much I care about that because like every site uses react

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:30.240
 and like, yeah, if it works for other sites, it can work for us, like if it works for Facebook,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.480
 whatever, like they have a lot of users, I think.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.880
 Do people still use Facebook?

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.880
 I don't know.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.180
 Yeah, to me, it's more the philosophy.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.600
 I think it's more just like the vibes.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.520
 I just don't like the react situation.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.040
 So that makes me turned off from it.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.720
 But at the same time, the community is so large.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.880
 I feel like we're getting pulled toward should we just use react because everybody uses react

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.720
 and if it's going to be open source and other people need to maybe work on it, just feels

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.760
 like this inevitability of react and I hate it.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:05.000
 Like, how do you feel about the community size and the ecosystem solid versus react?

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.080
 It's on a trajectory that like I'm not going to be wanting for anything or do you have

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.080
 opinions?

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.080
 Yeah.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.080
 To me, it's not.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.080
 Yeah.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.080
 It's like this question comes up a lot.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:19.760
 And there's obviously you can't deny size like size is a dimension that matters.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:27.120
 But to me, it's the same as like comparing companies just purely by size.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.600
 You can't say Google will always ship a better product because they're bigger than a smaller

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.600
 company.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.240
 It's usually like weirdly size almost is like the opposite in that case.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.240
 Yeah.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:42.640
 So for me, there was a point early on in solid where I felt like, oh, there's actually

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.200
 literally nothing like for the most part anytime I need to integrate with something else I'm

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.400
 doing it myself.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.720
 But then like a few things happen like cobalt came out.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.160
 There's this new form library called modular forums.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.560
 It's written by the guy that made this other thing called Valibot and Valbot generally

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.440
 is like like the next generation idea of like Zod.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.200
 So like to me, some of the best people in the space are also I'm trying to parse all

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.200
 that sorry.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.200
 Yeah.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:13.000
 The next generation of Zod isn't Zod like very cutting edge and hip was what's what's

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.400
 so Zod is cool.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.360
 And there's a lot of the elevation libraries.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.840
 And the problem with Zod is a chaining API it makes it so you basically ship all of Zod,

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.560
 and if you just use like two of the validators.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:31.240
 So Valibot is like a really tree shaking focus version of Zod, and I think the solid team

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.760
 actually sponsored the work that the person did behind it.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.760
 Okay.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.320
 I think it was even part of their like masters or something academic related.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.720
 Then that person went and made this thing called modular forums, which is so good.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.960
 It's like a really great forums library.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.800
 It integrates perfectly with cobalt.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.960
 So everything is like coming together and meshing.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:55.240
 So I'm at a point where I feel like, oh, this is like what react people must feel like

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.240
 all the time.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.240
 Because like it's gotten there.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.400
 Yeah, there's like a few libraries that are the best and they all work nicely with each

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.280
 other and they're very composable.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:09.760
 So the past six months, I would say I don't feel lack of ecosystem in solid.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.760
 Yeah.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.320
 Everyone's different.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.640
 And even if you look at cobalt, I'm sure if you drill down into cobalt behavior and like

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:21.640
 compare components one to one with some of the stuff on react, I'm sure the react stuff

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.160
 gets stuff more correct.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.480
 Just the other dimension is like just age of some of these things.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.280
 Yeah, just maturity.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.840
 Yeah.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.720
 So you're just not going to go wrong picking react.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:41.480
 The only reason I would pick solid is if you just find using react frustrating.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:46.560
 So I guess the react frustrating thing, I definitely like, it was eight years of building

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.160
 react before I kind of stopped.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.640
 I felt like there were things that still didn't stick after eight years.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.600
 Use effect usage.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.600
 That sounds like a meme.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:59.000
 But I really did feel like I probably used it way too much and just sprinkled it everywhere

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.600
 to solve every problem.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.520
 There's definitely stuff in the like the edges of react that didn't feel great.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.320
 But I'd like, but I know how to write react apps.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.760
 So it's like there is an advantage there.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.240
 Our team is very familiar with react.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.560
 Getting solid versus react is really probably more like just like getting out of the react

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.560
 drama.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.120
 I guess.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:25.200
 And like Ryan, I think Ryan is like the smartest guy in the space.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.400
 So it feels good to use something he made, I guess.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.400
 Yeah.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.400
 Yeah.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.960
 And yeah, for me, it was like, it was the same.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.880
 It was kind of similar where I was like, I've spent years using react.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:42.200
 I spent a lot of time as a consultant looking at a lot of react code bases and they just

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.580
 never come out great.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.720
 They just come out just okay after a couple of years.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:52.400
 And I could like start to identify like why I didn't know what the solution was or better

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:57.640
 model and solid to me like was the answer is like, okay, the things I identified don't

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.000
 even exist in the solid world.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 Yeah.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:08.400
 So I found that I've been able to focus on really important things a lot more now, like

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.840
 like little interactivity details and stuff that would just be too tired to focus on otherwise.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:17.480
 I've shown a solid to a bunch of other people that have switched over, not even people that

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.520
 are like super senior or anything, just, you know, just a average person building stuff.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.840
 I can see the result of their work is actually better.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.480
 It's like noticeably better, like the thing that they built.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.480
 Yeah.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:34.040
 So I think it is it is good and it's it's effective and I've seen it enough times where

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.680
 I can like make that claim and I feel confident in it.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:44.680
 It just comes down to like how sensitive are you to again, just like he goes, we're going

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.680
 to book everything.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.680
 Yeah.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.920
 Like I said, it's like it's it's not even it's so much better now than it was a couple

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.920
 of years ago.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.600
 And I like I can't even imagine I don't think it even needs to get that much better, but

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.400
 everyone has like a different yeah, different bar.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.400
 Okay.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:04.680
 So I didn't make a decision on this podcast that'll happen with my team, but I do feel

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.560
 more informed and that's nice.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.520
 I really don't like looking at felt files.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:14.880
 I don't know why, but we have enough of it now like I mean, we have like there's hundreds

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:19.960
 of lines of felt in our code base at this point that does feel like the easy path is

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.480
 to just keep doing what we're doing, even though I don't like it.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:26.800
 Like I don't like looking in or working in these files.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:32.600
 This is especially funny because at least this is my impression.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:37.220
 My impression of like this felt angle is actually a lot about aesthetics.

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:43.440
 Like they really care about the way something looks and they will like always introduce

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.120
 compiler functionality to like improve the aesthetics.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.120
 Yeah.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.320
 But again, that's like their perspective of what the aesthetics are.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.840
 So if someone that's not that are all coming into it, just like, ew, but then there's like,

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.040
 no, like what are you talking about?

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:01.240
 That's like the thing that they care about, you know, I don't I'm not trying to say it's

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.320
 objectively hideous.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.680
 It's just from my perspective.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:09.920
 And maybe it's just my experiences coming from mostly doing react development and mostly

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.720
 working in JSX files.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.640
 It just is so unfamiliar that it's like repulsive to me.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.640
 Yeah.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:20.080
 And I'm not trying to offend anybody involved with felt like I'm sure it's excellent.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.960
 I just I can't get over the fact that it feels so unfamiliar and I just want to be back home

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.240
 in something I know.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.240
 Yeah.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.080
 Stuff doesn't click sometimes.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.080
 That's what I liked about solid.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.080
 Like I like JSX.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.360
 You know, I know some people don't, but I like genuinely like it.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.720
 I think that was one of the best things that came out of react.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.120
 I use it outside of react.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:41.840
 Like I use it on the back end, like without react even say that again, you use JSX on the

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:42.840
 back end.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.840
 How?

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.840
 Like, what do you do with it?

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.040
 There's there's libraries that I'll just compile for emails.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.240
 Well, we use it for emails, JSX email, we do use that.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:56.160
 But sometimes I just have like page I need to put together.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.160
 That's pretty simple.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.640
 And I don't want to like create a whole front end project for it.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.680
 So I'll just spit out some JSX from a Lambda and that gets rendered by it.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.480
 And that like it's converted to HTML.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.480
 Yeah.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.480
 And there's like non react renderers of JSX.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.480
 It just do like a sync.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.480
 Really?

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.480
 And spit out HTML.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.720
 I've used it for PDFs like I've used it for like, I like JSX.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.400
 I think it's interesting.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.080
 I've never heard of any of that.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.080
 I've heard of using react to make terminal apps.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.080
 I've done that, I think.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.080
 And I've done that too.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.400
 And yeah, I'm not derries out.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.880
 I'm not so sold on it.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.320
 You know what it is?

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.640
 We just run into like the dumbest errors.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:38.040
 We have, and this is just more of a node ecosystem, or npm ecosystem thing.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:42.460
 We are CLI depends on React for SSD, the current CLI.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:48.080
 And of course, like some package manager somewhere gets confused at the fact that the

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:52.840
 CLI needs to react, but then their app also needs to react and it like fucks up the versions.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:57.520
 And then it's just like, it's like relatively common because a lot of people use react.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.320
 So it's just like unnecessary complexity.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.680
 But you know what, like making a terminal app that like is interactive and like clears

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.520
 out the bottom footer of it is like pretty hard.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.520
 Oh, for sure.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:15.160
 Yeah, I've made a few and not had great experiences with everything I've used, but Ink was one

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.760
 of them that didn't solve a lot of my problems before we move off of it.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:25.760
 So you also looked into like the Alpine world.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:29.640
 And you said they do have like a component library that has like more than the bare bones.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.880
 It's sort of, yeah, it's sort of like tailwind UI.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:37.320
 It's like you buy a license one time and you can like copy paste these components and then

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.920
 rework them how you want to.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.800
 But they're very like accessibility focused.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.480
 It's sort of similar mantra to like, I think they're headless too, to radix on all these

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.160
 other libraries.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:53.560
 The thing with Alpine, I even, I literally went to, you know, on Twitter mobile, do you

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.560
 use Twitter mobile?

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.600
 Like the web, the web app or like the native app?

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.000
 No, like, like the native app.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 Sorry.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.240
 I just spent way too long asking that question for what I'm about to ask you because it's

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.240
 like, you said, yes.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.520
 So you know how much I'm on Twitter.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.360
 Like, do you think I don't, I mean, I don't know, maybe you're like a non native app person,

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.920
 one of those people that's like, I only use the web.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.080
 I just did the voice again.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.080
 I know.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.080
 This is something different.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.880
 I was the same person.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.880
 Oh.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.880
 Okay.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:29.160
 No, in the native app on iPhone, you can like go to somebody's profile and just search

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.160
 their tweets really easy.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.040
 You don't have to like, from whatever.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.840
 That's why I said it was too much time spent because like, it could just said I'd use Twitter

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.840
 search.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.840
 I used to be a lot of time like, I'm still talking about it.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.840
 Yeah.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.840
 Yeah.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.840
 It's just, okay.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.320
 So I searched through Ryan Carniado's tweets for all the times he mentioned Alpine.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.800
 Because I just want to know what does Ryan say?

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.560
 I just trust his opinion on any front end thing.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:56.080
 And he, there's a history of him talking about Alpine very favorably, even though, like if

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.240
 you look at his benchmarks, it tests horribly from the standpoint of like manipulating the

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:05.720
 DOM really fast, which I don't really care that much for our use case.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:11.160
 But he speaks favorably in the sense that if you're trying to just modify existing DOM

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:15.160
 nodes, pages that are rendered, like on the server he talks about, it's used a lot in

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.640
 like the Elixir, the Rails communities or whatever, that it's better than solid for that use

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.640
 case.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.640
 Yeah.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:27.280
 So I kind of thought like that was my philosophy is that we're trying to take an existing page

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.280
 and just augment it.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.400
 We're progressively enhancing it, if you will.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.520
 There's people that get really into that stuff.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:37.400
 Well, it's just funny because I think that stuff makes way more sense when you're back

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.600
 in is not in JavaScript because it lets you avoid writing JavaScript.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.800
 That's a good point.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.280
 But you're already writing JavaScript.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:49.040
 So then you give up the benefit of like being able to like mix in these frameworks.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.040
 That's a great point.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.040
 Okay.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.920
 So that's maybe the deciding factor here is we already have, it's an Astro back end.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.420
 It's already JavaScript.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:00.880
 Why not take advantage of the fact that it can now render all these front end library

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.160
 components on the back end.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:10.040
 And then so it looks the same, I guess, like the HTML coming down for our select elements,

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.640
 it's going to fully be rendered in the HTML.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.040
 It's just it becomes interactive after the hydration step, I guess.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.720
 How much time, like how much are we killing?

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.880
 I know these things don't matter.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:22.880
 I'm not going to say it.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.920
 It's like one time interactivity or whatever.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.920
 Yeah.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.240
 What they do matter, I mean core, core vitals matter and like the field data that we see

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:33.560
 on our site, there's a lot of users that we can pull that data from and look at using

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:37.120
 Chrome tools like, yeah, what is timed interactive?

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.760
 Is it going to kill our time to interactive if we introduce react?

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.760
 Yeah.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.760
 I mean, yes.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.760
 Yes.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.760
 More than.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.760
 More than solid.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:50.200
 I think the other weird thing is, and I have to think about this more, but Astro is like

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.440
 a neutral server framework, right?

00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:00.640
 It doesn't particularly like adopt specific patterns from the frameworks that support.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.520
 So like Astro is not going to support RSC.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:07.040
 Like they have their different way of doing SSR and they're going to stick with that.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.040
 I would think.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.040
 Yeah.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.040
 And similarly, I am.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.640
 But like you could imagine how if you use react with RSC, like all those metrics are

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:17.840
 probably better potentially, like technically, like I don't know if they matter, but it will

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.680
 probably be better because they're optimized for those things.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:25.000
 And you can maybe imagine using solid with solid start would actually give you like technically

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 better performance.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 Yeah.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 Yeah.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.720
 So yeah, I do wonder what that gap with Astro, like Astro plus solid has that compared to

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:35.200
 just using solid start and ask us react has that compare.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.200
 Yeah.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.200
 Yeah.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:41.120
 I mean, like you have a big consumer facing app with like millions of people using it.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.000
 So I guess these things do end up mattering kind of matter.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.640
 Yeah.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.880
 So we should just stick with felt.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.080
 Is that your official recommendation?

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.120
 No, I'm just trying to get somewhere.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:42:00.520
 I think if you both felt and saw it produce small, smaller, like bundle sizes, I think

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.280
 the TTI will be faster as well.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.280
 Yeah.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.800
 But all came back to bundle sizes.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.800
 It really did.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:10.720
 I think maybe you should just like put what's great about solid is you can try all of these

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.720
 things together.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.880
 And they're just just look at it.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.880
 It's not like there's a work.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.880
 What's great about Astro?

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.880
 You mean?

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.880
 Sorry.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.880
 Yeah.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.440
 What's great about Astro is you have to like bootstrap a whole solid project to try and

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.400
 bootstrap it like you just made the same drive down with with the underlying library that

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.400
 you like and just.

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.880
 Oh, we could just see what the yeah, actually see what the time to interactive is on a page

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.880
 or something.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.720
 I feel for like, I think the reality might be they're all like effectively the same.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.600
 And if that's a case, and you at least know it's not a big deal.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.600
 Yeah.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:39.600
 Okay.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.600
 Yeah.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:45.960
 So we started describing solid start and felt kid or whatever you were saying or next

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.960
 JS.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.120
 I started thinking like, Oh man, did we screw up with like, if we were if we ended up leaning

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:55.200
 hard into react, for instance, or solid, should we have just used our meta framework?

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:59.760
 But I've loved that we actually do have a react component live on the site today.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.760
 That was a carryover from it used to be a react.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.840
 The whole stat means that site used to be a react app.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.200
 And we didn't want to redo this very complicated shot chart component.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.200
 We just carried it over and it's plugged into our Azure site.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.200
 It's great.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.480
 So we have some components.

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.160
 We have this one react component.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.960
 And yeah, to your point, I could experiment.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:22.080
 We could try it in solid and see how it feels like from an authoring standpoint from a bundle

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.840
 size standpoint, all that.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.840
 So that's pretty great.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.840
 Asha's.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.840
 I'm a big fan.

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.840
 Yeah.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.840
 Cool.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.840
 Okay.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:35.760
 I guess I have more thoughts and information in my head now to go into a call with my team

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.000
 and figure out what we're going to do.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 Okay.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 Consulting fee.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 Yeah.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 Sure.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.040
 I'll take you out to lunch when I'm in Miami.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.040
 Take you out.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.040
 Yeah.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.960
 Just give me whatever the paid version of your product is for free.

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.960
 Oh, there you go.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:52.960
 Yeah.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.960
 You can get.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:54.960
 Yeah, I'll get you a coupon code.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.960
 There you go.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:56.960
 Big sports fan, huh?

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.960
 I've used it like three times a day.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.960
 Oh, that's awesome.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.040
 Only because only because you mentioned.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.040
 You had to prove.

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.040
 Yeah.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.040
 I see it.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.520
 Now that I know you, it's like one of those things or ones you hear about it.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:11.520
 Hear about something you just see everywhere.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.520
 Yeah.

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.440
 It's all over the Twitters.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.000
 It's a lot of a lot of Twitter activity.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 Okay.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.480
 We can talk about something else now.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.000
 I dominated the first 45 minutes of this conversation.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 It's your turn.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.200
 I'm just going to say I'm going to drink my water.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.200
 I'm just kidding.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.200
 Do I have anything?

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.200
 I don't know if I have anything.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.200
 You have to have.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.200
 You always have thoughts.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.200
 You've never not had thoughts.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.200
 What?

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.200
 I think there's something.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.840
 You guys just a stream and a big blog post about leaving the CDK.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.840
 Oh, right.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.840
 We talked about that?

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:41.840
 No.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:42.840
 What did we talk about on the hugs?

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.840
 Not.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.840
 Yeah.

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.320
 Can I just say first before you go into this?

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.160
 I feel kind of like kid at the dinner table, mommy and daddy fighting because I know so

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.600
 many people on the CDK side and like really the beginning of my AWS roots kind of come

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.640
 from that CDK community.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.400
 So it's a little spicy for me.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.400
 I hate conflict.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:08.000
 This is so funny because in the stream, Jay was like, because Jay wrote most of the posts,

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.480
 he was like the first two drafts of this were too angry and then like the third draft

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.000
 was not.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.320
 And I genuinely don't think it was a controversial or a spicy thing.

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.320
 We just listed out.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.320
 No, I read the post, by the way.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:27.000
 Yeah, we just listed out all the things that you might run into when you're using CDK and

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.080
 we described what the root problem of those things are.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:36.680
 The spiciest thing, maybe we're like someone like the section titles like I don't know.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:40.440
 Yeah, there were a couple lines, I think, that were kind of like, yeah, this is a sign

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.440
 of terrible design.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.440
 Did we go that far?

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.080
 I'm not terrible.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.080
 Maybe I exaggerated.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:50.840
 But I think maybe like people we'd like had some subtitles that were like, this is not

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:57.840
 IAC, this is an IAC hack or whatever, and people were like, what?

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:01.320
 But to be honest, I thought, okay, one, I was surprised at how much it spread.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:07.840
 It was surprising to see other people posting, reposting, not like retweeting it.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.520
 They would just separately post it.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.360
 We would see it on LinkedIn in a few other places.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:19.600
 And most of the reaction, I would say almost all of it, minus maybe one thread was, or

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.840
 maybe two threads were like really positive, because they were like, oh yeah, people that

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.840
 felt the same thing, though.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.800
 I was like, I recognize that, or I thought I was being dumb, but it's good to know that

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.320
 they know it's a thing.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:34.040
 And there's hasn't been a compilation of all of these weird things.

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:38.080
 And even going through the article yesterday on stream, I was realizing there's actually

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.880
 other stuff that we didn't even include in there.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:45.880
 Like the open source, sorry, I could just add like maybe their stance on outside contributions

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.120
 and well, I talked about that on the stream a lot.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.720
 I didn't see the stream, I just read the box.

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.760
 Yeah, we talked about that too much.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:57.000
 Yeah, no, no, yeah, we were just really looking at just the implementation and like what it

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.040
 feels like to use it.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.480
 And this has nothing to do with like using it through SSD.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.480
 These are just things that come up if you're using CDK, whether you're using it directly

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:10.560
 or with SSD, they just happen and you have to like know that they happen.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.520
 So yeah, most of the reaction was really positive.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:23.640
 The only reason we even put this together is because we're going in a different direction.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.240
 You've seen we've seen this a million times with every other open source framework when

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:33.600
 there is a big shift, there's a lot of concern that it's like a flippant like decision.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.600
 Yeah.

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.600
 And it definitely seems that way, right?

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:40.200
 Because if you're just a user of a product or user of a framework, you're like not in

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:45.360
 the weeds on like the problems and the future and the ceilings and all of that.

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:51.120
 So when there's a big change to you as a user, it feels like really random and we've seen

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.080
 this like with next and like just all their struggles getting people on board.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:59.720
 So we only wrote that to make it clear that, hey, we've like thought about this for a long

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:03.680
 time and we've tried every single solution for these things and we're only doing this

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.600
 because we're out of ideas.

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:11.600
 Yeah, you're not just chasing like a shiny thing that would be fun to do or yeah, it's

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.200
 like there's a lot of deliberation going into that decision.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.200
 Yeah.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:21.760
 And the thing that I posted in my tweet was we personally don't have that many actual problems

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:25.840
 with this stuff because we know how to deal with all these problems and avoid them.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:31.080
 So we're not like, like, yeah, we want them to be fixed, but we're like experts at this

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.080
 point.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.080
 So we know how to work around them.

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:37.840
 It's really the people that are trying you for the first time or like, you know, I think

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:42.800
 the thing with the CDK community is a lot of people in it like live and breathe it.

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.280
 And like that's like the thing they're focused on.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:49.280
 But if you want it to get mass adoption, it needs to be used by people that like don't

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.880
 think about it that much.

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.560
 And if you don't think about it that much, randomly doing a deploy one day and having

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:58.840
 that circular stack problem is just insane, lay frustrating.

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:03.640
 So that's kind of who we're focused on, like we want more people to adopt this stuff.

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:09.680
 It can only happen if they're not being thrown into these weird details entirely randomly.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.680
 Yep.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.600
 Yeah, no, that's what I took away from and I didn't.

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:17.920
 You talked a lot about like the users of SST and the things that they have to deal with

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.360
 because of CDK and like there's no, at this point, there's no workarounds for those things.

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.360
 Yeah.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.640
 And then the other dimension that's also is a little bit challenging to understand as

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.720
 again, just like as a user of these things.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:36.720
 I think people dream of this scenario where you like learn a framework and it really doesn't

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:41.040
 change and there's like it's like very stable, right?

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:45.000
 You don't have to like keep up with the changes and we all want that like we all kind of vaguely

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.280
 want that is annoying when we have to like rework stuff that has nothing to do with our

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.080
 main thing we're working on.

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:59.800
 But that scenario is kind of a fantasy because if a framework is not evolving, it's effectively

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.800
 dying.

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.560
 You know, we'll hit a ceiling with what we have now and I think we're like kind of getting

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.320
 close to it.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.800
 So we basically will never grow after a certain point.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:14.560
 If we just stick with what we're doing now, over time, better options come out that do

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.000
 some of the things that we want to do.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.880
 But like if we choose not to like we'll lose some of those people, you see how like this

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.520
 just won't take around forever.

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:26.960
 You always keep hitting these ceilings and when you do, you do have to like try to jump

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.480
 to the next thing.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:31.720
 Otherwise, the alternative is just becomes a dying framework, right?

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:34.800
 And we've seen that with stuff that's kind of gone away.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:39.720
 We've rarely ever seen something that just hasn't changed at all and been around forever.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.040
 So it's annoying.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:45.420
 You don't have to jump on the cutting edge like the week it comes out.

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:48.360
 You can wait literal years before you do and that's self-control.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:53.360
 It's annoying because you see all the exciting, shiny new stuff, but you can choose to wait

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:58.440
 and a lot of people do that like you're in control of doing that.

00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:02.440
 Projects generally don't like destroy the old thing when they move to the new thing.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.840
 And you know, people pointed that out with react, but yeah.

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.800
 So again, it's a little hard to understand that when you're not working on these things.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:14.880
 You talking about a tweet of yours, took me to your Twitter because I need you to explain

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.600
 a tweet for me.

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:18.960
 Yeah.

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:24.280
 You sometimes do like a sub tweet that is so cryptic and so hard for my brain to understand

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.560
 that I'm just going to start bringing them to you for you to directly explain it to me.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.440
 You don't have to tell me who it's a sub tweet or like what happened that made you think

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.440
 of this.

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:36.120
 You don't even understand the like insult that you're throwing out there at somebody.

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.320
 I can't even comprehend it.

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:40.360
 So I'm going to read the two tweets.

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.240
 The first one, you're kind of setting the stage that you're going to create this thread

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.480
 of like all these different thoughts.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.720
 I still can't believe how much people fall for professional bullshitting in our space.

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:52.640
 I know engineers aren't known for their soft skills, but damn this stuff is super effective.

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.560
 I think I might add examples to this thread over time.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:59.160
 Example one, and this is the one I just don't understand and I need you to unwrap it for

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.160
 me.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:05.040
 The other thing to look for is what self-perceived unflattering thing they're avoiding saying.

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:08.560
 People working on startups are extremely competitive, no different than a sports team.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:13.200
 Some people have no problem acknowledging this, watch out for the people who refuse to.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:16.080
 Maybe it's not as complicated as I thought it was.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:20.520
 It's funny because Cody posted a chat GBT explanation of it and it was a fantastic explanation.

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.520
 Oh, really?

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.520
 That's such a good idea.

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.520
 I don't even have to ask you.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.520
 I can just chat GBT it.

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.520
 Okay.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.520
 Oh, there it is.

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:31.600
 So, I wasn't the only one that had the problem, so you all understand.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.760
 Oh, wow.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.400
 Oh, that's so good.

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.400
 Is that first sentence?

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:36.400
 That's what I struggled with.

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.120
 What I messed up was the second part of the tweet was an example of the first thing.

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.400
 It wasn't like the first thing again.

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.040
 So yeah, right, right.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:50.800
 Going back to why I post his original thing, I'm just getting increasingly tired of this

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:56.480
 expectation of corporate speak and we pretend like for some reason we all want that.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:03.080
 It's like whenever some controversy happens, you expect the CEO to say all this weird corporate

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.240
 approved stuff.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:10.720
 When they don't, you see a bunch of reaction of people saying, "Oh, this is why I see you."

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:16.760
 Yeah, that's why people for some reason and it's completely arbitrary are like, "This

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.760
 is this type of talking we expect."

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.760
 Yeah.

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.840
 And when it's not that, we're going to be like, "Oh, yeah.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.600
 You should run it by your PR team or whatever."

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.040
 But the thing we expect, nobody actually likes.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.880
 Like nobody actually likes that type of talk.

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.880
 Yeah.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:30.880
 Nobody actually likes LinkedIn.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:31.880
 I mean, really.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:32.880
 Exactly.

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:33.880
 Everyone's just pretending.

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.720
 It's like an entire social network where everyone's just pretending to like what they're

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.800
 doing on there because they want to make enough money to support their family or whatever.

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.800
 Yes, exactly.

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:47.200
 And that's actually the perfect example of the example I gave, which is people avoid saying

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:53.920
 certain things because it's perceived as like they self-perceive it as unflattering, right?

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.240
 If someone is like, "I love money.

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.600
 Like I fucking love money.

00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.600
 I want so much money."

00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.600
 You said it all the time.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:00.600
 Yeah.

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.920
 So many people have trouble saying that, even when it's true.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:03.920
 It's a good point.

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.400
 No, I've never heard anyone else say it.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:09.000
 Like when you say it the first time I heard it, I think it was kind of like, "You're not

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.480
 supposed to say that, Dad."

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.480
 Yeah.

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:15.200
 But the thing is it's largely true for a lot of people.

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.520
 A lot of people do love it.

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.520
 They still think about it.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:22.800
 So when they're avoiding saying it, it's kind of like this weird lie of it's all self-inflicted

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.680
 though, because I know I love money.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.880
 If I see that somebody else loves money, I'm not judging them because I know them the

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.880
 same way.

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:30.880
 So it's all self-inflicted.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:38.560
 So there's even random things that are technically unflattering that we don't want to admit.

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:43.760
 The sports team thing I compared it to is like, imagine a sports team that is in the

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:52.640
 finals and they're like, "We just want everyone to win."

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.560
 And when you do this, talking about how we're not competing with other people, what is the

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:57.560
 phrase people use?

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:58.560
 There's a phrase...

00:54:58.560 --> 00:54:59.560
 Zero-sum?

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:03.080
 Yeah, it's not a zero-sum game.

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.000
 That's thrown around all the time.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.360
 We can all succeed or we can all...

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.660
 In net, that's true.

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.440
 In net, humanity is not a zero-sum game.

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:13.440
 We grow the kind of growth.

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.800
 But startups, in general, are.

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:16.800
 Yeah.

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.400
 In the micro, there's connecting ideas.

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:22.560
 There's conflicting visions of the future, and sometimes only one of those can be true.

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:29.040
 And everyone that's worked at a company, like really think back how much time have you spent

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:33.360
 shit talking to your competitors and like, we're all competitive.

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:37.360
 We want to crush our opponents and it's okay to say that because that's just how the world

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.360
 works.

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.160
 My competitors probably want to crush me.

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.800
 I want to crush them.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.800
 Nothing wrong with this.

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.760
 It's totally nothing wrong with admitting that we're competitive.

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:48.800
 Like a sports team has no problem admitting this, but for some reason in business, it's

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.800
 like...

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.800
 We're just trying to make things better for everyone.

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:53.800
 It's just like...

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:54.800
 Yeah.

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:55.800
 Is this...

00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.800
 What else will this other thing?

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:03.200
 Is it kind of like the Netflix way they treat employees, their approach to like...

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:08.960
 I feel like they kind of have the same spirit of like cutting out all the nonsense and

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.040
 just being direct.

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:13.760
 And like, if you suck, we're going to fire you and it's not personal.

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:14.760
 You know what I'm talking about?

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:15.800
 You've read all the Netflix stuff, right?

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:18.160
 I haven't too much, but I have heard that they run.

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.160
 I think the sports thing is...

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.280
 Yeah, it's very much like the sports team out with our company as well.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.280
 Yeah.

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.280
 Because like a sports team will just cut a guy.

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:28.680
 Like you're out of the team and that's just business.

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.680
 And it's understood.

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.680
 Yeah.

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:35.080
 But simultaneously, like there's nothing more intense than the bond of a team when they

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.080
 work together.

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:39.720
 Like a sports team when they're like, you know, on the court, whatever, working together.

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:40.720
 So it's like...

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:47.260
 So you're saying people at Netflix probably have that, like they get that lift because

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:52.720
 of that straightforward relationship with their employer, that their team probably feels

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.600
 more of a bond because of it.

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.640
 Like they've all gone through hard things together in that sense.

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:04.520
 I think intensity creates like a lot of negative feelings, but also like the most positive

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.520
 feelings you can have.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:10.080
 And I think there's a weird like neutral thing of...

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.080
 It's all fake.

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:15.320
 It's like a fake thing that one isn't actually good and two, like it's fake.

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.000
 So yeah.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.640
 Is there a way to get rid of it?

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:22.880
 Like, is there a way for society to evolve out of all of that?

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:27.680
 Like will LinkedIn cease to exist someday because people got tired of all that inauthenticity?

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:28.680
 Yeah.

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.680
 I think it's an arms race.

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:35.920
 And that's why I kind of wrote that thread because the things I point out in there are

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.040
 somewhat subtle, right?

00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:43.120
 And they're like little manipulations, little like tricks that come up a lot.

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.340
 And I don't blame people for like falling for it.

00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:48.400
 Like they're pretty effective.

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.760
 And I think people are getting better and better and better at utilizing those people

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.360
 that like kind of opted into that stuff.

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:58.160
 So yeah, I'm just going to write this and collect this here and I'm hoping it has some

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:02.560
 amount of impact on people so they can kind of recognize this when it happens.

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:03.560
 Like to me, it's...

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.640
 The stuff is so obvious, but I see people falling for it all the time.

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:07.640
 Yeah.

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.480
 I hadn't even noticed that you'd written more of them.

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.040
 And now I kind of want to read them all, but I'm probably not going to understand any

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.040
 of them.

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:17.880
 So maybe I'll use GPT, I'll just create a DAX GPT.

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:22.800
 Oh, you know this, the word reasonable comes up in a lot of these because that's like another

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.000
 trick.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:30.440
 People are trained to act surface level like extremely reasonable, no matter the situation

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.800
 because it makes the other person always look like.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.800
 And reasonable.

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.280
 They're like exaggerating or in the wrong.

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:41.600
 A lot of like training around how you do, how you like diffuse angry customers and stuff

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:46.120
 is all around like this, this angle and just everywhere, like whenever there's any kind

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:51.280
 of conflict, like the more reasonable person always kind of seems right and like they're

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:55.640
 able to like shift the conversation and avoid talking about certain things that they're

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:56.640
 actually in the wrong for.

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.000
 I totally do this.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.600
 I am such a jerk.

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.840
 I do it with people close to me.

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:02.840
 I do.

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:07.560
 I think I've even had the thought in my brain like I'm just being so reasonable here.

00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:08.560
 There's nothing they can do.

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.560
 Yeah.

00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:10.560
 It's very effective.

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:11.560
 It really is.

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:12.560
 It's very effective.

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:13.560
 Oh man.

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:17.520
 I didn't even realize it's such a dark thing to like realize that I'm doing those things

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.200
 and I'm not even thinking about it.

00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.680
 I mean, why do you think I know how to make this list?

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:23.160
 It's like we all do this.

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.160
 Yeah.

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.160
 We all do it.

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:26.160
 Yeah.

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:29.880
 You're just actually acknowledging it and thinking about it which in itself is a manipulation.

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:30.880
 Yeah.

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:31.880
 You're a psychopath.

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:36.680
 You're the most psychopath of all of us because you do it and you know you're doing

00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:37.680
 it.

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:38.680
 Okay.

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:42.880
 So what I thought for me was we wrote that CDK article and we're talking about moving

00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:43.880
 to Pulumi.

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:47.840
 We had a few people ask us like, oh, what's going to happen if Pulumi changes their license

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:52.320
 like the way Terraform did like, like what is like already where like, you know, people

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:56.480
 were wondering about that and kind of like not directly, but it's a situation where you

00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.520
 can look at that and you can look at the situation as, oh, they think we did something

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:04.600
 wrong and they think we didn't consider this thing.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:09.280
 So it's weird, my initial instinct was to like do this weird corporate thing where I

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:13.840
 like kind of massage it and avoid it, but it was like, that's, that's so, that's really

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.840
 not me.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.000
 I generally don't do stuff like that.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.560
 And I was like, it's crazy that this is seeping into my, my head as well.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:25.360
 And it replied to them being like, oh yeah, if they changed this stuff, we're 100% screwed.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.640
 Like there's no, there's no like, there's no way to like spin this like this.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.560
 It's give a very direct answer.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.480
 And the person replied, oh, thank you.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:37.480
 Like I love how direct you were about this, but this is what people want, right?

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.480
 Yeah.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.240
 At the end of the day, it's like, we all know we don't prefer, or we don't desire this

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.120
 fakeness that we're all putting up.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:50.320
 And so when we see like, when I see the things you say on Twitter, it is very refreshing.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.040
 It's refreshing to see like honesty is authenticity.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.600
 The word, have I used that too many times in this episode?

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.600
 Can I say it again?

01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.600
 Yeah.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.800
 And I think it feels more like a short term, long term thing.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.120
 I think I tend to look at everything in that way.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:09.800
 I think you're afraid of like, so here's a very classy example, right?

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:15.040
 So I'm only ask, especially if you're a startup, they'll ask, hey, you guys are a startup.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.680
 Like, how do we know your product is going to be around a couple of years?

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.320
 Like it is all sustainable, whatever.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:24.600
 And of course, like you get some like corporate generic answer of like, you know, we're working

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:30.520
 to do things in a way and like, because what they're afraid of is in that moment, someone's

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.480
 going to hear that and choose not to try your product, they're afraid of that short term

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:34.480
 problem.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.480
 Yeah.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.960
 In those situations, what I say is, yeah, we're a startup.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.600
 We don't even know if we deserve to exist.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.860
 And we might be gone a year from now, it's like 100% true.

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:46.760
 Because that short term thing of some, whether someone's going to try your product or not,

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:51.440
 like they're going to, it doesn't matter in the end, like it, if your product is good,

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.880
 like you'll conquer that.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.880
 But that fear of that immediate thing, if you think like, I don't want anyone to think

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:02.600
 anything negative, is bad, in the long term, we establish a lot of good credibility and

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.240
 people trust us because we aren't doing these other things.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.240
 So yeah.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.240
 Yeah.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.240
 Yeah.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.240
 It's so hard for me.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:15.720
 I am like, from a social relational standpoint, I'm very like conflict avoidance, whatever that

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.920
 personality trait is.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:23.680
 I just, I really am always thinking about the very near term when it comes to social interactions.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.880
 So it's very hard for me not to just do the thing that makes everybody feel good for a

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:31.400
 bit, or maybe it doesn't, maybe they're not feeling good about it, but I feel good that

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.960
 they don't feel bad.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:33.960
 Yeah.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.360
 So I do a lot of this.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:40.040
 I mean, it's, it's like I said, I was doing it literally yesterday.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.000
 I felt I was in my instinct to go and do that.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.320
 So it's, it's very hard not to have that be your default.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.320
 Yeah.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.320
 Because it's how everyone interacts.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.480
 And it's like so fake sometimes.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:56.640
 And I do, if I ever think about this stuff, I'm sure I've said it on this podcast, that

01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.800
 I start spiraling into this, like it all needs to fall and just crumble.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.440
 It's society is built on a web of lies.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.440
 It's all terrible.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.440
 Yeah.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.880
 And it's always LinkedIn for me.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:07.880
 I was just imagining.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.880
 Yes.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.320
 It's a great example.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.320
 Yeah.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.880
 I think someone, after who it was, maybe it was Warren.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:19.360
 He replied with like, he basically replied with a message that was doing the opposite of

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.520
 everything I said in that thread.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.840
 And the reactions were like, get this on LinkedIn.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:24.840
 Yeah.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.080
 It's the vibes.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.640
 That's some clever.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.360
 I just found it.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.280
 It's clever.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:34.280
 It's like Chachi BT is like, that's what it is.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:42.080
 Chachi BT is in essence, when you ask it anything about some hard part of the world, like something

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.480
 softer and nuanced, like it, it replies in, in this exact style.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.080
 We got to stop like valuing that.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.080
 Yeah.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.620
 I, I no longer value it.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:53.620
 I'll forget.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:54.620
 I'll forget like tomorrow.

01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:56.080
 Do you forget a lot of stuff?

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.000
 How's your memory do you still early 30s?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.360
 I don't see myself as someone with a great memory for most things, but I have like an

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:10.200
 inhuman memory for like random useless shit, which I think is maybe like very common.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.360
 Is that part of our job?

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.240
 Is it, or is it just everybody?

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:18.520
 No, I have like stupid and human, I've talked about before, I have like this crazy gift for

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.720
 remembering every movie, every actor, like what they were in, like who they connected

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:25.280
 with their names, like their brothers that way.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.280
 Yeah.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.280
 Yeah.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.920
 It's just like, I can recall just like such specific stuff, but you know, I forget more

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.240
 important things all the time.

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.240
 Yeah.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:40.760
 I, I feel like I've probably said this is like so meta right now because we can't remember

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.760
 that we said this already.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:42.760
 Yeah.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.440
 I'm about to say something that I'm just sure I've said on this show and we've talked about

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.960
 and you've probably given me some comforting message, but like in case you've really concerned

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:54.280
 about my memory, like to the point that she wants, like she's looking up like how early

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.760
 can you develop dementia or whatever.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.800
 There's just like so many things in our life that she has to tell me three and four and

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.120
 five times in like, you know, a five, six week span.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.440
 And I don't know if it's because I'm just not storing it.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.720
 What I tell her, I genuinely believe I hear something.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.720
 I know it's something that she's got covered and I just don't store it.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:21.080
 Like it just bounces off my head and I nod and I smile, but like, I'm using that spousal

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.080
 memory.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.720
 Like she is half of my brain.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.800
 And if it's a thing that's not a thing I need to consider like day to day, I'm just

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.800
 not going to store it.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.000
 I feel like she stores everything.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
 Yeah.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.480
 And I am very selective with what stays in my brain and I, I blame it on work.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.800
 I just say like, I have this whole other world.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.920
 I have to think about things and remember things and use them day to day and be creative and

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.480
 do the stuff and I feel like there's not room in my brain for all of it.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:48.120
 It's that meme that like pushing the thing in the head.

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:53.840
 There's stuff in there that I just can't do away with or I'll be ineffective, I think.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.040
 Or it could just be developing an adventure.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.040
 I don't, I don't know.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.040
 I honestly don't know.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.120
 My explanation for this is I think it's like a classic husband wife thing.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:06.280
 Like you see this, everything describes exact same way with me and Liz.

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.800
 And we just see stuff on like Instagram all the time where people make jokes about this

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.160
 exact dynamic.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.720
 I can't remember anything and Liz always remembers stuff that she has no business remembering

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.080
 because it's like my, my thing.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.080
 Yeah.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.400
 So I feel like there's just some, something there.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.880
 There's like some man, woman thing.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.880
 Okay.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.240
 So that's like a marital, like just a dynamic maybe between.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.240
 Yeah.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.560
 And I wonder for people that are like, like two men that are married, are they just like

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:37.040
 just lost all the time because I super rely on Liz to like remember all this stuff and

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.040
 then.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.040
 Yeah.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040
 Yeah.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.400
 They just like, are they just so like on it?

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.400
 Yeah.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.400
 Yeah.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.960
 Is it more of a role thing or more of like a physical, genetic thing to me it feels like

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:51.280
 it feels so core in me doesn't feel like a role thing.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.280
 Yeah.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.280
 That's what I like.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.680
 She gets upset sometimes over things that I should have remembered.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:58.680
 She feels like it was an important conversation and I feel like there's literally nothing

01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.680
 I can do.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.680
 I don't know.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.600
 Like I can't do more pushups and suddenly just remember those things.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:07.080
 They are not stored in my brain and there's some reason it's not that I don't value what

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.080
 she said.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.080
 Like lots of things.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.600
 I mean, I do remember I need to do this at this time today because it's important or

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:17.400
 you know, like it's not like I'm completely incapable of hearing and retaining something

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.400
 she says.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:23.520
 But anyway, yeah, there's another thing that that just reminded me of that I feel like men

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.320
 are generally in a marital relationship bad at and that's finding things.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.480
 Are you terrible at finding things?

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:33.360
 Oh, that this is a subcategory of this is kind of exactly what I'm talking about.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.280
 Like I'll have something very specific to me.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:40.480
 Like some like document or something that I got in the mail and I can't remember where

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.200
 I put it and Liz will always be like, oh, yeah, I saw it over here.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:48.760
 I'm like, what the, how do you remember this or it'll be like, it's not that I needed to

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.920
 remember what it was, but she'll tell me where it is.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.800
 She'll say like, Oh, it's on the counter and the pantry, whatever.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:54.800
 And you're going to look for it.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.320
 And I go look for it and I'll be like, it's not there.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.320
 I don't know what to tell you.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.320
 And she'll walk right in and grab it.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:03.240
 And it's, she says I'm looking instead of searching, like, yeah, like I don't move stuff

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.240
 around.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.800
 It's kind of like walk in the room, stare at the wall.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:11.440
 And I think exact same thing, again, there's like a million TikToks and stuff about this

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.440
 dinner.

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.440
 Yeah.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.440
 She's shown me the TikToks.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.440
 The one where like it like the milk materializes out of the refrigerator.

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.440
 You don't see it.

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.440
 And then when she goes to grab it, just like up here, it's like what it feels like.

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:24.240
 I'm convinced we're just thinking about other stuff when we think we're looking.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.120
 Is that what we're doing when they're talking to us too?

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.120
 I don't know.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.120
 Not me.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.120
 Is that why I don't know.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.120
 It's not me either.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.120
 Are you just saying that though?

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.120
 Is that fake?

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.120
 No, it's not fake.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120
 I'm a good listener.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.120
 I'm a good listener.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.320
 Do our wives listen to our podcast?

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:37.320
 Because now-

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:38.320
 Sometimes.

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:39.320
 It'll be extra fodder.

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.320
 Sometimes.

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.320
 Oh, no.

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:42.320
 You know what I think about?

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.960
 Do you- You know when you're driving, you know in the moment you must be paying attention

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:49.280
 to stuff because you're not like crashing into cars and stuff.

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.960
 But then if you like try to rewind two minutes ago, like while you're driving, like, okay,

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.680
 what do I have any memories of two minutes ago?

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.320
 You have zero memories of two minutes ago.

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:00.120
 There's some autopilot going on for sure when you're driving.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.120
 Yeah.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.080
 I think there's something like that going on with just other parts of our life.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.080
 Okay.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.800
 I feel a little better knowing that it's universal.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.660
 I knew the finding things was universal.

01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:12.680
 I've seen the TikToks, but the memory thing, I don't know, I was getting a little concerned

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:13.680
 for my health.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:14.680
 Yeah.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.080
 I had something else I was just thinking about.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.840
 No, I lost it because you know that I never-

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.840
 Okay.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.840
 Yep.

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.840
 That's funny.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:26.840
 I think we're good here.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.840
 I think we've recorded for long enough.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:29.840
 I've got to eat.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:30.840
 I haven't eaten today.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:31.840
 Me neither.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.160
 We were recording and we're just underfed.

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.120
 I had five gummy bears.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.680
 You've had five gummy bears today.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.680
 That's all you ate.

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.680
 That was my, that's what I've eaten so far.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.080
 They're the creatine ones, but yeah.

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.080
 Oh, creatine.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.360
 I was like, why would you only eat five?

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.160
 Like, I've never like sat down with a breed like that and then like, I'm just going to

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.080
 eat five of them because I have self-restraint.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.040
 Imagine being someone that could do that.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.480
 That would be amazing.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:58.080
 I feel like, yeah, people who meditate, I bet Jay could do it.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.120
 People who are like in tune with their inner self or something.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:07.520
 I, I just traveled yesterday, back from a work trip and all I ate yesterday came from

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.520
 an airport.

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.520
 I was in two airports.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.520
 I had a connection.

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.040
 And the only thing that went in my body yesterday was from an airport.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.040
 So it was terrible.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.040
 I felt awful.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.640
 I hardly could sleep last night from how gross I felt.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.640
 Traveling is so hard.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.360
 Imagine people traveling on like boats and carriages and stuff.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.360
 What the hell were they doing?

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.360
 Oh, man.

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:26.360
 Well, I wasn't even thinking that.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:30.120
 I was just thinking, imagine the people, like I feel like the generation before us, probably

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.680
 less so now, but there was like a generation where it was like a badge of honor if you

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:36.640
 just like lived out of a suitcase and like traveled for work all day.

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.640
 Can you imagine?

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:41.640
 That's still like an ideal people have, like I have some friends that live that way for

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.640
 a very long time.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.280
 They got their like million miles, status thing, medallion, whatever.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.440
 Yeah, like all my friends are like were like consultants out of, you know that whole thing?

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:55.280
 Like you graduate school, you do a consulting firm and you're literally like a Kinsey or

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.280
 Accenture or something.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:02.000
 Like I don't know, it's like Sunday night you fly out to a client and then you fly back

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.840
 on Friday and that's what they did for years.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.520
 This is what I mean when I, the fake thing, I just feel like there's so much stuff that's

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.760
 so fake, like business travel, nobody needs to travel for business.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:15.760
 Now I'm not saying what I just did, like that was fun.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.000
 It was like the whole point of it is like our team just get together because we only work

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.400
 online together and it's like nice to get together and do fun stuff together.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.400
 That's fine.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:28.060
 Business travel where it's like I'm sending a consultant to your office.

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:30.800
 That's just so pointless to me.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.960
 Am I just discounting like a whole industry and I don't know what I'm talking about probably.

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:34.960
 It's a little bit of both.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:35.960
 Yeah.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:41.000
 It's like, I think, I mean, I think that those consulting firms are like, so such bullshit.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
 It's a joke.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.840
 It's like, yeah, if an entire industry could be linked in.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.840
 That's what it is.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.840
 Yes.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.960
 And the thing about what I just described, who do they send to these places?

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.440
 Someone that just graduated college.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:58.880
 Why are you paying $300 an hour for someone that literally just graduated college that

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.280
 knows literally nothing?

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.280
 Yeah.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:04.440
 Very little life experiences, let alone professional experiences.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:05.440
 Yeah.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.240
 It's just like, I think it's all just like a liability shifting thing.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.160
 There's like some inherent value in having work done by external parties.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.280
 Oh, that's so slimy and gross.

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.880
 Like some executive that just wants to stay there longer.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.480
 So he just can point fingers at consultants.

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.480
 It's just all so dumb.

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.480
 Yeah.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.160
 And this is the spiraling just the more I think about it.

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.800
 I'm like, none of us should have jobs.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.800
 This is all pointless.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:32.440
 But not what we do, but we do know everything else is pointless.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:37.240
 I think that's a good note to end on.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.240
 Okay.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.240
 I had this urge.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:42.760
 I don't know why I have this urge like meta talk about the podcast for a second.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.760
 I don't know.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:47.000
 Should we should we do that after we work like should we do that now?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.440
 Like while I don't mean like, no, I don't, I just mean like, I want to say something.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.200
 Like, like and subscribe or something.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.200
 I don't know.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.200
 What are you saying at the end of a while?

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.200
 We never like do the podcast.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.200
 Thank you.

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.200
 No, don't do that.

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.200
 Don't do that.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.200
 People even listen to this.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.200
 That's a great question.

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.200
 I think it's in our analytics.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.800
 I think it says, I think most spotify, I think you listen to the podcast.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.800
 Is this potify?

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.320
 That's, I'm so glad you said that.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.440
 Uh, I actually listened to our podcast yesterday on the plane.

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:11.440
 I was like, you know what?

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.440
 I haven't listened to any of our episodes for months.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:16.400
 I need to hear what we sound like on a podcast and listen to it.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.680
 I'm one of our listeners.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.680
 No big deal.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:25.760
 I got to subtract that from our analytics and my mom, she's probably like listening on

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.760
 repeat.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:27.760
 I listen on spotify.

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:28.760
 Yeah.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.760
 Okay.

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.760
 I'm not a podcast person.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:31.760
 I think they're stupid.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:32.760
 It's just kidding.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.760
 It's so funny.

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.880
 It's so funny that you would be on a podcast and not be a podcast person.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:40.920
 I don't do any of this stuff that I do, you know, I feel like you don't do any of the

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:41.920
 stuff that you do.

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:42.920
 You know what I mean?

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:43.920
 That's insightful.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:44.920
 Could you tweet that for me?

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.920
 That's a good one.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.920
 That's a nice tweet.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:47.920
 If I've ever seen one.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:51.800
 No, I know what you mean, like making YouTube, you don't watch YouTube.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:52.800
 I get it.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:53.800
 Yeah.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.320
 You don't watch Twitch, but you're streaming on Twitch right now.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.320
 Right.

01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.440
 And like when I'm like tutorial stuff, like I don't really consume that.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.440
 I do read tweets.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:02.920
 I guess I post tweets and I read them.

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:03.920
 That's a little bit honest.

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:06.800
 Do you see my react tweet yesterday?

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:07.800
 No.

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.200
 I know you're not going to get it.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.200
 I'm probably not going to get it at all.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.200
 Hang on.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.200
 I'm going to read it.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.200
 I'll see if I get it.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.200
 You're not going to get it.

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.440
 Check that one, I guess.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.400
 See, I found you another way to implement our lap.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.400
 Nope.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.400
 Nope.

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:23.400
 Get this.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.400
 I missed the old react.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.400
 Oh, okay.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.400
 Got it.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.400
 Got it.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.400
 Got it.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.400
 Got it.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.400
 I missed the old react.

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.360
 Straight from Facebook react component did mount react with this dot state dot count react.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:35.040
 I mean, this is bringing back memories, but I feel like this is like a song reference

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.040
 or something.

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.040
 Yeah.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.040
 Yeah.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.040
 It is.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.040
 Okay.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.040
 Okay.

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.040
 I hate the new react triangle crew.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:46.320
 Uh, be needing use react service, I'd use react.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.320
 It rhymes too.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.320
 Yeah.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.320
 That's right.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.320
 It's the word react.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.320
 No, it literally.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.480
 It's also the word before that, like you cruise crew.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.480
 Look at you.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:15:02.680
 Uh, I missed the sweet react to boot up from V. I gotta say at that time, I'd like to tweet

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:03.680
 react.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:04.680
 This is good.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.720
 I'm not going to read the whole thing because I feel like this is getting less entertaining

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:09.480
 by the second, but what is it?

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.480
 What's the song?

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.480
 Okay.

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:15.800
 The song he wrote about himself, like I missed the old Kanye, but he like performs it or

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:20.880
 like a he sings it and it's really interesting because it's him getting in the minds of fans

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:26.080
 that are like, I miss old Kanye, like the new Kanye is weird, uh, acknowledging their

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.200
 point of view, but then like having this nice sentiment of like, it's okay.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.200
 Like things evolve.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.200
 We missed the old one.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.200
 We have nostalgia, but it's like a really nice sentiment.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.200
 Uh, yeah.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.640
 So I posted that and a lot of people understood what the reference was and that was thought

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.640
 it was funny.

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:46.280
 Of course, of course, there is people out there that are like, like, you need to evolve

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.560
 and like get with a new react, like just move on.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.560
 Like that stops.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:54.800
 You need to like stick with the old thing or move to new thing or, you know, die.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:59.120
 It's like, uh, this is you're so lame.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:02.520
 This is the lamest response in the universe.

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.960
 Like there's nothing way more than this, but you miss the point.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:06.960
 You missed it.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:07.960
 You missed the reference.

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.800
 Uh, you also miss the nicer sentiment underneath.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.800
 Yeah.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:15.920
 And you like tried to be smart about it, but you tried to read all the replies.

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:18.680
 You just took up another 20 of my minutes because I'm going to go back.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:22.840
 I just saw this is the best tax tweet ever from Allison.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.840
 It's true.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.480
 This is probably the most effort you've ever, is this the most effort you've ever put into

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:28.480
 a tweet?

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.480
 It was up there.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.480
 I guess you've written some long ones.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.040
 You've written some big insightful posts.

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:35.720
 So that's a, it's a high bar, but what is this, this book icon?

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:36.720
 What is this to?

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:37.720
 What?

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:38.760
 Did that just do?

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.960
 No, not the bookmark one.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.400
 I know that one.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:45.640
 There's like a, an open book and I clicked on it and it changed.

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:46.800
 Is this like a print view?

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.800
 What is this?

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:52.840
 If I want to print a tweet, it like changed the page for like kind of a modal print my

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.640
 tweet immortalize it.

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:58.160
 I don't know what this is.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.160
 It's like a reader view.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.160
 I don't know.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.160
 Anyway.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160
 Do you not have to pee?

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.160
 I don't have to pee.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.160
 What the hell?

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.080
 I don't have to pee.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.080
 Why don't I have to pee?

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.080
 I've drank a lot.

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.080
 You already peed yourself.

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.080
 Stop it.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.080
 You just haven't realized.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.440
 I got a bottle.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.440
 That mela can you saw earlier?

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.440
 Yeah.

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.280
 Is that the, the water ball you got?

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.280
 The pink one.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.280
 Oh, the mela.

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:21.280
 Okay.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.280
 Sorry.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.280
 I heard something.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.520
 You thought I was, you thought I was, I recycled it or something?

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.520
 No.

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520
 I've been using it.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.520
 This is a dumb joke.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.520
 I need to stop.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.720
 Why don't I have to pee?

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.720
 That's really weird.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:32.720
 Anyway.

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.720
 I don't know how to end our podcast ever.

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.720
 We're 77 episodes.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:35.720
 It's always.

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.720
 I have to pee.

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.640
 I feel like, yeah, if I don't have to pee, I feel like we're just going to go for two

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:39.640
 hours.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.640
 What do we do?

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.640
 Get the fuck out of here.

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.640
 Oh, that's a new ending.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.640
 That's a good one.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.640
 Okay.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.640
 Sorry, mom.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.640
 I'm tired of you.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.640
 Get out of here.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:48.640
 Okay.

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:49.640
 I'm going to hit the end button.

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.640
 Okay.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.640
 Bye bye.

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.640
 Just without even saying it.

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.640
 I'm not even going to say it.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.640
 Nope.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:55.640
 Don't do it.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:56.640
 Nope.

01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:06.840
 I'm going to hit the end button.
