WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
 -How exactly are we using our hunting skills?

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.240
 -I mostly just kill people on Twitter.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.120
 I mean, that's me hunting.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.400
 -It's okay. So I had nothing to talk about.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.200
 I forgot we had a podcast, forgot it was Tuesday.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.600
 I have COVID, by the way. It's not a cold.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.520
 Then I just saw something right before we got on,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.200
 and I'm so excited about it.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.000
 -I get really excited about that stuff.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.040
 It's called Rewind. Have you seen this on Twitter?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.160
 -Oh, yeah, Rewind. I mean--

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.000
 -Oh, you go way back. -Yeah.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.240
 -You and Rewind. -We should definitely talk about it.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.160
 Which part did you see because the new announcement?

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.080
 -Yeah. -I saw people complaining about the privacy aspect of it.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.360
 Again, I don't care about privacy.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.920
 I've always wanted something to record literally everything I see in here

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.600
 and everything I say to augment my memory.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.960
 Because there's so many times where cases like we've literally talked about this twice.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.560
 Like we've already had this conversation.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.600
 We're having a conversation for the third time.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.080
 And I don't remember a thing.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.760
 And I just wish I could go back and say, "Okay, you know what?

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.440
 You don't have to say it again. Let me just go back and listen to it again."

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.800
 This is really funny.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.360
 I'm going to explain to you why this is extremely, extremely funny.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.880
 -We've had this conversation before? -No, no, no, no, no.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.000
 Okay, so you've probably seen some people pointing this out.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.800
 But you know the show "Black Mirror"?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.880
 -Yes. -Okay.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.360
 The first episode that I ever saw, which like made me think,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.440
 "Wow, this is a really, really good show. It's really, really well done."

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.800
 -Yeah. -It was an episode on--

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.280
 There's a device that people install--

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.360
 I think they install it, like, on back their neck.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.400
 It records every single thing that they experience.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.520
 And then they can replay it.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.640
 And it seems awesome at first.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.960
 -Oh, no. -And then you see how deeply it impacts

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.000
 like every single part of people's lives.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.600
 And it follows this couple that are having some problems.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.960
 But this thing just makes it so every little detail,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.920
 they can't let go of--

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.400
 -They like replay it. -Oh, no.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.200
 They like replay every fight to figure out

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.800
 who was like exactly wrong or who's like, "Oh, no."

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.280
 And forgetting is a big part of your brain dealing with anything dramatic, right?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.440
 Like, people that suffer from long-term traumas

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.640
 because they are not able to forget in the way that you're supposed to.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.840
 Like, your brain thinks something is important that is no longer super important.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.600
 So it's funny because it's literally that seemed--

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.720
 Obviously, in the show, it was like way crazy, like way more futuristic.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.720
 But I thought the show was brilliant because that was my first time--

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.200
 OK, for some experience in this show, but this is a theme for them,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.120
 where they take something that seems awesome.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.640
 And I think they very realistically explore how it's a lot more complicated than it seems.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.240
 But that said, have you seen the existing product?

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.480
 -So then I went to their website,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.520
 because I saw people complaining on Twitter about the privacy thing.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.680
 I saw a recent tweet, this little thing that hangs around your neck,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.080
 solves all my problems, but apparently not.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.920
 And then I went to their website, and it's like, they have this thing

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.880
 that just records your screen, is that the idea, and your audio?

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.720
 So it just records everything that happens to you on your computer, basically.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.320
 -Yeah, they index it by running OCR and storing in really, really small files.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.560
 And then you can query it using LMM stuff, which I think is very, very cool.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.480
 -So you can watch back your screen recording is what the end result of your search queries is, basically?

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.360
 -Yeah, because you can say something like, I know I saw something about this thing,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.320
 but you don't remember exactly where, and it'll pull up the exact.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.000
 -Yeah. -Like video.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.640
 And I think it's like, obviously, like, it's compressed and everything,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.760
 but you usually just need like a pointer, and you can go like, look it up again.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.400
 -This sounds kind of cool. -Yeah, it's like a brilliant integration, right?

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.600
 Because you normally, because I think we've always,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.720
 I think a lot of people have had the thought of like,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.200
 "Oh, I just have like stuff everywhere.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.400
 I wish like, one thing would integrate with everything and like,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.920
 aggregate it and make it queryable."

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.480
 And that just seemed impossible, because how are you going to integrate with everything?

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.000
 But then a brilliant way to do that is just to like, capture the video feed.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.920
 This is still a product I think so much to build.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.760
 I think the browser history is just so underutilized,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.760
 where every piece of information that's useful for me,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.520
 there's like a pointer to it in my browser history, and like,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.480
 browser's just kind of put it as like this on an organized tap.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.320
 And I'm constantly like, I know I saw this thing,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.320
 I know a reference to these materials, but I don't, I can't find it again.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.880
 And it's like, like a five minute process for me to figure it out.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.960
 -That's why we leave so many tabs open, right?

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.720
 It's that fear of like, I won't really find this again if I close this set.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.880
 -I never do that. I like can't stand having a bunch of tabs open.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.360
 -Oh, really? -Yeah, but I know a lot of people do that, yeah.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.720
 -So you're inbox zero, and you close all your tabs.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.880
 I'm inbox infinity, and I'm tabbing infinity.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.640
 -I find that people are the opposite of what they are in the physical world.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.440
 I'm kind of like all over the place in the physical world,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.640
 but I'm extremely organized and neat in the digital world.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.720
 -So I'm kind of tidy in the physical world, I've got a nice little space.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.920
 I mean, the streaming stuff doesn't help all the cameras and lights,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.360
 but aside from that, your theory holds up.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.280
 -So I've described to you my desk right now.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.440
 I have a roll of dog poop bags, I have two socks that I brought,

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.200
 and I like, I forgot I already had socks here, so I put them on my desk.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.840
 I have an empty bottle of coconut water, a cap with just a coconut water cap,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.840
 a half-drank bottle of coconut water, a box of crackers,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.840
 tray of food from yesterday, like a takeout thing from yesterday,

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.480
 filled with orange like tangerine peel.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.080
 -Well, this is so gone, isn't she?

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.080
 Is she so dry? She doesn't come into my office.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.120
 This is why it's like this.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.600
 -Okay.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.400
 -An empty bottle of kombucha and a water bottle.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.840
 -And a cup and a cup.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.960
 -Is that for peeing in?

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.640
 -I don't think there was milk in here, I don't know.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.400
 -Do you drink milk?

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.480
 Do you just drink like milk like a glass of milk?

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.920
 -I love milk, I love milk.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.320
 -Yeah, a lot of people have a problem with drinking milk.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.960
 It seems like a lot of women have a problem with drinking milk.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.800
 -I don't know if that's sexist to say that,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.840
 but all the women in my life are like, "Ew, you drink milk."

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.320
 -I don't know.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.960
 So, did you sign up for this rewind thing?

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.680
 -Oh, no, not yet.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.440
 I literally just saw it right before we got on.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.600
 -Yeah, I think when people talk about privacy,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.120
 they're talking about someone else wearing the device

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.720
 and do not realizing everything or saying's being recorded.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.840
 -I guess here's my problem.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.480
 What's the hang up with?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.720
 Like, if someone could hear you saying something with their ears,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.760
 people just don't like to know they could listen to it back.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.600
 The recording is the part they don't like,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.240
 because I feel like if you say it to them,

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.440
 if it's something that was said.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.720
 -Yeah, but even on this podcast,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.880
 sometimes we're like, "Oh, we got to make sure that this is."

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.440
 -Oh, that's true, hypocrite.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.520
 -Yeah, I guess, okay, so, well, I was going to say,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.200
 well, a podcast is different, but is it?

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.080
 I don't know, maybe not.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.040
 -Okay, the thing is, I get it.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.880
 It doesn't have to be fully rational,

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.360
 but it just maybe feels weird,

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.480
 because when you're talking to someone,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.680
 you're not like really like modulating your thoughts.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.280
 You maybe are like talking a little bit about this,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.000
 because there are some scenarios where you just met someone,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.240
 you're going to be like a little more cautious about what you say.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.960
 You know someone really well, like you change what you're going to say.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.920
 I think whether it's recorded or not would also affect your thought process.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.800
 And if you find out it's recorded and you didn't know that ahead of time,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.520
 that feels like a little intrusive in some ways.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.400
 It's the same as getting on a video call.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.720
 And usually people ask if you're on a sales call and they record them,

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.560
 they usually ask, "Hey, do you mind if I record this call?"

00:07:59.560 --> 00:07:59.960
 -Yeah.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.960
 -Not because they're expecting anyone to be like, "No,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.280
 just so you know that they're doing that."

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.280
 And I'm pretty sure a bunch of states have laws.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.520
 -I was going to ask if there's a legal protection.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.120
 -That's kind of like one party consent or something like that.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.600
 -Yeah.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.840
 -Some states, you just need one person to consent to the recording.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.520
 Other states, you need both parties too.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.280
 So yeah, I don't know how this works in practice.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.640
 I think it's, I love their current product.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.760
 I mean, I don't, I can't use it because I'm on Linux.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.240
 But I think someone should build an open source version of it.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.440
 I think there's a lot of opportunity there.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.000
 I actually looked at it.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.280
 I think someone is doing it, but they're doing it in Python,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.920
 which means like there's 900 steps to install it and it's super slow.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.040
 And then it's going to fill your, "Oh, I messed up with a bunch of dependencies."

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.720
 -Yeah.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.400
 -I love that idea.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.240
 And I think that that's like reasonable.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.480
 Like I'm sure you'll capture video calls that maybe people don't expect.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.600
 But I don't know, it's a little tricky,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.000
 but you can just always tell people that you're recording.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.920
 -Yeah. But you think it's strange that they're going into the physical world with the, the pendant.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.720
 -I think it's cool and I want them to try it.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.040
 I don't think I would get one.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.760
 I think I would find it a little weird if I saw someone wearing one

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.200
 and I was sorry to them, but I like to just kind of want to see.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.800
 Maybe I'm wrong and like ends up being a very universal thing or a very normal thing.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.800
 -I guess I don't ever, I never thought of it.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.280
 It's like everyone would want this.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.400
 I just feel like I have a specifically bad memory.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.240
 I don't know what that's about.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.480
 Maybe I'm just really good at forgetting stuff and that's a feature to your point.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.280
 I don't, I literally can't think of any trauma in my life.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:36.920
 So...

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.120
 -Yeah, exactly.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.760
 Maybe there's something to do that.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.960
 -In this Black Mirror episode, it's funny because it kind of goes both the ways.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.560
 In this Black Mirror episode, like it's a while ago, so I remember exactly,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.360
 but I remember they're like at a party and his wife looks at this other guy.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.080
 Just like looks at like a brief exchange.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.040
 -Yeah.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.960
 -And the guy found it like maybe a little weird.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.520
 In real life, you'd find it a little weird, then you kind of forget about it.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.000
 -Yeah.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.640
 -But he kept replaying it and looking at it.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.840
 And he eventually unraveled that his wife was having an affair or something.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.640
 -Oh geez.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.560
 -So it did technically help him out.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.120
 -It didn't help him.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.280
 -Yeah, but I think it was...

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.120
 -It drove him crazy.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.120
 -I think the thing also caused the relationship to go bad, which caused this whole thing.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.600
 -Yeah.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.440
 -Yeah, especially during fights.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.400
 Like I really don't know if a fight should be recorded.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.360
 -Yeah, that I get.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.560
 There's nothing rational about most fights.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.400
 It's like, you know what I like, go back and try to figure out.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.000
 -Well, you technically said this.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.760
 -Yeah, that's no good.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.800
 Yeah, I honestly wanted it for innocent purposes.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.720
 Just like, so I could remember stuff.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.240
 And even like, memories.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.120
 Just like, we take a lot of photos and videos of the kids.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.840
 But it'd be cool to know that like, every moment was captured.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.760
 We just have to go back and curate it.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.520
 -You guys have the cameras in your house, though, right?

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:52.920
 -We do.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.720
 -It's like a angle.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:11:02.200
 -But no, yeah, there's like a, well, two days ago, we were doing some mulching.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.560
 And like, we decided, but I have a new stance on some of this stuff.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.160
 I used to be like, hardcore, I pay people to do labor.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.040
 I'm not going to like, do stuff that I could just pay someone to do,

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.880
 because my time is valuable or whatever.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.440
 I used to be really hard on that.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:24.120
 And now, like, we've realized we just need stuff to do with the kids.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.040
 Like, we need activities.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.320
 And they actually do really well with like, work.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.800
 Like, when it's like, here's a task, I need you to do this.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.960
 Like, they're super helpful.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.640
 It's better for their little minds.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.840
 Like, they're just not so, they're bouncing off the walls and going crazy.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.600
 Not bored or whatever it is they get.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:46.680
 So, yeah, we used to like mulch the house every year or twice a year.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.200
 And it's like, it's like $1,500 or something to bring in all new mulch and the labor and all that.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.000
 We went to the local hardware store and it was like, 200 bucks to get like,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.120
 four scoops of mulch.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.560
 And now we're just like, spreading it everywhere.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.320
 And they're having a blast.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.800
 But it's, I got to this because the archer is just so cute when he's doing it.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.080
 Like, he's riding around on his bike, kind of like being the message boy.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.320
 Like, we need infinity more loads, dad.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.760
 So he keeps going back and forth between me and Casey.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.680
 Casey's kind of like doing the spreading.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.240
 I'm doing the losing up the wheelchair.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.200
 Yeah, he's the supply chain.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.240
 Yeah, yeah, he's the manager.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.080
 But I had that thought a couple of nights ago as we're doing it.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.320
 Like, I want to watch the video here.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.080
 Because we've got three different cameras picking up this process of him riding back and forth.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.560
 And yelling at us and yeah, I just thought, like, I'm glad we have all these recordings.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.160
 I can actually go back and look at that.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.120
 Yeah, I feel that way too.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.600
 Cause I have a really, I have like no habit with pulling out my phone and like,

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.880
 remembering to pull it out and like take a video or take a picture.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.440
 I'm always like, Oh, I should record that.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.800
 And I remember later.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.040
 Yeah.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.560
 So it would be cool to have something passive though.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.920
 It's me pull it up.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.960
 But in terms of like forgetting information, do you feel like there's a lot of information

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.880
 coming at you in the real world that you're forgetting?

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.200
 Cause I think for me, I feel that same way where I'm like, I forget stuff a lot.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.960
 And I wish I had something helping me with that.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.680
 But most of that is sourced from my computer.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.640
 Like to some of it, that's sourced elsewhere.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.280
 But I think most of the information is on my computer.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.640
 So I guess like, I worry that I don't balance.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:23.240
 I don't balance the work life memory very well.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:29.320
 Like I feel like I do remember a lot of stuff about obscure technologies or just random stuff

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.440
 that I learn on Twitter.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.480
 Yeah.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.400
 And Casey will point out that like, I could tell you the score of like most of my high school

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.680
 football games, like I have weird things in my memory.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.960
 But then like, she'll tell me something that is important to her.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.520
 And like, we're doing this next week on Tuesday and I will completely forget.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.520
 So I do feel like it's that meme of the guy with the brain full of.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.640
 Yeah.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.520
 That's the name.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.360
 I'm like, full of jiu-jitsu stuff.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.960
 Jarvis. Yeah. Exactly. So I'm not fitting all the stuff in there that I should fit in there.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.800
 And it's hard because there's like stuff for work that I do need to hold in that memory.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.240
 And sometimes it feels like there's a lot going on in the professional life.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.360
 And some of the personal stuff is just hard to remember.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.960
 And honestly, it's like, if I don't remember, like we're going to end up going still.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.680
 And I guess my brain just knows I don't really need to store that.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.200
 Casey's going to make sure at three o'clock we go to the thing.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.720
 Is that an awful jerk move and a relationship to be like, you got that, but sure.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.640
 I, okay, I have a question for you.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.520
 So this seems to be an extremely common dynamic.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.920
 And there's like memes and TikToks and everything about it.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.120
 Are you constantly misplacing stuff around the house?

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.520
 And does your wife always know exactly where it is?

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.680
 I don't know that I misplaced stuff around the house a lot.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.640
 You think she moves it around?

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:51.080
 No, I'm pretty, no, I'm just pretty good about like, I know where I leave a thing.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.560
 Yeah.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.280
 But I will say she has to find everything in the house.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:00.280
 She says, I look, she searches, like I look in the fridge and I'm like, we don't have any.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.480
 And she comes in and she moves one thing over and she's like, it's right there.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.440
 Yeah, exactly.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.640
 That's searching for it.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.840
 Yeah, exactly.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.560
 That's the problem.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:12.520
 The feeling I get is like, I look at, there's this classic TikTok where like,

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:18.200
 the husband looks in the fridge and the wife comes over and it like seems to materialize

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.800
 that affair like it was there the whole time. That's the exact feeling I have because

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.440
 I'm like, I look at this a hundred times and I just didn't see it.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:24.840
 Yes.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.280
 And I do wonder if this is this is like so common.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.800
 Like every single couple we know, like describes the exact same thing.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:37.160
 So I do wonder if there's some like, like deep genetic thing going on here.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.440
 Yeah, what is it?

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.160
 I've seen the memes about like men in relationship, not being able to find anything.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.280
 There have been so many times where I come back to Casey across the house.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.440
 I'm like, I looked every, it's not there.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.040
 We don't have that anymore.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.040
 And then she can walk right in the room and grab it.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.960
 And I don't know what that's about.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.320
 Let's say that it's like a hunter gatherer thing where like, if you're going to be a gatherer,

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.440
 you've got to like, keep track of all these things and know where everything is and know

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.760
 where the thing grows and find it and organize it.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.000
 Yeah, how exactly are we decks, me and you using our hunting skills?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.600
 I mostly just kill people on Twitter.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.400
 I think that's, that's my, that's me hunting.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.480
 I just think of like hunters.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.520
 So they have like really good, like reflexes and like seeing stuff moving.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.520
 And I'm just like, I don't know how I'm using that, if that's what I've got.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.400
 I guess they're good at finding patterns and herds of animals.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.480
 Is that, is that real?

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.520
 I don't know.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.320
 The gatherer stuff definitely feels way more practically useful.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.680
 Yeah, today.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.400
 No, for sure.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.760
 That's, that's, that's very, but yeah, I don't get it.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:48.440
 Like I, to me, it, it really feels like, wow, I actually have like an inability.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.440
 It's like, it's like one of the few times in my life where I'm like,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.560
 this is just a, a lacking that I have.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.080
 And I don't know how to make it better.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:00.040
 I feel like almost like, just like so like helpless and competent when it comes to this.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.080
 Like I'm trying.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.600
 I'm trying as hard as I can.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.320
 Yeah.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:03.800
 I don't know.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.640
 I can't try any harder.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.200
 It's weird.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.800
 How's, how's tech?

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.840
 How are things?

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.840
 I'm actually doing a lot of stuff with tech, I guess.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.680
 I'm just not really plugged into the broader community.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.920
 Like I'm missing everything.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.400
 I feel like there's times in your life where you're like,

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.000
 discovering a bunch of things because you don't have anything to really use it on.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.880
 So you're like, learning a bunch of new stuff, experimenting.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.360
 Then you end up like reaping all that where you're like, okay, now I have to actually do something.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.000
 So you are focused and you're just building, you picked your tools and you're building with it.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.360
 I don't really think that much is happening.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.600
 Yeah.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.240
 Do we already talk about the Cloudflare stuff? I can't remember.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:47.160
 Yeah, so they got the LLM stuff and then, was there more stuff in their ship week?

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.120
 There was a lot of stuff.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:48.680
 Yeah.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.440
 LLM was a big thing.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.960
 I still remember the rest, but.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.440
 Are you shifting SST to build on top of Cloudflare?

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.160
 Go ahead.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:01.640
 One of the things that they added was, or they kind of simplified even further,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.640
 the whole CPU billing model, I think that's like crazy revolutionary.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.240
 Where now it's like very truly, you only build for the CPU time that you use,

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:17.880
 you're not build for any network requests or any IO waiting, which I think is insane.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.400
 And I'm looking forward to AWS trying to get there as well.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.920
 Yeah, you think AWS will do there and we'll go there?

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.560
 I don't know.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.760
 I think they have to, right?

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.040
 Because their whole culture is margin destruction.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.680
 So if they don't, they are now officially a different kind of company, I think.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.560
 If they don't like continue to chase, like reducing that down to zero.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.680
 Yeah, I wonder how many, like how much of the AWS customer base,

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.320
 because they're so focused on like what customers are asking for.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.800
 I wonder how much of the AWS customer base is aware of Cloudflare offerings?

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.160
 And like, is that driving further innovation in AWS?

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.560
 Because they have to compete with these types of things.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.720
 Like are their customers being like, hey, why does Lambda charge me when I make a network request?

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.480
 Cloudflare doesn't.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.400
 This is not in the category of customer stuff.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.480
 Because a customer will never like bring it up in the sophisticated way.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.080
 I think it falls into the overall culture of like they just have to be the cheapest.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.360
 And if someone else is, they have to be the one ruining other people's margins.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.560
 It can't be the other way around.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.240
 That's like their whole business.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.680
 But yeah, I don't know.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.120
 Like what they're current, like knowing how it's built in the back end.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.600
 I actually don't know if they can do this given their current scope.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.320
 Because Cloudflare scope is just JavaScript functions.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:40.040
 They've built a very JavaScript specific platform where they can very easily schedule

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.320
 all their work while your JavaScript code is waiting on IO.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.400
 But yeah, I don't know if AWS is set up in the same way.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.440
 I don't think a lot of people are using Cloudflare still.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.960
 I think it's an extremely interesting platform that can do a lot.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.280
 And you can probably build very high quality things.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.720
 But I don't think really anyone is doing that yet.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:07.960
 So at some point, I think I will build something on Cloudflare, like fully on Cloudflare.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:14.680
 And we'll probably bring that probably result to me building a bunch of SD tooling to do that well.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.160
 And maybe that can help like bring it to more people.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.360
 But yeah, right now it's just, it's very like definitely niche.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:20.840
 Yeah.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.040
 Yeah, I saw I asked that question because I saw you tweet something about

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.360
 Cloudflare announced the stuff and it makes you question your whole career or something.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.200
 Yeah, it's like they're launch weeks are the ones where I'm like kind of nervous,

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.760
 where I'm like, okay, they can actually announce stuff that just means I have to

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.160
 think about things extremely differently or shift what I'm doing.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.440
 Yeah, kind of changes the landscape.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.520
 But and then they do.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.360
 And I would say this week they did it just.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.440
 It's weird.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.640
 It's like all of there.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.720
 But like the last mile of it making.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.560
 I've actually making the people's hands. I don't feel like has happened as much.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:02.360
 So that I'm just realizing I've never seen like Cloudflare on like market share statistics.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.880
 Like where is Cloudflare adoption and where is that information?

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.560
 Have you heard anything?

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.240
 No, because this is all new for them, right?

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:14.040
 Like their their angle is they sell this completely different product and now they're trying to

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.960
 expand it into being like a general purpose cloud to build everything out.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.320
 Oh, wait, what did they start with?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.840
 Just networking stuff. So like Firewalls, the DNS, the DDoS protection.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.920
 So that was there.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.880
 That's how they started.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.840
 Now they're moving into the broader compute platform.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.120
 Like they have a bunch of really useful stuff for like enterprise companies.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.280
 Like all the way to zero trust VPN things like just stuff that again,

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.960
 like you're building something new.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.800
 You just like just not something you care about.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.720
 But yeah, it's a good weird strategy.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.800
 Because you would never really have expected this company that builds a firewall.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:55.800
 To like pivot into offering like one of the best like complete cloud platforms that are out there.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.920
 Again, everyone, yeah, right.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.720
 And the market share thing is always like here's AWS and here's GCP and here's Azure.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.200
 Yeah.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.720
 And I don't think GCP and Azure are real threats to Amazon.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.920
 Like they're just kind of the same business and they'll kind of split the pie in some way.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.840
 Whereas Cloudflare has a shot of being like, no, this is like this is like the next generation.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.360
 And if we're successful, then the majority of stuff will be built on us.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.440
 Obviously, like very small chance of actually pulling that off.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.600
 But there is a chance with the approach they're taking.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.400
 Yeah.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.280
 Disclaimer, Dax is an investor in Cloudflare.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:26.600
 Sorry.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:30.280
 Oh, speaking of investor stuff.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.520
 I guess I got to figure out.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.600
 I guess I can talk about this because I can like maybe not mention specifics.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.440
 But I've invested in a few companies.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.040
 I'm aware.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.200
 None of the companies have died yet.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.840
 One of them has given me a return.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.160
 And then last week, the second one.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.280
 Giving you a return.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.240
 Wait, wait, wait.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.080
 What like exited or like you're out of the position.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:53.800
 You got to return.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.600
 No, what's that?

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.800
 I sold to like, I sold to new investors.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.120
 Yeah.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.560
 Because I thought the company was garbage.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.320
 Somehow got new investors.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.440
 I was like, I'm not here.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.160
 Like, see you.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.040
 Oh, I love it.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:06.680
 Okay.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.880
 I like to do over doubled my money, which is not bad.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.680
 Nice.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:15.480
 And there's another company that I consulted for for a little bit and I ended up investing them

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.240
 before I left.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.400
 They actually just weren't really going anywhere.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.520
 They've been around for a while.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.200
 I just had not heard anything from them.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.880
 So I just assumed that yeah, it like wasn't going anywhere.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.920
 But then randomly like a year ago, they raised some like crazy round.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.280
 And if I just let raise were involved in it.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.760
 And I was like, I don't really get what's going on here.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.480
 Is it crypto?

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.840
 No, no, it's not crypto.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.720
 It's in the music space.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:41.160
 Well, it's funny you say that because I heard news last week that it was acquired.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.560
 By Jack Dorsey. Are you serious? Yeah.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.360
 So you're going to get some kind of a check in the mail.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.520
 How's that work when you invest in a company?

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.560
 So he's always just think it's a split of cash.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.720
 So I get like some percent in cash and I get some percent in stock.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:04.600
 So I am now a shareholder in block, which I was like, this is dumb.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.400
 But then I remembered, oh shit, they own Square, which is a real company.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:09.800
 Yeah.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.000
 They own title also, and now they own this.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.440
 Oh, title, the music streaming thing?

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.960
 So I thought it was like, because I know block was like his random crypto thing he was doing,

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.360
 but I didn't realize he rolled in.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.760
 He rolled up Square into it, which is like a real company.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.600
 So these shares are not like, I could like sell them today, probably.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:34.040
 Yeah, so you're like, I mean, you're like, as far as VCs go, or investors.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.680
 Two for two.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.200
 You're doing great.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.520
 Do you own a Patagonia vest?

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.640
 No, I don't.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.680
 I have Patagonia.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.960
 You're going to need to go ahead and get that.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.200
 Let's get the best, the puffy vest in the mail.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:48.840
 Let's get that on the way, because it's the official attire of all investors.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.520
 Man, I just don't want to be an investor at all.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.800
 I think here's the thing.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.720
 I think being an investor is like the dumbest job, and I can't believe people aspire to it.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:04.120
 I see kids coming out of high school or college that they're like, I'm going to be an investor.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.880
 I'm like, this is just a dumb thing.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.560
 People want to be it. I just thought people fell into it.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.360
 The right connections, something.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.920
 And people aspire to it, because VCs are kind of good at the image that they can

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.440
 conjure of themselves is very appealing to a 20-year-old, I think.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.040
 Interesting.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.040
 They're always like, we have the money, and we predict the future.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.120
 Yeah, that's basically their whole thing, is they got to convince people.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.600
 It's kind of like a founder in that they're just constantly raising money.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:40.680
 And using their people skills to convince rich people to put money into their fund.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:46.520
 And then the actual investing part is all just the lottery.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.800
 They're just throwing money at stuff.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.440
 The work, I mean, here's how it works.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:57.320
 It's like in every VC circle, in the VC circle in general, at any given time,

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.920
 there's a bunch of hot investments that everyone agrees is a good bet,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.560
 and there's space for three investors, and everyone is fighting to get those deals.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.160
 Some of the majority of their time is spent convincing founders to pick them and say

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:15.800
 someone else, whereas I think they portray it as like, oh, we saw the future,

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.920
 and we placed a bet on this company, and nobody else thought to bet on that.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.160
 Which happens sometimes because of the true contrarian bet,

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.480
 but most VCs aren't making contrarian bets.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.960
 We're all just trying to get in mind, the consensus deal.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.760
 Yeah, and the reason I know that young people are into this is there's so many like

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:40.040
 Gen Z VC groups and whenever you talk to some of these VC funds,

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.600
 like they send their quote unquote associates, or they try this in their associates.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.360
 You never bother talking to a associate because they're just like

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:53.720
 some random kid that just graduated, always trying to ask you questions about your business,

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.200
 and it's just the dumbest waste of time ever.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:04.600
 It's just so weird to me that people like, you have the option of being a founder or being a VC,

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:11.640
 and I'm just like blown away that it's at all appealing to be a VC, just like,

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.080
 it's like a very dorky job to me.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.960
 It just occurred to me.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.800
 I'm probably going to be a VC someday.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.360
 Oh, man, it's just like going to happen.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.480
 It's going to be in my future at some point, I can just see it.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.120
 A VC, you think you're going to let you think you would join like a VC fund?

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:26.760
 I don't know.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.640
 How's that going to happen?

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.040
 I can be like meeting founders out in the story.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.240
 No, I'll just do everything remote.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.360
 I'll do the zoom thing.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.440
 I don't know why I think this is going to happen.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:44.360
 It just seems like I'm not going to be a professional software developer when I'm 50,

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.960
 and I'm going to have to do something.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.760
 And I'm going to have been in the startup space for like 30 years,

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.000
 and I'm going to end up being some kind of an investor.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.960
 I can just see it now.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.120
 That's okay to retire into being a VC.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.520
 So that's very different than aspiring to make that your primary thing.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.000
 Maybe just being in the Ozarks.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.080
 Maybe that'll eliminate that from my future.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:03.560
 Maybe you're right.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:07.800
 Maybe I just cannot worry about it because I can't do the whole

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:13.320
 just deal flow and then illusion if I'm in the Ozarks.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.880
 Yeah, well, you might not be in Ozarks in 30 years.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.520
 Yes, I will.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.680
 Ozarks are going to be underwater in 30 years.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.080
 Stop it.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.360
 The Ozarks are going to underwater.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.160
 We're in trouble.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.520
 I'm buying a submarine ASAP.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:34.360
 It's funny, though, because that line is always like a thing that's been around forever.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.360
 My old apartment in New York, it's right on the water.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.720
 When I was moving in there, I remember searching.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.360
 And I think I was searching like the building or whatever,

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.200
 and this was around in 2016.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.560
 And I found a forum thread from 2005,

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:54.360
 where people are talking about the building or something or that area.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.400
 And they're like, do not buy real estate here.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.360
 Like, it's all going to be underwater in 10 years.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.440
 The Goldman Sachs is building a giant building across the water.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.280
 It's like crazy wind tunnel.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.360
 It's going to be the worst thing ever.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:13.400
 And I moved there, I guess 10 or 12 years after that post.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.960
 And yeah, it was completely fine.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.360
 The Goldman Sachs tower is there and no crazy wind tunnel or anything.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.320
 The people were so certain that that was completely screwed.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.360
 I know, and I'm not just like, dismiss everything.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.560
 I'm sure like, of course, like stuff is going to happen.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:33.400
 It's just like the confidence and the predictions of like specific timelines

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.160
 are just are funny to look back on.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.240
 Yeah, can we check in on climate change?

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.480
 I feel like I never hear anything anymore about climate change.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.720
 It's just other stuff to talk about because we solved it.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.440
 It's done.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.320
 Did we?

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.440
 No, we almost did with the LK99.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.880
 Oh, almost.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.840
 What a moment.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.280
 That would have solved everything.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.000
 But is there like, is there like progress?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Is it not a thing we should be worried about?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.800
 Are our kids going to have an Earth to live on?

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.360
 I think there's some stuff because there's a,

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.520
 I mean, you saw this stuff in New York, the flooding.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.000
 I did not.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.960
 So New York City, and this is like, I think...

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.480
 I know your apartment's underwater.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.840
 Did it really happen? They were just five years late or early?

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:18.600
 To be fair, the situation in New York is really complicated.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.560
 It's not like, oh, this is because of climate change.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:26.440
 New York has like some of the oldest infrastructure in the country.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.280
 It's so crazy common.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.880
 The problem is so crazy complicated.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:39.080
 Like, so nowadays cities have separate lines for sewage and for like drain water for rain,

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.120
 which makes sense.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.400
 But back in the day, that wasn't the thing.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.840
 There was just one pipe for everything.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.760
 So now in New York, when it rains heavily,

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:51.240
 the sewers get backed up, which means your toilets get backed up.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.440
 And then stuff just starts flooding.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.240
 They do like emergency dumps into the Hudson and all this stuff.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.480
 But it's a really complicated situation because like,

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:06.360
 nothing is more complicated than digging up stuff in New York City and like figuring it.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.280
 One, like people don't even know what's under the ground because the history is like,

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.080
 some of it was publicly built, some of it was privately built,

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:19.000
 some of it's like documented, some of it's not just massive, so much money to do that,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.080
 so much disruption to like tear stuff up and replace it.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:27.160
 It just like, it just seems like an impossible, very, very difficult problem.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.120
 So they have had these crazy floods the past couple of years,

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:36.440
 because like the that whole system is under a lot of shame, like describe crazy flood to me, like

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.280
 streets or underwater.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:44.200
 Yeah, just like, like cars are like driving through like the water.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.240
 So yeah, a little fight is cranky.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.080
 It took away all its toys.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.240
 Oh, no, are they sitting on your desk?

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.360
 You're squeaking too hard.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.200
 There's like just several feet of water that cars are driving through in some places and like,

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:03.320
 just like some of it. After heavy rains, not like a sea water thing, just like.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.800
 Yeah, but the heavy rains are technically climate related, but like obviously like,

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.000
 if the city had normal infrastructure, it would handle it fine.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:11.400
 Yeah.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:11.880
 Yeah.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.560
 So it got like crazy political too.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.560
 People are like posting all is like weird political stuff.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.520
 That's completely unrelated.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.880
 They're like, this is because of the immigrants.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.240
 I just can't with the like politicizing climate stuff.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.800
 Just like with any topic, I just hate it.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:28.520
 Like, I don't have, it doesn't mean I believe something about some political party just because I,

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.680
 I don't know, care about a certain issue.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.200
 Climate change seems like one I can care about because, I don't know,

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:40.360
 have kids and I want to make sure 50 years from now, things aren't just a barren wasteland.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:46.440
 So when it felt like like a year ago, it felt like it was really a pressing topic.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.360
 Maybe it's just because I haven't been as plugged into media sources.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:55.400
 But I don't, I don't remember last time I read anything about like progress.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:55.800
 I don't know.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.680
 Current forecasts.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.360
 Do you know anything?

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.360
 Is this an issue you don't really worry about?

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.240
 We're going to solve it.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.040
 Humans are awesome.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.600
 I'm fairly optimistic about the whole thing as I am with most things.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.640
 But my friend works, he like works in this space.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.920
 He specifically is focused on like, how do we make carbon markets like a viable thing.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.160
 And it's extremely, extremely interesting in two ways.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.400
 So the first is it's crazy complicated.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.960
 It's why I hate seeing like random people talk about this stuff.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.280
 Because it's like so much more complicated than it is.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.840
 The thing he talks about is like, okay, carbon offsets.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.960
 Is that a thing that can work?

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:34.600
 So can you produce carbon somewhere and then buy or like invest in something that reduces

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.560
 carbon somewhere else?

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:40.440
 So you have one side of the argument that's like just kind of like overly ideological.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.360
 We're like, no, people just want that.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.960
 So they can continue to like, you know, use energy and not care.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.640
 So there's a whole faction of people that believe that we need to punish ourselves and

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.480
 there's no other way out of this thing if we don't do that.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:56.360
 But then what he talks about is 100% he believes it can work, but it's extremely

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:01.320
 complicated because it's so hard to track like second, third order effects where like,

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:07.400
 if you plant a tree, does that cause like a farmer somewhere else to like cut a tree because

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.600
 they need more space for land?

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:13.240
 Or like, if you do this one action, does it increase the price of this good,

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:17.080
 which causes like the market to react to then like do stuff to produce more of it?

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:17.560
 Yeah.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.680
 So he works on like figuring out all of those things.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:25.640
 But the thing that's interesting is people focus way too much on like the politics of this.

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.000
 And obviously when it comes to politics, it feels like nothing is happening.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.960
 What's crazy is the private industry and talking to me, he confirms this.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.000
 They're like way ahead of all the politics stuff.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.880
 Like there's like a lot of consensus in just the business world that we do need to decarbonize.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.440
 There's from like a incentive purpose, like this is coming.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.920
 And there's like very unique opportunities to take advantage of it if you're there first.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.600
 So he's working with this company that makes fertilizer in Europe.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:58.120
 And they are investing in a massive solar farm.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.440
 I forgot it's some country in Africa.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.720
 And there's like very few people there.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.280
 It's like hard to live in desert area.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:10.200
 But they're investing a lot in that to like move their operations to produce the fertilizer

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.360
 there because it's way cheaper for them.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:17.640
 To get this crazy market advantage while also like decarbonizing like crazy because

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.320
 fertilizer like takes a lot of carbon to produce.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.640
 But it's never been done before.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.120
 So that there's like a lot to figure out.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:28.280
 But there's just so much movement in the private world because they're just natural

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:33.720
 incentives to if you believe that this is going to be a thing that you have to care about.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.800
 And you're eventually going to be forced to do this anyway.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.520
 The early movers are going to have crazy advantages where like if you're too late

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.120
 to decarbonize some regulation comes out, like you're not going to be able to catch

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.040
 the period that we're starting the process, right?

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:46.600
 That makes sense.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.640
 So yeah, there's just so much movement.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.160
 It's just a very complicated thing.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.600
 I think people expect like the politicians just need to sign one law.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.920
 And if they do that, then everything will be fixed.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:59.640
 But it's like a billion little industries that each need to like figure out like

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.080
 first if it's kind, yeah, type of solutions.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:03.960
 But that is happening.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.880
 So I do feel very optimistic about that.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.880
 Yeah, I generally am optimistic on it.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.240
 I didn't have as much detail as you did or context.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.280
 I just feel like humans are good at solving problems.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.320
 And it can seem really bad, but we'll figure it out.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:17.880
 Yeah.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:24.600
 Could you ask your friend if my solar array offsets about 70,000 pounds of CO2 a year,

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.480
 how much money is that worth in the carbon markets?

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.000
 I would like to know because I will sell it to the highest bidder.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.920
 Wait, but you that only offsets it if someone uses it, right?

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:35.640
 I don't know.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.000
 It's just what the app says.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.800
 It just tells me.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.440
 It tells me how much CO2 is being offset.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:47.560
 Let's say you produce a thousand units of energy and you use 200.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.840
 Yep.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.640
 And if you had done nothing, you would have just used 200 of like coal burning energy.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.120
 Yeah.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.080
 So that 800 is that this is why it's complicated.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.200
 Like they 800 only counts if it would have been used anyway.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.560
 If it's just new energy that's produced that is now newly used.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.760
 It's not really offsetting anything.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.560
 It's just cleanly powering something new.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.560
 Could you check with your friend just to make sure?

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:09.800
 Yeah.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.360
 Ask him.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:20.120
 No, the app like tells us all the CO2 offset and how many trees are planted and equivalent.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.120
 I guess there's no new trees actually being planted,

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.280
 but 500 a year if you're curious.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.160
 We have a giant solar array.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:27.880
 It's just stupid.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.120
 Yeah.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.120
 It's funny because on one hand, it is like these details are super complicated.

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:39.000
 But on the other hand, it's like shockingly simple in that we share one atmosphere and

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.560
 sucking carbon out in one area actually does like offset carbon produced like on the other

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.120
 side of the world.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.320
 Like it is crazy that it actually is that simple.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:47.880
 Yeah.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.760
 That makes sense.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.000
 Okay.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.840
 That's enough on the climate stuff.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.480
 I'm going to continue being optimistic.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.920
 Oh, speaking of optimistic.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:38:00.680
 So I've had like, I mean, I went to the emergency room with the stupid stomach

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.520
 infection or whatever.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.400
 And then I have COVID now.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.240
 And now because COVID is sucking the life out of my immune system,

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.760
 it's been like two weeks almost now.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.600
 It's been two weeks, almost two weeks.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.880
 It's been a long time and I've got this stupid case of COVID.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.120
 I've got the shingle tingle coming back.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.120
 Have I told you I get shingles?

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:20.680
 Oh, you do?

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.720
 Well, I got them once in adulthood.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.480
 Is it is this the thing where like it's because you didn't get chicken pox when you were a kid

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.440
 so you get shingles.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.280
 So I got chicken pox as a kid.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.160
 I don't know, but both my grandpa and my dad got shingles and adulthood.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.760
 And it's been like three, four years ago.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.040
 I got shingles real bad.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.240
 It was all over my face.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:41.720
 Oh, wow.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.240
 I'm so painful on my eyelid.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.600
 Like it was just, this is like one of the worst experiences of my life.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.560
 And since then I learned a lot about shingles.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.160
 It's like lives in the nerves.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:57.480
 It's like the chicken pox virus that lives in the nerves and then any like high amount of stress

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.960
 or any stressor on your immune system can cause it to like come back out.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:07.080
 And it manifests early on is like this tingling feeling.

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:11.320
 It's in my left hand and then the left side of my face like my brow.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.000
 Yeah, that just noticed last night.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.520
 So now I have to completely eliminate stress and try to like

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:23.640
 just like calm down, yeah, calm down, meditate, be happy and not get shingles.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.080
 I do not want to get shingles again.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:25.880
 It was awful.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.280
 I'm going to travel this month and go into Twitch con can't do that if I have shingles.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.480
 That would not be fun.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.720
 So yeah, a lot riding on my current stress levels.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.080
 But like how bad would that suck?

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:42.600
 If I went from like emergency room, COVID shingles all in like a month

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.760
 and right after I canceled my health insurance, so I go ahead.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:48.680
 That's how like life works. I figured just stacks all the bad things together.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.120
 And then and then you get like, you know, eight months of good time.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.840
 Then you're back to something bad for for three months.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.480
 It's just how it works.

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.400
 I always thought shingles was something that older people got like less is grandma.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.560
 Yeah, it sounds like an old person thing.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.720
 Yeah, I think she she had it like a year ago.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.560
 A lot of people get it on like the rib cage.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.080
 That sounds nice.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.080
 I would take that face.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.440
 It's not so fun.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.240
 I've got pictures.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.280
 I'll send you pictures.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.560
 Don't put them on the internet, please.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.280
 It's awful from when it was on my face.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.920
 It's like the amount of swelling and just like angry.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.920
 How red and angry they are.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.960
 It's awful.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.400
 It looked like, I don't know.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.840
 It looks like something from medieval times.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.880
 Like some kind of like leprosy or boils or something.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.800
 It's it's bad.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.200
 It does sound like an old time you think.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.480
 Yeah, seems like wheels.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.440
 I think you can actually get like a vaccine for it now

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.800
 where you can't get shingles anymore.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.760
 I need to look into that.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.520
 But it's already in your nerves and maybe too late for you.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.720
 Yeah, maybe too late for me, yeah.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.080
 They might they might they should just

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.200
 put you out of your misery, I think.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.160
 Probably at this point.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:50.840
 Yeah, any more health scares and it's like,

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.920
 yeah, we're going to put you down or we're putting you.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.960
 It's been enough.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:54.840
 You lived a good life.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.760
 A bunch of people have COVID now.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.200
 I've talked to a few people that have COVID.

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.440
 Yeah, I've learned there's a bit of a flare up.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.840
 I had forgotten literally forgotten about.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.160
 Me too.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.200
 I mean, my memory is terrible.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:04.600
 You too.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.480
 I feel like it was a thing of like 2020 and maybe 2021.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.000
 But that was the thing of the past.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.360
 And then turns out, still a thing you can buy test for

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.720
 and you can still get it.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.240
 Here's a messed up thing.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.880
 My emotions around the COVID era

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.400
 are always going to be very positive.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.800
 Because you got to be at home all the time.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.040
 Well, if I instinctively just like imagine it,

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.120
 it felt it was like a crazy time.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.080
 Like, I was me and Liz were making a lot of money.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.760
 It was her first time working fully remotely.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.200
 So like, we got to do a lot.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.640
 We guys spent a lot more time together,

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.200
 which is great.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.320
 It's right at the beginning of our relationship.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.840
 Yeah, nothing was very serious.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.280
 In terms of in our lives at least,

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.480
 like we started like live in Miami part time,

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.800
 which I started to like, I'm going back and forth.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.480
 There's a lot of like good stuff happened

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.880
 despite how annoying everything was.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.600
 So yeah, like a part of me is always going to be like,

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.680
 COVID that was great, you know?

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.080
 Because that's the best it is.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:04.280
 Casey, Casey really looks back fondly on it.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.760
 It was like the first year and this is going to sound awful.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.440
 I don't know if my family listens to my podcast.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.160
 Probably not.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.600
 She was so excited.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.760
 Like we didn't have to go to the Thanksgiving with anybody.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.600
 Like we just were home and didn't have to see anybody for a year.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.120
 And that's just like her dream.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.680
 Not interacting with people.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:25.800
 Yeah, it was just like all obligations were canceled indefinitely.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.680
 That was nice.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.280
 Yeah, we watched so many movies like movies.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.920
 I think that so many with me and Liz like,

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.920
 that was more my lifestyle.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.160
 So like we kind of got to live more my lifestyle.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.160
 And we like just do stuff inside all day.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.640
 So like the relationship shifted to be more like the kind of stuff that I like doing.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.880
 Yeah, does Liz look fondly back on COVID?

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.480
 That's what I need to ask.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:51.240
 I think some parts of it, but overall like it was like very hard for her.

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:51.480
 Yeah.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.800
 And I think it's very complicated for her because she also like lost a bunch of years

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.000
 of being able to live in New York.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.560
 Because for her, it was like, do you live for five years in New York?

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.160
 But then like half of them were like COVID years, which don't really count.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.680
 So she feels like kind of like robbed of that.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.440
 You guys were in New York during COVID?

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.240
 Yeah, the epicenter of COVID as all the news station.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.240
 That's a bad that's a bad time, wouldn't it?

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:11.480
 Okay.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.880
 Here's what's really funny now that I don't live in New York.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:20.040
 I'm understanding why the rest of the world is like always freaking out.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.760
 Because I go I live in Miami, Florida.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.360
 I go to the gym.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.160
 What's on TV?

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.920
 News about New York.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.040
 No matter where you live, it's just news about New York.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:30.520
 Yeah.

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.720
 It's just that that's just like if it's like local news and when you're bored of that,

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.840
 it's just New York and it was.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:35.240
 Yeah.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.600
 And it always makes everything look so, so crazy.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.840
 Like the flooding from like the past, the past week I was talking about like,

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.680
 it looked like New York was about to like get swallowed by the ocean.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.280
 But like all my friends lived there and they were like, it's fine.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:54.520
 And then I remember living in COVID, I was living in New York during COVID.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.080
 And technically it was like whatever the epicenter.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.680
 But that's just because like we just went through our spike earlier than everyone else.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:00.920
 Yeah.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.280
 And yeah, it was like kind of intense.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.920
 And that was early on when we knew the least.

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.200
 But it also like was not as crazy as people.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.000
 Because people would like talk to us being like, oh my God, like are you guys okay?

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.080
 Like it's just normal.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.400
 But like everyone just gets the news of New York.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.480
 So it just feels like this funny thing.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:17.720
 Yeah.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.760
 I remember like when the big wave hit New York,

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:24.520
 it was like pop up hospitals and like body bags in the streets.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.840
 That was like the news perception.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.480
 Yeah, I know.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:32.120
 What's funny is I actually got, do you remember that floating hospital?

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:32.520
 No.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.040
 Did it maybe ship that they sent over?

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.000
 Oh, wow.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.400
 They sent over this like Navy hospital type of thing.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.920
 Where it's like a giant carrier.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.640
 But it's just just for medical stuff.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.880
 And I saw it go by my house, like by my car.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.640
 And I saw it like go up the Hudson.

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.640
 And I was like, oh, there's that thing that drops in there.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.760
 I don't know how useful it was.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:57.000
 I think it like, I think they just put overflow for like non-COVID issues into there.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:57.960
 Because that was the main problem.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:01.000
 That hospital is getting overwhelmed with non-COVID and COVID.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.920
 You can get like your gallbladder removed because the COVID took over the hospital kind of thing.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.160
 Yeah.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:11.000
 But overall, like I don't know, like the city, I feel like handled it pretty well.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.640
 Did it become like a ghost town?

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.480
 That was the other thing I remember about New York was hearing that nobody was there anymore.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.640
 Yeah, which to me was also kind of cool because we knew Liz would do these walks

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:26.600
 where we just walk from our apartment all the way to like, we'd walk for like an hour or two.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.000
 Yeah.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.200
 And we would just walk in the middle.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.520
 It's like a whale.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.880
 It's not like a bull whale.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.080
 He's so spoiled.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.080
 He's crying because he doesn't have his toys.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.200
 You're walking to the streets of New York.

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.880
 I'm picturing the movie, I am legend.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.080
 But it's like nobody.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.360
 Yeah, because we would just walk in the middle of the street walking around.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.600
 No, not long enough for nature to reclaim, but...

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.560
 Well, there was some of that too, not New York.

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.600
 But do you remember some of that?

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:53.000
 Yes, yes, yes.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.440
 I'm talking about national parks and stuff.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.160
 Like all the animals were like, what's going on?

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:57.960
 The humans are gone.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:03.080
 Liz picked up biking.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:06.360
 Like she bought a bike and it was like, you know, it's like a very nice way to learn how

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.400
 to bike in New York when there's no cars and we're very like safe to do that.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:09.560
 Yeah.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.520
 So yeah, just stuff like that.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:14.520
 Like it was kind of cool to be there where how many people are going to be able to experience

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:19.160
 New York where it's as big and crazy as New York is, but like calm.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.840
 Like, yeah, it's very calm.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.400
 And you can kind of have these like, oh, another great thing we would do.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.880
 We would bike over the Brooklyn Bridge all the time.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:30.600
 And normally it's like completely annoying to just fill with tourists.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.080
 I don't know where they're going and get in your way.

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.800
 We would bike like once a week across it and it was awesome.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:40.520
 So to me, it felt like going to Disney World when like during off season,

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.000
 when like everything is just easy and not annoying.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:43.480
 Yeah.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.360
 Like that type of thing.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:44.600
 Yeah.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:50.680
 I feel like there's a romantic comedy movie that could be like your life during COVID in New York.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.600
 You guys riding bikes across the bridge and such a good time.

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.280
 But it's a tough time, you know?

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.640
 It's a good time, but a tough time.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.440
 There's a movie there.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.000
 I don't know.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:46:59.560
 There is, yeah.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.960
 I mean, there was just like, the tough part for me was the arbitrary rules that made no sense.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.360
 You know, I just hate that kind of thing.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.400
 But that was just a kind of aggravating.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:09.800
 Yeah.

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:14.120
 The whole thing just had all these stupid rules that like just did not make any sense at all.

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.160
 It just made our lives harder.

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.720
 But yeah, besides that.

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.000
 Other than that, great time.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:19.800
 I appreciate it.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.600
 I appreciate the unit.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.520
 There was all the suffering and the human toll.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.840
 But other than that, really recommend it.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:29.080
 The body bags in the streets as all you people saw in the news.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.000
 I can't believe you live in Miami, Florida.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.320
 All this time, I thought you were in Miami, Ohio.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:33.800
 I don't know.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.600
 I've never heard you say that loud.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.960
 What's up with the Midwest, right?

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.760
 Why does the Midwest name stuff after other stuff?

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.840
 That's like in more important places.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.440
 Are we sure that Miami, Florida came first?

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.560
 Are we positive?

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:47.880
 Yeah.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:48.760
 Well, actually, no.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.320
 I guess not because Miami is somewhat new.

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.920
 But here's the thing.

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.120
 I mean, Florida actually does this a lot.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:58.200
 Like, we have St. Petersburg.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.080
 Oh, yeah, Russia.

00:47:59.080 --> 00:47:59.640
 Florida.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.480
 What's like, why?

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.360
 Yeah, why?

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:06.360
 There are a lot of Russians in St. Petersburg, Florida.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.920
 It's weird to me because you just make it less important.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.440
 Like, you're already less important.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.600
 Yeah, you're now the second most important city with your name.

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.960
 Yeah, at the best.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.280
 We also have like another funny one of the Jupiter.

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.840
 Why did you name it after a planet?

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.120
 Like, that's something I can't either.

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.040
 Jupiter, Florida.

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.040
 That's funny.

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:26.920
 Florida is a lot.

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.600
 I think there's like a Paris also.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:29.880
 Paris in the Midwest.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.120
 There's a Mexico, Missouri.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.000
 What else is there?

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.080
 There's definitely some of those in Missouri, I've seen.

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.480
 Also, street names repeat way too much.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.120
 I, uh, there's a street by me called Tiger Tail Ave.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.120
 And I'm like, oh, this is like a crazy street name.

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.480
 I was picking up lifts in the airport.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.040
 Very.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.000
 Like in like 45 minutes away, I took a wrong turn

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.960
 and ended up on some like warehouse back street.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.840
 Tiger Tail Ave.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.800
 Like what the what?

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.480
 Like that's a very odd name to be duplicated.

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.040
 Yeah.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.320
 Just aren't making up words.

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.120
 Just numbers.

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:00.760
 Just numbers.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:04.280
 One, two, three, 200,000 if it takes it, whatever.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.080
 Like cities.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:05.240
 Yeah.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.200
 That's what New York does.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.280
 And to be honest, I'm really bad with directions.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.000
 And it was really helpful that in New York, for the most part,

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.600
 if you're on 54th street, you want to go to 55th street, you go up.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.000
 Yeah.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.520
 You want to go to 53rd, you go down.

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.960
 Very, very easy and straightforward.

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.520
 Yeah.

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.440
 Like you don't have to memorize like all these bespoke names.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.720
 It's like Broadway.

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.720
 And there are others.

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:24.440
 We got a few.

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.040
 We got, we got a few name streets.

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.160
 Like below a certain level.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:27.400
 Yeah.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.880
 There's like Lafayette and a bunch of like name streets,

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.680
 but good portion of it, pretty straightforward.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.480
 Hmm.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:33.800
 Yeah.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.600
 We don't have like streets in the Ozarks.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.440
 The matter.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.480
 Of course you don't have streets.

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.560
 We have state and county highways.

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.680
 You guys have dirt roads.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.760
 I live on highway 160.

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.320
 For the horse and buggy rides.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.320
 Dirt roads, we do have a lot of dirt roads.

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.840
 Wait, is that, are you just joking?

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.960
 Because we do have dirt roads.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.000
 I don't know if you.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:53.400
 No, I'm not.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.760
 I'm just joking.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.880
 I'm just making fun of you guys.

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:56.280
 Oh, OK.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.480
 Have I been on a dirt road?

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:57.720
 Yeah.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:58.040
 I don't know.

00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.240
 Is that like a thing in cities?

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.440
 People have never experienced it.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.000
 It's funny because I'm not really from the city.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:03.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:03.960
 You're from.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.240
 Because I grew up in.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:09.720
 Yes.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.200
 Yes.

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:14.120
 My 1000 year old family in India that have all been farmers for,

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.840
 you know, thousands plural of years.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.000
 Yeah, you're really messing that up for your family.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.840
 But you know, I grew up in New Jersey.

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.960
 People think of New Jersey as it's like toxic dump wasteland,

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.480
 which it is like a beautiful.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.240
 It's the garden state, right?

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.040
 Yeah, but it's green.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.720
 It actually is like, I would say a third of New Jersey

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.640
 is that like wasteland that people imagine.

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.560
 The part that's just basically New York City.

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:37.160
 The New York's like New York's trash.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.720
 Yeah, where it like just fills over into New Jersey.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.120
 But the rest of the state is like upstate New York, right?

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.560
 Similar geography wise.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.280
 Yeah, exactly.

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:44.600
 Yeah.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.680
 So we have like these like rolling mountains.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.400
 And yeah, I mean, I grew up in a very like farmy,

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.760
 rural town with dirt roads.

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.960
 With their roads.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:52.920
 Yeah, that's in high school.

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.360
 We'd like go backroading.

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.440
 You just like ride drive around on dirt roads.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:00.360
 It's wild to look back and think of some of the things we did for fun in high school.

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:02.520
 That's really stupid.

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.320
 I miss it.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.200
 I miss that stuff.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.640
 Like life was so simple and fun.

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:06.200
 It was.

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:06.840
 It was simple.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.480
 You don't realize how simple you have it.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.120
 So I go ahead.

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:10.840
 I know.

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.160
 They're just, yeah, can't go back though.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.000
 It's impossible to give up.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.480
 My friend was a, we asked my friend the other day.

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.440
 Like when was your, like when were your parents the most pissed at you?

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:26.040
 And he was like, well, that time my trucks, my dad's truck.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.520
 I like took my dad's truck and I caught on fire.

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.800
 And we're like, what did you do?

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.440
 And he was like, well, I took it off a jump.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:35.800
 And the first thing I was like, what do you mean off a jump?

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:36.600
 Like where I grew up?

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.040
 There weren't any jumps around.

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.760
 He grew up in Arizona.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.240
 And again, I imagined like kind of like a flat desert.

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:46.040
 So I still don't maybe, I don't know, maybe the little clips or something.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.120
 But yeah, he took it off and jumped and like the battery fell over.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.000
 Oh, my word.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.760
 And the engine caught on fire.

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:53.880
 And he would tell me that his parents still don't know what happened.

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:57.640
 I was just trying to get caught on fire.

00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.120
 I don't know.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:58.360
 Yeah.

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:02.120
 But yeah, I mean, that sounds fun.

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.800
 Like growing up in the desert where you can just do all kinds of wild crazy shit.

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:06.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.800
 Yeah.

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:12.760
 One time my dad came home from work, it was just me and my older brother that were home.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.360
 And we were, we were shooting off.

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.320
 I mean, this is innocent enough, but we were shooting off fireworks in the backyard.

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.560
 We were like dropping.

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:24.840
 We had these empty tubes from like a playset, you know, like the hold up the roof on a playset.

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.360
 And we were dropping the water rockets at it.

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.520
 And there was like a mortar kind of simulation.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.720
 The thing that sucked was he came home.

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.640
 We're out in the backyard doing this.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:37.080
 And the trash can in the living room is on fire or in the kitchen.

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.920
 Because we had thrown away some matches or something and we didn't know.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.720
 And it was still on fire.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.800
 So he comes home, no one's in the house.

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.680
 And like our kitchen trash can is up in flames.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.520
 Like, what is going on?

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.080
 Oh man, he's pretty mad.

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:51.960
 He's going to be crazy.

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.480
 He's just like, yeah.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.360
 I'm just like thinking about from his point of view, he just like,

00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:00.120
 imagine you coming home and then like just something in your house is randomly on fire.

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:00.360
 Yeah.

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:04.280
 Like that's like really nothing that chaotic happens at all in real life.

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:09.000
 It takes kids to introduce that kind of kid that kind of thing all the time.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.760
 That's wild.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.160
 And the kids just they just push every limit.

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.560
 Like my eight year old now, that's the thing we're dealing with.

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:19.400
 It's like literally every single thing he runs into in life.

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:22.760
 He thinks, how can I do something with this that's not intended?

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:26.200
 How can I like use this thing in a way it's not meant to be used?

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.560
 And it's just the amount of things that are broken on a daily basis or things.

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.200
 And I'm like, you're going to fall and hurt yourself really bad.

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.240
 It's just constant.

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.760
 But it's like, it's a curiosity.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.200
 You don't want to, I guess, stifle it.

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:36.680
 I don't know.

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.880
 No, it's definitely entertaining.

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.400
 Probably sure.

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.400
 I just want to be entertained.

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:41.880
 Yeah.

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.800
 And I thought you wanted to say this about me.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:47.160
 She's like, you just like surrounding yourself with things that entertain you.

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.400
 And I don't understand how that's like an observation.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:54.760
 Cause I'm like, isn't that just what everyone is like, like, why don't you want to be entertained?

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:59.160
 Like she says that like the friends that I surround myself with are just people that I just find

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.040
 really entertaining.

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:03.960
 But I don't understand like what other type of people do.

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.120
 Yeah.

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:04.920
 What would you want?

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.480
 If not that.

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:05.720
 Yeah.

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:06.760
 I don't really get it.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.200
 It's an interesting observation though.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.040
 I think other people probably have relationships for other reasons other than entertainment.

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.680
 So it might be a truth, but there might be something there.

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.280
 I'm going to look at you see that lens now.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:21.880
 I think it's a good trait because when there are scenarios that are stressful,

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:25.000
 though people get stressed in, I can like find a lot of joy because entertaining.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:31.240
 Like I don't mind if like someone has like annoying girlfriend or something.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.720
 That's like, I don't find it entertaining.

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.880
 I find it entertaining that she's annoying everyone.

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:36.440
 Yeah.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.040
 You just like the spice of life.

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:42.520
 It's like COVID, awful time, millions of people died, all that, but it was pretty entertaining.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:43.240
 But it was interesting.

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:45.800
 But it was not boring.

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.760
 Well, it kind of was boring, but it's funny.

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:49.800
 All right.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.200
 That's enough entertaining for today.

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:54.520
 I think we've done all the entertaining we can do.

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:57.080
 Did I entertain you for this hour?

00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.360
 Yes, I'll show up.

00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.800
 So it's twice a week.

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.000
 Got to keep being entertaining.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.360
 I'm going to try.

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:02.920
 No pressure.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.040
 All right, I'm going to keep I'm going to keep having COVID.

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.800
 So there you go.

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.080
 I mean, it's been a week.

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.120
 I think it's like a week and a half.

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:10.600
 Yeah.

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.760
 Yeah, everyone's saying this one takes this one taking a while.

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:13.160
 It takes longer.

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:13.800
 Okay.

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.240
 I had my Jiu Jitsu tournament a week ago Saturday.

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.160
 I have not been on the mat since.

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.520
 I'm about to go insane.

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.280
 I can't just go in and give people COVID.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.480
 I asked my wife.

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.440
 She said, no, I just really, really want to train.

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.000
 And my coach is like, you'll have plenty of time to train.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:29.800
 Just get better.

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.560
 Like, no, I want to do Jiu Jitsu.

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.360
 I'm watching YouTube.

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:35.400
 You have, why don't you get like both your kids to attack you at once?

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:39.640
 That's like almost like an adult.

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:40.120
 Yeah.

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.560
 An eight year old and a three year old.

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:42.840
 Yeah, it'd be a challenge.

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.960
 Or you can ask Casey.

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:44.360
 I don't know.

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:44.680
 Yeah.

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:45.800
 No, I want to get her a geek.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.480
 I really want her to get into it.

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:48.760
 She's interested.

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.040
 She thinks it'd be fun.

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:50.840
 All right, I got to pee.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:51.480
 Cool.

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:51.720
 All right.

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:52.120
 Thanks, Max.

00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:52.600
 See you.

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.480
 All right, see you.
