00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 Like, find me on x.com. That just sounds dirty to you.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.480
 You're going to do that.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.400
 Yeah, you can find my profile on x.com.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 What's fun is when the predominant thing, the thing that's taking all of your emotional

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.520
 and physical energy in your life, when you can't talk about it, that's a lot of fun.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.760
 That's a lot of fun.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.800
 I love getting on a podcast and talking about other things that I haven't been thinking

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 about.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 That's fun.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.440
 Yeah, you've got to pretend, you're at the fake person.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.280
 And you imagine there's people that do this professionally, right?

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.600
 Like, I don't know, who does this professionally?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.600
 Like podcast professionals?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.600
 Which is that?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.840
 Just people that are like entertainers on TV, like late night talk show hosts, like people

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.840
 that are just on everything.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.840
 They go through stuff.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.480
 Occasionally, they're going through a difficult situation.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.720
 And then they just, they have to act like everything's fine.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.720
 Everything's fine.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.120
 I guess the cat's out of the bag now.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.840
 Oh, man.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.320
 This is a, you're just teasing everyone.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.120
 Everyone loves to hear juicy stuff.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.120
 Sorry.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.120
 No, I'll just go ahead and divert away.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120
 Because I really can't talk about it.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.840
 And that's the thing that sucks.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.840
 But I do want to say, I just saw on Twitter, I mean, X, that LK99, the dream is dead.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.840
 And that's some bad news.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.240
 I saw that post this morning too.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.400
 I was actually just going through the comments right before this.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.400
 I don't know.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.400
 I don't know.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.480
 Like I said, in the last podcast, I don't know what to make of any of it.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.720
 So I'm like, is it dead?

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.720
 Is this person trustworthy?

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.680
 Like, is what they're saying makes sense?

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.960
 Yeah, they may sound so official.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.680
 They said this is as official as it'll get.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.440
 As they said, I don't know what that means though, whoever that person was that tweeted

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.440
 it.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.360
 Whenever I tweet, I'm just going to add on there.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.360
 This is official.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.360
 It's going to get.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.360
 Yeah.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.360
 This is official.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.360
 It's going to get.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.360
 It's just he's the best.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.360
 Yeah.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.360
 There you go.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.360
 Say how that works.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.360
 Yeah.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.960
 That's, I mean, well, yeah, I guess we'll see.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.600
 I mean, I did see that prediction markets are still at 25%.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.560
 So it's going to take over.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.560
 Oh, really?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.760
 So the markets weren't swayed by that one post on X.com.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.680
 It probably takes time to build it up where, like, you know, you hear news, you kind of

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.760
 denial anything about it, then you're like, yeah.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.760
 Yeah.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.760
 Yeah.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.520
 So I think the claim in the tweet was that it is levitate.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.840
 It does have a levitating effect, but it's not super connected.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.840
 It's the claim.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.840
 Yeah.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.840
 I guess it's just from normal.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.840
 Dymagnet or whatever.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.400
 There's fun stuff we can do with levitation, right?

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.320
 I mean, I mean, it's just a magnet than the date.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.320
 It's not super-conductor.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.320
 Oh, bummer.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.320
 But it might be really hard to make magnet.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.320
 It might be.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.320
 Yeah.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.320
 Really hard to make.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.480
 I mean, there might be other special properties of it because it's not a typical magnet.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.840
 So I don't know.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.720
 The silver lining to me is that it does seem like the whole world was woke up to the fact

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.480
 that, like, we still don't know anything.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.440
 There's still so many combinations of materials and things that people could, like, there's

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.440
 a lot of progress to be made.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.080
 Even if this wasn't it, I feel like you just don't even think about, like, a new material

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.680
 could surface that changes the world.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.680
 It's not an area I was thinking about.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.360
 It's like, I think about the internet.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.900
 I think about what else do I think about, I don't know, physics discoveries?

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.900
 I don't know.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.900
 But I don't think about material science.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.900
 And now I do.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.880
 Now I'm thinking about those people in the lab, mesh in different things together and

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.880
 figure and stuff out.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.880
 I don't know.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.880
 It's interesting.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.880
 Yeah.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.720
 I think it's funny because I read two comments this morning that were polar opposites.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.440
 One was just some salty, cynical person being like, this is why the media shouldn't hype

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.440
 up this stuff.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.360
 Now, public trust in science has been eroded.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.600
 I was like, what the hell is this guy talking about?

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.920
 I think I had the opposite reaction.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.560
 Then that's another comment that wasn't replying to this person.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.360
 It was a completely separate comment that was like, oh, well, you know, even it doesn't

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360
 work out.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.360
 This was awesome because like the whole world got to like get into this and it was inspiring

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.360
 to see.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.040
 And I think it was like very positive even even if it doesn't end up being a thing like,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.240
 I can't see it as anything besides inspiring that like, there's moments like this of like

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.080
 something this impactful that can happen.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.200
 So I saw it as entirely positive, but yeah, it's just people, I think we'll just see it

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.840
 through whatever lens they want to see.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.200
 I have an all new respect for like chemists and people who know this stuff.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.280
 It's like, I'm sure people feel this way when they hear people talk about technology,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.360
 like internet technology and web stuff, but it just kind of blows your mind to watch these

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.640
 people talk on Twitter.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.200
 Like the things they understand that are so foreign and just seem like this whole other

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.200
 language.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.200
 I don't know.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.520
 I've been very impressed with that whole field and I didn't even know it existed honestly.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.200
 I thought we invented all the materials a long time ago.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.200
 Yeah.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.760
 It's funny because you imagine, I guess for me, I imagine like, okay, production of materials,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.680
 that's like some big industrial optimized process that happens in these like crazy factories.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.400
 But of course, there's like a non-scaled version of making anything.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.560
 So it was funny to see people make this stuff at home using just like their hands and like

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.040
 some basic, not literally at home, like in a lab, obviously, but yeah, it's just interesting

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.720
 for me to see that yeah, no matter what the industrial processes for anything, there is

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.240
 like a more like amateur version of it that they would have discovered first before scaling

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.240
 it up.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.080
 So it was cool to see that side of it where, yeah, you can literally make any material.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.480
 Obviously they're making like crazy small amounts.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.480
 Yeah.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.160
 It's actually funny how small the amount is given how much it goes into it.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.160
 Look at this.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.160
 Like it's moving.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.160
 Exactly.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.040
 But it is cool to see that technically you can build all that home.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.640
 It would be like for us if someone, and I've seen this people do this where people build

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.120
 a CPU at home.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.120
 Oh, for real?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.120
 Yeah.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.920
 Have you seen the thing with a toaster?

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.920
 No.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.400
 There was this guy, I'll look it up and I'll find it later.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.760
 His goal was to build a toaster with zero, literally from scratch.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.760
 What that means?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.760
 Have you seen this?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.760
 Yeah.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.760
 I think you told me about it.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.760
 Okay.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.480
 It just like mines the ore and like it doesn't turn out great, but he actually did it like

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.480
 it worked.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.480
 It looks like a piece of shit.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.600
 It looks so much worse than you could even imagine, but I think he did do it.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.560
 It's incredible how hard it is and really makes you appreciate the harmony that the world

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.560
 works good.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.760
 The collective humanity efforts.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.760
 Yeah.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.760
 Yeah.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.760
 I've heard that that's like what we're good at.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.320
 That humans separated from other species by being good at working together.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.160
 Is that am I summarizing that?

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.160
 Yeah, I think so.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.800
 I mean, we talked about those before where our ancestors were individually smarter from

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.920
 what we can tell like brain size and just more individually impressive people.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:57.440
 But their capabilities are like a fragment of what even the least capable person can do

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.440
 now.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.440
 Yeah.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.440
 Yeah.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.440
 That book, I feel like I've probably already said this on the podcast.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.440
 I don't care.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.120
 The rational optimist starts off and kind of talks about like he's sitting at his desk.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.840
 And like all the things that were made from all the countries around the world, like I'm

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.360
 drinking coffee from Columbia and I'm coffee cup was whatever, you know, made in Taiwan

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.160
 and the desk is, you know, you got the silicon manufacturing and the mining and all the millions

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.680
 of people involved in just this like simple setup at his desk where he's reading a book.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.680
 It's pretty crazy.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.680
 Yeah.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.000
 My favorite part about this always makes fun of me because I'm going to play too much.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.480
 My favorite part about that whole system is it just relied on people being selfish.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.900
 It didn't rely on like people like loving each other and like being friends and working

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.900
 harmony.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.560
 Everyone just operating their own self interest and somehow like it comes together in a overall

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.560
 positive way.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.560
 Is that capitalism?

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.880
 Is that basically what capitalism is or am I missing?

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.880
 Yeah.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.560
 I think I think it's a good system in that you can redirect people's natural incentives

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.480
 towards something that is so productive for everyone.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.760
 Obviously there's like holes and gaps in this, but generally speaking, like that does happen

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:08.040
 and all like I go to work and I help a bunch of people build stuff just because I'm selfish.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.040
 Yeah.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.760
 Like it's not really it's a nice for me to help other people, but like let's be honest.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.560
 I mean, that's not hard to believe though.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.560
 Yeah.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.560
 You're kind of a jerk.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.560
 Like everyone.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.560
 They understand that.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.560
 But think of like really kind people.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.240
 They do it for themselves too.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.240
 Yeah.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.240
 Am I a jerk?

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.240
 Am I as honest?

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.240
 Adam, you're not a jerk.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.240
 You're just you're honest.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.240
 You're so honest.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.120
 And you're so it's actually real kindness is that you're honest with people like that's

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.120
 the East Coast thing, right?

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.120
 I like this.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.120
 Yeah.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.120
 I've seen you in forever.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.040
 And we don't really talk now outside of the podcast.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.080
 Like we're not like DMing every day, like we used to.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.080
 Did we use to?

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.080
 Yeah.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.680
 I feel like the podcast is like enough of a we stay in touch twice a week, you know?

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.920
 And this thing it's like a big social part of my week where we do this twice a week.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.920
 So it was kind of weird this last week.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.920
 Yeah.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.480
 So we just I took like one day off or we took a day off and I think I said on like the last

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.480
 podcast we recorded like I guess someday we'll take like a week off and I don't know

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.080
 why I didn't realize I was going to be gone the next week.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.880
 So the reason that didn't occur to me.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.200
 We went to like a Lake Tahoe last week for like a company offsite.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200
 Lake Tahoe is amazing.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.200
 Have you ever been to Lake Tahoe?

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200
 No, I haven't.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.200
 Okay.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.200
 Beautiful.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200
 It's beautiful.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.360
 It's like everywhere you are in Lake Tahoe is beautiful.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.280
 It's like you hike up the mountain views of the lake.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.960
 You're on the lake views of the mountains.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.680
 It's just like mountains and like everywhere is really nice.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.080
 They have beaches, they're sand.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.080
 Oh, really?

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.480
 Is it a huge lake where like it looks like an ocean?

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.040
 Yeah, but you can see all the way around it.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.040
 Like you can see the whole perimeter.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.960
 It's not like a great lake where you don't like water to the horizon.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.320
 The water there, I guess it's known for it's clear water because it's all like snow melt

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.800
 from the mountains in like the middle of it.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.040
 We went out on a boat and you can basically see the bottom anywhere in the lake.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.640
 Like it's that clear straight down and like lakes in Missouri.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.640
 Not so much.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.960
 You can't, you can't see like a foot in front of you.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.080
 You don't stick your arm down there because it's creepy.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.080
 So it's great.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.080
 A lot of swimming.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.080
 A lot of, we did some paddle boarding.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.080
 Was it warm?

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.080
 It was very active.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.080
 Yeah.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.080
 Yeah.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.080
 It's like 70s.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.080
 Nice.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.640
 So down the mountain and like Reno, it's 100 every day, but you go up a few thousand feet

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.840
 or whatever it is.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.840
 And yeah, it was beautiful.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.800
 70 degrees, something we were in the water or doing something moving.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.040
 One day I got 24,000 steps, which is like an entire week for me.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.880
 Like I get like 3000 a day when I'm not trying.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.880
 Wow.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.880
 So yeah, very active.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.880
 I was beat every night.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.880
 It slept really well.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.480
 Well, speaking of being active, I got to talk about what happened to me this weekend.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.600
 Yes, I heard.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.600
 Go ahead.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.080
 As we, I think I talked about a previous episode.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.760
 I'm getting into skinboarding and planning and getting into kiteboarding.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.400
 I was at the beach.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.760
 I was getting pretty good at it.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.560
 I was finally like having fun, skinboarding, I got the hang of it.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.440
 I was doing it and I went in to do another, so basically you get like run and then you

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.840
 drop the board and jump on it.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.840
 Yeah.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.320
 Two steps into a run like halfway, like I was doing it for me like 15 minutes.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.480
 I just felt like a pop in the back of my knee and I kind of ignored it and I just jumped

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.680
 on it anyway.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:21.320
 And then I just fell off right away and I was like, oh no, that feel or sound good.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.960
 And then I got up and I was like, damn, this hurts.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.480
 And then I like went over to Liz and she was recording me this whole time by the way.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.920
 Oh, don't video the thing.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.640
 It doesn't look like anything because like I didn't know I didn't like, you're not like

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.160
 collapsing and screaming and grabbing your knee because that would be a hilarious city.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.160
 I'm sorry.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.760
 And it's just like, it just popped on its own.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.680
 It's like I like fell around and twins or it's just, it's just not a fun.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.000
 It's like she, she actually had it on cinematic mode when I was walking up to her.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.880
 So it's just me like slowly walking up being like, I hurt myself.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.280
 I'll say I'm going to post it later.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.400
 It's very epic moment of like triumph.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.600
 You just did your skin more than anything emerging from the ocean holding my board looking

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.200
 really cool and being like, I pop my knee.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.200
 It hurts.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.200
 Yeah.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.640
 And then I got and I was like, I was like, it did a hurt by like walk.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.840
 We walked back and I came home.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.680
 Then later that day, like it was messed up, like my knee was swollen and I like could

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.680
 barely walk.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:24.960
 And I was like, this sucks because these types of knee injuries are the type of thing that

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.960
 you do at once.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.880
 And then it just becomes a thing that you're not constantly worried about.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.120
 And I was like, I, I know so many people in that situation, I don't want to be one of

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.120
 those people.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.200
 So it's kind of bummed yesterday I woke up and I went from like not being able to walk

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.200
 at all to like feeling almost 100% fine.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.760
 Are you serious?

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.760
 That's the end of the story.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.640
 It's still, no, it's still like off.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.640
 There's something off about it.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.280
 Like I'm so careful moving on it.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.640
 I think if I like tried to move really like, I might aggravate it again, but yeah, it definitely

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.320
 went from me feeling like I definitely need to go to the doctor and this might need something

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.960
 to now me being like, okay, maybe it was just a strain.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.080
 I hope it's just like a minor tear or like just a strain, but we'll see.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:10.280
 Does it feel like there's more slack or anything like I tore my posterior cruciate playing basketball

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.840
 in high school and I remember going to the bench and it was the weirdest feeling in the

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.940
 world that like I felt like my leg in my shoe was like my foot was doing things in my shoe

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.400
 that I just didn't make sense.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.400
 Yeah.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.880
 Have you had any of that kind of sensation?

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.000
 Well, the second day when it was really bad, I like, I couldn't tell what was happening

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.560
 because I feel like they forget how to walk because like everything just feels like wobbly

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.560
 is out.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.360
 So that's what I thought is serious, but I think it was from the swelling and the swelling

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:41.520
 like messed up the muscles because today now I feel pretty normal.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.680
 And the thing is there's so many little, I keep trying to look up what could have, like

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.760
 which thing I could have messed up.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.240
 There's so many things in your knee.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.760
 It's like the most complicated thing possible.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.120
 There's a lot of stuff going on.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.120
 It really is.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.040
 And I'm like, I know exactly what makes it hurt.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.400
 So kind of like figure out what it is, but like even then it's like, I can feel exactly

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.400
 where it hurts.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.760
 I know exactly the motion that makes it hurt.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.760
 Yeah.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.760
 But there's like a million things.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.800
 Like it's at the meniscus is the ACL is like one of the things that you meant.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.160
 There's like all these weirdly things in there.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.440
 It's a complicated joint like the PCO goes through the bone, like it goes through the

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.040
 middle of the joint and then around it's wild.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.880
 Yeah, there's, but I'm one of those people that has like I will, my knee will swell for

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.880
 the rest of my life like unless I'm completely sedentary, if I just go for walks every day,

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.920
 like I've got swelling and I think it's to like stabilize it.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.320
 It's because of my, I don't really have a PCL in my left knee.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:36.000
 So I think by swelling, it keeps it a little more stable because that's mainly a stabilization

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.320
 like it's just keeping it stable.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.720
 I think it's for good reason that it gets swollen, but it hurts.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.600
 I mean, it went, the more swollen it gets the more pressure and the more like bending

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600
 it hurts.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.000
 But what did you, when did you heard it?

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 How old were you?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.360
 I mean, I would have been like 16, 17.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.360
 Yeah.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.080
 I hate injuries like this because they're so like invisible.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.680
 I am fine breaking a bone.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.160
 I break a bone.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.160
 They said it heals.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.160
 It heals.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.160
 Okay.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.320
 Like there might be some issues, but it's just very straightforward.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.320
 But these like weird ligament tear things, it's just like, yeah, you never know what's

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.320
 actually going on.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320
 Yeah.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.880
 And when it's a lower leg thing, you end up favoring a lot like even after I bias, I

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.720
 mean, like immediately after doing the physical therapy, I had surgery, everything was better

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.720
 for a while.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.480
 But then eventually, like in older age and adulthood, I started playing basketball again.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.760
 It's like, I'm favoring it so bad that then you get all out of culture and it just messes

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.760
 with everything.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.760
 It sucks.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.760
 Yeah.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.740
 So we're just getting old.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.740
 Yeah.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.080
 The dumb thing is, I'm like, okay, I'm going to pick water sports because they're not the

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.080
 like low impact.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.000
 But then I guess technically it's like running on the sand is actually one of the like it's

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.320
 actually very hard on your body.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.000
 Because like you're, you're like constantly hitting it the ground at different angles

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.520
 and your knee is like compensating for balance.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.520
 Yeah.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.200
 It's not a, not a nice level terrain there on the beach.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.200
 Yeah.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.200
 Exactly.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.200
 So I'm realizing, okay, that's, it's maybe isn't actually like a low injury risk.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.080
 And then people forget to fill in their holes, like we dig a lot of holes on the beach.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.080
 We fill them in.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080
 But like, I don't know.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.080
 Did we do a good job?

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:17.080
 I don't think, I mean, I, I'm not out there dodging holes for sure.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:23.720
 I'm hopeful that kiteboarding as, even though it is like a more intense thing, that one

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.880
 I do think is like pretty low, like you can like injure yourself if you get like, like

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.080
 sucked over land and like you fall from the sky, but that's again, a little bit more straightforward

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.240
 than like is invisible thing happening into your knee because I, that you're just like

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.640
 on the water and you're being pulled along.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.680
 It's not, it's not like anything that crazy.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.680
 Yeah.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.960
 But yeah, just injury sucks that they set you back.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.760
 I think the other thing that might have causes is the past month I've been going to the gym

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.160
 like really hard, like I've been going into that lifting a lot.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.160
 Yeah.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.400
 I'm wondering if I like kind of overdid it somehow, but this also sucks.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.040
 Because now like I kind of lose that progress can't go bad.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.040
 Yeah.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.200
 That's, that's a big dilemma.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.920
 So I'm, I have told you, I'm into jiu-jitsu pretty into it.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.760
 But I know that big injury is going to come and then like all the, the like getting, I'm

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.760
 so obsessed with it.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.200
 Like I want to just pour myself into it every day and you can't do that once you're hurt.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.200
 Like even now I've got little stuff just like Sunday, I went for the first time to like

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.720
 an open mat, which they do every Sunday and it's just like people from other gyms show

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.080
 up and it's just rolling.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:35.680
 There's no like holding back, you know, it's like a live role, like a street role.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.680
 Yeah.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.960
 So I got arm bard for anybody who listens to this and does jiu-jitsu.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.760
 I'm dumb and I'm brand new and I got like people mounted on me constantly.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.880
 I was in everyone's guard constantly.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.080
 And then a lot of the submissions were arm bars.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.760
 I did get choked once, but my left elbow, I definitely hyper extended.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.800
 Somebody went a little hard.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:01.080
 They were going for the gold medal, I think, and it's, it's still hurts.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.080
 And now every time I've trained since just the blood flow and like getting into it again,

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.600
 it's like afterward when the adrenaline comes off, it's just achy, like real achy.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.600
 Yeah.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.240
 Everyone that does be jj says, uh, you will eventually get injured.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.240
 Yeah.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.240
 And it's rib stuff.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.240
 It's knees.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.760
 It's, it's stuff that's going to suck.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.760
 Yeah.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.120
 But I can't, I can't turn away.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.120
 I'm too into it.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.440
 Oh, my finger, uh, it doesn't hurt to type.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.560
 But like my pinky finger, my left pinky finger is so fat.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.560
 Did you jam it?

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.720
 I think I burst a blood, I think I burst a blood vessel.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.240
 I jammed my middle finger and it's swollen for that reason.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.520
 But this one I think is a blood vessel and it's, it's tight.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.520
 Yeah.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.520
 Those arm bars scare me.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.000
 Whenever I see that, I'm just like, I can just see wrong so easily.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.480
 My fear is that like as a dumb white belt, I won't even know it's coming and like somebody

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.120
 will injure me before I even have a chance to react to like I'm too slow and I'll just

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.760
 be like, this is fine and then I'm, I'm dead.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.720
 Somebody passed out the other day, like from a choke, somebody got a choke on them and

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.720
 they passed out.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.520
 They didn't tap and they passed out.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.520
 Wow.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.160
 That was like my story when I didn't know how to tap out.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.400
 I didn't know what I was tapping out.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.400
 Yeah.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.400
 Yeah.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.400
 I never passed out though.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.400
 I came close.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.840
 I definitely saw like the edges in my vision starting to black out.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.160
 It's, it is like a thing that I told myself, like, I don't know anything.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.280
 So if I feel any pain, I'm just going to tap, but then once you get in the heat of the

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.000
 moment, you're like, I can get out of this.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 I got this.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.200
 Like somebody had me in a, a choke with the guillotine, I think they call it.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.400
 And they like fall back and, and I resisted so hard that now I'm just like all those

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.200
 muscles in my neck or so, I never use them.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.840
 Like I just hold my head up, you know, so sleeping's hard, we're just getting old.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:39.840
 That's okay.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.840
 It's okay.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.840
 It's fine.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.840
 It's just everything hurts all the time.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.920
 I had so much I wanted to do in life.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.360
 I turned 37 this month.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.360
 Did you know this?

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.360
 Was it turned or you?

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.680
 My birthday is, I turn in like 12 days.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.680
 When's your birthday?

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.680
 Should I tell you?

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.680
 Oh, I don't know.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.240
 You can tell me in private if you can't say it in public.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.760
 Well, I, I used to have, no, okay.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.760
 It's August 20th.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.760
 I don't care.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.760
 I used to have it on my Twitter profile.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.120
 And I was told it's kind of a security thing.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.280
 You don't put your birthday out there.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.280
 All right.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.000
 People can like steal your identity easier or something.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 Yeah.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.880
 At this point, I feel like identity theft is so easy to pull off where if you're targeted,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.320
 like there's no stopping it, like it's just so easy to look up anything.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.320
 Yeah.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.400
 And this is what I hate about, because in America, when you need to prove your identity

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.000
 to someone, they ask you what's your social security number.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 Yeah.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.400
 Then you give them your social security number, which is both your username and your password.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.400
 So when you give it to them, now you have to rely on them never, ever losing it.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.800
 And it's every person you've ever given it to.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.800
 Yeah.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.240
 You think of all the people along the chain that passed that information along?

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240
 Yeah.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.240
 Yeah.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.240
 It's out there.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.240
 It's just a dumb system.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.320
 But like the public, private key pair concept was built.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.040
 Like you have something that is secret to you.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.240
 You can sign something and give it to someone else.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.760
 They can prove that it's you, but they don't ever get your secret thing.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.760
 Yeah.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.440
 Like we need to switch to that at some point because social security, because it's just

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.800
 getting ridiculous because now, now everyone knows that those security number on its own

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.800
 is not enough.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.440
 So they ask for like three other things on top of it.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.440
 And then that's me for the things and five other things.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.800
 And it just, it just gets to a place where it's an arms race.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.800
 Yeah.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.800
 It's very annoying.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800
 I hate it.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.800
 Yeah.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.800
 I don't, please don't steal my identity.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.920
 Now I'm just fearful that one of our listeners is like, oh, it would be easy to steal out

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:23.920
 of my identity.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.920
 Please don't do that.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.920
 That would be great.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.480
 But then you'd have to be Adam.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.480
 And do you really want that?

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.480
 Yeah.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.480
 Do you really want my identity?

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.480
 Exactly.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.480
 Come on down.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.480
 Man, I really do.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.040
 We've said we've talked about this too much, but I really do wish I could be anonymous.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.040
 Is it too late to go anonymous?

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.040
 Really recording a podcast?

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.040
 Please figure that out.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.560
 Yeah, but like, but our name doesn't have to be on it.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.600
 I mean, our name is not tomorrow.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.600
 You know what I'm saying?

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.600
 Yeah.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.600
 I feel like it's too late.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.600
 But I don't know.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.600
 It's too late.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.600
 I mean, you can start over.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.680
 You can like be like, guys, I'm retiring and you come back as someone else and nobody

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.680
 knows it's you.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.680
 I've thought about that.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.840
 I've basically already retired.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.080
 I mean, I haven't streamed or done anything public and upside from this in a while.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.160
 I could just disappear.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.160
 Yeah.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.160
 But then people would know what I look like.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.160
 Okay.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.160
 I grow my hair out.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.880
 I wear glasses all the time.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.800
 I talk about totally different stuff, not tech.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.320
 I'd have to come back in some other field.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.320
 You don't know those arcs.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.680
 Because the players that want to make a problem, the moment anyone from the Ozarks signs up

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.640
 and shows up on tech Twitter, it's you.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.640
 Yeah, it's over.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.640
 Yeah.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.640
 But it goes.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.640
 Okay.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.640
 So I just, I got to go into a new thing.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.640
 I'll just be, I'll get into cooking or something.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.640
 I don't know.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.640
 Are we still calling it Twitter?

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.880
 Are we calling it X?

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.880
 I haven't even thought about this.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:37.080
 I was trying earlier to be all proper and be like X.com and posting and it's hard though.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.480
 I'm going to say Twitter forever.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.200
 I can see myself switching to word posting.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.240
 Something about saying a single letter.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.880
 Yeah, it's weird.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.640
 Like find me on X.com.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.640
 That just sounds dirty too.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.520
 But you're throwing the dick.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.520
 Yeah.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.480
 You can find my profile on X.com.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.840
 It's not even like it redirects to Twitter still, right?

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.760
 Like it's not even the one thing that's remained is the URL is still Twitter.com.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.760
 I think.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.760
 Yeah.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.080
 I feel like they should have done what if they really wanted to do this, just do what Facebook

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.720
 does where they're like Instagram, a Facebook company or what's up, a Facebook company,

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:14.680
 Twitter and X. Like they could still have the X company as this umbrella for Twitter,

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.840
 but still call the product Twitter.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.840
 It is weird to me.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.000
 It's weird to change the name from Twitter after 16, 17 years, whatever it was.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 Yeah.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.420
 Like, but what do I know?

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.920
 You know, I want to challenge it, but it's like, I don't know, I don't have billions

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.920
 of dollars.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.920
 I'm not smart.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.080
 There's a few examples of, I can't remember any of my head right now, but I was looking

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.080
 into this.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.440
 There's a few examples of some giant companies that have went through a name change and then

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.480
 reverted it back a few years later.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.600
 Because it just cause like an irreparable.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.600
 Could that happen?

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.000
 I don't know if it'll happen.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.640
 Literally, my lesson with Twitter is it is literally unkillable, like you can do whatever

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.640
 you want with it.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.640
 Yeah.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.480
 I do wonder like what you would have to do to meaningfully drop usage because I feel like

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.480
 yeah.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.480
 Literally nothing.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.480
 There's nothing you can do.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.480
 I mean, I've not been using it as much, but that's not related to the rebrand.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.480
 Like, that's not slowed me down at all, I guess.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.360
 Like, it's weird to see it on my home screen, the black and white and the X.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.240
 It's a little weird, but it's fine.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.080
 I'm not going to stop using it because of it.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.080
 Did you see the payouts that people have been getting?

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.080
 Yeah.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.160
 The company that I worked for is a rather large Twitter account that gets a rather large number

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.160
 of impressions every month.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.160
 Oh, you guys.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.160
 And it's very interesting.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.160
 Yeah.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.160
 So we'll see.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.960
 We'll get like 150 million a month.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.920
 It's funny because I never thought about company accounts because obviously there's some giant

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.080
 company accounts that are like, that is very interesting.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.080
 Yeah.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.880
 People have been posting how much they're making, it's obviously like really tiny numbers, bigger

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.000
 than you'd expect for just posting on Twitter, but they're bigger than you expect.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.160
 But aren't those, aren't those payouts that I read?

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.640
 They're from like February or something.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.640
 It's like a back page.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.640
 It's not like per month.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.640
 It's not going to be like a monthly thing.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.640
 Yeah.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.640
 Yeah.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.640
 Yeah.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.640
 Yeah.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.640
 Because it wouldn't have made sense to me.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.640
 Some of the numbers I saw, like if people were getting paid that a month, there's no way

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.880
 Twitter's making enough to cover some of those things.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.440
 So it makes sense of it several months.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.440
 Yeah.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.840
 I try to do some calculations.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.080
 It seems like it's a two cent CPM.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.640
 Oh, that's helpful.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.640
 Yeah.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.520
 Wait, M stands for Millie, which is 1,000.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.040
 It just makes no sense to me.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.080
 I guess I'm not into the metric thing.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.080
 I wish I was.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.360
 Well, I was an ad tech, I always thought it's so confusing.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.360
 Yeah.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.120
 So two cents every thousand impressions?

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.120
 Yeah, because the thing is, it's not, it's like so much of an estimate.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:28.560
 I'm just like guessing based off of the things people posted, plus it's not literally, they're

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.640
 not literally paying you for every tweet impression.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.200
 They pay for ad impressions.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.880
 So theoretically a tweet impression correlates ad impressions, but like, I don't know, you

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.960
 might post something that where people read a lot of the comments a lot more than something

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.960
 else.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.960
 Yeah.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.960
 I see.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.960
 And the comments would have more ads.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.000
 So yeah, it's, it's still an approximation, but that's not terrible.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.920
 Like, I think, so I think I, I didn't qualify for it.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:54.200
 I, I think the qualification is you need 15 million impressions over three months.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.200
 I had 13 million.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.200
 So I was close.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.200
 Oh, wow.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.040
 So you're going to be rolling in Twitter cash soon.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.320
 I mean, ex cash, that sounds real dirty.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.120
 I mean, I think I could make like 40 bucks a month based off of my last three months.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.360
 That's pay for your Twitter blue or your ex blue or whatever.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:18.420
 You take out that, that I'm making like 30 bucks a month, which covers your profit.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.360
 What do I, what do I have that cost?

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.360
 Not even a pizza.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.120
 Man, stuff is expensive now.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:29.600
 I actually noticed prices when I travel and like stuff, I, I got Uber eats one night.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.600
 No joke.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.180
 I got Uber eats.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.920
 It was a single entree, okay.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.220
 And okay, maybe a side, an entree and a side, and it was like $72.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.220
 Oh my God.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.200
 I went back and I looked and then they didn't even send me the side.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.600
 They just sent me the office, which I got it refunded, but I, I went through the ticket

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:53.560
 and like, cause I was sending there with friends and it was like, how is one meal, $72?

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.800
 And I went through and it was like the sub total, like the actual food was like $38.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.800
 Yeah.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:04.000
 I was literally like as much money in the four different random fees as well.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Yeah.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 I know.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 I just booked it.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 I just put the flag.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.080
 Cause I'm visiting my parents and granted we booked it really late, which is really stupid.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.480
 And every time we do this, we're like, next time we'll book it early and then we don't.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.480
 Yeah.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.740
 But yeah, like we're going from Miami to New Jersey and it's like over $1,000 round

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.740
 trip.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.740
 Oh, ready for a rant.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:23.740
 Okay.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.640
 Something has happened to flight tickets and I hate it.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:33.040
 So do you guys remember at some points, these, uh, quote, quote, quote, a budget airlines

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.200
 started popping up like spirit frontier.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.700
 I don't know if they have them.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.700
 Allegiant.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.700
 Allegiance.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.700
 Okay.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.700
 So ours is a legion.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.700
 Yeah.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.700
 You said, do you guys remember who else are you talking to?

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.100
 You talking to me?

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.100
 Just me?

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.100
 Just people in our audience.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.100
 Oh, do people that listen?

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.100
 Okay.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.100
 Okay.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.100
 Okay.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.100
 It's actually we have a Twitch chat, whatever.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.100
 That's true.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.100
 Yeah.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.100
 Okay.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:00.340
 Uh, when you would search for flights, their prices would be so much lower than everyone

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:05.120
 else's because every single part of the flight was an add on literally picking your seat

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120
 cost money.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.120
 Yeah.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.120
 You literally have to buy your seat.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.120
 Yeah.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.120
 Yeah.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.120
 Oh, you want to carry a personal item on?

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.120
 That'll be $15.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.120
 Yeah.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.120
 Yeah.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.120
 Yeah.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.120
 Yeah.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.120
 Yeah.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.120
 So okay.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.120
 I was okay.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.120
 Fine.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.420
 It's good to have that option because theoretically, like when I came, when I came to vitzvit, you guys in, uh,

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.420
 where do we go?

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.420
 Saint Pete.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.380
 So that was nice because it was like, we're flying the morning coming back in the evening.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.380
 We were carrying nothing.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.380
 You don't need.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.380
 Yeah.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.380
 So we don't pay for all the extra stuff.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:35.280
 So I liked the option, but of course it's like this game theory scenario where now all

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.740
 the other airlines are like, wait, what the hell?

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.540
 Like they're always showing it was the cheapest option.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.780
 So now all the airlines are doing this.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:46.420
 So now when I'm trying to book this flight, none of the prices were real.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.660
 Every single airline, I tried every single airline.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.180
 They have just a crazy amount of fees tacked on and it was probably almost twice as expensive

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.460
 when you could actually check out.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.340
 So just like the world is worse now.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.340
 Yeah.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.980
 How do you, is that something that can be combated?

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.980
 Like, can there be legislation that's like final price of anything?

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.980
 I don't care what it is.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:13.020
 Plain tickets, Uber Eats can't be more than 75% of the thing or something.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.740
 Can we, can we put some limits here?

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.580
 This is like a big part of having our system work.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.060
 Like you need to be able to discover prices, discover accurate prices easily.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.420
 It's like the key thing you need to have like a capitalist system work.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.420
 So this is like completely eroding that.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:32.660
 So yeah, I think this is one of the areas I'm like pretty like not into regulation generally,

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.180
 but this is a place where I'm just like, you need, you can't just have people making up

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.180
 prices that have no correlation to what people actually get.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.140
 Yeah, there's got to be some penalty for that.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.140
 I would thank you.

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.140
 Yeah.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.300
 So yeah, it's a booking plane ticket.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.300
 It's just garbage now.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.940
 So yeah, we ended up paying so much for this, this trip.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.940
 Yeah.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:54.460
 I'm used to having to pay a lot for flights because it from Springfield, we connect anywhere

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:59.540
 we go, which means, I don't know, it's not double, but it's like, I think my flights are

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.540
 generally more expensive.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.820
 I can remember being on the West Coast for a while when we're fundraising and it's like,

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.220
 oh, flights are so cheap.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.620
 Like I can fly somewhere for $150.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.620
 That's a thing.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.620
 Yeah.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.460
 I mean, New York to Miami, I've gotten for $150.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.460
 That's crazy.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.460
 Yeah.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.460
 Not in New York.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:21.620
 We paid like five or 600 round trip for each of us this time, but yeah, it's painful.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.820
 Wait, so you just went to New York?

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.820
 No, I'm going.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.820
 I'm going this weekend.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.140
 Oh, you're going this weekend.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.140
 So you bought the tickets.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.140
 What are you doing in New York?

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.140
 Why?

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.140
 Why is this going to Jersey?

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.380
 We're actually not going to New York, but my parents live in New Jersey.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:35.260
 So we're going to just visit them for a weekend.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.740
 They're doing like a little thing.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:41.460
 Let's just parents are actually going to are you going to stop by your, your, your apartment?

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.460
 Check it out.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.460
 Make sure everything looks.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.460
 I mean, someone that's there.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.460
 Yeah.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.460
 Yeah.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.460
 Hey, I'm just in town.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.460
 I thought I'd check out the place.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.460
 Make sure everything's in your bed for a little while.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.460
 Just for the memories.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:56.380
 Could I just maybe, I'll say about a couch even, man, it was hard to leave that apartment.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.500
 Like we just had so many memories in it.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.900
 So when we were leaving, it was, it was hard, but then it felt hard.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:08.500
 And then the tenant wanted it painted a different color that she, they were like painting it

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.500
 as we were leaving.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.500
 Yeah.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.500
 Yeah.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.500
 And it wasn't hot.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.500
 It was not a good color.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.500
 It's so much easier to leave.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.500
 We're like, okay.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.500
 This just isn't our apartment anymore.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.500
 So it was a lot easier.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.500
 That helps.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.500
 Yeah.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.500
 I don't have a lot of childhood nostalgia anymore because our house burned down.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.500
 Oh, really?

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.500
 After we, after we had already left, I got struck by lightning and burned around.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.500
 Oh, my God.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.500
 Yeah.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.260
 So it's kind of symbolic of like, there goes my childhood.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.940
 It's all in the past now.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:36.020
 I can't go back and visit, can't like, it's just like there's a new house there.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.020
 And it's kind of wild.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.100
 Were people living in it when it got to the lightning?

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:43.460
 They were all fine, but, but yeah, we had a neighbor get struck by lightning.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:49.060
 Uh, in this neighborhood, like, not them, their house, and it blew a huge hole in the

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.060
 roof.

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.060
 And it was like in the middle of rainstorm.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.060
 So obviously that's problematic.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.740
 Uh, but he owns a roofing business.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:57.060
 So we had like people over pretty fast and like they were patching it with stuff, but

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.220
 they just put a tarp or whatever.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:03.340
 But he, he described it as like, when they were in the house when it happened, like sockets

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:07.700
 blew out of the walls, like electrical sockets shot out of the walls in their upper room where

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.940
 it hit the ceiling.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.900
 Just some wild stuff that sounds very terrifying.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.980
 Never been really scared, strike that close.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.260
 There's a show called How To With John Wilson.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.740
 It's a incredibly, incredibly weird show.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.420
 Uh, it's on HBO.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.340
 The guy basically he lives in New York.

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:30.940
 And I think every single day of his life, he just goes out with a camera and just walks

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:35.500
 around to like every crevice and corner of New York with the camera on.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.740
 So he basically captures like all this really crazy footage.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:39.740
 Yeah.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:44.740
 So in Hinesight, like create like a narrative to like teach you something about New York.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:49.420
 It's like, it's like exaggerated in a joke, but yeah, it'll be like, you know, trying

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.900
 to find a bathroom in New York, but it's like, and he'll have like a bunch of footage of

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.740
 him, like trying to get to a bathroom, like he'll like narrate stuff and he'll just find

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.820
 all these little clips that go with what he's narrating.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:04.140
 It's incredibly, incredibly well done, but he always ends up in these situations where

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:08.840
 he finds like the weirdest people and somehow he's like in their house and they're talking

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.260
 to all this really weird stuff.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.620
 One of the one of the people I remember was there was a guy again, I don't know if this

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.260
 is true.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:20.020
 The funniest part of the show is he'll be the main topic will be something else.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:24.540
 And he'll somehow come across a person that just has like the craziest story somehow under

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.060
 the place like now relates to the main topic.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.380
 So I remember the topic was, but he randomly wanted to talk to a guy about something very

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.380
 normal.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.300
 And the guy was like, Oh, yeah, I got struck by lightning twice.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.700
 And he explains how he was like sitting in his bed on the phone and it like came through

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.520
 the wire and like blew him off this bed at the ceiling.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.100
 And he talked about like how long it took for him to like go through physical therapy

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.300
 and recover and whatever.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:54.300
 And then it happened to him again, and I'm just like, what the like, how do you perceive

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.300
 the universe and life after that?

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.300
 Oh, no kidding.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.300
 Have you been struck twice?

00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.300
 Yeah.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.300
 Yeah.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.300
 I mean, it's true.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.380
 Like even ones is insane and like getting hit again.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:09.620
 I do know someone that was struck by lightning and they it's somebody that like older guy,

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.740
 very respectable in the community would not make it up.

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:16.260
 Like I just am convinced he really was struck it was struck in the thigh out in the field

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.260
 doing something.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.260
 I think he had a farm.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.260
 He was fine.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:23.900
 I mean, like, I think he had like a scar and it was obviously like a lot of pain, but

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:24.900
 they can kill him.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.900
 I just thought you start by lightning.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.900
 You're you're gone, right?

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.900
 But apparently not.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.900
 Yeah.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.860
 I've been such crazy lightning here lately and it's so like I said the other day, it's

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.860
 been knocking stuff off of our shelves, like it's out loud.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.420
 And I'm imagining getting used by whatever is making that noise.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.420
 Yeah.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:44.980
 It's like the Voldemort thing, just walk away like Harry Potter.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:45.980
 No big deal.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.060
 That'd be a really cool story to be a like if you could survive being struck by lightning.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.260
 Just think you get to tell that story for the rest of your life.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.260
 That's fun.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:57.220
 So I assumed you only you like can't get hit this thing taller than you around.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.700
 Is that like a stupid myth?

00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.780
 I have no idea.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:04.780
 I mean, it seems like good like a heuristic that you don't want to be the tallest thing

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:05.780
 around.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:06.780
 Yeah.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:12.180
 But how big of a radius like a five foot radius, a half a mile radius, like are you the tallest

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:17.260
 thing in this, you know, I'm saying like if you got hit in a field, that makes sense because

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.300
 maybe yeah, because he's probably the tallest thing around.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:24.380
 But there's probably trees, you know, somewhere and yeah, a hundred yard radius or something.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.380
 We're getting really into stuff.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:26.380
 We don't know anything about.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.820
 Well, I was trying to think like when I was listening to this guy saying I hit twice,

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.420
 I'm like, okay, can this happen to me?

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:38.260
 I'm literally never, I'm literally never around like, I'm never the tallest thing around.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.900
 I'm always surrounded by a bunch of trees that are like a few feet away from me or like

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:44.060
 buildings or something.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:49.100
 When I was in my apartment in New York, I had a really great view of the World Trade Center.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:53.700
 And shortly after I moved in there, I was sitting at my desk, I was like looking outside

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.220
 at night, and I see a lightning bolt hit the top of the World Trade Center.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.580
 Like on the thing, I was like, this is insane.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.740
 Like no one's going to believe I saw this.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.580
 And it turns out it just happens like all the time.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.580
 Super common.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.580
 It's just a thing.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.580
 It's just a thing.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:08.580
 Yeah.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.580
 And that's why they build those, those like little, those things.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.580
 Yeah.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:11.580
 Those rods, they really get used.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.340
 It's not like just in case because I would have thought it was just like a just in case

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.780
 thing, but it's like an active thing you can always get to.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.820
 It's really, there's so many pictures of it too.

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.860
 I was like, this is so rare, but no, it's not.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.860
 It's interesting.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.060
 Like if you're, if you build the tallest building, now the freedom tower, I guess, is the top,

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.140
 is that's the tallest building in New York?

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.140
 Yeah.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.060
 You build the tallest building, like all the other buildings, they can take their lightning

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.060
 rods down.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.060
 It's like, I don't know.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.060
 It's true.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.060
 That one's even struck.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.060
 It's funny.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.060
 Only the top one needs it.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.060
 Yeah.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.060
 Yeah.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.140
 Don't, don't, don't, like don't count on that, I guess.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.140
 Stay safe people.

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.140
 I don't.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.140
 Yeah.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.140
 I mean, the Empire State Building still has its thing.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.020
 It looks, it looks naked when you remove it, you know, it's like it's designed with that

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.020
 in purpose.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.020
 Yeah.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.020
 Mind for sure.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.020
 It's funny about New York.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:58.040
 And I guess a lot of major cities is like the whole thing where you can have like a

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:03.500
 fantastic view and then someone just builds a bigger building and you're now looking at

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.500
 a wall.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.500
 The side of a building?

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.500
 Yeah.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.500
 Yeah.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.500
 That's like such a crazy dynamic to me.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.820
 And there's like these air rights and like people arguing over in.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.820
 Are there, are there any other major buildings going up in Manhattan?

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.860
 Like is there any skyline altering towers that you're aware of?

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:23.660
 Yeah, there's, there's, there's pretty much always a few.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:24.660
 They don't build them.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.660
 Okay.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.540
 So lately what they've been doing, they've been building really skinny buildings that

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.540
 are super, super tall.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.660
 So like the traditional buildings you think of in New York, like they're just massive

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:35.660
 in every direction.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.660
 Yeah.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:37.660
 Yeah.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:38.660
 Yeah.

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.660
 Exactly.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.660
 Big, big powers.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.660
 Yeah.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.060
 But now they're like buying smaller plots of land and just building these things where you're

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:45.860
 just like, how is that?

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.860
 It seems unsafe.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.860
 Yeah.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:48.860
 That does not seem safe.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.860
 Yeah.

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.540
 Like the world's most expensive apartment is in one of these buildings overlooking Central

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:57.020
 Park and it is just so narrow.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.380
 Like every floor is a whole apartment.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.380
 And that's it.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.380
 Oof.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.380
 Don't love that trend.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.380
 Yeah.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:04.380
 And they sway.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.380
 It's true.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.380
 They do sway.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.380
 Yeah.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.340
 Even the bigger, like the bigger ones, like the freedom tower, is it swaying?

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.340
 Yeah.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.260
 I mean, you stand to the ground and look up and you can see them sway and you think this

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.260
 is not the illusion.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.260
 And it's like, no, it's not.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.300
 It's actually not an optical illusion.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.300
 It's.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.300
 It's awful.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.300
 I, I don't do cities.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.900
 That's why I live in the woods.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:22.900
 Neosarks.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.900
 Yeah.

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:24.900
 Yeah.

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:25.900
 Yeah.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:29.580
 This, I mean, it's funny because this, this show that I was just talking about, I like

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:34.860
 watching it because I'm like, Oh, I can reminisce about living in New York, but he just makes

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.660
 it look so disgusting.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:40.940
 Like he just makes it because it's a comedic and exaggerated and I'm like, did I really

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:41.940
 live there?

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:42.940
 Like that is so gross.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:43.940
 I mean, it is disgusting.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.740
 Just from an outside perspective, every time I go to New York, compared to any other

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.740
 city.

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:48.820
 It's so grimy feeling.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:52.660
 I just feel like when I get out of the streets of New York, I've been like coded in something.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.740
 I don't know if it's car exhaust, whatever it is.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:01.340
 It's weird because my entire time living in New York, growing up in New Jersey, visiting

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.500
 New York, I never once felt gross.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.020
 Like people are always like, it's gross and it smells like garbage.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:11.460
 I just literally don't know what they're talking about, but I know it's a me thing because when

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:16.180
 I walk around and try to notice it, I'm like, Oh shit, there's like literally trash everywhere.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.140
 It smells like trash.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.900
 You can see trash.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:21.900
 Yeah.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:22.900
 Yeah.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.820
 In the summer, like the heat and the trash day and like, yeah, I can see why people say

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:30.060
 it smells like trash, but I don't know if I've ever been there in the winter.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.460
 I think I've only ever been there in hot months and it was sweltering and like, I'm wearing

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:38.220
 a button up shirt, like a collared shirt for the only time in my life because I'm in New

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.940
 York for some reason and it's just disgusting.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:45.020
 And yeah, I just feel like there's like a layer of something caked on my skin that I

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.660
 can peel off in the hotel.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.660
 It's gross.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:51.260
 And the hotels are tiny, like that's, that's not a normal hotel room.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:57.100
 It's like a Sheraton or whatever, but what it's like half of a room, if that paid the

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.100
 same price.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.100
 Super annoying.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.100
 There is.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.580
 So I think it's hard to experience this specific thing unless you live there, but there's

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.860
 a single day every year that everyone knows about this.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.580
 Everyone knows that their nose.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.500
 When I describe, they know what they're going to know what I'm talking about.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.980
 It's in the spring, basically, you have like the worst months of your whole life because

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.140
 it's freezing, dark, cold, winter.

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:20.660
 Everyone hates everything.

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:26.680
 Then there's this day that shows up and it's like the first nice day and yeah, it's like

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:32.540
 literally it feels like this is like what heaven would literally feel like everyone cuts out

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.220
 from work at 3 p.m.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.660
 Everyone just outside.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.620
 There's people on skateboards, like people are holding flowers for some reason.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.620
 It's happy.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.340
 I think there's like music playing in the background somehow.

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:48.980
 It's just like this magical day where it's like the perfect weather and it's like the

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:53.780
 first sign that the misery of winter is over.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:58.620
 And that is like New York is incredible in that zone, like in that spring, spring time

00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.820
 when things are warming up.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:00.820
 Yeah.

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.940
 But yeah, most people, I don't think it's like hard to, it's like unlikely you would

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.900
 have traveled in that, in that exact window.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:06.900
 That little window.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.900
 Yeah.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.900
 We have that in the Ozarks too, by the way.

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:13.340
 We have that first day when things, it's like everything is blossomed overnight and

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.660
 everything is amazing.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:19.380
 And then like the next week it's 95 and 100% community, like we get no spring or fall.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:23.380
 They're like a week long where there's really nice weather and then it's crazy again.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.780
 It's just, we get the extremes.

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.780
 Yeah.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.700
 New York spring and fall are people's favorites.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:33.180
 I actually like the summer too, just because it's like, I like don't mind the heat.

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.420
 But yeah, spring and fall are people's favorites and they do lassawa and also that the trees

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:41.620
 changing color and New York has a good amount of trees, we've are not.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.340
 So it does change the vibe of the whole city when it's a fall.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.340
 Yeah.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.740
 Like yeah, I guess Central Park, that's a bunch of deciduous trees, they're turning colors

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:50.740
 in the fall.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:51.740
 That's nice.

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:52.740
 Yeah.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:55.420
 I never liked the fall because I hate winter so much and to me fall as a first sign that

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.420
 winter's around the corner.

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:58.580
 I love fall so much.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:03.220
 I think I thought like it was a trope to love fall but I just, I get very excited toward

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.760
 the end of summer because fall is probably my favorite.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:12.620
 I think the thing about fall, I get what you're saying, I don't like the dead of the winter

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:17.020
 but after fall, you've got all the holidays, like you've got Thanksgiving and Halloween

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:21.780
 and Christmas and like, to me, that's a very exciting time of year, especially with kids.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.180
 The fall is just like this warm up.

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.180
 It's really nice.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.660
 It's like things cooling off.

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:30.620
 We're doing stuff with pumpkins and we're decorating with oranges and reds.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:31.620
 It's a good time.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:34.860
 It's really pretty here in the Ozarks, like the color of the trees are nice.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:35.860
 Yeah.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.220
 I mean, now that you're describing it, I'm like, oh, that does sound really nice.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.700
 I'm like getting all these memories.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:40.700
 Yeah.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.700
 Warm drinks, like cider.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.700
 Yeah.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:43.700
 Yeah.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:44.700
 Good time.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.700
 But here's the thing.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.700
 This is not going to be a thing for me anymore.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.180
 I grew up the whole, my whole life on the northeast where this is a thing.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.180
 You've got no seasons.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.380
 And now, yeah, it's funny though.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.620
 Liz always complains about this.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:43:00.660
 She's like, the prop, she's like, the northeast has a monopoly on, I don't know which is, it's

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:05.220
 either, she says that's either full or like on Christmas or on holidays where everyone

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.820
 does the northeast version of holidays.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:13.580
 So we'll like put up a Christmas tree up here in an environment where like, what the

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.620
 hell is a Christmas tree doing here?

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:20.140
 People will like want to wear sweaters and do like false sweater things.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.580
 But like, that doesn't make any sense here.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:26.660
 So she wishes that we would just like figure out, we can still celebrate the same holidays.

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:31.860
 Like figure out like a more native version of it, but yet a whole world just celebrates

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.860
 northeast Thanksgiving and northeast Christmas.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:35.860
 Yeah.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.220
 Well, I don't consider it northeast when I live in the Ozarks.

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.220
 We get all those seasons.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:40.220
 So I, but sure.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:41.220
 Yeah.

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.220
 That's true.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.220
 We all celebrate New York's holidays.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.220
 That's right.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.220
 Like our pumpkins are turning.

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.220
 Are they like local?

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:49.300
 Because to me, like, like all those like pumpkins and squash and that's a very northeast

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.340
 specific, uh, no, we, we grow all that stuff.

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.340
 Yeah.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.340
 Here in the Ozarks.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.340
 Yeah.

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.340
 There's a huge pumpkin field like two minutes from my house.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.340
 I've already grow it.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:01.500
 Like you can not, you don't see pumpkins, but like the plants, they grow so many pumpkins

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:06.340
 and it's stupid because like they're selling them, but they sell like 10% of them and the

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:08.380
 rest of them just get tilled in the ground for next year.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:13.060
 Like that it's just giant field and then like seriously, they will sell next to none

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.060
 of them.

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:15.060
 So it's kind of.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.060
 I'm always confused by this.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:20.100
 Uh, do they literally just grow them for Halloween or like how much of them are they selling

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.100
 throughout the year?

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.740
 Uh, I mean, like it's not just Halloween.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:27.300
 And I think it's like all the fall season, like we go to pumpkin patches a lot around

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.300
 here.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.300
 Yeah.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.220
 Like that's, so they like, that's a pumpkin patch where you can go pick your own pumpkin.

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:33.700
 Uh, and we eat it.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.020
 We make pies with pumpkins.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:40.100
 Like we do all the stuff you can do with pumpkins and maybe not all the stuff that anyone should

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:41.100
 do with pumpkins.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.100
 I don't know.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.100
 I'm going to start.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.100
 That just sounds dirty too.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.100
 I like pumpkin pie.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.780
 So I'm, I'm a fan of fan of pumpkins.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:49.940
 Oh, pumpkin pie is so good.

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:50.940
 It's the best.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:51.940
 Yeah.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.940
 I do have something called, I haven't been to this because I don't know what it is.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.140
 So I might be making this up entirely.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.980
 I have heard people here in Miami talking about pumpkin patch and the fall they go to

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:02.700
 pumpkin patch in Miami, huh?

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:07.020
 But they're not saying let's go to a pumpkin patch or let's go to the pumpkin patch.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.620
 They're saying we're going to go to pumpkin patch.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.620
 Go to pumpkin patch.

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:10.620
 I'm sorry.

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:15.660
 I'm pretty sure it's just a theme park that is what fall, not really a theme park.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:20.180
 I think it's just kind of like fall themed, like all year round in Miami, you can go to

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.940
 the pumpkin patch theme park and you get a little taste to fall.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:23.940
 That sounds nice.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:24.940
 It's something like that.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.300
 Cause I'm like, there's no, there's like no, I don't think you can grow a pumpkin in

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.300
 this planet.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.580
 Like, I don't think that's a literal pumpkin patch.

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:34.800
 I think it's just some kind of like, not carnival, something, just one of those like little,

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.800
 little things.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.800
 Yeah.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.800
 That sounds fun.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.980
 I have seen this like, was that really, this was in New York.

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:47.740
 It was in, it was a display of like alternative Christmas tree concepts.

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:51.860
 And there was like one, like palm trees, they're, they're so shaped like, they were so shaped

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:56.420
 like Christmas trees, but they were like made out of like, more tropical plants.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:57.420
 Yeah.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.420
 And so it looked really cool.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.340
 And I was like, okay, this is what we should do down here.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:04.580
 We should have these like, they can still be the Christmas tree shaped, like that's iconic,

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.420
 but they don't have to be made out of.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.420
 They don't have to be free.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.460
 We shipped in from the Northeast, strapped to a truck.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:11.460
 It's so sad.

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:16.660
 And it really feels because like in, in the Northeast, we would go to a farm and then cut

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.220
 down the tree, like a tree that was growing.

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:19.220
 Yeah.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.220
 Cut it down.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.220
 Right.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.220
 And I'm sure you guys have done that.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.220
 Yeah.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.220
 But if you're in Miami, you're shipping them in from Canada or something.

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.220
 Yeah.

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.220
 Right.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.620
 In, in Miami, you go, this tent pops up at the parking lot of the Home Depot.

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:34.260
 And there's all these, these trees that there's like pre rafting, like that tree wrap that

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.500
 just looked like it was captured from the wild.

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:37.500
 Oh, trees.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.500
 Yeah.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.500
 Just ship down here and squeeze.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:43.180
 And then you go and you, you like unwrap it in your house and look, it looks, it looks

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.180
 terrible.

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:46.460
 It's a crap, like half the trees missing.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:49.500
 I mean, that's the price you pay for living in a beautiful place like Miami.

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:50.500
 Yeah.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.500
 We just don't get our Christmas trees.

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:52.500
 Like we did.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:53.500
 We did the Christmas tree thing.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.420
 Like two years ago when we were just here for a couple of months.

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:58.260
 And I was like, I don't think I want to do this anymore.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.060
 Like it just felt wrong.

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.220
 That's funny.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.220
 I really got to pee.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.220
 So I think we got to end it.

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.220
 All right.

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.220
 And that was very abrupt.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.220
 I'm sorry.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.220
 I was really enjoying the Christmas Eve banter.

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:10.140
 If I didn't have to pee out, enjoy it so much more.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:11.140
 Can you tell I'm squirming?

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:12.420
 You're just doing the thing.

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:13.420
 All right.

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:14.420
 We'll talk about Thursday.

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:15.420
 Cool.

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.420
 Good to see you.

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:17.420
 See you.

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:42.420
 See you.
