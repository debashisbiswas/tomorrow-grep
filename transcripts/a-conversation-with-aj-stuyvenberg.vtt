WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 So are we going to talk about Adam speedrunning my hobbies?

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:27.200
 How's it going?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.680
 It's great. Thanks for having me on decks.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.040
 I've been wanting to do this for a long time.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.480
 I'm glad that you finally gone through all of the better people

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.360
 and you've gotten all the way down the list to me.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.640
 That's that's awesome.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.800
 Well, you finally did some stuff that was interesting enough.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.880
 You know, it was more you than me.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.480
 You have a new camera set up.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.680
 You look really good.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.080
 Thank you.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.120
 It's the same.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.760
 It's just a web cam, but the microphone is better.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.960
 And I actually did.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.400
 I went out and bought a key light on recommendation of you and others.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.720
 Yeah.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.640
 So I fixed a couple of those things.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.320
 Yeah, the lighting makes a huge difference.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.000
 It can make your camera seem like it's more expensive than it's not.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.720
 For a second, I thought you had maybe like a non-web cam.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.760
 No, just a crappy webcam.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.960
 You know, what it'll never do is make my beard look as good as yours.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.640
 And for that, I'll be jaded forever.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.960
 That's funny.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.400
 Yeah, the mic sounds great too.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.360
 There's a new purchase.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.120
 You got the MV7, right?

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.080
 MV7, yeah.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.720
 It's a I was convinced Theo convinced me on Twitter to do that.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.200
 So so far, I've liked it a lot.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.320
 I've gotten some comments on it.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.560
 I've been told I have to go and just smoke a pack of new ports a day to get that voice level

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.280
 down wherever you want it.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.080
 Yeah, even I feel that way.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.680
 I have a pretty naturally deep voice.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.000
 But Liz's dad, my wife's dad, she, he like smokes a crazy amount of cigars.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.200
 And he's got that like graveliness to his voice, which I'm just like,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.640
 I don't think I'm ever going to have that.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.320
 But it sounds amazing.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.040
 I mean, you don't want it, right?

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.720
 Because it's not a it comes with all sorts of downsides.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.520
 It's kind of worth it.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 I don't know podcast is doing that well.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.920
 It's not that.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.280
 It's just like whenever you're in, of course, it's for recording as I was great.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.400
 But whenever you're in any type of scenario, any meeting, any like,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.480
 anything you just sound way more authoritative and good and people want to hear you talk.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.240
 And I think that had just subtle effects on on everything you try to do.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.320
 So it does make a difference.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.440
 I think so too.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.080
 So are we going to talk about Adam speedrunning my hobbies?

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.880
 Oh, really?

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.080
 Okay, let's let's let's start there.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.040
 Let's talk about your hobbies.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.480
 The thing I wanted to start off with image yesterday is second.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.760
 So for those of you that don't know AJ, I'm going to start off with the weirdest part

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.960
 about him, which is he literally jumps off of bridges.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.600
 And there's plenty of days on Twitter of him jumping off things, backflipping off things.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.360
 So tell us more about why do you do that?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.320
 How did that happen?

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.520
 Just give us a rundown.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.800
 I mean, that's a long story.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.200
 It starts.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.800
 I grew up in a town called Nina, Wisconsin, which is about two miles north of Oshkosh,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.000
 which hosts the single busiest fly in on the planet for a week in July every year.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.680
 It's the busiest airport in the world.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.440
 It's called the Experimental Aviation Association, EAA, fly in.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.080
 It's this giant people who build planes.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.720
 And you can do this.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.360
 Within the rights of you as an American, I think just a just a resident.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.680
 You can build an aircraft in your garage and put a experimental slap and experimental sticker

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.720
 up on the door and just take take it up once you have your pilot.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.200
 So I grew up around aviation and I wasn't clear.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.960
 It was normal to me to have friends that just had planes they built or like family

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.520
 friends, like, oh, you get to go over to Uncle Bob's house.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.280
 He's got a hanger in his backyard where he built this kit plane and just takes it off

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.640
 from his grass field.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.600
 That wasn't typical.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.160
 It wasn't like every single person, but it wasn't abnormal either.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.960
 I'd been in a lot of aircraft before I was 18.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.880
 And I always wanted to do it, but it's super expensive.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.280
 And the cheapest single cheapest way to get into aviation is to skydive.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.320
 So I got into that around 2010.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.200
 I got my license and then I did a bunch of jumps for like two summers and then

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.440
 had the opportunity to learn to base jump there.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.320
 So people I did it and there's this bridge you can go to in Idaho,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.440
 where it's legal year round.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.920
 It's free.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.480
 You just show up jump jump over the railing and jump.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.640
 And yeah, it's a parachute kit that you just you could you can get.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.320
 And you can just go and learn and do this thing.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.040
 So I started doing that in November 2012 and had the pleasure of doing that ever since.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.280
 Nice.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.000
 How like dangerous of a thing is it?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.240
 Right.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.160
 So the safety of base jumping I think is is a little skewed towards more dangerous because

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.920
 not every jump is reported, but every accident becomes news.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.080
 So there are there are you can jump anything tall enough.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.520
 There are people that like I have a friend that owns a cell tower and runs a rural

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.560
 internet company in Minnesota.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.760
 And I probably have a dozen two dozen jumps off of that tower.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.720
 Wow, because it's you know you just climb it and jump it and it's his.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.200
 And there's no there's no organization.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.680
 There is no governing body.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.880
 There's no licensing program.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.760
 So there's not a reporting structure nationally or internationally that reports this.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.000
 There are very popular places to jump in the world.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.960
 In the lot of room in Valley of Switzerland is extremely popular and they're several times.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.080
 Northern Italy has a lot of great spots and they have some organization and they have some

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.160
 reporting, but that is just like these small bits.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.160
 There is just no you know body that collects information on how many jumps are done.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.600
 So it's all speculative.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.480
 But yeah, I've had the pleasure of having eight hundred and seventy some bass jumps.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.000
 I've never been around.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.200
 I splinted a couple legs and helped carry people out.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.560
 But otherwise have been have been pretty safe.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.120
 And there's a lot.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.200
 I mean, it's risk management.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.200
 I think anytime you look at the stunts or these you know,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.480
 bass jumps or YouTube, it seems like it's completely wild and out of control.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.680
 But you're not seeing all the preparation that goes into it.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.960
 And you're not necessarily understanding how the systems are engineered to keep you safe.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.440
 Nice.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.960
 Which I think is like that's one of the coolest parts about this board is just how

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.880
 simple the system is engineered to be.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.000
 And as a software engineer, I think you're like primed to appreciate it.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.480
 Yeah.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.960
 Because there is not a part of that kit that isn't necessary.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.760
 And there is only like every single part is designed for a specific purpose.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.680
 It's designed to be bomb proof.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.360
 It's designed to never fail or if it does fail fail obviously.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.000
 So you check it.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.440
 You know, you catch it in a gear check.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.040
 Things are color coded.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.320
 Things are ordered.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.480
 I think there's a check process.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.960
 Manufacturers have collaborated on ways to ensure that the safety is sort of built into the systems.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.400
 And it's just like a really interesting it interesting from a technical standpoint

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.640
 achievement for for the systems to be just so light so small and so simple.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.720
 And so they're like extremely linear.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.120
 Yeah.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.080
 That's the way I would explain it.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.360
 Yeah, that's very cool.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.360
 What do you think of the the new stunt and the mission impossible movie from this year?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.560
 I'm sure you've seen it.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:00.000
 Yeah, I have Tom Cruise is a sort of legendary in both acting, of course, but also in the sport.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.200
 He has a Scott having license.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.360
 He has his private pilot license.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.920
 He has a helicopter or rotary aircraft certificate.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.920
 He can he kind of does everything.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.200
 He's an avid jumper too.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.360
 Like he takes it seriously and does a lot of jumps.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.200
 Mostly, I think in the large Arizona drop zone.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.200
 But for the for the most part, you know, he did it for sure.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.720
 Like and you could tell they were like their insurance company is probably sweating.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.680
 And he's sort of sitting down there.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.520
 He's like, yeah, you know, I could I could go again.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.640
 I could go again.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.240
 Yeah, they did it a few times, right?

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.040
 Yeah, probably.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.480
 And I'm sure like there's like a behind the scenes interview where the director's like,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.040
 yeah, we got a ton.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.520
 We got he's like, no, no, no, I want to like we're going to go again.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.600
 And that's exactly what any base jumper would do.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.520
 They're like, I'm going to just press the fun button.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.800
 There's like a little dopamine button.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.960
 And Tom Cruise is walking over to the wall and he's just pressing that dopamine button

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.520
 as his entire staff and crew and insurance company.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.120
 I'm sure are just sweating and holding their head and freaking out every time.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.200
 He's like, no, no, no, like let's go again.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.040
 Really impressive.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.280
 So for those of you that haven't seen the that haven't seen the movie,

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.600
 he basically rides a dirt bike off of a ramp of a cliff.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.080
 Then he like separates from the dirt bike and then pulls a shoot.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.640
 And yeah, he did it a few times, which is, which is crazy.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.800
 And I think that was a crazy stunt.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.560
 I think for me, the craziest one will still be when he's strapped to the side of the plane.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.440
 When it's taking off.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.200
 Oh, yeah, that's wild.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.560
 Yeah, like he's strapped in.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.240
 So he's not really too much in control of anything,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.160
 but I cannot think of anything.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.000
 Has anyone ever done that before?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.480
 Just like how many people on earth have had that experience of like knowing what it's like

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.440
 to be on the side of the plane?

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.360
 It's just taking on more than you'd think.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.360
 Oh, yeah, because it's more than you think, okay.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.600
 So when you're skydiving, you have to get out of the aircraft.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.160
 That's true.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.920
 The large planes have jump doors, but I grew up jumping like a Cessna 172 or I think it was

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.520
 206, 208, the small Cessna where you have to open the door and climb out.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.200
 And then you're holding out of the strut.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.680
 So you're in the prop last year behind the prop,

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.520
 and you're just getting, you know, you're holding onto it.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.080
 And you have to get clear of the aircraft and then also know where you're above the ground,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.200
 where you drop because you're not making a lot of horizontal progress,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.640
 even in a wing suit, compared to where you can be in an aircraft.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.840
 So you have to kind of know all this and pick your spot and then climb out.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.800
 So holding on is a little easier than you think, but you're just gripped with fear.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.320
 Yeah, it's true.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.120
 You've got that like, you know, strength where you're like,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.520
 I'm never letting go until the jump master is looking at me like,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.960
 you go now, okay.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.840
 Yeah, it's in that scene.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.880
 I was like, oh, well, the nice part is he's never thinking about acting

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.800
 because I'm sure his face is just reflecting exactly what he needs to be saying.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.360
 Yeah.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.120
 Yeah, I have no, I mean, it must be terrifying to be outside of the aircraft on takeoff.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.840
 I've never done that.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.280
 That's like totally unsafe.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.320
 The parachutes don't work below a certain height,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.680
 especially skydiving parachute.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.400
 So I, you know, that would be freaky from like an equipment standpoint.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:46.880
 Yeah.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.680
 Do you think he had a parachute on when he was doing that scene?

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.680
 No, they had a cable up the arm, but I can tell you from personal experience,

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.480
 I am a terrified person by like cliff edges without a parachute.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.200
 Yeah, me too.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.880
 And then I put this stupid little backpack on and then I'm happy to just walk over

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.600
 and like kick a rock over and just stand and be like, oh, it looks good.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.920
 And it shouldn't, it's not right.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.000
 It's like, it's to do this hobby, to do this as an activity.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.240
 You have to like convince yourself that it's totally safe with a parachute,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.960
 even though you know it's not like statistically speaking,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.240
 it's just not a safe activity.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.000
 But that same mentality that gets you to jump off the edge makes you think you're

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.440
 invincible with the backpack on. And I do think that's interesting.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.600
 Because if I did slip and fall, I would get very badly hurt or killed.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.920
 You know, you need to have a good exit.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.560
 You need to push hard.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.680
 You need to present your body such that the parachute opens away

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.520
 from the cliff or the object you're jumping off of.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.160
 There are all these things you have to do to do this safely.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.760
 But that mentality of like, okay, I can just walk up to the edge and just like

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.600
 peer down off a cliff.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.520
 I think I think it like does you disservice actually, but it's required, right?

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.280
 Yeah, it's very cool.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.120
 Yeah, I've always like heard about this.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.440
 I never really known anyone that was so deep in it.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.600
 There's a bunch of great drop zones in Florida, too.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.880
 You should give it a shot.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.080
 The one thing you're going to miss out on.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.680
 Yeah, Scott, I have to land.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.880
 Uh, wait, Daedland?

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.640
 Like D-A-D land?

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.000
 No, D-E-L-A-N-D.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.880
 Oh, got it.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.160
 Has a really big drop zone.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.560
 Nice.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.400
 Well, I'm assuming these are all, well, hang on.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.920
 You're talking about Scott, I think you're based jumping.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.640
 Scott, I don't think there's a lot of buzzies.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.440
 Say the highest point in Florida is like 300 feet.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.240
 Yeah, yeah, it's just flat, flat and marshy.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.320
 Yeah, so it'd have to be like office LTA or something.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.360
 So you were saying that Adam is speedrunning through your hobbies.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.640
 What did you mean by that?

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.680
 In high school, I started jujitsu in mixed martial arts.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.720
 I liked jujitsu a lot more because I didn't like getting hit in the face.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.360
 I did one amateur MMA fight.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.920
 I won, and then I was like, I don't know if this is for me.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.560
 So I went back to just the jujitsu thing.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.560
 I got a blue belt, and then I was in school,

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.080
 so I had to kind of put it aside for a while.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.840
 And then that next summer I picked up skydiving.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.560
 So that's like, I'm waiting for Adam to be like, I'm done.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.560
 The jujitsu thing, but the skydiving thing.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:00.960
 Yeah.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.400
 I'm going to check that out, you know.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.240
 His brother is a pilot, so yeah, he set up well.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.440
 And there is nothing stopping you.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.480
 Well, there's a couple of rules,

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.560
 but nothing really stopping you from leaving that aircraft.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.000
 I mean, so I had a friend that built a powered parachute

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.280
 and the way these systems work,

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.880
 they are the scariest piece of amateur aviation you've ever imagined.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:24.400
 It is nothing more than a go-kart and a fan and then a skydiving tandem parachute

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.120
 over it.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.560
 And there's a video on YouTube of it.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.000
 And one of the interesting things about about baseraming parachutes

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.600
 is they can generally be configured two ways.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.240
 They can be configured for jumping off of really low stuff.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.760
 And then the parachute is packed to open as fast as absolutely possible.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.520
 They can be configured for jumping a terminal velocity

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.040
 out of like a high aircraft or off of a cliff or with a wing suit.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.840
 And in that case, you have to pack it so that it deploys slower.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.320
 Otherwise, you could really get rocked and damage the equipment in yourself.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.240
 And I'm coming up on this little powered tricycle.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.560
 The thing is shaking, he can't get it trimmed right.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.200
 So it's barely climbing and we're like coming up kind of to power lines,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.800
 where maybe, you know, 80, 90 feet in the air trying to gain altitude.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.040
 And all I'm thinking is, why did I pack this for a high jump?

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.960
 Why did I configure this?

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.000
 Because now I can't leave.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.560
 You know, once we're 200 feet up, if I was packed for,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.000
 we call it slider down and slider up.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.720
 If I was packed, slider down or with a reefing device that slows the canopy off,

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.840
 I can jump very low.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.600
 And that is the biggest comfort when you're in somebody's hobby project.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.840
 They built on their farm in their spare time with a BAC of .08.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.360
 You know, the whole time they were building it.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.720
 And that every time I kick myself,

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.400
 when I'm like, why did I convince myself to take the slider up

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.160
 and convince myself I would get altitude?

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.800
 And I'm watching this thing climb so slowly, like, oh, God.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.240
 So yeah, I'm waiting for Adam to speedrun the rest of these hobbies.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.520
 He's going to get a motorcycle next.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.400
 And then he's going to sell that quickly and start skydiving.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.720
 Yeah, the amateur aviation thing is crazy.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.480
 I don't know if you saw that news where these, I think it was two people from Cuba.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:08.080
 They escaped and made it to America with some kind of like powered glider thing that they built.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.880
 And it looked, it looked really cool.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.080
 It like looked really legit, but it was just made out of like motorcycle parts

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.200
 and just like random stuff.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.040
 And they made it all the way here.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.280
 And I was like, you know what, if someone does that, you should just,

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.160
 we should be waiting here with like a citizenship and like a job offer.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.480
 Yeah, I mean, it's crazy.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.120
 Yeah, like the immigration in this country is nuts.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.120
 So I'm I'm in Boston now.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.200
 It was in Minneapolis for the last 10 years,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.760
 which has a lot more general aviation airspace.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.480
 But my wife has a PhD and we we've been together.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.920
 We've been together as long as I've been based jumping.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.560
 So almost 11 years and we got married a few years ago.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.800
 And we're like, she's a PhD.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.680
 She's a master's degree.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.200
 She's working on gene editing at a biotech now, but previously was doing cancer research.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.560
 And we still had to fight the government for like four years to get a green card.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.560
 Yeah, it is really crazy.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.840
 Like it's like, I don't get super involved in political things,

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.520
 but this is one area where I'm just like,

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.080
 I just get so frustrated because there's so many amazing people that want to be here and

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.960
 pay taxes and give it like us more money. And it's just like we make it so hard for

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.320
 our reason when it's so obvious that we should be taking advantage of that and

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.320
 kind of starving our competitors with those people.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.760
 Yeah. And Canada is doing a great job right there.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.120
 Their H1B process like, oh, you were in the lottery, but didn't get it.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.160
 You're automatically approved.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.040
 Yeah, that's insane.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.920
 You're fast-tracked here.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.800
 That's just slow.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.120
 Yeah.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.880
 What a no-brainer, right?

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.760
 For a company like in we're a country that needs people.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.200
 I don't know, I think there's this misconception that we don't need more people.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.400
 We desperately need more people.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.640
 And that is an important thing to do to make that happen.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.640
 But I do like Boston, you know, like it a lot.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.560
 It's nice to be out here.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:50.160
 Like I said, less general aviation, but I pick up new hobbies and I ride my bike a lot.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.080
 And in an office most days, so I'm at home today, but for the most part,

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.360
 I work at Datadog, I'm an engineer, I work on the serverless stuff.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.800
 And I get to go into an office most days, which is nice.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.000
 I know I used to work for a remote company like UDACS.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.360
 And I like that too.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.320
 But sometimes it's nice to just like talk to people in person.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.760
 No, I definitely miss it.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.400
 And I posted the other day about how if I could literally have anything in the world,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.080
 it wouldn't be 100% remote.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:21.680
 Like I would love to just have a place where I can handle my co-workers whenever I wanted to.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.800
 Yeah, let's unpack that.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.600
 Like, what do Jay and Frank think about that too?

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.600
 No, they're all into that as well.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.880
 I think, I mean, the two of them are both in Canada and Toronto.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:37.600
 So Jay works in a wee work every day, and Frank comes in not every single day, but occasionally.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.920
 Yeah, at the end of the day, we're such a small team, and we all like each other.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.920
 So we're just down to hang out.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.200
 So it would be nice.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.760
 Of course, it's not like an extreme where we're in there eight hours a day, every single day.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.000
 But just some of that mixed back in.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.200
 I've always worked at small companies, and I know people think this is bad,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.120
 but a big part of my social life did come from the people I worked with.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.760
 Because at Small Company, you just get really close to people.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.800
 You tend to pick people you could be friends with in terms of who joins the team.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.320
 You hang out, you get pretty close.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.640
 And all the people that I work with and will continue to work with are people that I've just

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.720
 gotten made that leisure with.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.320
 Totally.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.320
 I do like that aspect of it.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.280
 And it's not for everyone.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:31.040
 I tend to mix every part of my life together, I smash work and out of work and all that stuff together.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.560
 People like more clear boundaries.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.200
 But yeah, for me, I definitely miss that.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.760
 Yeah, 100%.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.920
 I really do like having the option to be in an office.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:49.920
 For me, I think Boston is famous for just horrific traffic, but I get to ride my bike or take the train.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.800
 So it's pretty easy.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.640
 And I think you'd set in your tweet.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.560
 You're like, if I could just be walking distance.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.160
 Like I'm a mile and a half or two miles from an office and I could just go in.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.040
 And yeah, it is such a powerful part of my social life.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.000
 I moved here with no friends.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.840
 I didn't know anybody on the East Coast.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:09.920
 And my wife and I both sort of made it a point to try and be super outgoing and super proactive about it.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.720
 And then yeah, a lot of my friends here are coworkers.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.280
 And I really do enjoy that.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:20.720
 I am excited for you to post the demand letter from Frank that says you must move to Toronto.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.320
 You know, 30 days or whatever it is to leave Miami.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.280
 Yeah, that's funny.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:31.600
 But yeah, I do think, so I do, I suspect, and again, I have no evidence for this.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:38.000
 I suspect the next billion dollar startup or the next whatever big tech company is going to be

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 one that was started in person and sort of have that feeling.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.560
 And again, I'm a big proponent of remote work.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.800
 That was a huge, it unlocked a huge part of my career.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.360
 And maybe we can kind of unpack that a little bit.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.360
 So Dax and I used to be competitors.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.400
 I don't know if people know this.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.800
 Yeah, so we talked about your hobbies, which seemed like they would fill up all your time.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.200
 But you also have this side thing where you're a software engineer.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.200
 So everyone's aware.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.560
 Yeah, so yeah, just to tell me a little bit about like your history with that.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.800
 Yeah, I was not a good student, but I did manage to call my way out of school.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.040
 And I left mechanical engineering.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.640
 I think I had like a C average.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.240
 And I was like, I'm going to just do software.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.080
 And I finally was able to like get things together and graduate,

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.000
 started working at a medical device company.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 And I actually liked, I loved the team.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.920
 I loved what the work that they were doing.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:32.160
 But I couldn't love the velocity to build things as quick as I can and ship them.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.680
 And that is just not what you want in an engineer who works on medical device.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.560
 So I quickly moved on and joined a startup that some friends were at in Minneapolis.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.320
 That was awesome.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.920
 That was a formative part of my career.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.920
 I started working on Ruby on Rails tech and that company experience really rapid growth,

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.080
 which I think I credit a lot to my development.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.200
 Both as just like a developer, but also just a person.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.160
 When you go from having whatever it was, like 100 people to 500 people very quickly,

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.000
 it's a big life change.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.680
 And at the same time that company grew, we were approached by, it was a sports tech company.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.240
 We did an amateur athletic registration payment processing background tracks.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:18.240
 If anyone has a kid or volunteers on a sports team, you've probably used this service before.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.840
 And we were then acquired by NBC Sports.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.040
 And they did a very interesting thing.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.720
 They said, "We're going to give you a blank check in three years."

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.560
 And at the end of the three years, we are going to subtract whatever you spend

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.040
 from your valuation and pay everyone out.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.200
 So we didn't have to worry about fundraising.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.880
 We didn't have to worry about making payroll.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.480
 And again, I'm just an engineer here, but wasn't necessarily involved in that.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.360
 But from an engineering standpoint, it allowed the company to go and acquire all of these sports

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.680
 vertical, like small companies that were doing three, five person companies that were doing,

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.360
 like we own gymnastics, we own swimming, we own golf or whatever it was,

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.360
 and sort of bring them into the platform.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.680
 And at the time, the result of that, where we were a PCI compliant shop,

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.880
 which meant we were able to process credit cards directly with merchants.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.800
 And there's a lot of rules and regulation about that.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:12.400
 We also had to bear in mind the legal world of the Child Online Privacy Act,

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.920
 or COPA, which it's a little bit like GDPR for kids in the US.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.480
 That's a horrible summation, but you get the point.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.560
 And hearing all these rules and they were acquiring these companies that just didn't do any of it.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.400
 And we had this incredible operations team that made so much of our jobs easier,

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.560
 and then they were just gone.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.760
 And my VP came to me, he said, "You have a blank check,

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.160
 but I cannot give you an operations team.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.440
 Figure out how to build your product."

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.200
 And that's how I found serverless.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.480
 And started using serverless early on.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.520
 This was probably 2017-ish before when we rolled it out to production.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:53.520
 And I loved it, found it really, really productive, made a bunch of headway,

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.080
 and that's when I learned operations and I learned how to build on the cloud.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.920
 And that picked that up, thought it was great,

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.160
 sort of working on some of the open source aspects of it.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.280
 And a couple of years later, they reached out, like the company,

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.400
 and they had raised a Series A and they wanted to build a platform.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.480
 So I jumped a couple of years after the acquisition with MVC closed,

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.800
 and that's how I started competing against DAX.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.160
 That's working on the serverless framework.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.600
 And I worked on their competitor to CID Run,

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.320
 which was like a CI/CD product for serverless.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.800
 And I know you talk about this a lot, but I do want to bring up the point.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.680
 We had, I think, some of the same problems that you didn't have,

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.400
 because you were bootstrapped and we were VC.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.640
 So we had growth, we had revenue, we had users,

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.520
 but it just isn't out of velocity that would necessitate

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:45.120
 venture capital, multiples on exit, which made it hard to pursue.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.120
 But I think for you and Jay and Frank,

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.560
 you can use it to extend your own runway with three people

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.440
 and build out what you really want to work on while you have this other product

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.120
 that sort of creates some cash.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.880
 And I think that is key to anyone who's maybe out there thinking

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.160
 about starting their own thing on the side or working on their own

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.760
 kind of "lifestyle company" sort of startup.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.120
 That is a really big opportunity and a really, really important thing to look at is,

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.040
 can you do something you don't want to do long term,

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.880
 but just long enough to pay the bills so you can work on the thing you actually want to do long term?

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.640
 Yeah, exactly. Getting to a point of sustainability.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.960
 Before we talk about that, I want to go back for a second.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.000
 So it sounds like, so do I understand this, right?

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.120
 Like some of the compliance burden is what pulled you into serverless?

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.000
 Because that's exactly how I got in there as well.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.960
 It was two parts, right?

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.400
 First, the compliance burden where it's like we have to adhere to these rules in this AWS account,

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.640
 so I can't just stand up a VM and call it a day.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.200
 That is a big part of it.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.360
 The other part was just my operations team was so busy bringing these other companies into compliance

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:47.520
 that I didn't have time for them to, at the time we were on Chef and OpsWorks.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.600
 And I didn't have time for them to, like they didn't have time to stand up new services for me

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.520
 or to run the operations for it.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.080
 So that's when we went on call for our own services.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.440
 We owned our own production deployments, our own pipelines, kind of the end-to-end process.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.640
 I think for some folks, it's hard to imagine a time before DevOps.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.920
 But there truly was like a wall between Dev and Ops.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.760
 It was like different rooms, different people.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.760
 You would just build the code and even with GitHub, we would put like a label on it.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.680
 That would say, this is ready to be deployed.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.200
 And then some time later, someone would deploy it and then you would just get,

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.560
 if it broke something, you would get paged or then you would get brought in.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.000
 And they would be like, we reverted your code.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.720
 It wasn't very good.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.760
 So the DevOps thing was really taking off about then.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:34.160
 And that's now we're in a world where any, virtually any large tech company

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.080
 you're expected to run your own services for the most part outside of some core things.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.840
 And that I do think has been good for the industry.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.680
 It's like a point of mature maturation.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.280
 And it also helps people really understand what they're building and the impact it has

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.440
 versus like, oh yeah, it's ready.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.520
 I'll just hit the merge button and see what happens.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.920
 Yeah, it's funny because even at a lot of modern-ish companies,

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:06.720
 I was at a company where I was kind of surprised to find that wall was still pretty strong.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.960
 They still called it DevOps.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.440
 And it wasn't so extreme of like literally like you had no idea I was deployed,

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.560
 but it was close to that.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.800
 Like people were very good.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.600
 And this company was using Elixir for everything.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.880
 They were very, very good at using Elixir and the Phoenix framework and all of that.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.760
 But they had no idea what happened once it left and went into production.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:33.680
 And I found that really odd because from my entire career, it's like how it runs in production

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:39.200
 impacts like how I build the application and like things I can take advantage of.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.800
 So yeah, there still is that wall and it's weird.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:49.760
 I think that's why maybe a lot of people don't understand or like don't appreciate

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.080
 some of the value of serverless like so similar to me, similar to you, I was in the healthcare

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:58.080
 space for a while and we were running Kubernetes and our own containers and all of that.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:04.000
 And every time we signed a new client, I had the fun task of filling out a 30-page security

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.960
 questionnaire asking all kinds of crazy stuff like what kind of antivirus do you run on your

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.240
 on your VMs and like and is just a huge pain.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:17.120
 Time sucks such a waste and like my least favorite part of the job by far.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:24.320
 Then I realized, oh, you know, if I literally don't have access to the underlying infrastructure,

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.960
 nobody can ask me those questions.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.320
 And that was what like pulled me into serverless where I was like, okay, if I build my things

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.960
 in this way, the right answer for every single question is not my problem, not my problem,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.920
 not my problem.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.320
 Managed by provider, I think is the key.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.400
 It's like you get to write MSP like manage service provider and then dash and then AWS.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:42.880
 Yeah.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.080
 And that's just such a flex.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.440
 You're just like, oh, I'm done with that.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.240
 Yeah, exactly.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.240
 So I was like, if I'm going to keep building something compliant in compliance spaces,

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.400
 which is actually not even that uncommon.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:58.080
 Like everyone kind of eventually ends up there because even if you're not directly in health care,

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.920
 you now have a customer that's in health care and they like want to make sure.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.800
 And now you are.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.840
 Yeah, exactly.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.640
 So you eventually.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.480
 Yeah, we're stuck to compliance, right?

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.760
 Like, oh, you got to be stuck too.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.200
 You got to be, you know, FedRAMP or there's a billion of those.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.960
 Contrary to popular belief in the Forbes 30 under 30 list,

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.600
 ignoring the law does not make you immune from it.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.440
 Yeah.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.360
 Well, it does up until a certain point, but so people start looking into like, wait,

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.560
 what's actually going on here?

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.320
 And at that point, it's like, yeah.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.760
 So that's, that's what pulled me into.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.760
 And I found all these, all these other benefits as well.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.480
 And yeah, it's been crazy how long you've been doing.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.960
 So I really, I got pulled into it maybe in like 2019 while I was at this

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.200
 Elixir company just because I was bored of Elixir and this compliance thing I was thinking about.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.320
 And yeah, it's been awesome.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.920
 So I met AJ in person at AWS reinvent.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.120
 And it was the first time we met in person.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.560
 Maybe the only time I'm in person.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.200
 And 80s, which has been doing this stuff for so long.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:59.280
 And whenever I have like a question about some weird obscure thing about how Lambda works

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.240
 or how is any AWS thing works on the hood, 80 is the person I ask.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.760
 And it's been amazing to have them as a resource.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.840
 Now you even like responded questions in our, in our Discord, which we definitely appreciate.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.280
 I mean, I love SSD.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.480
 It like, it's a great tool.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.280
 And I think everyone is considering or, or wants to experiment.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.040
 Building an AWS should, should try it out.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.280
 So I'm happy to answer questions there.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.360
 And I, you know, answer questions on my own blog.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:25.520
 I'm exploring and experimenting with the idea of, of streaming while I work on some other things.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.240
 So I'm happy to announce on this podcast that my RFP for a talk at reinvent was accepted.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:30.640
 Nice.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.080
 Thank you.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.680
 I'm going to be talking about Lambda and cold certs and initialization.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:41.760
 And I'm running kind of a suite of benchmarks and working closely with, with other people

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.920
 at Datadog and also a couple of people at AWS to answer some of those questions that I have.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.560
 And then we're going to be, you know, putting together, together this talk.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.160
 So I'll be there.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.280
 I'm pretty excited about it.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:51.920
 Nice.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.480
 Yeah.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:52.880
 Yeah.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.600
 But the serverless space, I mean, yeah, we, you know, I think we'd interacted a lot

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.520
 online before we met in person.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.960
 And I do think serverless is at an interesting jumping off point where it's still possible to do

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.920
 that, but it is sort of eating the world.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.280
 I mean, I think in our Datadog state of serverless report last year, we shared that like 50% of

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.360
 organizations have adopted serverless at some point in their stack, which makes perfect sense

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.360
 because it feels so many gaps in ways that you don't have to like be, you know, own the entire

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:28.240
 operationalization of the tool, you can just sort of run it and it just executes.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.960
 So I do think that there's just a ton of value there.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:38.000
 I also think that there are a whole number of folks getting into software development and

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.200
 learning serverless first.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.840
 That is really great.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.960
 And I'm really happy to see that.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:48.320
 I do think people struggle with some of the distributed systems rules that govern the world

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:48.880
 we work in.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.960
 And I think that's funny because I think both of both you and I have kind of distributed systems

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.520
 backend background before we got into serverless.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:01.840
 And I do think that has helped me a lot in my like journey and over the over the years,

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.320
 even though I have been working in the serverless space for so long, but it operates on the same

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.880
 fundamental principles, right, you have to build in item potency.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.560
 You have to handle race conditions.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.840
 You have to handle retries.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.760
 You have to handle things like either load shedding or just graceful failures.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.280
 Like what happens if the service is down?

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:23.200
 And that part I think is really like that's just like an important part to learn.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.840
 If you're going to pick up serverless to understand that you are in a world of multiple systems

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.880
 running in concert, which is like a really horrible thing to learn.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.760
 If you're just coming straight from, okay, I'm going to build this app on my computer

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.560
 and then just deploy it.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.480
 But once you get past that, yeah, it's such a force multiplier, isn't it?

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:40.640
 Yeah.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.400
 Like it's so much leverage you have.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.600
 Yeah, it's fine.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:48.480
 The thing I point out all the time is so prior, I was doing Elixir and Elixir has a really

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.760
 incredible concurrency and distribution, just primitives that you can use.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:59.920
 So taking a task and running it in parallel is very natural in Elixir.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.080
 You can run across most of the machines, et cetera.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.200
 And I thought that was great.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.440
 But whenever you did that, whenever you did like, I'm going to run this parallel,

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:13.600
 you set a limit of some mental, you had some mental sense of like this has to have a limit

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.880
 because I've only provisioned for servers.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.280
 And I know that I can't just be like, okay, run this at like a million X concurrency.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.440
 So like you like kind of had that, but they were still a cap of like,

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.800
 okay, if I want to go up those other ghost and another server joins the cluster, et cetera.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.360
 And once I moved into the serverless world, that's only became an option where I'm like,

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.640
 this needs to go faster.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.080
 I can run it in parallel.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.240
 I'm just going to do it 100% in parallel.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:43.120
 And it's like, it's crazy how much is just solved by doing that.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:47.280
 Like so many problems are highly parallel and you don't have to worry about optimizing

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.200
 the individual units runtime when you can just run it 100% in parallel.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.920
 And you learn that lesson one time and it becomes your superpower.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.160
 Yeah.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:58.400
 Like if you look for the aspect of a problem you're faced with and you figure out how to,

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:05.600
 in industry parlance, we'd say scale horizontally, but how to do this separately and isolated

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:11.520
 from other transactions you're processing or other jobs you're doing, you can do them independently.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.160
 It's so easy to just rapidly scale them out, especially with something like Lambda.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:21.280
 And I would say the big benefit for Lambda is that they're isolated, guaranteed.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:21.760
 Yep.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.760
 You have this guaranteed isolation where you're going to get this amount of CPU and this amount of

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.480
 memory. And beyond that, you don't have to worry about the noise and neighbor problem

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:35.920
 affecting your individual request. So if you have 100 requests and the server starts to slow down

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:42.560
 in a normal load balanced container application, one request is going to affect 99 others.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:46.560
 However, in Lambda, that is just slowing down its own request.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.280
 And this is a principle, this is just queuing theory, right?

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:49.280
 Yeah.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.320
 So I talk a lot about the Trader Joe's model of queuing theory.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.920
 And I wanted to, I wanted to bounce this off you before I build this into my talk. But are you,

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.240
 have you shopped at a Trader Joe's or do you have those in Miami?

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.680
 Yeah, we do. I haven't been to it much, but I have been to it where it goes before.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.440
 I recently was told that this is not true for all of them. So it does the metaphor breaks down

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.520
 a little bit. But at the Trader Joe's, in my experience, the way they're set up is they have

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.520
 one line of people waiting to check out. And then they have multiple cashiers.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:22.000
 And the benefit there is you get limited variability in the P99 or the 99th percentile.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.840
 Right, those outliers. And almost everything we do as performance engineers and software

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:32.240
 is outliers. Like, what is that? 0.01% or 0.1% of requests wise of taking so long.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.120
 And the benefit of the Trader Joe's system of checkout, compared to a typical grocery store,

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.280
 where you just pick a line and wait, is that one person in front of you, you know, writing a check

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.640
 or you wouldn't use any gift cards. Yeah, kind of pennies. Yeah, it doesn't impact you as much,

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:51.600
 right? Because it all it does is, it's like a thread pool. It reduces one worker in the pool. But

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.920
 every other cashier is there. And also at the same time, they can, quote, spin up, you know,

00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:00.160
 new cashiers can come forward and help burn down the line. Yeah. And that is very similar to the

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:05.440
 way I think about Lambda and distributed systems is having this ability to consume work. And if

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.840
 you're a Go programmer, if you're a backend developer, looking at Go, you already probably do this,

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:15.680
 because you already are familiar with Go routines and within a single process. Yeah, absolutely,

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.360
 absolutely. And the same with the roster if you're using like Tokyo or even Node, right? A lot of

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:23.280
 node developers don't realize like how the like new node developers don't realize how the event

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.280
 works. But it's very similar. You know, you just the event loop is processing whatever events are

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.200
 being emitted. As you get more, you push more things into the event loop. And then it continues

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:37.680
 to cycle through and execute any awaiting transaction in that loop. Yeah, I mean, people do get hung

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.040
 up on that because when I asked, I asked a question the other day about doing something concurrently

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.600
 in node, and I had a few people respond being like, that's not possible. You can't do that. And

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:50.240
 they didn't realize that, well, for IO work, you can, because it like totally it jumps to the

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:56.880
 like pauses that and jumps to the next EP work needs to do. Yeah, it's a I mean, the thing you

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:01.280
 bring up the trade that trade was that queuing thing is great. It's that's another product. I

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.000
 totally forgot that these were problems I used to deal with. But again, very typical, right? Like,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.760
 you build some service where you can upload a CSV and get a processed. Most people have CSVs

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.560
 that have a thousand lines. Someone shows up with the 2 million line CSV, and you prior

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.960
 process it has aggressively to process everything else. And suddenly everyone's requests are slow.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:27.440
 So being able to like preempt that and like and deal with those situations is is again,

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.320
 I totally like this used to be a constant problem for me. It's like, okay,

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.760
 how do I do this? Absolutely one big user, but I just totally forgot that it's it is not an issue

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:40.240
 anymore. Yeah, and I think, you know, we're getting the point in our careers where you can look back

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.920
 on things you've solved before, which is that's experience, right? Yeah, that's what people talk

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.280
 about when you're like, well, what does experience mean? It's like, oh, I've solved this. Yeah,

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.040
 and the CSV thing is something I think everyone has to go through. And it's yeah, so it's exactly

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:55.440
 what you're describing. We we used to have to do these running a big Ruby on Rails app with a

00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:00.720
 background processor called a delay job and later sidekick. It would in queue these tasks in Redis.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:05.600
 But to make the task horizontally scalable in Redis, it would split the file either by line or by

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:10.560
 chunk and then in queue those as different items. And that still isn't quite solved the noise neighbor

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.760
 problem, right, where one person is doing two million and the other person is doing six. Why are

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.480
 they waiting behind that person? But with S3 and Lambda, and event triggers, all of a sudden you

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:24.560
 get that isolation, right? And I can say, okay, here is a URL, put your CSV file here. And then

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:30.800
 that URL, once that user writes the binary data to S3, we'll trigger a Lambda function. That Lambda

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.320
 function can then you can do so many things right away. You can even use something like step

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.880
 functions dynamic map to just entirely have it split and processed. And then you don't have to

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.960
 worry about any of the isolation at all, right? It's just done for you. Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.480
 You also get so like, another thing you're going to do is is just by by the nature of

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.840
 CSVs, people are going to have duplicates. I don't know about you, but everybody's data is

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:57.200
 crappy. So they upload these giant CSV files and you can, you know, lemons scene distance is an

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:02.160
 algorithm to detect how close words are together. It's used for autocorrect. You may not know the

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.400
 algorithm, but you've just, you've been a user, you've definitely used it before. And it's such a

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.640
 common thing to like run levishing distance against the rest of the file and flag any dupes and have

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:15.520
 people correct those. And I think I've built that twice at like production scale. And the first time

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:21.440
 I got paged a lot because yeah, I didn't handle, I didn't handle the P99 well. But the second time

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:26.240
 using like step functions and using serverless was just so effortless that all I had to do is

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:30.480
 watch the metrics. And just say, Oh, wow, we just, we just processed a 200 million line file that

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.440
 this giant like national governing body uploaded every single person in their contact list ever.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.520
 Yeah. And it just churned through it.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:42.720
 Yeah, it's a it's really cool. And even yeah, you can definitely see it in your own. I mean,

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.000
 you mentioned the metrics and that that's an interesting thing I think about all the time.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.680
 If I look at the metrics that I used to obsessively look at and the ones I look at now,

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.960
 they're completely different. I could never go to production before without having memory

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.600
 monitoring in place CPU monitoring in place alerts, alarms, all of that stuff just in case

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.160
 something happened and I need to go intervene and scale something up.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:09.600
 I don't know the last time I really looked at any of those metrics. Now we just look at

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:15.520
 whoa, look how much we did. That's cool. That's about it. That's a lot of time. I look at stuff.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.320
 Yeah, so it's like a completely different world.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:23.520
 Totally. And Lambda solves that. Like Lambda solves that. But let's talk about S3,

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:29.040
 S3. Which might be the single most impactful data system that any of us have ever

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:38.000
 ever used ever. S3 does one trick and that trick is called erasure coding. And if you've ever read

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.360
 about rate arrays or built a gaming computer, you maybe know a little bit about this, but the

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:47.120
 just the idea is like breaking up a file or a binary blob. It's arbitrary binary data into chunks.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:52.720
 And then writing a multiple of those chunks to different services. So you take the bits,

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.960
 you run them through an algorithm, you scramble the bits, and then you take different sets of

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:02.640
 those bits and write them to five places. So maybe you have one record that needs to be

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.040
 divided into three chunks to store at scale. Then they're going to divide them into five.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.080
 And the idea is you can lose two of those five disks or two of those five data sets at any point.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:19.200
 And your data will still be fine. But it's not just about data storage. It's about retrieval.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:24.640
 So when you read a file from S3, it's going to do a scatter gather operation. You talk to a control

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:29.040
 plane or a service that tells you where this data lives. And that control plane will say, okay,

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:34.240
 here are the 15 nodes you need to talk to. But once you get 10 reads back or, you know,

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.480
 10 responses back, you now have enough to reconstitute that file. You can just drop

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:44.880
 the other five reads you were doing. And that's so important because in any distributed data store,

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.320
 there's always going to be one node that is doing garbage collection or hot spotting,

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.280
 or there's a hundred other requests that happen to hit that node at that point,

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.520
 or any number of things that cause it to drop that request. And this is why you get this very

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:03.760
 consistent response out of S3. And now every cloud has their own version of S3. So you have

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:09.280
 like a binary compatible blob store. And that is just such a powerful thing to be able to do.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.640
 It's not necessarily super, super fast. You don't get single millisecond responses like

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.560
 you do out of Dynamo. But you sure as hell aren't going to have, you know,

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:21.600
 one minute long response times like that long tail of data systems and data services that we

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:26.480
 typically see in distributed systems, you don't have to deal with that. And that becomes the basis

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:31.840
 for so much of what we do. We wrote a data dog wrote this great blog post in the service called

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.960
 Husky we use that stores our event data. It's you can read it. It's on our website. It's great.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.800
 And that's all backed by blob store. All right. Like that's that's how that service works. Yeah. So

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:48.880
 many other systems built on AWS are just built on S3 as well. Yeah, it's funny because that's

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.560
 one of their oldest services. I think for a lot of people, they might have even gotten introduced

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:58.160
 to AWS through S3. It's also like it fits the mindset of serverless. It's been that way since

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.280
 the beginning as maybe the first serverless offering that people use like you just pay for

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:08.800
 your usage and you don't think about provisioning resources at all. Yeah. And it's great. So much

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:14.640
 is built on top of it. I actually like got into like managing servers through distributed

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:21.200
 fellow systems. My Oh really? Tell me about that. My dad bought my dad's also a software engineer.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:28.000
 He was doing like a Hadoop prototype for his job. He was working at the time. So he bought

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.320
 like this rack of eight servers that he just installed in our basement and he was using that to like

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.800
 set up a dupe and prototype and and Hadoop is like is similar to what he was saying. Like it's

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.960
 it splits up data and you have like some metadata server that tells you where everything is. You

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:46.320
 can kind of retrieve it efficiently and in in the same way. Basically, it's kind of build your own

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:53.040
 S3, which people are doing back then. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. He prototyped with it for

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.280
 not that long. I think it took him like a one month. And after that month, he was like,

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:03.280
 okay, these are yours now. And I was like, Oh, and then that's how I learned how to do Linux

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.600
 and servers. And I would like I was like putting a Minecraft servers and doing all this stuff.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:13.760
 But yeah, like that that was technically the only reason those machines made it into my house

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.800
 was was for this this reason. So I was doing the distributed false system stuff, but that's why I

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:26.960
 got there. Yeah, that's why they're there. That's awesome. My my my dad worked part time as a

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:33.200
 janitor at the school. I went to sort of make ends meet when things were rough. And he they were

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:37.120
 going to they were going to recycle these like Pentium two machines. And he took home two of them

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.360
 for my little sister and I and that's kind of how I got my start. And that's actually how I got

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:45.840
 into like networking because I wanted to play like SimCity and Streets of SimCity and all these

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.520
 games with my with my sister. And two machines was it solves such a huge problem in our life,

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:54.160
 which was, you know, one controller on the Super Nintendo or the Sega Genesis or whatever,

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.160
 right? There's only one. And how are you going to share with your sibling that the unplugged

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:05.280
 controller trick doesn't work past like a they catch on. So so that was such a big part of me

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:10.960
 growing up to is was thinking around on unused machines. And I do think it definitely like lit

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:18.320
 the spark. Yeah, the other thing that did it for me was Legos. Yes. Yeah, I wrote about this a few

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.680
 years ago. It's probably I'm most embarrassed by it because it's just not a good piece of writing,

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:27.040
 but you have to you have to be bad at something before you can be okay at something. And I wrote

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:32.800
 about how Lego League impacted me as an engineer. And Lego League was this like ultra nerdy hobby

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:39.200
 I picked up where you have this this Lego kit, which is based on a microcontroller and then motors

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.920
 and sensors and then just Lego parts. Yeah. And you build a robot and you use that robot to compete

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.640
 on a map to score objectives and every year the objectives were different. You might have to,

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:53.360
 you know, rescue a villager from volcano or, you know, it's like a Mars mission drop a supply

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.800
 crate off at some, you know, launch site or something like that, right? Just like little like move

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:02.880
 parts around on a board. And that it was written with this visual. Are you talking about like a

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.920
 mindstorm? Was that related? Yes, it was a Lego mindstorm. Yeah, I had that too. The visual,

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.400
 the visual programming thing. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. And that was such a cool thing for me because,

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:18.560
 like I said, like we talked about, I'm not a good student. I need to see things and be like this

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.760
 is important to me because it does something I want to do and not because I'm a better person

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:27.360
 for learning it. Yeah. And that clicked for me, like the Lego thing clicked for me where I could

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:32.480
 drive this robot around my living room or whatever. And I do think that definitely keyed my interest

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.160
 because the people that coached all of that were all engineers. They're all hardware engineers or

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:41.040
 electrical engineers or software engineers that parents that were at the school. And that definitely

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:46.160
 piqued my interest. And I do still see some of that like in the, you know, in the engineering world

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:51.360
 today, I see people kind of bringing aspects of those old little hobbies and toys to their to their

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:55.440
 day to day. And I think that is neat. You know, it's a good way to teach, like to see if kids have

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.840
 that spark and are interested in this type of thing. If they have the patience for frustration to

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:04.320
 like see it through till something works. And I think software is kind of one big frustration

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:09.440
 exercise after another. Yeah. Yeah. That's a big part of it. Just nothing worked when, I guess,

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.040
 when we were growing up, totally rage, right? So there's nothing that worked. Well, but to

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:17.280
 tell the crazier degree, like every single time I wanted to print something, I had to go debug

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.480
 the printer. Like what's wrong? The driver, the thing. And then start printing. You remember

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.320
 when like it would start printing out like all those nonsense, like weird test page. And yeah,

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:29.680
 not diving that just like weird care. My printer had this thing where it would like not decode

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.720
 something correct. So we just start printing out like all those like weird characters and stuff.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.920
 It was actually kind of scary now in hindsight. I think that's your dad trolling you. Like 99%

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.080
 share your dad was like, this kid keeps messing with my printer. He's already got my my rack. Like

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:46.320
 what more does he want? I'm just going to print some scary stuff that says go to bed and he'll be

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:51.760
 done. But yeah, nothing worked. And I had to constantly debug it and you just kind of learn

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:55.680
 that debugging skill, which you learn from like literally anything is enough to be something

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.800
 totally related. It's anything that's not working out to forget what the issue is.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.960
 And he's developed a lot of patience for it. My brother is very different. He got,

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.680
 I think he grew up in an era where stuff which has worked a lot better. And he just, you know,

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:12.720
 for him, it's just like, there's this classic story my dad always tells where my brother was

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:17.680
 complaining that TV wasn't working. The TV's not working. And my dad goes to check and it just

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:23.680
 like wasn't plugged in. Just like just sitting registered for my brother like taking in and

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.640
 figure out what was wrong. So I definitely appreciate the era that kind of we grew up in.

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.880
 I think a lot of a lot of stuff kind of pulled us in that direction.

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:38.400
 I think there's still a lot of that too. And ultimately, for me, it boils down to the theory of fun.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.040
 Have you heard about like the levels of fun? Are you? Okay, tell me.

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.480
 I think this comes from the military. I've heard it from other other like jumpers for

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.880
 comes from the jumping community part of. And the idea is there's three levels of fun.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.960
 The first level is a roller coaster or something that you do. It's enjoyable. You say that was

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.600
 fun. You know, you talk to your friend or your spouse. You're like, Oh, that was fun.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:59.920
 But the next day you're not like, Oh man, I gotta gotta get back on the roller coaster.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:05.040
 Yeah, the femoral level two. Yeah, level two fun is not fun when you're doing it level

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.560
 two fun. It can be like hiking a mountain or building a big system or, you know,

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:12.320
 whatever, doing something that or running or, you know, pick pick it, whatever you want to do,

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.880
 right? Like learning, I think you're learning the kite surf. I think there's a lot of times

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:19.280
 where that is not fun when you're doing it. And it's very true for bass jumping. You know,

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:24.240
 you're on this like six hour hike up a mountain. We jumped the Eiger with a wing suit a few years

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:29.120
 ago. And it is not fun. It is not, it's not a fun hike. It's not a, it's a very pretty hike,

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:34.160
 but it's on this like crusty shale rock that keeps breaking under your feet. So it feels like

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.920
 two steps forward is only one. You're just kind of crushing. You're just,

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:43.360
 you're just willing your way up this thing. And it's not technical to do. It's not technical

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.880
 to achieve. There's not, it's like, okay, you walked up the Eiger, we can see it from here.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:51.200
 It's just annoying. It's an annoying thing. Yeah, it's an annoying thing. And you're,

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:55.520
 in your at altitude, and I'm already, it wasn't in great shape, still not an amazing shape.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:00.560
 The whole thing is a grind. And, and you get up there, and then you jump and you land,

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:04.400
 and then you're like, okay, that was fun. Yeah. So type two fun. Interesting.

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.600
 It's not fun when you're doing it, but it's fun and retrospect. And that's the thing that gets

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:13.200
 people to do a marathon again, or do a five day or whatever it is, right? Yeah. Yeah. That feeling,

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:19.840
 that feeling of accomplishment is the fun part not doing the task. Right. Level three fun is never

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:23.840
 fun. You're never happy about that. You never, that, that is never a good, you know, if you've ever

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.240
 been on a camping trip, or I went on this backpacking trip in Wyoming, and it was in July,

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:32.320
 and we got like snowed in, and we didn't, no idea why there was snow in the mountains at this point,

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.360
 but there was. And of course, we didn't know, we're a bunch of minutes, so we don't know anything

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.040
 about the mountains. Get back to the car, and of course the car's battery's dead. We hadn't seen

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.800
 anybody in five days, and we're freaking out, and we're like, okay, how much food do we have,

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:46.720
 whatever. And finally, like someone comes by and jumps the car and whatever, but like,

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.080
 that's never been fun. I've never looked back at that and said, oh man, I would love to have that

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:54.960
 experience. It's just like not camping in the snow when you're expecting like a summer camp,

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.240
 and then thinking you're going to have to live out in the wilderness until it thaws,

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.960
 and people come and rescue you, because you have no cell service. Like that's not a fun

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.200
 thing. That's like level three fun. And I do like it's software projects like that too. Like,

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:10.240
 there's like a self-refessed in software, in some times. And it's a key part of your development as

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:15.280
 an engineer is, is do, like figuring out what has to be done, and what, you know, what you can sort

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.160
 of really have fun with, and figure out how to make yourself do the things you don't necessarily

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:22.400
 want to do. But there's this whole class of problems that I never want to solve in software

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:29.680
 that are like the Kobayashi Meru to borrow the Star Trek reference, where if you do everything,

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.320
 100% right, you nail it, you have the entire software as flawless, the operations are flawless,

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.400
 the deployment is great. Maybe you're like migrating a system. And you do it perfectly.

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:46.000
 Nobody notices. Right. And anything less than that is abject failure. And every stakeholder is like,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.440
 how did the system go down? What were you doing? What were you thinking? What, you know,

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:53.280
 those types of problems, I think, are key to understand as a software developer, and how to do

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.680
 them is unlocks a lot of value. And especially how to do them in a way that you can motivate the

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:02.560
 team and be fun, right, and enjoy it and do the work, even though you know it's a self-refessed,

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:07.440
 you know, this is like level three fun. This isn't going to be, no, no good comes out of this,

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:11.920
 no promotions come out of this, no blog posts comes out of this, it is just work. But you do

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:16.720
 have to do it, you know, those things come up. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it's, it's nice. I feel

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:22.160
 like as my career is progressed, I've been able to do less and less of things in that category,

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.280
 just because like as an industry, things are maturing and like their solutions for things like that.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:32.000
 It is like a weird thing, because in the moment, it's always fun to like learn something new,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.360
 and like you're proud of the skills that you acquired, and you like that you know how to do

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:41.360
 certain things. Simultaneously, I am happy to never use certain skills. Again, I'm happy that I'm

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:47.120
 never gonna have to like manually run a database again and like make sure it's running and make

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.640
 sure it doesn't go down, make sure backups are up. I know how to do that, I've done it before,

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:55.040
 but I'm glad to not have to do that again. I can appreciate what other people are doing for me.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.720
 So yeah, I think sometimes people look at especially people like in the serverless world that are

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:06.160
 like really using managed services. I think sometimes externally people look at that and they're like,

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:10.640
 oh, that's, you're only doing that because you don't know how to do that yourself. But it's

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.000
 actually the opposite. We know how to do it ourselves and we just never want to do it again,

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.920
 because we know it's just not the best use of our time. You know, it's so intimately, you know,

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:23.600
 it's so intimately and so well you never want to do it again. I did, I wrote about a user service

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.520
 migration where we shut down, we like acquired this company, we were migrating the users and our

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:32.320
 users, and that is like one of the things I just never want to do again. It wasn't, it went well,

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:38.000
 and everything worked, but it is definitely a process where if like data could be lost, if it

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.680
 wasn't done right. And so much of your career, your development as an engineer and your developer,

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:48.720
 you know, we're contributed to a business and understanding the value of that business is key

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:55.440
 to knowing your place and how to improve your prospects, but also the company and your team

00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:00.000
 and all those things. And identifying those areas that you've done before and steering away from

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.120
 the Quagmire is a mark of the senior engineer, the person that's got that experience. And also,

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:09.040
 like the thing that you're doing now at your company, you're avoiding those pitfalls, so you

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:13.920
 never have to solve that problem. And doing that with serverless, that is the whole point, right?

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:18.400
 You're like, no, no, no, this, I'm going to solve this problem once. And I'm never going to have to

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:25.040
 open this code or touch the system. Again, it will just work. You know, Alex debris is a good

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.560
 friend of mine. He's a mentor. I actually, I had the pleasure of he managed me at serverless ink

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.640
 for a while when we were both there. Oh, wow. So if you don't know Alex, Alex wrote, literally wrote

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:39.040
 the DynamoDB book. And last week I was in Seattle at the AWS hero summit, hanging out with him,

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:43.440
 and he kept getting like product managers at AWS, where like just pulling him aside out of the

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:48.400
 summit to talk with him, right? Like he is very respected by that group and by that company.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:52.480
 And I think, you know, one of the things he taught me about Dynamo and just systems in general is

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:57.680
 like the guardrails prevent you from writing a bad query. And you have to do all of that work up

00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:02.160
 front to model your system. And then that is hard. And I think a lot of people look at that and say,

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:08.880
 why I could just, you know, throw it in SQL and no disrespect to Aaron Francis, but you know,

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:15.600
 that didn't exist also at the time. This conversation was happening. Yeah. So you get this world of,

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:20.640
 you know, this guaranteed world of very low latency services just by doing a little upfront work,

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:26.080
 and you never have to worry about it again. You won't let you write a bad query. And I do think

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:32.320
 those, like I look for those levers in both serverless, but also other, you know, I do a lot of

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:36.000
 containers work. I love app run or love far again. There's a lot of these tools that exist out there

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.800
 for you. We just never have to think about it again if you sort of go down the right path.

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:45.840
 And that is experience. Like, yeah, I've made those mistakes. Yeah, exactly. I made those mistakes.

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:50.080
 Opting into the upfront pain, I think is because when you start maturing, you start to like,

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:53.760
 you talk to say, okay, I'm just going to, this is going to suck for the first week,

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:58.800
 but then I get this long term benefit and like making those choices. It's hard, but I think that's

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.320
 what as you get more senior, you start to make more of those. The diamond one's a great example,

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:08.000
 because I think people often respond saying, well, I don't have high scale, like I'm not dealing

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.120
 with massive scale. So why should I care? And the thing I always point out is it's not the fact that

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:20.960
 it can scale to a crazy place. It's what that experience looks like. When you work with like

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:25.840
 a database that doesn't, like you said, DynamoDB doesn't let you build anything that doesn't scale

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:30.320
 automatically. When you're in a situation where that's not true, like for using a center SQL database,

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:37.760
 which, you know, our current products are all on my SQL. So I still use it. But the reality is,

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.000
 is one day you have a week planned. You're like, we're going to build all these really cool things

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.200
 this week. We're excited. We have momentum. We just shift a bunch of, we just shift a bunch of

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.720
 things the last two weeks. We're on a high, like we're going to keep going with it. You wake up one

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:54.560
 day. And it's like, Oh, this table is overloaded. Right? Like, yeah, people are using this specific

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:59.280
 feature more than we expected. And now we have to go change all of our plans that we have for this

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:03.920
 week to go do this firefighting of like, you know, figuring out, okay, what indexes do we need,

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:08.160
 like what optimizations do we need to make? How do we rework this? And you're going to do it. You're

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.440
 going to do it. It's not going to be a big deal. You're going to achieve it in a couple of days,

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:15.200
 and you're going to forget about you're going to move on. But that moment just killed all this

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:19.840
 momentum that you had in your plans. Let's get shifted to the next week. And then it's a disruption

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:25.520
 and people kind of lose lose that momentum. So yeah, a lot of this for me is really understanding

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:30.160
 how people work and how companies work and how teams become efficient and start shipping a lot.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:36.480
 And those disruptions really, really make it's very easy to underestimate them. But

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:41.280
 that's the difference between teams that are shipping 100x more than other ones, like they know

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:45.760
 how to build momentum and maintain it. And those like unexpected disruptions, those surprises,

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.640
 they're like they're killer for that type of thing. Absolutely. The thing I always say is that

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:57.680
 preserve momentum. If you're if you're an engineer, even a leader or an IC or a new engineer, like

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:03.680
 everything we do is to preserve the momentum of the team going forward. So if there is a way that I

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:10.000
 can trade okay work or good work today for the best work tomorrow, I'm going to take the good

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.440
 work today. And I know that I can make things move tomorrow. And that the other thing is always

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:19.760
 be ready to ship at any point. I need to be able to press the merge button or press the deploy button.

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:23.760
 This is true. Now I'm mostly on a library team. I do a lot of open source work, but I also do

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:29.200
 manage a backend service that distributed system think like go in Kafka and a few other components.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:36.240
 And that like always be shipable or always be ready to ship is such a key mantra. We do not want

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:42.080
 to exist in a world where for coalescing of reasons, we cannot do a deployment or make a

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:46.640
 change or roll something forward if we need to. We do that through things like feature flagging,

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:51.760
 we do that through things like small pull requests, coding small is a big mantra of mine, right?

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:57.120
 How many? I don't care that you can, you know, refactor this whole service in a 20,000 line PR.

00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:01.360
 I want to see how you can start today with three lines and how that's safe and how I can roll

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.400
 that back if we need to. And you've thought about the impacts that could have on the underlying

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:10.560
 data store if this goes wrong. And that mentality I think carries you so far. And I do think, you know,

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:18.480
 there is this, I think that that so many like, especially early career and hungry engineers want

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:23.840
 to kind of move mountains, not realizing that you move mountains a little bit at a time. And we

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.600
 should talk about this because you and I are both in our 30s. We've been doing this for some time.

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:32.880
 So like Dax, how do you, you know, like stay motivated to keep working? You're, I think we're

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:37.280
 both ICs. I'm not sure how your company is organized. But you know, everyone's contributing and you're

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:42.480
 pushing forward. Like what keeps you going through this? I mean, to be honest, people always laugh

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.760
 me for saying this, but it's true. I just love money. If I'm going to be completely honest,

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:52.640
 like I just love finding ways to say I put in five minutes of work. Here's how much value I created

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:59.600
 and increasing that lever over time. I'm just addicted to it. So it's a joke because I'm saying

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:05.120
 money. And it is money. But then the day it's like, that satisfaction I get remembering that

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:11.680
 a year ago, this thing, this value I created would have taken me two hours today. It took me 10 minutes.

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:17.680
 It's like, I always liken it to like, like an RTS game where in the beginning of the game,

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:22.080
 you have like nothing, just a few villagers and you're like, just figuring out food and basic things.

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:26.480
 By the end of the game, you've got like more than the, you have so many systems set up for like the

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:31.920
 basics, you've moved on to like much higher level things. Building a business building and the

00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:37.280
 tech to me feels that way and it feels addicting in that same way. Totally. I think since we're

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:42.160
 confessing, I'm like a deeply insecure person. That definitely drove me to want to base jump

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:47.040
 because I wanted, I was a cringy kid in high school in college. I was not, you know, it was not a

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:51.440
 good experience for me. I did not have fun. And I just wanted to sort of be accepted. And as a

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:57.520
 result, I had this like the classic millennial, you know, crave attention, crave validation, life,

00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:02.000
 you know, and that definitely, that's like a big part of why I'm active on social media in

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.800
 technology. And I like to give talks is definitely like it comes from that part within that like,

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:12.400
 oh, I need to, I need to be validated. But, you know, I, that's not really, I think what keeps me

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:19.120
 going now. I think so much of what keeps me going now is unlocking the ability of others and making

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:26.000
 really big things move. So I'm a staff engineer at Datadog for my day job. I do have a couple of

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:32.080
 reports, but I'm not predominantly a people manager. My role, and I think sort of the canonical role

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:38.720
 of staff engineer is to solve problems that exist horizontally at the company. And that means

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:41.440
 taking people that maybe, you know, this person's working on front and this person's working on

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.800
 back end or teams, right? Like at our scale, it's like teams of people are doing this part

00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:51.680
 and that part. And then there's the back end for Datadog is not a Postgres database. I just want

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:58.000
 to go right out here and say it's a little bit more than that. And so our front engineers are

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.360
 full stack and they do back and they build their own API endpoints. They build their own

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:05.520
 API contracts. And then we have a whole group of distributed systems engineers that build the

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:10.080
 actual streaming and the real time data services that power at all. And then there's people like me

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.880
 that are more closer to the like front front end or the client libraries where this is open source

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:20.080
 libraries that you run in your infrastructure and send data back to us. And a big part of my role is

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:24.720
 is finding the right people in all these different groups and getting them excited about a vision

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:29.360
 or an idea and helping them move forward on it together so that any one part of that

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.760
 doesn't seem like it was a big change. But when you step back, we've moved to mountain. We've done

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.480
 something big here. And I think as somebody in my 30s now, that has been a really big, it's like

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.120
 unlocked that fun button all over again, all over again. So instead of, you know,

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.840
 oh, I ship this API and it's really good. And I like using it, which I still do find value in.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:54.080
 So much, so much of it now is like this group of six people sort of skunk work style,

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:58.560
 which is the code name for the group that built the SR71 board kind of under the covers, right?

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:04.880
 At Lockheed, like that, that kind of of building and moving pieces inside of a company is huge.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:11.040
 And I think that's what like senior and super senior staff I see is kind of do is they have

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.320
 this like higher level vision of what has to be done for us to be successful in five or 10 years.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:20.960
 And they're able to work within all those groups and identify the siloed people or the people that

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:26.800
 are in different teams to move those projects forward. And that like, I work with some incredibly

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:33.280
 motivated, I have a couple of engineers on my team now that are young and 10x, what I ever was

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:39.280
 at that age and ever will be in my career. And I love being able to sort of direct them and help

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.760
 them solve a problem and then watch them just go out and crush it. And that, you know, it's not

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.800
 management. It's not full-time management. It's still very technical work. Like I'm shipping code

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:51.840
 every day. But that is, that's the role you're leading, you're mentoring, you're helping people

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:58.480
 have an impact, helping people build a product. And I do because I am so deep in need of validation,

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.160
 I do like working on product teams so that I can like go off and do that.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:05.440
 Yeah, you know, that's awesome. I mean, that's really well put. I think it's,

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.440
 I can relate a lot to that. And it kind of in a different angle though, because we're just a

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:15.120
 team of three. Totally. But yeah, the thing you're talking about is you see what's going on in like

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.920
 a very large, broad way. And you see certain opportunities and you connect the dots and make

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.400
 sure that like certain things come together and it ends up having a huge impact. And at the end of

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.520
 the day, it's all we're talking about, we're having trying to, as you go further and further

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.440
 in your career, like the same amount of time you spend on something just starts to have a much bigger

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:36.720
 impact. We're able to now do this kind of in the open source space, right? Like we're so plugged into

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.280
 all this stuff going on, all different tools coming out, being able to identify,

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:46.320
 again, just like you said, like there's like, I mean, a great example is a team behind Drizzle,

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.280
 which is like, you know, TypeScript. To type say what it's all to your database that is awesome and

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:57.920
 we love. But we saw that team early on, we were like, they built something way better than any of

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:02.720
 like, I could ever build like this is just like, like the good said, like the people are way better

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:08.080
 than me at certain things. It's super impressive, but very underrated, right? Like it's not fitting

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.680
 into the right place is being overlooked XYZ things. And being able to like connect the dots with,

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.760
 I know that a lot of people would benefit from this. I know they're just, it's like a arbitrary

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:23.200
 that they're not more popular and finding a way to get them in front of people and get adoption and

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:29.440
 see where that grows and kind of maneuver things in that way. It's like I said, it's a fun button.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.120
 It's like a new thing that I realized, oh, I can do this now. I can like see different things and

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.080
 have influence and impact this impact. All this stuff comes together. Yeah, it's like the same

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:42.080
 satisfaction. Like I said, the same satisfaction I get from like shipping, like a literal thing

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.760
 that I built with code, it's all the same. It's like the job looks very different. You're doing

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:51.600
 very different things, but your, your intelligence around it, like how you approach it that have a

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.240
 thinking it takes. It's the exact same thing you've always been doing. Just the pieces you're using

01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:01.840
 are, are quite different. Yeah, you're moving, uh, logical groups of people and their efforts,

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.760
 and you're not necessarily doing the technical work or, you know, you mean you're doing the

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.640
 technical work, but not every single component of it. You need to, you need to compose those

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:15.280
 pieces. You also have to direct, you know, direct the traffic. Yeah, it is, yeah, it is type two fun.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:21.680
 But, but I think as you, as you grow and you build more software, build more, do whatever it is that,

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:26.960
 you know, you sort of incentivize to do what you like to do, you go through the hard parts with the

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:32.640
 kind of a, a ry smile on your face, knowing that in three weeks or six weeks or when the release is

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.480
 done or when customers start to adopt it, it's going to be good. Yeah. You know, you're going to be

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.480
 really happy you did that. And that is, you look back on that, you're like, ah, yeah, that was a good

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.240
 project. Yeah. You know, and that lasts forever. I still, I have a team that I worked with that

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:48.880
 that sports tech company that we sort of built around the ashes of a project that was just horrible

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:54.480
 and it burned out a lot of people, like most of the people on that project quit. And they,

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:58.400
 like a year later, they, they tapped me. They're like, do you want to, do you want to get a, like,

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.640
 ragtag group of people that want to try and attempt this again? And you know, you can sort of decide

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.760
 how it's going to go and how we're going to work on it. But we do have contracts signed, you know,

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:09.040
 it's like, Oh, great. Thanks. No problem. Like, let's just run through the ringer again.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:15.840
 But we were able to build up a team that got so close and were so successful that we still,

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:19.120
 we still talk to each other all the time. Like we have a slack instance and we just get to hang

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:24.160
 out. Now everyone's at different places all over the place. But we still, you know, connect because

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:29.120
 those bonds are sort of forged in that process. And we, I think everyone looks back kind of finally

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.520
 added at the time it sucked there. It was a suffer, because there was not a lot of fun that was

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.840
 happening day to day. There was just enough to keep people from burning out. But then we did,

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:41.760
 you know, at the end, we did this really big thing. We look back on it. We're like, wow, that was like,

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:45.760
 that was cool. And it is, you know, I think to your point, right, like, it makes money. Like,

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.840
 that it's not going to be successful. If it didn't make money, it was a business we're working in a

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:54.400
 business. Yeah. So you know, if that motivates you, that's great. But I don't think, you know,

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:59.200
 not really, right? I think it motivates you to a point. But I think really, like, when people

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:05.280
 use something, I work on like, Oh, this is good. Like, Oh, I like this. That feels so good that I

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.760
 definitely money is a side effect of that thing. Exactly. Yeah, building building something good.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.240
 If you if you haven't read this, I think everyone, everyone should read Zen and the art of motorcycle

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:18.880
 maintenance by piercing. It's a classic, I'm sure your dad probably was like, here's your server,

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:23.440
 here's your here's your motorcycle maintenance book, here's your sick book. But it's just a book

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:28.560
 about quality. And like, what is quality? It's it's it's an abject measurement of something. But

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:32.880
 what what actually is it? How do you know, you know, you pick something up, you know, it's quality.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:38.720
 But describe the quality parts of this, the qualitative parts that make this thing good. Yeah.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:43.440
 And I do love that about software. And you talked a lot about linear, you know, you know, you know,

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:50.960
 I listen to your episode. I forget the names. But Tomas, yeah, thank you. And I could tell that

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:56.960
 this is a person that also really values the work they do for the purpose of knowing that it's good.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.920
 Yeah, that people will objectively assess us as good. They may not be able to tell you what's good.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:05.920
 But when they use it, when they when they touch it, when they feel it or you know, interact with it,

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:13.360
 it feels good. And that that is a really powerful motivating factor for me too. Like, it's a big,

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:17.440
 big part. Likewise, like, I want to make sure what I put out in the world, I can point to it and say,

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:22.560
 like, that is that represents me that represents the best of my abilities. You can judge me based off

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:27.520
 of off of that piece of thing. And it's kind of going back to what we were saying. It's just that,

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.200
 yeah, we can be honest about this. There's just a need for validation. Like, I am the same way

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.280
 I want it. I need it. Like, we don't have to pretend like we're all like emotionless.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:40.560
 Like, no, it's a part of your hierarchy of needs. Yeah, absolutely. Like respect for your work or

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:45.280
 what you do or what you spend a huge amount of your waking hours do is important. I do think it's

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:50.640
 important to walk a line and be able to unwind because burnout is real. And I'm someone who also

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:58.640
 intertwines deeply, intertwines my day job with my hobbies, with my, you know, being an AWS hero

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:04.960
 and working, you know, towards kind of that type of blogging content creation sort of role. Like,

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:10.080
 that's all me. That's all one part. And I sort of bring my same part, my same self to each of those.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:14.800
 It's not like I like compartmentalize my blog when I go and work on a bug. Like, so many of my

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:19.200
 blog posts, if you read them are about bugs, like they started as a bug. This proactive initialization

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:25.520
 thing was a bug, you know, it started as a bug ticket. So, so that is, I think, a superpower.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:31.280
 But it's like a nuclear core. You have to be really careful to temper how much of that you you do

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:36.000
 or don't use. Because first off, you have to go long. We have a long career. Everyone's living

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.640
 longer than ever before. You're going to be doing this 30, 40 years from now, probably, right? Well,

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:45.120
 hopefully not 40, but you know, longer than maybe our parents or their parents, definitely

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:51.520
 longer than their parents. So figuring out how to do that over time is the real secret. I think

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:55.120
 anyone can have fun and anyone can sort of burn the midnight oil and hack away on something.

01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:00.240
 Or or whatever, right? If maybe you're you're not a developer, you want to be a streamer and play

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:05.360
 games or entertain people like that is hard work. Yeah, that is not an easy thing. I don't I think

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:11.360
 there's this like concept of easy jobs. There are no easy jobs. Yeah. And once you have that in mind,

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:16.400
 you can, you know, you have to find a way to temper that over the long term. And I think that's what

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:22.000
 leads companies are actually to be successful because and you said this too, right? The most

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.160
 important thing you can do to be successful in five years is to be there in five years. You have

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:31.600
 to be there. You have to be there. That is that is the people giving up is the number one killer

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:38.000
 of startups, the number one killer of dreams, the killer of ideas. P zero, you have to be there.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.400
 Yeah. Yeah. It's I think someone said, I don't remember where I read this, but someone was like,

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:47.440
 almost every struggle and challenge in life is just your internal debate between the short

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:52.800
 term and the long term. And almost anything in life you struggle with can probably be summarized

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:59.840
 in that way. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, short of horrible like sickness and disease and all those other

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:06.320
 things that do come up, you know, and governments. But yeah, your ability to your ability to persist

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:11.440
 through this is key. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. Well, okay, we're at an hour now, but this was great.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.840
 Thank you so much for joining. A lot of wisdom there. Appreciate it.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:20.880
 Oh, it's been fun. Yeah. I look forward to jumping back on when Adam buys his motorcycle.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.480
 And then later when he gets a scottiving license, that'll be great. Yeah.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:28.320
 No, I think we'd definitely love to have you on again, but maybe Adam can do can do the next one.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:33.360
 And you guys can talk about you can influence it maybe on on some of these other hobbies. I feel

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:38.800
 like Adam is like in the his hobby is hobbies right now. That's what I feel like. I feel like

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:42.880
 he's like, Oh, that's also such a superpower though. Like just be like, so I think so many

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:47.840
 people are scared to look dumb. Yeah, I have always looked down and I've never been athletic

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.240
 and I've never been coordinated. So it's always it's just like, if you're just, okay, I'm going to

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:57.600
 just do this thing. No suck at it for a while. If you can embrace the suck, embrace the sufferfest,

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:03.760
 it's just such a you have more fun. Yeah, it's it's a try more things. It's so true. And I can

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.480
 give you like a little example of this. So I live in Miami. My wife is Cuban. Her whole family

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:14.800
 speak Spanish. I have made basically no progress on learning how to speak Spanish. Because of

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:19.520
 exactly this issue, I am kind of afraid to look and sound dumb. Like my whole identity of myself

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:24.240
 is that I, you know, I'm pretty articulate. I can express myself well. And then suddenly turning

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.120
 that off like I'm like, I don't know who I am. Like, how can I even so that's like I'm letting

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:35.520
 that get in the way. But you know, that's obviously a short term thing like I'm going to sound and

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.640
 look down for a little bit, and I'm going to figure it out. And I'm going to have a new ability to

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:44.640
 communicate, which I seem to like kind of get over, but totally. Yeah, it's that's life, man.

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.560
 It's like a wild little adventure and no one gets out alive anyway. So you may as well,

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:51.440
 you may as well try a bunch of stuff. Okay, awesome.
