WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
 And just thinking about the, what is in my pocket?

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.220
 Sorry, oh, that's random, okay.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.220
 Do you want to know?

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.900
 It was a measure.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.320
 What the hell is in my pocket?

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.880
 And I was like, what is going on?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.300
 That's a kind of measuring tape you use to measure your own body.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.020
 No, no, I did not measure my own body.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.800
 I measured my children's bodies.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.460
 Because I'm ordering them BJJGs,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.700
 but that's another topic for another time.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.700
 Wow.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:51.020
 - Hey.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.840
 - Hello.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.120
 - It's been a couple weeks.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.960
 - Yeah.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.800
 - We skipped a week.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.960
 - Yeah.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.400
 - I feel like we skipped a week pretty,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.680
 it's been pretty recently and we skipped another week.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.080
 Are we falling off?

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.240
 What's going on here?

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.160
 Do you not like me anymore?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.760
 - It's you, you're the one that's like, I'm traveling.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.600
 I need a break.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.920
 (laughing)

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.520
 - So what I said, did I say I need a break?

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.360
 - I'm a little baby.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.620
 (laughing)

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.640
 - We were on a break, friends, anybody?

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.080
 - Well, I mean, this is very you to hit a milestone

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.440
 and then just not continue.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.280
 (laughing)

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.400
 This is me also.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.920
 - Yeah, there was a part of me that was like,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.240
 how funny would it be actually

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.080
 if we just never recorded (laughing)

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.760
 the longest gag ever,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.520
 just like continually not recording

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.240
 because we had 100, that would have been fun.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.760
 - Yeah, did you see,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.000
 I think it was Scott from Syntax.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.040
 I think they hit 800 episodes

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.520
 and he said something like,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.680
 - Wow.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.840
 - Getting to 800 episodes is hard,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.200
 but showing up every week to do one is easy.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.040
 - Yeah.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.800
 - And I was like, yeah,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.400
 that's actually exactly how I feel.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.160
 - Yeah, it really is like,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.840
 there's no excuse not to do it every week

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.000
 'cause it's an hour where we get to talk

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.320
 and that's it.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.320
 And we're fortunate to have some people

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.520
 that take it from there and make it more than our hour.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.400
 Shout out Chris, who's on vacation.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.640
 He's gonna edit this on vacation, by the way.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.480
 - Wow.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.320
 - He was happy to do it.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.480
 I'm not like a slave driver here.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.000
 I'm not like forcing this.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 (laughing)

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.960
 Well, I think he was happy to do it.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.120
 You're listening to this right now, Chris.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.280
 I hope you're happy to do it.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.200
 It seemed like you are.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.280
 - It's just the life of a freelance person.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.120
 - That's right.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.720
 - Every vacation costs twice as much.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.360
 - Yeah, business owners, man.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.840
 You don't get a break.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.840
 But it's good, right?

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.560
 Like, that's the better path

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.640
 than I was thinking about this a lot, actually,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.960
 of the last few days, just seeing a lot of layoffs

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.000
 and seeing a lot of like pain in our industry.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.080
 So I've been thinking a lot about like the tech industry

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.080
 layoffs and I guess just the idea of like working

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.320
 on small teams and how great that is

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.160
 versus working at a big company.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.000
 Do you think, like we've talked about this ad nauseam,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.760
 I feel like the idea that big companies

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.720
 do need to exist for certain things,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.800
 but like software teams just continually getting smaller

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.080
 and smaller, like that that's the future.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.920
 It's better, right?

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.520
 It's more fun to be on a small team for sure.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.440
 But is it more fun to be like an independent contractor

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.880
 and have to deal with invoicing and doing all these things?

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.400
 And if you're not like with a steady client,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.040
 like actually coming up with work,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.760
 like is that better or is it more stressful?

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.760
 - I think that if you do it well, it's better.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.040
 At least it's been my experience

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.160
 'cause I can remember when I first started doing that

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.000
 and it was not better.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.800
 Yeah, it was a lot worse.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.640
 - Yeah.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.080
 - But once, you know, eventually if some set of people

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.600
 break through that and I think it's better

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.600
 because you end up with situations that are fairly stable.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.280
 Like when I used to do that,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.600
 I pretty much was like full time.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.440
 - Yeah, same.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.280
 - Like when I go full time.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.320
 Like I wasn't like, they have worked for me one week.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.320
 They don't the next week.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.240
 I think that sucks.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.480
 Any kind of freelance where your client can't guarantee

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.400
 the amount of work you do,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.880
 but you still kind of are like committing to them.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.040
 So they like might have worked, but they might not.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.400
 I think that's hard to deal with.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.720
 But if you can get it close to looking like normal employment

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.560
 except you've spread your risk among a bunch of companies.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.360
 - Yeah, I mean, risk from just them going down,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.480
 but also risk from just you not liking them anymore

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.640
 or like them being annoying, you know,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.360
 you just have more options.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.680
 But yeah, I don't know how many people actually get

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.200
 to that level.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.000
 - Yeah, and that's one of my questions is like,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.480
 is that for everybody?

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.360
 Like if tech layoffs.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.200
 - How's that way now for everyone?

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.760
 - I guess I just feel like teams like big company,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.840
 software teams are just gonna keep getting smaller

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.320
 and there's not gonna be like the proportion of people

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.440
 that are at smaller medium-sized companies will grow over time.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.280
 Like the Twitter thing is the big example

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.400
 everyone points to right now that like they went

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.400
 from how big like 7,000 engineers to how many?

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.120
 Not very many compared to that, like a thousand?

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.560
 Did they cut it that far?

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.760
 - I think it's some thousand now, yeah.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.600
 - Yeah.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.600
 So like that's the big case study where everybody's like,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.880
 oh, actually they get a lot done still

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.400
 and the things had some bumps.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.520
 But like when you shed that many people,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.840
 of course there's gonna be bumps.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.120
 So I guess I just think like big tech companies

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.200
 are gonna realize and just with like improvements

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.760
 and efficiency, tooling, abstractions, all these things,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.160
 AI, whatever, whatever you think's gonna drive

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.040
 the next step, I don't wanna say step function.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.800
 The next, sometimes you just are the trope

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.160
 and you can't help it.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.520
 The next big leap in developer productivity,

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.480
 I just feel like the era of like a 10,000 person

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.920
 software development team is just, it's just not,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.840
 it's not the future.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.040
 - Okay, but here's a observation I had,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.480
 not observation, I guess this is like maybe,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.520
 I was able to think about this a little bit more.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.120
 That's maybe a counter to that.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.440
 And maybe kind of explains this thing

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.360
 where I've been talking about

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.200
 and I think you feel too,

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.160
 we're fizzing the whole economy's fake.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.680
 So this CrowdStrike thing that happened.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.680
 But this is the, was the biggest blunder disaster

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.440
 that has ever happened.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.000
 Like by far the biggest by a wide margin, right?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.760
 It's one of the biggest things we could even imagine.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.920
 - In technology, in IT, in software.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.360
 Like how do you in bucket that?

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.120
 - Yeah, like in software, I guess,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.320
 in like in computers, I think that's how broad it is.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.000
 - Which side note, just real quick,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.800
 it's kind of interesting that it was like a software bug.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.640
 Like a software team shipped an issue

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.440
 that created an IT nightmare.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.880
 It wasn't software people that had an IT,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.720
 are you know what I mean?

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.560
 Like I'm sure they had a bad day,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.680
 but like it was all these IT people out of the world.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.160
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.560
 But here, that's my point.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.280
 So it's been maybe a week,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.380
 maybe a little more than a week.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.220
 - Yeah, how long has it been?

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.680
 - It mostly is all fixed.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.000
 Like I'm not really running into business,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.960
 like every business was down.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.080
 But now they're all just back.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.520
 And they're just back to doing their usual thing.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.520
 And you know, for something that is like

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.760
 the largest disaster that has ever happened,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.520
 you'd think that it would screw them for like years.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.560
 But it doesn't.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.160
 And I think the explanation is the economy is not fake.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.600
 It's just massively over-provisioned.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.120
 So all of these people that worked at these companies,

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.800
 they had what looked like full roadmap.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.080
 So I'm sure they're all doing sprints and using JIRA.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.280
 I'm sure they like had a maxed out story point.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.920
 So I'm sure it was like their like full capacity.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.200
 And this totally unplanned amount of work shows up.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.640
 And somehow they just also do it, you know?

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.480
 - Yeah.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.600
 - And I'm sure there was some like kind of thing,

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.120
 but in the grand scheme of things, like I doubt, you know,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.560
 it's like an effect them for years in most cases.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.360
 So yeah, everything is just really over-provisioned.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.440
 It's you are everyone's over-hiring, everyone's whatever,

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.440
 just for these moments where things do spike unpredictably.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.200
 And that's ultimately, and this is like actually

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.480
 in Taleb's book, he says, that's what's different

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.040
 between an employee and a contractor.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.440
 An employee, you're paying them to be there

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.720
 whenever you need them.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.400
 You might not need them every second,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.920
 but most employees are actually rarely needed.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.480
 But you know the moment you need them, like they'll be there.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.120
 Whereas a contractor, you just don't have

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.880
 that type of relationship with.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.880
 Like they can just say, no,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.920
 or like they have another client, they're prioritizing.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.920
 So all this costs, I think is for immediate availability.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.480
 That's like, I don't know if that explains the whole thing.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.920
 I think a lot of what you're saying is still true,

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.200
 but I think that is like another dynamic that exists.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.920
 - So there's so many different avenues I want to go.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.560
 And I'm going to try to go to all of them.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.800
 It's not going to work.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.720
 - Yeah, it wants.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.560
 Okay.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.560
 So the first thing is, I guess,

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.960
 there's a distinction between the software industry

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.200
 and the fluff or the extra slack in the system

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.000
 versus like whole categories of jobs

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.440
 that maybe shouldn't exist or that like,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.280
 okay, so there's a book.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.960
 Somebody, actually someone who listened to the podcast

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.120
 sent me a book recommendation.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.920
 They heard me talk about my idea

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.000
 that the U.S. economy is fake or the world lot economy,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.840
 whatever.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.440
 And there's this book, Bullshit Jobs.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.280
 And basically, if you read this.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.280
 - No, I've been reading books.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.120
 It's pretty popular.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.960
 - You get the premise.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.800
 - Yeah.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.640
 - Yeah.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.920
 And there were some like studies where like,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.560
 it was 30 to 40% of people in some country,

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.240
 I can't remember, the Netherlands, the UK, I don't know,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.880
 said that they didn't think their job

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.200
 served any like purpose to humanity.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.560
 Like that it was helping society in any way.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.320
 And that's all people that were surveyed.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.480
 It wasn't like specific industries.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.680
 So you imagine like all the nurses and doctors

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.840
 and I don't know, very important jobs,

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.480
 even people like in the surface industry,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.720
 they wouldn't say they think their job has no purpose.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.000
 Obviously they can see the purpose

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.600
 like they're helping people every single day.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.280
 So those whole categories were probably unanimously

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.920
 like, yes, my job does have a purpose.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.200
 And then 40% still of the whole economy

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.760
 were people in jobs saying, I don't think it needs to exist.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.680
 And there's like whole categories of jobs

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.960
 that just maybe don't need to exist.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.640
 So that's an interesting topic.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.960
 We don't even have to go any further into it.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.600
 But I think what you're saying is,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.000
 did you have something to say?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.160
 - No, I mean to that, yeah.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.400
 I think, yes, there is a lot of it.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.360
 And there's a few dynamics that contribute to that

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.200
 that are just like fundamental in human nature,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.200
 which is by default, humans like empire building.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.080
 So when they enter a company,

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.560
 they like to just add more and more people underneath them

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.760
 and expand the number, just number of people

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.120
 that they're in charge of.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.680
 - Not everyone does this, but that's like an innate bias.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.600
 Generally, we like doing that.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.560
 So of course, that's gonna result in some amount of

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.880
 made up stuff, a lot of them made up stuff.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.200
 So I think that, yeah, that is there.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.480
 So I'm gonna tell you, see,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.040
 I don't know if you can self-identify

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.360
 if your job is important,

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.040
 especially at a big company or like needed.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.360
 I do feel like a lot of these big companies

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.800
 do tend to be like a team of 10

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.120
 and like one person is really like doing all of it.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.000
 - Yeah, it's just like a school.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.480
 - When there's like a team project,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.520
 like a group project. - Exactly, it's like that.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.640
 It's just that school that happened.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.880
 Like there's no reason why it would be any different

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.760
 as adults, right?

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.800
 It's, we've all experienced that.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.680
 Yeah, so I think that definitely is there,

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.720
 but yeah, it is a complicated thing.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.720
 I think this is just how humans operate.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.040
 And when we do need to work in teams,

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.400
 when we work in teams, like there's like a large margin

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.480
 of error of part of the team not being needed.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.300
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.640
 The other avenue to go down was I saw your tweet

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.120
 that was kind of tied to what you just went through,

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.120
 what you just explained about the whole CrowdStrike redundancy,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.520
 like how the world got back on track pretty quickly.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.040
 And a lot of people were kind of clapping back

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.360
 or pointing out that, oh, these companies had huge financial

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.800
 like Delta or all these airlines

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.520
 that had huge financial losses

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.640
 because of the CrowdStrike issue.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.440
 But in my mind, I didn't even see your replies

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.880
 to those people, but in my mind,

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.160
 you were talking about like the technology,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:00.000
 like the IT side of it healed, leaving outside,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.760
 the whole concept of financial implication

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.240
 was kind of outside what you're talking about, right?

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.760
 - Yeah, I think it was more that, as usual,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.280
 I thought those replies proved my point.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.440
 Like, yeah, it was big, it was huge.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.920
 - Yeah, just proving the size of the issue.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.760
 - Yeah, and if it's like the one of the largest things

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.160
 we can even imagine, and they're like kind of back

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.240
 to operations a week later, like just that differential

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.520
 of like how big it technically was

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.240
 and how like a non-issue it's gotten to already.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.080
 - Yeah.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.960
 - It's funny because there's so many crazy dynamics

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.800
 going on, right?

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.040
 You have the whole classic centralization problem

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.080
 where everyone is using the same thing.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.680
 So when that thing breaks, everyone breaks equally,

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.200
 which is like not how you build a robust system.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.040
 - Yeah, USC is one.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.480
 - Yeah, right, exactly.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.120
 But as an engineer, what's like a huge pain?

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.560
 You hate when people are using different versions or stuff.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.640
 You hate when people are using different browsers.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.760
 You hate when people are using different operating systems.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.760
 Like you like push for like consistency and standards

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:08.520
 and like contracts and all this stuff.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.200
 But you end up creating this like really brittle thing.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.800
 simultaneously, the real world completely rejects

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.480
 that notion, 'cause if you look at a lot of these big companies,

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.920
 they will buy like, I was talking to Stefan about this

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.440
 the other day, like, okay, we're using GraphQL.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.240
 For some reason, they buy like four GraphQL products

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.080
 that are all competitive with each other

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.240
 and use like one here and a different one there

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.080
 and a different one there.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.680
 And it looks like a completeness,

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.000
 but it accidentally creates this resiliency

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.160
 'cause there's no essential point in failure.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.200
 It's not their designing for that.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.800
 It's just a side effect of the chaos of people.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.400
 So yeah, there's like so many weird things going on

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.560
 where the airline that wasn't affected

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.960
 was a one that was like a behind on tech

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.760
 because they were still on Windows 3.1

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.440
 or whatever it was at Southwest.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.240
 Yeah, so it's so weird.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.720
 Like it just makes you question everything.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.040
 And that's kind of why I post that

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.760
 'cause I was imagining all the people that are like,

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.120
 you like want to rename a field in some library.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.760
 And they're like, this breaks backwards compatibility.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.000
 And then you imagine, and you like do kind of empathize

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.840
 with that.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.760
 You're like, okay, we're just trying to like do their job.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.080
 Like they don't want this unexpected work

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.640
 of like changing this stuff.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.800
 And as a library, I'll have that break.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.520
 So frequently, like I do feel bad about that.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.840
 But some of the things I'm like,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.320
 people act like it's the end of the world.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.320
 And like literally the end of the world happened

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.760
 and like we're fine weekly.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.360
 Like there's so much extra capacity

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.920
 to deal with nonsense like that.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.760
 So.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.680
 Yeah, what kind of like a rarity do you think this event was?

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.880
 Like do you think this is the thing

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.400
 that is like a once in a decade kind of thing?

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.720
 Is it going to happen more?

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.080
 Is there some reason why we're trending toward more of this?

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.760
 Do you have any thoughts on our theories on any of that?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.040
 So we're getting more brittle and more centralized or.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:48.960
 But it's weird, right?

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.720
 Cause like this was a critical example

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.840
 of the centralization of things and the brilliance of things.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.080
 But again, it just like didn't.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.960
 Yeah, it like recovered so quickly.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.160
 So yeah, I mean, COVID is a counter example

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.240
 of clearly from mass centralization, mass globalization,

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.080
 like a thing spread so fast so quickly.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.440
 And it did cause a lot of problems.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.080
 So yeah, I don't know it's, it is, it's like a meta thing.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:20.080
 Like even thinking about this concept is so not centralized.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.120
 There's like someone like chaotic different ways

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.440
 that like some places are getting creates centralized

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.320
 and places are like completely rejecting it.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.560
 Which in itself is diverse.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.760
 You go to like, so I had thoughts about see,

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.840
 after seeing your tweet, like about how it recovers

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.360
 so quickly and I had my feelings

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.120
 and thoughts about why it recovers so quickly.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.480
 And it's not what you came to, which was just to recap

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.880
 sort of like there's slack in the system,

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.280
 we're over provisioned.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.920
 So I love that concept of like you're applying

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.880
 kind of computing to.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.000
 So we're over provisioned and these companies

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.240
 are able to like pick up this kind of stuff

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.720
 that needs picking up.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.960
 I guess the way I viewed it.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.760
 And I think it's kind of like the rational optimist book

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.000
 kind of stemming from those ideas

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.720
 that like most people wake up every morning

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.520
 and want to make things better.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.040
 And because of that, something bad happens.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.120
 And you got a whole lot of collective energy

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.440
 trying to fix it across all these industries

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.560
 and all these different companies.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.600
 And the result is that we can kind of like fix stuff

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.400
 pretty fast because a lot of people

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.480
 trying to make it better.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.320
 I don't know, is that stupid and fluffy?

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.440
 - No, I think that's true.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.440
 It just like with the problem like this,

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:35.440
 the result isn't like one update and then you push it.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.080
 - Yes. - The exact opposite.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.280
 It's like a million people each like figuring out

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.480
 these localized solutions for it.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.600
 Like of course, there's a general solution,

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.560
 but then it's like, all these random local problems.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.920
 Like, oh, that machine is located in this room.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.080
 And like, I don't have the key to that room.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.720
 And like, you know, it's like you need the people

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.880
 that are close to it to like figure stuff out.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.040
 'Cause I'm sure there are stuff there like,

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.320
 like everything like just random stuff runs Windows.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.880
 Like in New York, you'd sometimes see these,

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.360
 not sometimes oftentimes you'd see these digital billboards.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.120
 - Yeah. - Like on the ground.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.320
 Like they're at ground level that are just like,

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.880
 they're not huge. - Mm-hmm.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.240
 - And they all show like ads and like directions

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.840
 if you're like in this subway, like all this stuff.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.280
 That stuff runs Windows and sometimes you'd see a blue screen.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.360
 Like how do you go update that?

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360
 Like where is that?

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.680
 - Yeah, who's in charge?

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.280
 - I'm sure the machine running Windows is like,

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.640
 in that physical thing.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.320
 So having to go to each one.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.240
 - Oh geez.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.520
 - And update this stuff.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.080
 It's crazy 'cause it seems like a lot of work,

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.840
 but this stuff like skills so easily, right?

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.480
 Like you just split up the work among a thousand people

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.320
 and they get it done that day.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.120
 Like no matter what, you can do it in a day.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.640
 - Yeah, it's interesting.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.080
 Yeah, 'cause this is kind of worst case scenario.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.640
 Like most things can be like patched over the air kind of thing.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.480
 - Right.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.320
 - The fact that this was the situation

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.400
 where you had to physically like go to each machine

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.360
 because it's stuck in this recovery mode or whatever,

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.520
 it's kind of worst case scenario.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.520
 And yeah, it's interesting to see how quickly

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.600
 it could be resolved.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.560
 - Yeah, that's good news for us.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.880
 And a society continually built on top of technology

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.720
 more and more so.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.080
 - The other thing this makes me think about

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.440
 is self-driving vehicles.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.120
 And I've had a hesitation with them for a single reason.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.760
 And it's exactly the thing we're talking about,

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.120
 which is it removes all diversity

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.720
 from driving styles on the road.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.160
 Which if you look at it through tradition,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.720
 like the way we traditionally look at performance,

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.920
 like how well do they drive?

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.560
 Probably beats a human,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.280
 but they will all fail in the exact same way

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.600
 in the exact same situation.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.880
 'Cause they're all running the exact same model

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.360
 with the exact same outcomes, right?

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.760
 And I wonder if that's not true.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.920
 Like do they put in like, is it like non-determinacy?

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.560
 Like is there some variability to it?

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.400
 And I'm sure like maybe it's not technically true

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.760
 'cause two cars in different positions

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.000
 are getting different inputs for whatever their input is

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.640
 and maybe like that creates variability.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.560
 But something about that feels off to me.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.720
 I feel like whenever we build these types of things,

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.200
 it's you just like hyper expose yourself

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.240
 to some catastrophic thing.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.960
 So my dream is everyone in the world

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.760
 is using a self-driving car except for me.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.000
 I'm the only person on the road that's still driving.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.400
 And I think that solves all my problems with it.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.600
 Really? Okay.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.760
 'Cause you wouldn't feel safe being part of this giant

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.840
 uniform driving apparatus.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.600
 But as long as you have that agency still,

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.520
 you don't mind if everyone else is a robot.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.600
 And like technically, like they probably are net safer.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.720
 So it's good to be around those vehicles.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.560
 Right.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.400
 (laughs)

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.280
 I have a lot of thoughts on self-driving cars.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.680
 And I actually can't believe,

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.360
 I don't think we've talked about this on the podcast,

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.200
 which is surprising to me. No, it's funny.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.720
 It's for the most cliche tech topic

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.040
 and we never talked about it.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.240
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.160
 I actually have a ton of thoughts.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:09.160
 So I own a Tesla and we use the full self-driving now some

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:15.280
 with a big asterisk, which is like it's kind of annoying

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.040
 how much you have to be paying attention.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.480
 Like I have to pay attention more

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.720
 when I use full self-driving than when I don't.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.520
 Which maybe that's just 'cause I'm not safe

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.600
 and I shouldn't, it's not like I'm looking at my phone

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.800
 while I'm driving, but like you can't even glance down

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.840
 like at the dash in the wrong way

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.240
 before it's like freaking out at you, the full self-driving.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.920
 Like it's very sensitive to you not looking straight ahead

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.040
 at the road.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.600
 So it's good like after a workout, I'll turn it on

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.040
 to get home and it does a really great job.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.160
 Like I can just kind of zone out and stare ahead

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.880
 and like I'm paying attention as much as you would pay attention

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.720
 when you're driving.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.800
 It's not like I'm completely checked out.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.240
 But it's just nice to relax a little bit.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.400
 That's basically the only use case that we use it.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.200
 Like it's really just I'm exhausted

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.720
 or I just got back from the airport

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.920
 and driving home from the airport.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.120
 It's good for those cases and it seems to like

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.520
 be pretty good at driving.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.280
 Like I don't know what other people's experiences have been

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.440
 but it's got the different modes kind of aggressive

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.160
 versus passive or whatever.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.920
 I think the aggressive seems the most

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.760
 with like a normal human driver.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.000
 It seems pretty good at it.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.840
 But the amount of you have to pay attention

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.440
 is so like counter to the purpose of using it.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.600
 Like I feel like I want to use it

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.840
 and I want to just be good at driving

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.760
 and I don't have to think about it and it drives us

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.200
 and we can do other things while we're driving.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.520
 Maybe that's never going to happen or maybe I don't know.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.560
 Maybe that's planned and I just I don't follow the news.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.440
 - Well, I mean like Waymo taxis are fully operational

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.120
 and it's SF and they're entirely running on their own

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.560
 with picking up random passengers.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.200
 - Like no driver in it even?

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.440
 - No driver at all.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.560
 - So it's not like a legislative thing.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.560
 It's really just like a Tesla like being safe.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.120
 Like Tesla, sorry.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.560
 Being, Casey makes fun of everyone.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.840
 I say Tesla was like a Z Tesla.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.960
 It's not just like they have to do this

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.200
 for liability or legal reasons.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.440
 - I think it's just a different product

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.040
 where when you're a robo taxi company

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.480
 you're like really constraining where it's operating

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.760
 and when it's operating and you have like

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.960
 a lot more control over that.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.160
 I can see why just giving this to end users maybe

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.740
 is a higher level of risk.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.580
 - Yeah.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.200
 - But yeah, I mean, like it's there

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.400
 and people have experienced exactly what you're describing

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.040
 of just being able to,

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.960
 I mean the taxi one's funny 'cause like you can just

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.280
 experience that if you just get a human driver.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.680
 - You're still not having to drive.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.600
 We've had that for a long time.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.160
 - Yeah, I guess like it, like it being a vehicle you own

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.760
 and like can take anywhere that's,

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.840
 that's probably feels a lot different.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.680
 - Yeah.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.840
 - Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to think with the way

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.800
 that I drive how much it would impact me.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.800
 So my car has a lot of self-driving like features.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.560
 - Yeah.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.560
 - So when I am driving on like a highway like a main road,

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.520
 I'm not really driving.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.600
 Like the car is like turning and doing everything for me

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.800
 'cause it's just very simple maintain a speed

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.240
 like all the way in like a car's been able to do that

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.080
 for a while.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.040
 - Yeah, the depth of cruise control in the lane,

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.160
 like staying in the lane,

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.880
 that's pretty commodity now, right?

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.720
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.800
 And so that's in a way that's probably like pretty close

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.880
 to what you're forced to do

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.680
 'cause even though your car's better self-driving,

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.280
 you still have to like, you know,

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.360
 be in the driving position.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.280
 But I've had the same experience where it's like it is,

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.600
 it is nice like I can like relax a little bit.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.160
 And I'm not like actively it's like wiggling the wheel

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.480
 the whole time and it does feel different.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.120
 I think that, I have tried to imagine like if I had

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.160
 full self-driving, yeah, it would be nice.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.120
 I guess it would be nice.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.280
 - Yeah, I mean if you didn't have to pay attention more,

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.240
 'cause I'm remembering now and maybe I can,

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.880
 maybe someone's gonna tell me in the comments,

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.400
 you can do this in the Tesla settings right now.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.440
 I actually liked the old version of self-driving better,

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.680
 which was just what you're describing is just lane,

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.960
 staying in a lane, wouldn't even change lanes for me.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.080
 It was just staying in your lane

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.040
 and not hit the car in front of you, like adaptive cruise.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.960
 I liked that better 'cause I could not pay attention

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.920
 and it didn't freak out.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.880
 I don't even know if our original Tesla,

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.120
 no, in 2016, our Model X didn't have the camera

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.880
 that looks at your face.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.640
 Like they weren't monitoring you paying attention.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.640
 So I actually enjoyed that old self-driving better

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.680
 and I don't have it anymore.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.440
 So now it's either like I have to completely drive

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.720
 or I have to stare at the road even harder than I did

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.120
 like when I'm just driving.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.960
 So it's like this weird trade-off.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.760
 Yeah, and when we make like a long drive,

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.960
 like three hours on the highway to Kansas City,

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.840
 it's really nice to just be able to turn on that adaptive cruise

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.660
 and coast, but I don't even have that anymore.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.920
 Mm, yeah, yeah, I just don't drive that off in, so.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.840
 Yeah, you get to walk all over your city,

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.400
 your beautiful neighborhood, I'm so jealous.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.360
 Yes, but I also just don't leave the house much.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.040
 There's no walking, yeah, well, I don't either,

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.400
 but there's no walking in the Ozarks.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.800
 Like if we wanted to walk to the closest grocery store,

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.320
 we're talking like hour and a half of walking.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.840
 Daddy, wild to me.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.280
 Like it would be that bad.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.680
 I mean, the suburbs in the Ozarks are so spread out.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.160
 Like everything is a long ways away.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.760
 Like it's a 15 minute drive to our grocery store.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.200
 So imagine like I'm not walking that.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.320
 I can't visit like 10 grocery stores in an hour now, probably.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:28.360
 I see the draw of cities, especially it's not like a city.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.720
 Like your neighborhood does not feel like I live in an urban area.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.560
 Like it's nice.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.560
 Man, I am so like, I'm feeling this weird existential thing

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.320
 where mostly existential things are about your own self

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.080
 and your own aging.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.040
 I'm feeling this about my neighborhood,

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.000
 or I'm like, I love this.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.680
 I don't see how this is going to be like this forever.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.640
 Like water feels like a sea level or what?

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.800
 No, we're talking here.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.560
 No, no, I think that crazy.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.880
 Okay.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.880
 So you remember how, I don't know if you remember,

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.120
 but you know what, to my left, it's an apartment building.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.520
 That's like, I don't know, maybe like 10 floors.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.200
 And I have a house in the backyard.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.120
 Behind me has been an empty lot for a while.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.880
 I looked it up the other day and it was sold two years ago.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.720
 And when it was sold, it had like renderings

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.760
 of a giant apartment building.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.840
 Oh, that's what you mean.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.240
 There's going to be an apartment building

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.040
 in my, like looking into my backyard.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:27.880
 Like that's really weird.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.240
 No, like it's going to grow bigger and bigger

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.160
 and they're going to densely pack it in

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.760
 because it's such a nice area.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.960
 Yeah, and then like on a more like mini version of that,

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.880
 you probably heard me complain about it a million times.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.200
 Like they're tearing down houses like mine

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.120
 and putting up duplex, like really shitty duplexes,

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.600
 like just two.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.800
 And I'm looking at all this and I'm like,

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.200
 there's actually no way to stop this

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.280
 because this is just like an economic force that's happening.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.120
 Yeah.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.440
 People want to be in that neighborhood

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.920
 in order to increase the number of people that can be there.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.760
 Yeah.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.840
 People want to be in that neighborhood

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.120
 and most people have horrible taste.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.840
 Like that's actually what the actual combination

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.680
 of things is happening.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.960
 It's because I'm not against tearing my house down

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.240
 and putting up something else.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.240
 The problem is the thing they put up like Rob's,

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.080
 the entire vibe.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.080
 It's just like this cement cube and it like looks modern.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.440
 It like, like it acts like it's modern,

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.160
 but to like if you like understand it,

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.640
 it's actually just super cheaply built.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.840
 I honestly feel like those are going to like last

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.040
 like 20 years before they like fall down.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.880
 It just seems like a piece of crap where you live, like

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.120
 the elements are much more intense.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.560
 Like salt water and that.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.720
 Yeah, it's like the grade stuff faster.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.160
 And my house is a hundred years old and it's so up.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.000
 Yeah.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.840
 That's crazy to me.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.440
 Like people actually built stuff that lasted a hundred years.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.440
 I don't think any homes that are being built right now

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.440
 are gonna last a hundred years.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.280
 Yeah.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.640
 So there's just this economic force

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.480
 and the only thing that would resist it

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.240
 if people were like not willing to move into these.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.520
 Again, they're like 1.6, 1.7 million dollar houses

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.680
 that are just like really, like there's a street

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.120
 where they just ripped up every single house

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.400
 and there are like eight, four on each side, side by side,

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.120
 exactly identical, exactly, exactly identical.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.320
 And I see them slowly being bought

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.360
 every single one white Tesla.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.840
 So it just.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:23.160
 Okay, I have as a driver of a white Tesla by take offense.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.840
 White Tesla model three.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.160
 Like it's like that specific.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.000
 Okay.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.640
 So it's just like my disdain is like just for.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.920
 It's not even like me moving into your neighborhood.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.760
 Say.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.720
 (laughing)

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.000
 I don't think you'd move into this house.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.560
 I'm like very skeptical that you would.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.400
 Yeah.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.600
 I think you would just notice all the winners to be honest.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.760
 No, no.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.080
 You should really advertise more

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.960
 how many mosquitoes are in your neighborhood.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.800
 That's true.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.640
 That's people out.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.480
 That is true.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.080
 All those white people from the Midwest

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.600
 that are moving down there in our white Teslas.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600
 Yeah.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.440
 So my disdain for all of this,

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.360
 it's not even the developers that are doing this.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.200
 Cause I'm just like, there's an opportunity

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.480
 and economic opportunity.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.320
 Of course, they're going to do this.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.320
 Of course, I'm going to try to figure out

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.520
 how cheap is possible they can do it for.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.480
 It's all the people willing to pay this much

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.320
 for this piece of crap.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.400
 Like what is wrong with you?

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.960
 Like why do you have this like boring generic life

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.080
 where somehow you get,

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.200
 you've like made enough money to afford this thing.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.560
 But you're just like using it in the most boring way.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.240
 Like if you had $1.6 million to spend on a house,

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.360
 like you could do some pretty wild fun stuff.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.600
 And instead you do this crap.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.440
 Yeah.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.520
 Now I have a question for you

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.240
 because you are not boring.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.320
 You are anything but average in every area of life.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.600
 What would you do if you had like,

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.800
 let's say $100 million.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.120
 Where would DAX live?

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:44.960
 $100 million.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.760
 What would you do that would be like

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.440
 your in-game living situation?

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.480
 Cause I know you love your neighborhood,

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.680
 but like $100 million is different.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.960
 That's different than like,

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.920
 you're comfortable right now in South Miami.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.040
 Where would you go?

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:57.880
 I said South Miami.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.600
 I would say my neighborhood.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.760
 You stand your neighborhood.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.880
 You can spend $100 million to my neighborhood.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.560
 Well, okay.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.240
 What would be the thing that you would like?

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.320
 What would be the DAX thing that happened

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.240
 because you have $100 million that we'd all be like,

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240
 of course you did.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.200
 I don't, I'm gonna disappoint you

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.080
 cause I don't, like nothing really comes to mind.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.440
 Is that gonna, I can only really think the next step.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.200
 So I would definitely stay in my neighborhood.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.320
 Cause I think, I think I told you the area

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:30.000
 that like LeBron lived in when he played for the heat.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.480
 Like there's property on like that scale.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.320
 That's over there.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.680
 So I think I'm very basic.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.680
 Here's the thing about Miami.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:43.520
 Like it is so well suited for basic richness.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.080
 If you're rich, you live by the water.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.000
 If you live by the water and you're rich, you get a boat.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.720
 And like that combination of things,

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.800
 you're like life is really, really amazing.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.080
 Like it's like really, really, really nice.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.640
 Like you actually really get the benefits of being rich

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.240
 just by having, having those things.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.000
 But if I was, I would, I've always wanted to build my own house.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.680
 I've always wanted to do like a very concrete,

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.760
 or like a house with concrete floors.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.040
 And like it just faces time really well.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.080
 Yeah. I mean, I think people know something cold.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.520
 It is like on the colder side,

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.080
 but I think you can still make it like pretty warm as well.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.760
 Like I like warm houses.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.760
 Like I don't like that like cold, ultra modern thing.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.040
 You'd have a bunch of dead animal rugs,

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.560
 like laying across your concrete floor

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.160
 to kind of keep it nice and warm.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.160
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.160
 Yeah.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.240
 I always wanted to build my own house.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.720
 But that's like the thing I wanted to do.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.120
 So this is this is too boring of an answer for a podcast.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.240
 So I need to ask more probing questions.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.440
 Would you have a second home?

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.160
 Is there another location in the world

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.160
 where different seasons like when it's too hot in Miami

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.280
 in the middle of the summers or somewhere else you'd go?

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.280
 Would you have thought about that?

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.160
 Yeah. I mean, I think what's hard about this question

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.320
 is like it's so unlimited.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.720
 Like if you have that much money,

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.960
 you can have 10 houses and be everywhere.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.320
 Like of course, I'm sure I'll find 10 plays in the world

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.480
 that I would like to live.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.040
 Like I'll go have a really nice apartment in New York

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:06.880
 because I love New York.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.040
 I'll go like we really liked Lisbon.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.000
 I think of the parts of Europe we visited.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.600
 Like that seems like a really good fit.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.560
 We definitely have a place there,

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.520
 maybe outside the city,

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.640
 which is only like 20 minutes away,

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:23.040
 get like a country type house or something in the city.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:23.880
 I don't know.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.320
 Like yeah, it's just so you can do anything

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.160
 with a hundred million dollars.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.200
 You know, it's not a-- I guess that's true.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.160
 It's just the basic stuff.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.720
 I don't think I'm interesting in that category.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.840
 There's not enough constraints.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.760
 You like when there's constraints.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.840
 You think the interesting stuff comes out of constraints, right?

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.800
 I can think about the next step, right?

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.320
 Like if I'm able to make it to the next step, like--

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.440
 You're planning or kind of semi-prepared

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.280
 for that.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.440
 By the way, my leechy tree died.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.280
 The one I got.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.520
 No!

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.520
 Yeah, it's unfortunate.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.360
 But my mango trees are doing really well.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.360
 But in that category,

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.080
 I would just want like a frickin' fruit farm.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:56.920
 Tree on your property?

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.760
 On your property?

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.600
 Yeah.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.440
 In my yard.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.000
 Oh, we have definitely looked at the tree.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:01.840
 Yeah.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.120
 The Maui draw is like,

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.520
 just have an entire like tropical fruit farm

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.480
 that you live on.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.840
 'Cause there's those on Zillow you can see 'em.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.680
 It's amazing.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.800
 I just keep finding more fruit.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.560
 Yeah. There's just like more new fruit.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.160
 Like so, I was really into leechies

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.560
 and then I found out that there's another thing

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.600
 called a Langen.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.640
 I don't know how to pronounce it.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.440
 Which is like exactly like a leechy,

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.200
 but the season is off.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.760
 It's like shifted forward by a couple of months.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.760
 So like it kind of widens your window

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.040
 of when you can enjoy this type of fruit.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.200
 Yeah.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.520
 There's just all the infinite banana varieties.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.280
 Do you like Ram Bhutan?

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.120
 I don't know how to say it.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.560
 I sound like such a midwesterner.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.400
 Ram Bhutan?

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.240
 Yeah, those are in the same--

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.080
 A little spiky ones.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.440
 Yeah, they're very similar to--

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.280
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.640
 I call them lychee, but I guess it's leechy.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.960
 We found this conversation.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.800
 Yeah, okay.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.760
 I mean, people-- (laughing)

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.280
 I'm fairly certain it's leechy, but--

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.200
 But you're probably right, babe.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.000
 You live in South Florida.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.640
 Like I just ordered them online from Miami.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.840
 I'm also from Asia, so.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.440
 Oh yeah, so you would know these things.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.280
 Yeah.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.280
 (laughing)

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.240
 From Asia, that's funny.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.440
 So fruit trees for sure, that's my thing.

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.640
 And I don't understand why people plant a non-fruit tree.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.800
 Couple of non-fruit trees, yeah, makes sense, but--

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.800
 Yeah, we've planted ourselves, like, six fruit trees.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:21.040
 One, two, okay, two peach, two cherry, four apple,

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.320
 and one, well, two papa, one died.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.800
 So now we have one in the papa tree,

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.160
 but we're gonna replace it.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.080
 So however many that is,

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.600
 we've planted a bunch of fruit trees.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.800
 It's really hard in the Ozarks, at least,

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.200
 to keep fruit trees alive.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.400
 The deer just wanna come and tear them down.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.600
 I don't understand that from an evolutionary standpoint.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.800
 Why would a deer find a little cute baby fruit tree

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.200
 and be like, I'm gonna root it, I'm gonna just destroy it.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.280
 I'm gonna hump it to death until it breaks in half.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.760
 Why did they do that?

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.920
 'Cause if they want fruit from it someday,

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.920
 I think they'd learn to respect the tree.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.560
 Take a little nibble, like a little nibble of a leaf,

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.400
 and then just come back next year

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.920
 and get yourself some fruit.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.720
 I don't get it.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.360
 Should I not say that word?

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.960
 Did I say a word I shouldn't say on a podcast?

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.400
 Chris can edit it out.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.240
 (laughing)

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.240
 To actually, though.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.960
 The people are uncomfortable with that word for sure.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.720
 Yeah, yeah, I don't know why that came out of my mouth.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.240
 Like, that's not a word I used to do.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.960
 - You're extremely upset by what happened to your tree.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.800
 - Do you have deer?

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.080
 Do you have deer in saffler?

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:18.920
 You don't do you?

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.320
 - No, no, we'd do there, but like,

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.240
 I'm not like roaming around the middle of Miami, you know?

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.680
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.200
 - Except when they wanna like, you know,

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.520
 when they're having a batch of bread or something,

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.000
 maybe they'll come down.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 (laughing)

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.840
 - That's funny.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.680
 - So stupid.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.640
 - So we've lost like one cherry tree and one apple tree now,

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.000
 just to the deer destroying it,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.800
 like completely snapping them in half.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:43.120
 Like, they look like there's nothing left of them.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.440
 And I don't understand that.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.320
 I don't get why the deer would do that, but.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.360
 - I mean, I think they just have to survive long

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.440
 to reproduce, so.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.400
 - Oh, yeah, okay, they're not thinking about it.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.040
 - They're not thinking about 80 years in like retirement.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.640
 (laughing)

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.960
 - Okay, that's fair.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.000
 - So the thing that's funny is a,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.400
 so peat trees, apple trees,

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.360
 I don't know what they look like when they grow,

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:08.880
 but mango trees look so cool when they're fully grown.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.880
 Like, if you ignore the fruit.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.440
 - Oh yeah, I love mango leaves.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.520
 - Yeah, they're like one of the coolest trees to have

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.520
 and they can like form all these intricate, crazy shapes.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:20.400
 And the other thing that I kind of clicked for me was,

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.680
 so with my mango tree, like trees grow in these like bursts

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.680
 where it seems like they're doing nothing

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.040
 and all of a sudden they're just like, shoot up.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.760
 - Yeah, kids too.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.040
 - Oh yeah, yeah, it may or it may or it may or it may or it

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.040
 may or it may or it may or it may or it may or it may or it may

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:30.880
 or it may or it may or it may or it may or it may or it may.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.880
 So it finally did that, right?

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:32.720
 When I first got it,

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.720
 I had these like three, like maybe like six inch shoots

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.600
 that were coming out the top and then like new leaves

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.720
 were growing on it and they were like,

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.680
 they're still like not very sturdy.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:48.680
 And four days later, there was a really crazy rain storm.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:53.040
 And because they were weak, they like kind of drooped,

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.680
 like the weight of the water and the wind there.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.640
 They drooped all the way to the side.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.200
 So they're like hanging, like facing left and right

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.800
 instead of going up.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.880
 And then they like and I like propped up a little bit,

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.880
 but they hardened in that way.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.300
 Like they grew and they got strong in that direction.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.680
 But now this tree is going to grow in a specific shape.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.080
 - Yeah, completely different because of that one rain storm.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:14.920
 - One day.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.920
 Yeah, and it's like you see trees and all those weird shapes

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.760
 and it could have literally been from like one specific day

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.160
 where like one thing happens, a permanent memory of it.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.000
 - Interesting.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.480
 - And the tree, which is really wild.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.400
 - That is wild.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.960
 I don't know why it made me think of like weight training.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.760
 Like I feel, I lift a lot these days

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.360
 and I feel like I don't stretch.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.240
 So like I'm growing in a certain way.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.120
 And then like I'm getting in a certain shape

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.280
 and it's just.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.840
 - This is a real thing though, right?

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.600
 - Oh yeah, no, it's for, yeah, I stretched today

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.440
 'cause I realized I was really sore and this is what happens.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.080
 My hamstrings get even smaller and tighter

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.480
 'cause I don't stretch them.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.320
 - Yeah.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.040
 - Can I go back to the full self-driving thing now?

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:54.880
 - Yeah.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.720
 - Okay.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:59.320
 Are you aware of like how full self-driving has evolved

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.440
 from a technology standpoint?

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.520
 - I'm aware, the most I'm aware of is like

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.960
 the LIDAR approach versus the non-LIDAR approach.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.440
 Like I don't know about anything else.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.800
 - So I'm gonna give you a short version

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.640
 and everyone on the podcast.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.480
 - Yeah.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.760
 - I don't know where I heard this actually.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.980
 I feel like this was like Carpathie.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:19.440
 It was when he joined Tesla, rejoined Tesla.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.280
 I don't remember where he's been, he's been everywhere.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.600
 But they used to like train so that they had the cameras.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.480
 Well, the LIDAR thing is going even further back.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.960
 Like they had multiple sensors involved.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.020
 Did they have radar too?

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.760
 They had like two or three different systems.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.880
 There was the cameras, there was the LIDAR

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.600
 and then maybe even something else

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.600
 that were kind of all like feeding into these ML models.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.480
 And the cameras were feeding images,

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.360
 which were like labeled data.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.520
 Someone could correct me if I'm wrong.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.280
 I may be misremembering any one of these points.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.480
 But essentially like how we would think

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.480
 of training object detection classically

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.040
 with image detection, right?

00:38:59.040 --> 00:38:59.880
 - Right.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.200
 - Like you've got an image, you label

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.120
 the different things on the image, whatever.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:04.960
 And it wasn't very good.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.000
 There was like this ceiling on that technology.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.160
 And then they said, what if we went all in on just cameras?

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.880
 And then today what they've,

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.840
 the ultimate form of full self-driving

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.000
 where they've gotten to with Tesla,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.960
 it's just like photon data.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.960
 They don't like train it on images.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.280
 They just take the photon data

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.000
 from the eight cameras or whatever around the car.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.560
 And raw photons feeding into some model

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.960
 that ultimately is making decisions.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.040
 It's like how our brains work.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.080
 It's like the eyes, the light comes into the sensor

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.760
 and they don't have any preconceived notions

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.400
 of what those images may look like.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.160
 It's just like trained on photons.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.360
 I think that's so cool.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.280
 It's just so wild to me.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.120
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.360
 The figuring out what the actual level of,

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.840
 like what level of data does it need?

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.680
 - Yeah.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:55.840
 - At some point it's like, that's like super unstructured.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.040
 Like you can feed it just raw.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.640
 I mean, for people to film training

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.160
 like the music models and stuff.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.360
 Like at some point, are they just like ingesting

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.440
 like raw sound waves and they can like learn

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.400
 and find patterns from that?

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.480
 Which is again like how like humans learn to see

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.320
 and learn to hear.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.360
 So that is very cool.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.800
 This reminds me of something like coming on related

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.240
 in terms of like humans seeing a certain way.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.520
 So this thing happens to me.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.480
 Like maybe like once, I get it like maybe like once a year,

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.560
 maybe twice a year.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.360
 It's in the category of migraine.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.400
 But it's called an ocular migraine.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.160
 - Oh, I think I have heard this.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.000
 - Yeah.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 It's this really crazy thing because it is 100% not a problem.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.960
 Like you get it.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.680
 It allows a couple of hours.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.000
 And it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.240
 It doesn't mean like you need to go get it checked out.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.560
 It's just a very, it's rare,

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.640
 but it's like a very normal thing and it's ultimately benign.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:54.360
 But the symptoms of when you get it seem insane.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.600
 So here's how it usually happens for me.

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.440
 I'll be working.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.440
 I feel totally normal.

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.000
 All of a sudden I realize that there's a blind spot forming

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.040
 in like an area of the monitor that I'm looking at.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.040
 And it feels really weird because blind spots are weird, right?

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.120
 It feels like you can see something but you can't.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.560
 And so it's sort of forming.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.720
 So I sort of feel like I'm going blind in one eye.

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.840
 That will transition into the blind spot

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:20.520
 having this like weird like flashing like rectangle

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.680
 that kind of shows up.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.120
 And then at that point I'm like, okay,

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.640
 I'm getting one of these things.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.480
 Yeah.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.320
 And I'll go lie down.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.160
 I like drink a bunch of water

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.520
 just to make sure I'm not dehydrated and stuff.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:33.480
 And then from there, the blind spot might start going away.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.120
 And I'll get like the traditional like migraine headache thing

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.320
 which is very painful and annoying,

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.320
 but whatever that's not a huge deal.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.240
 Then my hand, my hand will start tingling

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.080
 and it'll start going no.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:44.920
 - Oh my word.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.320
 - And I'll like feel like this like numbing going all the way up

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.960
 my arm and then like into like the side of my face.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:56.000
 And then sometimes this doesn't happen to me in a while.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.120
 Like there's like these weird neurological things

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.720
 where like I'll try to remember what people's faces look like

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.880
 and I just won't be able to.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.240
 Like some like random function in my brain

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.560
 just like sounds working.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.400
 - Yeah.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.400
 - And then an hour later, I'm just 100% back to normal.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.000
 - Oh, it's just like an hour.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.200
 - This and like it used to be a lot like there have been times

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.560
 I was younger where like lasted a day,

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.920
 but lately it's been like one or two hours.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.560
 And what's wild about all of this stuff is like

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.160
 I'm feeling something in my eye.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.440
 I'm feeling something in my hand.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.040
 I'm feeling something in my face.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.000
 But none of those things are wrong.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.920
 It's like entirely in my brain that this is happening.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.840
 So it's like.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.680
 - So wild.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.520
 - Yeah, it is really weird.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.320
 So it's really scary.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.000
 Teaming because it looks like I'm getting a stroke or something

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.520
 but it's like this very rare but normal thing.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.440
 - And like if it happens when you're driving,

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.480
 I guess you have enough warning.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.920
 Like it's kind of coming on slowly

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.320
 and you can like pull over.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.160
 - Yeah.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.800
 And I could probably slow drive.

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.640
 Like it would just be,

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.160
 I was just being uncomfortable because I would have headache

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.960
 but it's like a giant blind spot.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.920
 It's just like a weird thing.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.680
 I probably would pull over.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.520
 - Yeah, wow.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.360
 - But yeah, it's really odd.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.040
 And it's like, wow, your brain is like,

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.000
 it makes you realize like how delicate your brain can be.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.320
 Like something is going on in some part of my brain

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.160
 that's a gadgetated and it's.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.000
 - Oh man.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.760
 - Creating all these like weird effects.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.600
 - Yeah.

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.440
 - Brain stuff.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.320
 Brain stuff is wild.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.320
 What am I, I'm listening to something about the brain.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.520
 I can't remember what it is now.

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.000
 Is it a book I'm listening to?

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:18.840
 What am I listening to?

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.680
 It's about the brain.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.880
 - It seems like you're not really listening to it.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.520
 (laughing)

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.640
 - If I said anything lately to you about the brain

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.200
 that I've learned, what is it?

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.020
 (laughing)

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:29.960
 I gotta look at my audible now.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.800
 My brain just died.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.480
 - This is so funny because the sound so stupid

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.200
 and you're talking about the brain.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.920
 It sounds like you're like looking for a brain.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.560
 Like I like the map one and I'm like trying to find one

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.960
 and I don't really remember.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.880
 (laughing)

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.440
 - There's nothing in my audible about the brain.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.960
 What is going on?

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.360
 - I know I'm listening to something.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.340
 Maybe it's just a podcast.

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.840
 Like I just, I'll do you give you a random tidbit

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.400
 that I could not make up.

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.680
 Like just heard in whatever I'm listening to about the brain

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.800
 that some animals have like a part of their brain.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.720
 There's a name for this part of the brain

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.480
 and humans have this part of the brain too.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.480
 But in some animals, there's like a hole in their skull

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.360
 where light can pass through and hit this area of the brain.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.000
 You know what I'm talking about?

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.280
 And it's something to do with like their chrono cycles

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.360
 and like it keeps them aware of daylight and nighttime.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.720
 Ours is not obviously getting any sunlight

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.280
 but there's like animals that receive sunlight

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.880
 into a certain spot of their brain

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.080
 that like stimulates these certain processes.

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.280
 That's just wild.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.080
 Brains are nuts.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.720
 Bodies are nuts, just biology, big umbrella.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.120
 - I mean, that's probably how that I formed originally.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:46.480
 It was like light hitting some part of a creature

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.000
 and then a bunch of like neuron cells

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.160
 like forming around that area like over time

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.840
 figuring out how to interpret it.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.840
 - It hurts your head to think about some of the,

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.600
 just like I was thinking about this with dinosaurs.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.080
 My kids like do stuff with dinosaurs so much.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.240
 Like they've got dinosaur toys and dinosaur books

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.400
 and dinosaur costumes.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.080
 We're just constantly inundated with dinosaurs.

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:10.320
 If you ever just look at like a dinosaur model or a toy,

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.920
 you just think about like like an ankylosaurus

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.840
 is like this little like tank of a thing

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.280
 with a big club on its tail.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.120
 - Ankylosaurus.

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:17.960
 - Can you look at it?

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.560
 You just look at like all the spikes on its back.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.240
 Sorry, I'm not too much about dinosaurs.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.920
 - No, that's not why I'm laughing.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.760
 - Oh, that's the wrong?

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.200
 - I'm laughing for sure it's ankylosaurus.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.040
 - Oh my God.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:26.880
 - Ankylosaurus.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.720
 I mean, I don't know.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.720
 I might just be making it up.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.720
 - Light tea, ankylosaurus, whatever.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.800
 - It just sounds like, it just sounds like a dinosaur

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:37.240
 that's like very ankyly like it's got a lot of ankylos.

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.920
 - I mean, it kind of does.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.080
 If you look at like it's back and it has all these spikes

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.320
 and all this like crazy evolved armor.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.880
 And you think like all the intermediate steps

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.600
 like where it was like a little bump

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.360
 and it was like, oh, that bump helped protect it

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.440
 from dying from a T-Rex or whatever.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.200
 And that turns into a spike over how long?

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.040
 - I know.

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.760
 - Evolutionary stuff blows my mind.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.600
 Like to think of like, you just have these little building

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.000
 blocks for life and then you fast forward like hundreds

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 of millions of years and it like turns into these crazy shapes

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.360
 and crazy designs and organs and all these other things

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:15.360
 that are needed to like accomplish this thing of living.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.360
 It's just nuts.

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:21.360
 - Yeah, sometimes I wonder if you know how like in tech

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:26.240
 or like society or the world, usually it's like,

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:31.320
 there's like one crazy leap that like suddenly like spurs

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.880
 like a huge change.

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.720
 - Yeah.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.560
 - I do wonder if it's similar in evolution

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.800
 because I think we often imagine like,

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.200
 okay, like the armor, like yeah, I imagine the same way

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.920
 like where it developed like a tiny version of it.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.520
 It's like minuscule.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:43.360
 And then like-

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.120
 - But maybe it just jumps straight to full blown spikes

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:45.960
 like some shit.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:46.800
 - Yeah, it may be like that.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.200
 - It was a crazy mutation and it was like,

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:51.680
 it just fully covered its whole body and something or.

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.600
 - That's interesting.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.560
 - Yeah, I guess that was just so effective

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.840
 that like that like was a leap in terms of-

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.920
 - Yeah, it almost, it almost has to be that way.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.400
 - And here I am opining on very like probably known

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.680
 scientific facts, but like there's no way

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.280
 some intermediate step of a spike on an animal

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.400
 would protect it anymore, right?

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.240
 I don't know.

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.080
 - I don't know.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.320
 But maybe there's cases for both like, yeah, it is wild.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.880
 I think it's just one of those things where like the amount

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.960
 of time this stuff took issues incomprehensible.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.120
 - It's incomprehensible that's the word.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:21.960
 Yeah.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.360
 - It's like developing just that spike technology

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.480
 might have been like longer than all of humanity.

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.440
 - That's insane.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.960
 It's really, it's ludicrous.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.280
 And I've been getting into like quantum physics stuff

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.360
 and like astrology or which one's the one that's real

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.720
 and which one astronomy, astrology.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.560
 (laughing)

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.400
 - You know what?

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.240
 - You need to go find your brain

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.400
 before you get into these toddlers.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.640
 (laughing)

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.320
 - I really can't remember which one's real.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.320
 I think one of them is like the fake.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.360
 - Astrology is the science stuff.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:54.920
 Astronomy is looking at stuff in the sky.

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:58.400
 - Yeah, when you like get into like astronomy stuff,

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.160
 I just enjoy like to, I feel something

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.000
 when I listen to these types of books

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.840
 where they just talk about the crazy physics

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.400
 and underlie everything.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.320
 Just something about it just like blows my mind

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.080
 and I like to have my mind blown.

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.600
 That's why I like like books about time and all that.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.120
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.320
 Just like all that.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:21.320
 And then our little brain's trying to comprehend it.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:22.160
 I don't know.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.120
 It's just, it's wild.

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.960
 I have ever told you I want to,

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.360
 I've so badly wanted to make.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.480
 Do you remember "Spore"?

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.720
 There's like a game.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:30.560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.400
 - It was kind of, it's like,

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.840
 was there kind of like a let down and that like it wasn't?

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:35.680
 - Yeah.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.520
 So I've always, I wanted to make like

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.160
 the not let down version of that.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.000
 - Yeah.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.200
 - Like it's just in the back of my head,

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.400
 some version of that.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.600
 I don't know how you could do it,

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.680
 but some kind of game that's built on the premise

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.760
 of like evolving things

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.760
 and adapting to their environment.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.600
 Yeah.

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.200
 Yeah, like could you make something that surprised you

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.800
 as much as dinosaurs surprised me?

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.600
 Like where there's some in state in this game

00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.000
 that you just can't even anticipate.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.720
 I just, I think that'd be really cool.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:01.800
 - No, that's not really fun.

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.640
 - When are we doing that?

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:03.880
 When are we gonna retire and build video games?

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.000
 Sorry.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.640
 - Next, that's the next thing.

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.480
 - Okay, that's next.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.960
 - Before the $100 million, go ahead.

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.000
 - Here's my list of next things.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.520
 Once I don't have to work as much,

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:17.320
 I'm going to build a Plex competitor.

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.160
 - Oh, right.

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.240
 I just talked about the good day.

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.320
 - Really fast and doesn't have shitty stuff.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.160
 - Yeah, I was dealing with annoyances yesterday.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.400
 - I was too.

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.480
 - I literally have an item on my checklist today

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.400
 that's fixed Plex

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.680
 'cause I have this annoying DVR issue.

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.500
 Anyway.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.520
 - Yeah, it just constantly comes up.

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.640
 If I'm gonna fix it that much,

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:35.480
 I might as well just build it.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.720
 - I might as well just build the entire thing.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.160
 Yeah, that's totally the engineering solution.

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.000
 - Yeah.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.840
 So that, I want to write,

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.320
 I want to create a new program in language

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.880
 that is more functional,

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.840
 but composter single binary has a good type system.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.000
 It's like my ideal language.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:51.840
 That's one.

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:53.080
 - There is no,

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.000
 what's the closest thing?

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.960
 - I imagine something that looks like Elixir

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:00.840
 - That doesn't have the runtime.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.800
 - So that's a gleam,

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.560
 but composter, like a single binary would go

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.640
 with a really nice center library.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.480
 - Okay.

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.760
 - That's like, I want to build that.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.760
 - Yeah, okay.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.920
 Do it DAX.

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.280
 Call it, just call it DAX.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.160
 Just be like ultimate power move.

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.280
 Just call the language DAX.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.320
 And then build the game.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.880
 In the game you want to build,

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.760
 we've talked about this before.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.680
 The game you want to build is like,

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.200
 I think it overlaps with a lot of things I want to exist.

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.400
 I want to build.

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.840
 Like where we can like,

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.680
 it's multiplayer.

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.520
 - Share a world.

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.360
 - Some way.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.200
 - Yeah.

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.560
 - Share a world, kind of Minecraft-y, but not.

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.480
 - Yeah.

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.320
 - Yeah.

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.160
 - Yeah.

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.080
 - Let's get to all these things.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:39.920
 - Those are my things.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.000
 - Do you think there is actually a day

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.480
 where we want to work so much?

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.800
 Sometimes I wonder if I'm going to be saying that

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:44.640
 when I'm 75.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.600
 Like someday when I don't have to work so much,

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.160
 I'm going to do these things.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.400
 - I mean, when I can work,

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.280
 I don't think it's going to work so much.

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:57.080
 It's just like working on things with a different goal, I think.

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.600
 - Yeah.

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.280
 - Making that game the goal,

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.040
 like I don't have to like make a lot of money with it.

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.840
 - Yeah, the goal is just, it's fun.

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.680
 It'd be fun.

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.520
 - Yeah.

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.360
 It doesn't have to be a giant success.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.000
 It doesn't have to be venture scale.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.280
 (laughing)

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.360
 It's not working on venture scale things.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.360
 - Oh, do you have any reaction thoughts

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:20.680
 to all the VC stuff on Twitter I saw while I was on planes?

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.320
 - Oh man, I have so many thoughts to this.

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:24.160
 - Who's right?

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.320
 'Cause they're both like very angry.

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.160
 - These two.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.880
 - Paul, Paul, Brandon, David, Tex.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.320
 - They're right 'cause you're a VC company

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.160
 or you're a YC company.

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.000
 - No, no.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.120
 Those are the two fighting.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:33.960
 - Oh, right, right, right.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.200
 Sax versus, yeah, Paul Graham.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.040
 Yeah, yeah, sorry.

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:38.080
 You still laid out both sides, sorry.

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.480
 It's like a great suite of all time.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.840
 Who is Kendrick and who is one more?

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:43.080
 (laughing)

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:46.240
 - Oh, yeah.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.040
 No, I just heard Paul Graham and I immediately thought,

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.680
 oh, you're citing, like, you answered my question, who's right?

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.920
 And I figured it's--

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.120
 - Oh, yeah, I mean, I was gonna side with Paul Graham.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.200
 So for the longest time I found David's facts

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.440
 to be really insufferable

00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:00.080
 and I think he is wrong on most things

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.520
 in like a deep fundamental way and just gotten longer.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.160
 I'm sure there's some stuff that he's not wrong on.

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.360
 Whereas Paul Graham I have the inverse relationship with,

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.640
 I do find him annoying at times.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.280
 I feel like, I think where he struggles

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.880
 is he has a really hard time imagining

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:18.520
 a different type of personality than his own

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:21.600
 that also cares about the same things.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:26.560
 I think my annoyance with him is he just has this sense

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.840
 that anyone that cares about stuff he cares about,

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:35.600
 the way he thinks also must be this hyper introverted,

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.760
 just like very narrow, like SF type persona,

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.880
 like I think that's what he imagines.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.840
 And he struggles to imagine outside of that.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.800
 But outside of that,

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:50.560
 I find him to be generally very correct on most things.

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.840
 Zero consistency with what side he's on.

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:58.440
 I think you can see him swing from traditional bubbles

00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.440
 into like the opposite.

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.080
 Like I think he like truly thinks independently.

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:07.520
 And I find him in places where like he was contrarian

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.760
 in a way where everyone else in the industry

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.880
 was kind of focused on like leading one way

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.560
 and he actually thought about it from scratch.

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.240
 And the other thing that I really appreciate

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.960
 about this whole situation is it's something

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.600
 that I really value, maybe it's my number one value.

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.120
 So in this situation, these two VCs are fighting

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:27.200
 'cause they are fighting over the situation

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.160
 that happened to the the benefits founder.

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:34.240
 And Paul Graham is just, his approach is very simple.

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:37.560
 The benefits founder is my friend and it doesn't matter.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.600
 Like I'm just gonna back like the fuck out of it.

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.440
 Like I'm just gonna have 100% be on his side

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.960
 and be in his corner because I chose my side with him.

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.760
 And that's like if he goes down, I go down.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.560
 If he goes up, I go up that type of thing.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.720
 And I think that's like a really great,

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.280
 just way to be and way to live.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.880
 Whereas I think I think a lot of people,

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:01.240
 like it's hard to find that level of loyalty,

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.920
 especially in VC.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.400
 - There's almost like the crowd wants to like shame you

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.520
 for that, like you're just biased or you're just,

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.360
 but like you're saying, it's actually a good thing.

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.480
 Like you're loyal to this person

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.600
 that you decided to back a long time ago.

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:14.440
 - Yeah.

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:16.880
 - And that's enough of a reason to continue to back them.

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.720
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.440
 Like you made a commitment and you're sticking with it.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.360
 And yeah, like you'll take whatever.

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.200
 If they do something and it causes a problem for you,

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.040
 like you're gonna take it,

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.840
 you're not gonna like, wreath a lot of it, right?

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:29.040
 So that's like a level of like honor

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:31.520
 that I think that is not that common.

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.800
 So yeah, that situation was funny.

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.640
 - My only annoyance, my only annoyance with Paul Graham

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.800
 is his Twitter avatar.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.120
 I feel like if he changes the avatar,

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.680
 somebody posted like a full photo of him through all this

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.640
 and it was like, it looks so much kinder in that photo.

00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.440
 I don't know, just maybe think about it, Paul.

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.360
 Just the avatar is not doing any favors.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.360
 It kind of looks angry.

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.720
 Like he's like speaking or something,

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.360
 but it's just like this expression on his face.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.200
 - He was like interrupting you.

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.400
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.120
 It's somehow like, it's the perfect personification

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.480
 of how I read his tweets.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.640
 Like how I read every one of his tweets like that.

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.800
 And I feel like it could, he could do better.

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:06.720
 Even a little friendlier.

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.080
 - Yeah, yeah, it is funny.

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:12.400
 My favorite part about all this was,

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.680
 this was so good.

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.600
 I love this part.

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:18.880
 Matthew Prince, who's the CEO of CloudFlare,

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.920
 commented on this.

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:21.760
 - I think I saw it.

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:25.880
 - And then David Sacks replied going,

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.280
 I don't even know who you are,

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.960
 which is like a very classic dunk, right?

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.280
 Typically that would work

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.760
 because a person talking shit

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:34.880
 is like a nobody that's never done anything.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.760
 But saying that's a CEO of CloudFlare

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.920
 when you're supposed to be this like tech.

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.440
 So like Valley person.

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.120
 - Yeah, yeah, it's like so backfired.

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.720
 - Yeah, and I laughed so hard

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:50.120
 'cause the railway CEO posted that meme

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.360
 with the traditionally like the guy complaining

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.560
 and then the other guy going,

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.200
 I don't think about you at all.

00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.040
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:57.880
 - But he inverted it.

00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.160
 So the guy was like, I don't know who you are.

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.920
 Then Don Draper was like, wait, what?

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.340
 (laughing)

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:05.940
 That's not how this shows.

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.280
 (laughing)

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.920
 Like of course, you know who I am.

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.760
 - Yeah.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.600
 (laughing)

00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.960
 - Yeah, so it's really funny.

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:17.160
 But it seems like this,

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:21.760
 I think ever since the Israeli stuff started happening,

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.720
 there's been a fracture in this community.

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.640
 Like this, BC is interesting

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.720
 'cause it's so much about social connections

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.520
 and like networking and like,

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.080
 it's like a lot of it is that aspect.

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.920
 So everyone rides this like weird line

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.160
 where they like all act kind of friendly with each other

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.120
 'cause they don't know who's going to need at some point.

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.720
 But obviously there's tensions that build up.

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.280
 And I think after the whole Israel thing

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.280
 that was like the spark.

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.280
 And now that's cascading to all sorts of things.

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.000
 And it's like crazy fracturing happened.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:55.840
 I'm seeing people stay.

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:57.400
 - There's like punches being thrown.

00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.800
 - Yeah, like there's stuff that they won't recover from.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:02.280
 Like there's things that have been done where,

00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:05.040
 okay, these two VC firms will like never be on a deal.

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.600
 Together ever again, has like fracturing

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:09.560
 in like a million ways.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.240
 And all this political stuff with the election now,

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:15.920
 I saw a tweet that I think was so interesting.

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.680
 And I think it's a great way to put it.

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:21.640
 And they were like, it's clear that politics is this

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:25.520
 like crazy, crazy drug that'll just melt your brain.

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:29.120
 Like it'll just completely wreck you in a same way

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.600
 that some like crazy drug would,

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.520
 but like very normal people just go and do lines of it.

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.600
 Like without thinking.

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.120
 And I feel like it's what's happening.

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.840
 Like it's like melting people's brains.

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:43.760
 Like even these really like so-called like very intellectual,

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.840
 like smart people, it's like eroding them down

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.680
 to like being really, really stupid.

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.760
 Like even Paul Graham, who I respect a lot,

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:53.280
 like after the whole Trump assassination thing,

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:56.600
 he was like, finds like a weird angle to like minimize it.

00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:00.720
 And I'm like, like, like people just aren't thinking clearly

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:01.560
 at all.

00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:03.240
 This stuff is completely like melting.

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.880
 Like I really want to talk just with you

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:08.120
 about US politics stuff.

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:10.480
 I'm just terrified to talk about it on the podcast.

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.840
 I don't even, 'cause I,

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:14.120
 it just feels like this thing you just don't touch.

00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.800
 And I know like historically you don't,

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.640
 you don't talk about politics and religion,

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.720
 but it's like different now.

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:23.720
 It's like on a level of like concern for just safety,

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:26.480
 not wanting to say anything publicly for either side

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.600
 to pick apart.

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.680
 And I don't know, not that like we have this huge audience

00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:33.760
 that like I'm a famous person and he's aware about what I say.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.320
 It's just kind of like a thing I don't want

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.800
 to even be involved in.

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.160
 And I don't know what that says.

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.000
 - Yeah.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.960
 And I think that for me, it's two sides.

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.880
 Like I've seen, there are some tweets in our circle

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.520
 that were like slightly political

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.800
 and I saw the crazy responses to it.

00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.640
 Like way crazier than saying tailwind sucks.

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:51.520
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.880
 Which is crazy enough.

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.880
 (laughing)

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.320
 I know the replies you get to say things that when sucks.

00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:00.120
 You think those were extreme, but like these are like,

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.440
 wait, like people like don't give you an inch at all.

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.000
 Like there's no effort out at all.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.120
 And on the flip side, then you like react to that stuff

00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:10.360
 and you get pulled in, which is why it's like this crazy drug

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.760
 that just like completely deteriorates your ability to think.

00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:17.680
 So I think privately, I've actually been really plugged into it

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.760
 because I just find it like it's hard not to be.

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:20.600
 - Yeah.

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:23.480
 - Like really when I really enjoyed the drug quite a lot.

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:27.680
 You're melting the brain on the weekends quite a bit.

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.040
 - Yeah, I don't do it in public, you know.

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:32.480
 But not probably, yeah, it's a respectable thing to do.

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.920
 - Yeah, but it is like, you know, I thought in the day

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:36.760
 we can intellectualize it all we want

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:38.800
 and make it seem like it's as big important thing

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.120
 as all we want, but it is the greatest reality show

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.600
 that has ever happened and it happens every four years

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.640
 and we all just can't resist watching the drama.

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:50.240
 - It's so true, but I do feel like the stakes

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:53.560
 from like a societal sticking together standpoint

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:55.560
 are getting higher and higher and ratcheting higher.

00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:57.680
 Like as much as I wish it was just entertainment actually.

00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.600
 At this point, it feels like it's actually affecting--

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.440
 - Yeah, it sucks.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.400
 - Just like the tension is getting violent.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.640
 - Yeah, exactly.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:09.520
 It's resulting in real world ramifications for both sides

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.320
 from like a civil war kind of standpoint.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.240
 I don't know if that's dramatic,

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.640
 but like just the tension and the violence feels like

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:19.720
 it's always there and it's just very,

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.040
 at the presence of boiling over.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.920
 - I mean, it just reminds you that it's the default state

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.400
 of most of history.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.960
 It's kind of in that way.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.160
 - So, yeah, I don't know where those all go.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.800
 It's like you can't just keep ratcheting up forever.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.880
 - Right, yeah, on a more light note,

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.240
 I was thinking the other day,

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.720
 and I meant to tweet something about this,

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.240
 is there been like, what's the precedent for tailwind?

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.680
 Is this technology that if you say tailwind,

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.240
 people get so angry on both sides.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.000
 If you say you don't like it or you do like it,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.080
 it's so polarizing like US politics.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.040
 Is there a precedent like a previous technology

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.560
 that had that effect?

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.200
 Is tailwind the first to be like that?

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.040
 - No, no JS.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.760
 - Okay, not as much today, probably.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.640
 - I mean, the joke is still around,

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.760
 but like I don't remember,

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.480
 and I didn't use no JS for a very, very, very long time.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:13.280
 But I do remember like people using it.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.440
 Like, yeah, there was like crazy arguments over it.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.440
 They're like, it's stupid.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.600
 - It was like, I mean, it was like,

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.160
 that was like the first JavaScript on the back end.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.400
 - Yeah, right, like a serious scale, I guess.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.760
 I don't know, there's probably some obscure thing

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.920
 before that, but so you think just the idea,

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.160
 like people were very polarized

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.720
 because just the idea of running JavaScript

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.720
 on the back end in the first place.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.360
 And then whether it was the actual implementation

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.760
 or people involved was maybe a thing that.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.480
 - Yeah, I do remember that being polarizing.

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.320
 There's some like eternal ones, like types,

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:50.320
 aesthetically type stuff that has always been like,

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.880
 people would, that was like probably the first,

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.800
 like when I was first getting into tech,

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.720
 I do remember people already about

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.640
 data versus dynamic typing, all the time.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.440
 - There's like ideas, like tabs for spaces.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.280
 - Right, right, right.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.520
 - There's like these ideas that have historically had,

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.000
 you know, Emacs and them, like the two sides,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.200
 it's like gang wars.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.800
 But I've never, like, I couldn't think of a technology,

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.080
 like a library or something that like has a team behind it

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.920
 building it that brings up so much like intense feeling

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.640
 on both sides, like tail end.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.480
 - Yeah, I think what's similar to the node

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:26.480
 and the tail end thing is, and people will observe that

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.920
 whenever something has this level of controversy,

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.000
 it ends up being massively successful.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.960
 But I think what's going on is the form

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.680
 of this debate always takes,

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.640
 it's like almost the exact same in both cases.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.880
 You'll have the side that doesn't like it.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.160
 Their framing of it will be like,

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.320
 this is dumbing something down.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.240
 And you don't need it dumbed down.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.520
 It's like unnecessary.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.240
 Just use this other thing that you just spent some time

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.240
 to learn it and you can do it.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.080
 - Yeah.

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:02.520
 - The reason that side always ends up losing is,

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.040
 their observation is correct.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.320
 It is dumbing something down.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.240
 It is making something easier.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.160
 And that will always gain traction, right?

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.000
 - Yeah.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.840
 - So I think that's the same case with Node.js,

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:13.920
 same case with tailwind.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.720
 There's just some stuff that you just can't fight.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:16.560
 - Yeah.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.800
 - 'Cause it just makes something more accessible or easier

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.640
 to understand.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:23.160
 It just hit me that neither of us are extreme here,

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.440
 but I'm pro-tailwind, you're sort of not pro-tailwind.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.640
 Or you just don't use tailwind.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:28.640
 You don't, I just don't use it.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.480
 You're bothered.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.320
 Yeah.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.560
 You kind of have fun with it on Twitter,

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.680
 but we've never had like an intense argument about it.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.680
 So it's interesting that like,

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.680
 it seems to be more of a Twitter phenomenon,

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.720
 like a angry at people from a distance.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.320
 If you're actually like in a room with somebody talking

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.400
 about tailwind, you're probably not quite as passionate.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.280
 - The thing, the feeling I get whenever I get these kinds

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:55.000
 of replies is you have nothing else.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.880
 But if people that get so worked out over this,

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:57.720
 it's like-

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.720
 - Oh, that's actually-

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.360
 - I'm being harsh 'cause I want them to fricking stop.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:04.320
 But it's, I get these replies all the time, right?

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.800
 Like I work in dev tools.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.000
 I am someone that spends all my time working in dev tools.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.040
 I spent in a ridiculous amount of time

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.320
 compared to the average person,

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.920
 exploring just the random shit in the spaces that is my job.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.000
 - Yeah.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.480
 - Despite that, whenever I talk about something,

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:24.360
 people will insert like their random technology

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.240
 that they love as though I probably have never heard of it,

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.680
 because that is the only thing they have.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.840
 They have this identity that I know about this thing.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.840
 That's cool.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.480
 And nobody else knows about it.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.040
 And I'm a replies person who literally gets paid

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.280
 to look at this stuff.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.200
 I was assuming that they don't,

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.680
 they don't really know what it is.

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.520
 - Yeah.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.280
 - So I get that with like the anti-tailwind people

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.320
 who are like, I'm good at CSS.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.040
 And I love that about myself.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.560
 And I need to like obsessively talk about it.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.720
 The people that use tailwind,

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.560
 that are the equal thing on the other side.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.080
 They're like, I'm using this cool thing.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.160
 It's like the future.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.360
 And like people hate it, but like we're like rebellion.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.400
 It's like, they wrap all this shit around it

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.160
 where I have other stuff I do that with.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.600
 I'm not gonna do it here, you know?

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.440
 - Yeah.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.120
 It's fair.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.200
 - Yeah.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.040
 All they have.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:13.880
 - It's all they have.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:14.720
 Poor guys.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.560
 Poor people.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:16.400
 - Okay.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.480
 Well, that's an interesting note to end on,

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.800
 but I do think we should end on that note.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.840
 (laughing)

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.720
 - Well, do you have to pee?

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.880
 - I actually don't.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:25.920
 I ran out of water.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:28.120
 My throat's very dry, so I would like to fill it.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.680
 And other, other things I gotta do today.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.240
 I've actually got a giant list.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:37.560
 It's Casey and I, I think of this a lot.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.200
 For some reason, I used to play like golf.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.400
 In golf, there's like four days to every tournament,

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.360
 Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:48.360
 And I just randomly decide a day is moving day.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.360
 This is what they call it on Saturday in a golf tournament.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.960
 Like it's the day you're trying to jump up

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.040
 the leaderboard before Sunday.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.640
 It's like you go more aggressive,

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:59.240
 you go more big ambition on Saturday, moving day

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.320
 in a golf tournament.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.320
 Today is moving day.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.440
 We got a lot to get done.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.920
 It's been like a few days of kind of like playing it safe,

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.720
 getting a little bit here and there done.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.680
 And today is like, we got a giant checklist.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.760
 And record podcast was on that checklist.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.680
 And so did my duty.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.040
 I recorded a podcast.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.000
 I came back 101.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.020
 We did it, 100 wasn't the end.

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.360
 Oh, the memes that could have been.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.560
 (laughing)

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:27.080
 It's like every like, even number,

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.560
 we gotta like watch out for you.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.800
 Yeah, we really do.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.880
 110 to be honest, not out of the water yet.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.400
 (laughing)

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.280
 111 I guess would be more, more exciting.

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.080
 Today's not gonna be a moving day for me.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.600
 I went to bed at like 4 a.m. yesterday.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.640
 4 a.m.

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.240
 What are you working on something?

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.080
 Exciting.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.600
 I like stop working early 'cause this migraine thing happened.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.960
 And then I like completely normal at midnight.

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.760
 So when I was like, really hyped up to go work on stuff.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.000
 Yeah.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.600
 Okay, I said, I said we were getting off here.

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.920
 But now I just reminded me of something.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:01.280
 I just thought of you when you were talking about

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.240
 kind of like completing the multiplexer

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:06.760
 and you shipped this giant thing into SST

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.400
 and all the lines of go you've written.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.760
 I've seen some of the tweets and I just thought of like,

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:15.000
 I know that feeling when you finish a giant project.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.360
 It's like, it's an amazing feeling,

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.560
 but it also kind of like,

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:19.920
 you feel a little dead inside the next day

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.040
 when it's like, I'm shifting into something different today.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.320
 Like whatever day that is,

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:28.120
 maybe there's a little bit of like a halo

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.640
 or like a minute of like stuff you still gotta get done

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.840
 wrap up like little stuff.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:33.680
 You basically shipped it,

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.240
 but like you're dealing with some of the little here and there.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.800
 But then the first day where it's like,

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.400
 I'm actually picking up on the next thing.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.040
 It's kind of a depressing thing to me.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.960
 It's like I've been so in the zone in a context

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.360
 working on one singular thing

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.360
 that once it's shipped, it's kind of bittersweet.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.320
 It's like, now I gotta work on the next thing

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.640
 and there's kind of a ramp up process

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.800
 to get really into it again.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.440
 And I don't know, do you feel that?

01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:00.080
 - I don't think that's really how I think,

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.840
 if you take a little bit of scenario you're describing,

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.840
 I probably would feel that way,

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.720
 but I actually haven't worked on anything like that.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.680
 Like I didn't, I wasn't working on as multiplexer

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.320
 just working on it and getting it done.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.520
 I was working on it like one or two days out of the week.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.360
 - Oh, interesting.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.720
 Okay, so I'm more of an obsessive.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:21.720
 Yeah, I'm more of like a go dive hard on one thing,

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:23.800
 come up for air once it's done.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.880
 I think that's my personality.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.560
 - There was a week of that with a multiplexer

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.280
 when I like, when all the abstractions were failing me

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:33.160
 and I just had to like just go to lowest level.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.000
 - Yeah.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:34.840
 - There was like a week of that

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.360
 and that was crazy and I haven't had that in a long time,

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:40.240
 but yeah, I feel like I'm always like,

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.520
 okay, so the thing with me is

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.320
 I can work many, many, many hours,

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:50.280
 but I can only work a couple hours on a single thing.

01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:53.960
 So I tend to like do a burst on one thing

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:54.840
 and do a burst on another thing,

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.920
 then do a burst on another thing.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:56.760
 - That is the thing.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:57.600
 - I don't think it's a hard constraint,

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.840
 but that just is like my habit.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.480
 - Yeah, I'm not good at the context switches.

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.480
 There's just a big loss of something for me when I do that.

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.080
 I love talking about the multiplexer on here.

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.160
 I don't want to stop talking about it

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.520
 'cause it just sounds so made up.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.840
 Just sounds like we're just, like it's a gag.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.680
 Like we're just trying to see if anyone calls us out

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.000
 on the multiplexer that Dax is working on.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.680
 - It sounds like a time machine.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.520
 - I was gonna say, what is that like flex capacitor,

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.880
 whatever that's like flex capacitor?

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:21.720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:22.560
 - Flex capacitor.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:23.680
 - Yeah, it sounds like that.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.200
 - It sounds so made up.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.360
 - You know what's crazy about it?

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:30.080
 For how like weird it was,

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.000
 this was one of our like lowest bug launches ever.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.520
 Like I launched it and I was like staring at the ion channel.

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.920
 Like just waiting.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.440
 And like 24 hours went by

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.960
 and like nobody reported any issue.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.320
 - Oh man, that's crazy.

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:43.400
 'Cause it seems like the kind of thing

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:45.160
 that you can have a ton of little bugs.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.760
 Different emulators, different.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.600
 - Yeah.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.400
 - And to not have a bunch of issues, that's amazing.

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.240
 Good job Dax.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.080
 First try.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.480
 - Yeah, it is.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.080
 - First time ever, whatever it was.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.840
 - First time ever at a first try.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.240
 Whatever it is.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.080
 But yeah, it worked really well

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.160
 and we've gotten like really good feedback on it.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.280
 And you saw some of the crazier stuff

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.120
 - I love it.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.320
 - Like spinning up tunnels and all that stuff.

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.360
 So it's funny 'cause someone replied to,

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.200
 when I launched it, they were like,

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.840
 this is not something that I need at all.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.640
 Like I wish you would focus on other things instead of this,

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:25.360
 but I guess, you know, all engineers need to like scratch

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.280
 their like random things.

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:30.240
 And it's so funny how inaccurate that was

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.520
 because for the longest time,

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.440
 I was like, I don't want to fucking build this thing.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.320
 - Yeah, this is not a good thing you'd want to do.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.160
 - I don't want to build it.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.000
 I don't want to build it.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.880
 And just things kept stacking up as like,

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.040
 this would get solved if we do this.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.040
 This would get solved if we do this.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.680
 This book stops even being possible.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.640
 We had to get giant list of things that it fixed.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.640
 And I was like forced into doing it.

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.840
 And obviously once it got into it, I got into it, but.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.680
 - Yeah.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.960
 - But not a thing you'd be looking for is funny.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.520
 - Yeah, I did not make an excuse to do this at all.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.720
 (laughing)

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.440
 - Oh, it's solved a lot of pain points for me.

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.480
 I mean, it's things that like,

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.480
 I couldn't have articulated the right solution,

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.520
 but when I see it, it's like, obviously,

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.800
 this is what it should have been and needed to be.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:10.640
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.280
 - The multiplexer, it's a real thing.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.240
 - It's real. - Look it up.

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.280
 Is it still called mosaic,

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.880
 or did you just roll it into SSC dev?

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:17.880
 I haven't even seen.

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.280
 - Hey, just SSC dev now.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.720
 - Oh, nice.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.840
 - When does I on go away?

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.840
 When does that word gonna leave?

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.320
 - We're working on a migration guide right now.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:32.320
 We're planning on launching moving ion2v3 next Tuesday.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.320
 - I don't know if that happened.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.160
 - Whoa.

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.000
 - I'm still gonna make-- - I'm so gonna make--

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:35.840
 - Oh, I'm forever. - I'm forever.

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.040
 - I'm forever source of terminal repo

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.120
 and I'm making a video about it.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:38.960
 - Oh, nice.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:39.800
 - Essentially this weekend.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.640
 - Yeah, cool.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.040
 Are you gonna like get rid of all the get history

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.320
 or people who make fun of me for us in Korea?

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.160
 Okay, cool.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.720
 (laughing)

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.400
 Always, I always see that.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.640
 - Yeah, it's just kind of like pre-rec was it.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.640
 - Yeah.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.440
 - All right, now we really do gotta go.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.280
 - Okay.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.520
 - I got so many things on this list.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.340
 This has been fun though.

01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.180
 - All right, enjoy.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.760
 - All right, see you next time.

01:11:58.760 --> 01:11:59.600
 - Yep.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.180
 (upbeat music)
