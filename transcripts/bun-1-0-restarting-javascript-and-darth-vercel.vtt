WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 I am just curious because is there just gonna be a future where we just never see Adam?

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.980
 How's it going? Good, I think. You think? I think? I think good. You can't tell. How do you feel?

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.460
 I don't know. Just something about you started this. You said you throw it on Twitch and it occurred to me like

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.540
 how long it's been since I've even been on Twitch and

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.060
 And it's it's almost like I

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.300
 Don't know. Did I just have a little stint as a content creator and then I decided that wasn't for me

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.300
 Is that what happened? I can't decide

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.380
 I've been wondering that too

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.740
 It's about me or you know about you

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:10.860
 He's just been slowly retreating. You're not around as much. I'm really not and you're just a fading memory and all reminds

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.500
 The way you put it then just it stings a little I got yeah

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.260
 I got on Twitter yesterday

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.940
 For like 15 minutes and I said like a fury of messages and replies and whatever. Yeah, I don't know

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.900
 I don't know if I'm coming back. I don't know. Maybe this was just a gradual. It was a what's the is a soft landing

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.620
 No, what's the phrase? I'm looking for there was a phrase in pop culture and I can't think of what it is soft landing

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.940
 Oh, like 15 minutes of fame. No, I wasn't going there

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.980
 No, like instead of like an abrupt I'm leaving. I'm not coming back to the internet

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.620
 It's been kind of a slow fade

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.900
 Slow burn away. I don't like that. I don't like that you're doing that if that's what you're doing

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.380
 But that's what you end up doing

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.260
 And then what are you gonna do you're just gonna be using me alone? Well, no, I mean I have my family. You are any friends

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.860
 This is getting okay

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.500
 I was thinking about it yesterday actually like what what did I want out of doing any of that like anything?

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.740
 I did

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.140
 Publicly what was I what did I really want out of it? And I can't think of a single thing

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.020
 like that I actually won out of it in life like I

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:32.840
 Think meeting all of you people. I consider friends now. That was probably the only thing I really

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.940
 That will stick that that I actually like lasts and I care about yeah, I'm excited to go to twitchcon meet with

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.260
 All of these friends I've made on twitch

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.380
 But I don't know how much I care about doing any of the things that you do

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.420
 as a content creator

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.340
 I don't like the phrase content creator. I don't like saying it. I don't like it coming out of my lips

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.660
 Well, I don't think of myself as a content creator. I don't either. You're not your developer

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.280
 But you talk about things you don't have to be a content creator. It's funny though because I get I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.420
 Understand there's like it's unclear. I think people are

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.780
 Confused by exactly what the parameters of what I do are because I get messages all the time now from people asking me to do like

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.540
 Content creator type things and it's kind of weird because I'm like I

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.620
 Actually don't do that kind of thing

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.380
 Because it would be weird if I just started though like because it's always people that are like hey you want to like

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.220
 We're working on this product

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.740
 Like would you like to like talk about it or like it would just be so random for me to just to start talking about some

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.220
 Project reviewing it. That's actually not anywhere close to anything. I do

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.900
 Like I'm just out there trying to sell my own product like I don't I don't have time to also sell your product, you know

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.580
 Yeah, that would be weird if you did that by the way, it would it would feel weird

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.700
 I'm muted on Twitch by the way

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.620
 Guest no audio is it possible that they're all trolling us. No, they're not because I don't I don't see your bars moving

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.540
 I'm still talking. This is me talking idiot Linux. There we go. No, just clicking the wrong thing

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.900
 Input on my bike thinking that would I'm dumb. Okay, there we go. There we go. We agree. I'm just kidding

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.540
 You're not done. Okay cutting the podcast is gonna have a time. Thankfully. We don't rely on our own competence to do

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.140
 The podcast recordings. That's just all Riverside. I'm sure our podcasts are great because Chris is great

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.740
 Yeah, we are you do you think you'll ever find do you think we're just like a phase? I don't know

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.460
 I have this thing where I go through faces. I don't know if you know this about me

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.700
 You're defining characteristic

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.380
 Yeah, what did I do with that like what what good is that in the world to be like?

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:58.300
 Really good at having really intense phases and then never visiting it again all of life is just one big phase

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.980
 So, you know, it's not any different. I don't understand you live and you die and then you can say what good was it all?

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.260
 But you know well, it is very different like someone who's like I'm gonna be a lawyer for 35 years and then retire

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.580
 And I'm like I'm gonna be this for two months really hard

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.900
 And then I'm not gonna do it anymore. What do I do with that?

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.020
 I mean I have stuck with software development like I've done that for 15 years now. So I do have some staying power

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.380
 I guess when it comes to like things that pay the bills

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:33.820
 But when it comes to hobbies, yeah, but I mean the hobbies are gonna rotate I feel like I think even for me even for me

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.820
 like I haven't really been on twitch as much

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.220
 But I am just curious because is there just gonna be a future where we just never see Adam?

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.940
 That's what I wonder. I wonder if I will completely fade out of public

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.860
 Spirit 100% and I'm less interested in that from like an external point of view

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.300
 I'm more interested in that if you're gonna like what are you gonna be doing with all your time?

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.820
 I said you have no friends. Hi, listen. We'll still do the podcast. So I mean

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.780
 Ken guy who is on a podcast twice a week really say he's faded out of the public

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.140
 Depends how well the podcast is doing. Yeah. Yeah, it does feel though

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:20.020
 It feels like the more I drift away from Twitter and I haven't streamed for months and I have no intentions

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.980
 I've ever created another YouTube video. It does feel like

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:30.900
 There's a world where I'm really not on the internet much and I don't know that I feel that bad about it

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.900
 I just I just don't know what I'm giving up. I think like

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.620
 friends

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.900
 but like I can still be friendly and hang out on discord and talk with people and go to events occasionally

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:48.180
 To hang out like there's still like plenty of opportunities for touch points with people I actually want to interact with

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.180
 Yeah, yeah

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.740
 So I just don't know what I'm missing like if you did what I'm doing if you just fade it out of all these social media places

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.540
 Would you feel like you're missing a certain something and what is that something?

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.460
 Yeah, cuz I think for me. It's all roped up into

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.460
 What I'm trying to do career wise like I'm trying to have

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:13.420
 Certain impact to be able to pull certain levers like and I've just been building that up over time. So for me all that stuff is

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.740
 Highly connected. I definitely have

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:25.140
 It's just again one of those things where when you first start doing something it has to be like the thing you think about all the time

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.500
 Then you get better at it and it's like less of like the primary thing you're doing. So I think I've definitely shifted out of

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:36.300
 Okay, like, you know establishing a presence online is like my primary focus. Like that's like no longer something

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.700
 I have to think about it's a little bit automatic. Yeah, but it's not gonna ever go to

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.660
 Zero or I can't imagine it because it's it's so tight in like I can't

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:51.420
 Do any of what I want to do if I'm invisible, you know, yeah, no, that makes sense

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.660
 So my I guess my work is pretty detached

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.860
 from

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:01.780
 Anything I do publicly the public stuff was always just sort of like a bolt on us. Yeah, it was optional. Yeah

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:09.000
 Yeah, I see how it works for you. Like you've kind of got this whole thing going. That's just it's a nice flywheel

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.420
 Yeah, I don't have that. Yeah, I

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.300
 do miss just seeing like

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.300
 Names and twitch chat. I do miss the hanging out

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:24.180
 Just the aspects of but I mean like I it was it was never sustainable in the sense that I wasn't really working

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.740
 I was streaming I don't know if I'm capable. I'm finally

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.700
 After years of denying it

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:40.020
 Really eating into my amount of productive hours and it like likewise. Yeah, but maybe yeah, maybe there's a slower

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.020
 But I'm just not good at like

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.660
 slower burn. I'm not good at like I'll just do it once a week

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.860
 I'm just not good at like dipping my toes and things. No, it makes sense

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.100
 It's hard like I said as soon as I lost the habit. I just went to zero

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:58.940
 It didn't cut to like 20% so yeah, I think it's on this stuff that it is so let's let's change gears

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.620
 Yeah, and let's talk about the one thing we have to talk about

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:09.660
 Because bun 1.0 came out last week and that's oh, right, right, right? That's been everywhere. It's everywhere

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.780
 Well, I mean have you I mean you not being on Twitter as much as it I did

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:20.780
 Showing up. I mean I've been on Twitter like twice in the last week and it has shown up in my face quite a lot

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.220
 And I read the blog post. I'm gonna read the release

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:29.500
 Just all the details around the release and impressive. I'm gonna let you start though

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:35.240
 Yeah, I like infinite thoughts on this. I can probably talk about this for a while. Yeah, so bun 1.0 came out

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.980
 I guess to me. I didn't really see initially going into I knew it was gonna come out. I didn't know I

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.640
 Like was kind of like this isn't feel major to me because I've been

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.700
 Trying to use it like pretty much once a week

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:54.300
 I would like check in and see how it works. You like what part like what part of SST would it fail on?

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.160
 Yeah, and I really got checked out and we'll get a little bit further

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.660
 Another hit 1.0. Just like, you know, it must be the same thing

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.980
 But when I watched their video that they put together for their

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.340
 official

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.340
 Release announcement it was actually

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.580
 Pretty exciting

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.700
 Because I think I kind of got desensitized to some of what they were doing because it's been following it for so long

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.060
 But then putting it together and laying out like here's every single thing we're trying to do

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.100
 Here's how much progress we made on it. Here's all the little nice things that we fixed

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:29.820
 It was cool to see it all together and I see and even I got a little bit more hyped and I see why

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:37.460
 the reaction from the community was insane like people are going crazy everyone's like super excited and happy and

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.460
 Kind of all I saw people tweeting about

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:45.460
 So overwhelmingly positive like very few things are received this well, of course, there's the random haters that are

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:53.940
 Always there, but really very very few of them. I think everyone just sounds super excited. Yeah, it's like a I didn't realize

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.660
 they were

00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.860
 Taking on all these I didn't realize it'd be getting rid of my package manager and it'd be getting rid of my

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:07.180
 Bundler potentially it kind of makes the turbo pack and the like weirder extent Rome

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.060
 Just look like like what were they what were they doing?

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:17.980
 Why are they still doing stuff if if this was happening and it happened so quickly. Yeah, I mean I say so quickly

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.020
 I don't know how long they've been working on it, but

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:25.420
 It was just Jared for a year at least I think I was following him for like a year when you first started talking about it

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.740
 And then he raised money and that was another year. So it's probably like a little over two years

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.740
 I would guess yeah, obviously very impressive

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.220
 Yeah, so I saw that and I saw what we're talking about and I've and I got more hype than I was

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:42.740
 And then I went to go. Okay. I'm like right now that it's out people keep people have been prodding me to do this

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.540
 But obviously a lot more people started to ask hey can we deploy?

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.140
 bun functions bun fungz

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.220
 Whatever you want to call them

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:59.460
 Through assets really bun funs is that and I've been saying is because it's fun. Okay. That's fun. Yeah bun fun

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:04.340
 Everyone's upset a bun for not using bun time as the runtime thing

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:09.640
 My argument was if they called it bun time, I think they would delay enterprise adoption by like three

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:16.100
 Exactly

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.380
 extracurricular activity

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:24.380
 Even just a logo I feel like something back at least two years. Oh, yeah, it is really cute though

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:29.980
 And did I see they made cookies? Oh the crew looked really good. They did look really good. Yeah, they're the whole event there

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:37.500
 I'm cutting right now like I'm trying to lose another five pounds in a week. I've lost five pounds a week for like three weeks

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:44.060
 Yeah, I want to eat everything and everyone keeps posting all these pictures on Twitter of like delicious looking stuff

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.940
 Sorry, continue. Yeah, even if that like random cookie that got is getting me excited. I'm sure

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:54.780
 Yeah, it sounds like you've been on your diet for a little bit. Yeah, it's been a bit I started to implement

00:12:54.780 --> 00:13:00.300
 So, okay, let me just try the AWS Lambda custom runtime get button in there. I talked to

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:06.460
 I think this may Maxine. He's the one that has a really cool site that does like the daily benchmark runtime

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:12.260
 Yeah, he's gonna get bun added in there. I think I've got this exact hype cycle of bun before too

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.500
 Like I realized like like when I talk about this

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.420
 I don't want to sound negative on the project like I'm very excited and optimistic for it

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.300
 but I just need to like lay out some the realities there's a lot in the way and

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.980
 The end result might not actually be as exciting as we want. There's like so many different factors to this

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:36.620
 So we can't really use it on AWS Lambda because we put it on the custom runtime. It's like a 500 millisecond cold start

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:41.660
 It's not really viable, but but I saw like where Jared quote tweeted your your tweet and

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:46.620
 Beznick was his name one of the serverless das responded

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:52.460
 That they'll take it to the product team. Do you think there's like why couldn't AWS say that every single time with everything?

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.700
 So do you think like there's there's real?

00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:01.380
 It's a long shot that they would actually add bun is a supported runtime. Yeah, first party

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.860
 I think it's a long shot

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.820
 But if I was someone at AWS and I was in charge

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:12.900
 I would be like we need to figure out how to be the first to ship native support for this and like really compete with

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.340
 Cloudflight workers because that's like been like the thing that's in the background being like

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.820
 Are they gonna supplain AWS one day?

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:25.440
 Yeah, and I can see them really doubling down on bun maybe even like acquiring it and like just being

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:31.180
 Interest the best place to run again. You don't have to change your applications. That's a main issue with Cloudflare workers

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:36.420
 Amazing platform, but it's like completely next generation. You have to build all new stuff for it

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:43.700
 This would be just node compatible everything. Yeah, exactly if like a large percentage of node applications could just invisibly get upgraded

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.380
 That's like I can't think of any other company in the world better position

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:52.900
 I was to like really take advantage of the work being done here. Yeah, I don't I'm skeptical

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.820
 They will put this stuff together. I feel like they don't really bet in this direction

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:03.380
 I think they like more react to we have customer demand and to reach it through certain threshold and then we'll do something

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:09.980
 They're doing all their other betting on the AI space right now. I think right. Yeah, probably and that's not even a bet, right?

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.380
 That's just like already that's kind of reacting to you. Yeah, it's like I wouldn't say so

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.380
 But yeah, yeah, so I just don't feel like this is the type of thing that they really do

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.100
 and additionally

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:28.860
 I said this a few times on Twitter whenever AWS adds like an adapter pattern somewhere where they're like you can

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:35.300
 Customize it or you can like write your own plug-in. These never ship another native feature ever again

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:41.020
 Oh, has there not been another a new runtime since they allowed custom interesting

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.100
 So they launched custom runtimes and they lost the launch docker container

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:51.180
 Function support and they've just never done anything native since then do you have any kind of maybe this is a stupid exercise

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.900
 But do you have any ability to kind of like guess

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:59.100
 What the benchmarks what the cold start performance would look like with bun?

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:04.540
 Yeah, a lot of the work bun put into was to improve the cold start time so they're like putting the work there

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.220
 I think again, it's really hard to say because I haven't tried with the application, but I

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:16.220
 It's it's it's just kind of hard to say because yeah, there's already a floor from like the firecracker startup

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:21.100
 So I'm only talking about what happens after then. Yeah, I think if you look at node 18

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:25.740
 It's around like 180 milliseconds. I wouldn't be surprised if bun got to like some 50

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:32.060
 I don't think it's gonna get to sub 10 like go or rust or rust. Yeah, okay. So it's not getting to that level

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.940
 But it would be like quite a bit faster than that potentially. Yeah, exactly

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:42.780
 Um, so again, that is kind of good, but is it like

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:49.580
 Enough to make it all worth it? Maybe not? Yeah, uh, so then you have runtime performance

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:53.580
 And obviously they have like really insane benchmarks like crazy crazy crazy benchmarks

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:58.220
 Which are all accurate and really argue with it. I think they're like fair benchmarks

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.900
 but

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.900
 again, the reality is

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:09.340
 Uh, the biggest bottleneck that most people have is they just wrote bad code and bun can only do so much for that

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:14.380
 Uh, and a great example of this is someone from the cdk team got cdk working under bun

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:19.980
 Uh, it's not like a five x improvement. It's not a three x improvement. It's not a two x improvement

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.820
 It's like a one point three x improvement or something. What are you implying about cdk?

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:31.420
 I'm just saying bun even bun can only do so much right? So there's just a reality of like

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.540
 Okay, uh for a real world

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.180
 library application like cdk, okay

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.220
 Is that worth kind of the upheaval?

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.060
 Maybe not

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.900
 Uh, then you have

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:51.820
 The serverless functions world where all of my functions pretty much do a tiny bit of logic and then schedule io work

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.020
 Whether that's io to the database or to whatever. Yeah, right

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:55.980
 So

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.260
 Even there like it's not going to give me a crazy amount of benefit

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.820
 Uh, for like single functions execution time

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:07.340
 They put in a lot of work to make like if you're running bun in a container and it's like directly handling

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.620
 HE requests

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:14.540
 They put a lot of work for that to be able to handle like a large amount of concurrent requests like way more than the competitors

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.620
 Like note and yeah out in dno, but again, that doesn't matter for that doesn't really

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:23.740
 Yeah, that doesn't apply to your usage of yeah, and anyone doing sort of stuff like is that

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.540
 routing concurrency part is already handled by

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:33.740
 Something outside of your runtime in a native language. So yeah, just not that exciting from a serverless functions point of view

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.620
 I don't think it's going to move the needle there. Yeah, what about from a

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.140
 Uh, like developer workflow

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.780
 standpoint like your local machine

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:50.140
 Your your dev feedback loop. Yeah, so in terms of being a better package manager. Uh, I think that is definitely there

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.140
 It's like pretty crazy how

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:58.860
 Fast it is a copying files like it's like you I thought I was skeptical that it would be much faster than pmpm

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:04.940
 Because the pmpm avoids copying files. Yeah, but somehow it's faster than something that's avoiding copying files

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.420
 So I think that is cool

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:13.020
 Is that really enough like using bun as just your package manager? Yeah, maybe I think I could see myself doing that one day

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.020
 I'm actually trying to do that now just to force

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:20.700
 Myself to get yeah sst working better in bun because if i'm using it myself, I'll be in some device too, but

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.420
 That's cool. Uh, bundling

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.580
 Yes, build is already so fast. Yeah, where does the bundling fit in like

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.140
 because I mean everybody just uses one of these big meta frameworks like

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:37.740
 React or I'm sorry next JS or yeah astro or whatever

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.540
 Remix somebody's using some meta framework that they chose to build their application

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:49.500
 Like do they have the option of using bun as a bundler instead of whatever that framework uses as a bundler like is that how it works?

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.580
 Yeah, so buns

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.980
 The bundler portion of bun they actually kept

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.700
 Uh, they actually mirrored. Yes, build. Yes, build it has built in a lot of ways

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:03.420
 So one they kept plug in API and stuff plug in API. They have a very similar API in general

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.140
 So I'm like very familiar with es build because we do a lot of that stuff for sst

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.140
 Uh switching that over to bun would be very easy for us to do also

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.180
 They mirrored the implementation if you look at the

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.500
 uh, the parser

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.380
 or

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:21.180
 like the types of parser and the compiler i'm pretty sure it's like almost like a port of

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.260
 What yes, build is doing if I remember correctly. Uh, so it's very similar to es build

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.540
 Which makes it good because you get predictable behavior in both

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.900
 But yes, build is already so fast. It's like a pretty crazy fast and

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:39.900
 Uh, I have the same issue with turbo pack. I'm like, why is next day as like rebuilding the whole world

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.220
 When

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.460
 It's like basically going to be the same speed as he is build like so i'm kind of questioning that

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:51.180
 So many of the frameworks are already built on top of vt plus e as build replatforming those

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:57.580
 I just don't know if it's gonna be worth it. I'm sure people will do it like someone will be really motivated to go and do it

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.580
 Is it gonna stick? I don't know

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.940
 Uh, vt themselves might switch it under the hood then kind of everyone kind of transparently switches, but yeah

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:10.140
 Yeah, it's just like I don't know if it's a big move. I guess. Yeah, I don't know if that's enough of a game chain

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.780
 It's just like there's such

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.180
 Burden that comes with switching something like that like the new bugs

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:19.260
 It not I think as many maintainers or eyeballs as he has build so yeah

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:25.260
 Yeah, so what is still slow like I feel like type checking type checking there was the effort to like make

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.300
 type checking faster

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.900
 Uh

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.220
 Danny poor Danny Donnie. I don't know if he's still working on Donnie's not even a deep depression now

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.060
 Yeah

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.540
 So they're not taking that on they did do something

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.300
 Translation, what are they what did bun do related to type script?

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.780
 Like you don't need ts note anymore. You can just run type script files, but they don't do type checking

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:51.980
 Yeah, it's kind of similar to dino and that the transpiler is built into the runtime. So

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:57.660
 It's just doing the transpiling on the fly and it's so fast that there's not that much of an advantage to pre

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:04.460
 Conspiling it. Yeah, again nice like little dx win, but it's it is so weird because it's so obviously better

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.940
 But then now if you start to like drill it down in all these different ways

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.660
 It's kind of like it's hard to fit it in. Yeah, like what's it really?

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.580
 Yeah, the path forward

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:18.860
 Yeah, and you talked on twitter about the like there is no business model for a runtime

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:25.500
 Yet there hasn't been one created so they'll have to figure that part out. Yeah, that's the whole question on like where like

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.620
 If there is demand

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.500
 Somewhere then like how do you build now a business model on top of the man?

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:38.140
 Yeah, it's it's a it's a lot to figure out, but the thing I was saying because I wrote a few like posts that were kind of

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:42.700
 I would say on different sides like I will one I wrote about difficulty of a business model

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.380
 But two I also wrote about why even though it's just so hard

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:52.060
 You kind of have to attempt something like this and a vc has to fund something like this because on the off chance it's successful

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.180
 it's like

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.620
 an alias size opportunity like it like if it is

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.740
 Most likely it's probably not going to work out, but if it does it's going to overwhelmingly dominate

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:08.380
 Everything like not just a jobs with ecosystem. We're probably pull people in from other ecosystem. It's probably an opportunity to build like

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.020
 one of the biggest

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.300
 Like just dev companies that's ever existed. So

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:21.660
 The opportunity is there, but yeah, so so for oven for for the company behind bun

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.860
 You think it's still it's a it's a long shot you would say yeah, and I'm sure they would be the first to agree

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:33.820
 Yes, most startups are yeah, right. Yeah, but it's like on the scale of like this is going to be a hundred billion dollar company if it succeeds

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.980
 I mean, they're just so like Jared that they're so good at executing. I feel like

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:43.580
 What is their pivot out of this if it just doesn't work if a runtime just can't be a

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:51.100
 Successful startup unicorn probably like a like a modest acquisition probably okay. They're just so good at shipping stuff

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:57.260
 I mean clearly they've worked. Yeah, very fast very effectively. Yeah, exactly and it sucks because like you said

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.820
 It's like stuff. We all want like oh you're making JavaScript way better all all the fronts. It's great

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:06.940
 I'm excited, but to your point like in the real world. It has to like find it's

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.460
 It's path into everyone's life

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:16.060
 And that's a challenge and I think that's why they focus on the package management stuff because that's like a very

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.780
 Easy way to at least get a foot in the door again. I don't know where it goes from there

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:26.940
 But if that becomes a de facto package manager because it's just so fast. That's pretty good pretty good start

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.020
 Yeah, the problem for me with the package measure front is like I feel like as a community

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.300
 We all just collectively decided like oh pm pm. So nice. This is great

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:39.020
 We just made this transition. It's like timing is crazy the people that make pm pm

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.740
 We all love them. They're like

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:47.420
 I don't know. It just feels like oh now we're switching off pm. Well now that one hurts a little bit like

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:54.140
 Yeah, and there's just like a whole set of things that comes with this one of the reasons I like pm pm is they stop

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.300
 The default behavior is not to hoist and I feel like there are like

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.340
 an insane long tail of

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:07.580
 Frustrating pain and bugs that come from hoisting and I was so glad we got away from that. We're back

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:12.140
 We like stop. The reason is a weird hack where like lifting packages are technically so works

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:18.860
 But bun, you know is hoisting based. So that's kind of what's preventing me from switching to it as a package manager

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.780
 I'm just like it just introduces so much

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:27.500
 Pain like time I got away from it does seem like the bun philosophy. Maybe it's the Jared philosophy is such that like

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.500
 Just like make anything that they could see work

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.980
 Like take as much burden off the user like everyone's dumb dums

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:42.540
 And they I feel like he's done a lot of work create a lot of features to like make stuff work that maybe shouldn't work

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.420
 Yeah, exactly. It's just like surprising. Oh, that actually works

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.900
 Uh, like you don't have to do all this explicit configuration and stuff will just work

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.180
 That seems like a kind of philosophy, but that does sort of like

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:58.860
 To your point. It's different. I mean like the pm pm going more strict was nice

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.260
 It sucks when your stuff doesn't work, but it's like pointing it out ahead of time

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.580
 Yeah, and it's funny because the

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:10.620
 The block so as a bun 1.0. I ran it against sst and we the first I we ran into

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:14.860
 It's actually a weird case of us doing something correct

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:20.540
 Bun compensating for people doing it incorrect and then breaking our correct approach

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:25.420
 So there's always like stuff like that that comes up. So now we have to add we have to add like some

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.500
 really weird

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:33.900
 Code to again. The root issue is babble babble doesn't ship esm. We import it correctly

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.660
 But bun doesn't like it when we import it correctly. So we have to import it

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:42.780
 Incorrectly just in case it's being run and bun and then import it correctly if that fails

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:48.460
 Yeah, like technically it's better for the end user that's doing all kinds of weird stuff like mixing cjs and esm

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.180
 But then for people like us and do esm correctly

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.980
 We now have the burden so

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:58.540
 Uh, yeah, it's just really hard to get that stuff right where like and we actually with sst

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.620
 I think

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.460
 We have to run this balance as well like and I think different people on our team have different approaches

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.460
 like frank is more on the extreme of

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:10.860
 We will find a way to fix it for the user like we'll do something weird and fix it for the user

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.940
 and i'm on the other extreme of like

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:18.300
 Really being conservative about doing stuff like that. So we end up somewhere nicely in the middle. I think but

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:24.380
 Uh, yeah, it's like that that balance is it's hard to strike. Yeah, so what about this? Maybe

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:29.740
 Uh, maybe this world you've talked about where javascript needs to restart like

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:35.180
 Clean break just burn it all down start over. Maybe bun could be the thing we all just start over with

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.620
 Could we could you create your little package certification thing?

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.540
 and

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:46.860
 That coupled with bun coupled with your the new javascript dictator. I don't know what jared is just too busy to be a dictator

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.300
 Can we do it? Can we just build up from the ashes?

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:55.900
 Burn the whole thing down just so there's just so much because I feel here's what I feel like I feel like

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.780
 We are close to making

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.740
 JavaScript on the back end decent

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.580
 They're just like they were just like a few missing pieces and I feel like those are coming together like we're close

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.220
 and now that bun exists it kind of

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:13.180
 Resets that in some ways because if we do want to re platform and but do everything on bun

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.900
 So much doesn't work again, right?

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.620
 Yeah, yeah

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.500
 You're back to missing things and from parties that you can't rely on exactly like I can't

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:28.620
 Support bun. So that just is like a non-starter at that point. I mean you can ask. Oh, I that's a AWS wishlist

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.100
 Yeah

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.460
 Did you see what I posted when jerry quote tweeted it? I was like no

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:39.820
 I was like I'm willing to stop talking shit for one year if AWS supports

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:44.220
 If that's what they got to take that deal. Oh, they got to take it

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:51.180
 Yeah, that's a good deal. I'm sure that has a good financial value in terms of like the amount of stress that comes off of the people

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.340
 They'd have to acknowledge it though. Yeah, that's an issue

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:59.340
 They have to acknowledge it

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.420
 What about formatting? Who's gonna make formatting fast? Did Rome figure that one out?

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.500
 I was thinking about this this morning. I was like

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:14.540
 You know, everyone always complains about fragmentation in the JavaScript world and like how we can't stick to a tool

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:21.020
 But you know what prettier freaking did it prettier gotten there and everybody used it's true. Everybody uses prettier

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:25.500
 We all see that thing prettier does where we have a long template string

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.740
 And we have like a little variable in a template. Yeah, we're gonna breaks it into three lines and it sucks

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.340
 But we all just do it use it anyway. No one's out there complaining. It's true

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.380
 And they yeah, they just got in there and they're the default and it's it's slow

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:40.060
 It's always annoying to get in agree with the other but

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:45.100
 Hey, we found at least one thing we've all centered us done and we can do it

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.300
 Do you think there would have been more outrage if a major open source project got rid of prettier than type script?

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:56.620
 Actually, no, because something that a lot of people contribute to no that does seem

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.820
 Yeah, that does seem a lot of ways even more trivial to like care about that

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:05.740
 Yeah, I don't know that's DHH is next move. He's gonna rip prettier out of the turbo

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:12.860
 Even if they're using it right now. Oh, maybe not. Yeah, the only thing Rome ever shipped was their formatter

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:17.660
 Yeah, so can we take that formatter? Was it good? Can we is it fast? Is it written in rust?

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:22.620
 I don't know blazingly fast. Okay. Can we just rip that out? There's a few right? There's a few that I've seen

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:28.060
 There's at least two or three well turbo pack. They're doing an aren't they aren't they also doing the formatting stuff?

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:34.380
 I don't know. I thought they were doing a native formatter. It's like there's like four different groups working on like there's gonna be one tool

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:40.460
 Yeah for all of your javascript development needs and like at the end of it we're gonna have four different

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:48.540
 One tool and none of them are gonna ship except for bun. I'm pretty I'm very convinced bun has proven that it can be shipped in a finite

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:54.620
 Like number of years amount of time now the pressure's on. Yeah, do they just does herself stick with turbo pack?

00:30:54.620 --> 00:31:00.380
 I don't know. Maybe that's very stupid and presumptuous. Oh, I have a lot of thoughts on turbo pack as well. Oh, please talk about it

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.980
 Yeah, uh, so I posted the other day being like why

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.860
 someone ran into some

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:11.980
 Weird issue. I forgot what it was, but I was talking about how it's really unfortunate that

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.100
 all of these other frameworks have

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:21.180
 Consolidated on VIT which is made VIT very very good because not only had this set of support

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:30.460
 Nuxed it also has supports felt and also support yep solid start and also so there's like this crazy diversity that just hardening it and making it super

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:34.060
 Just would work for everything with like really solid APIs

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.220
 And there's a world where nxjs

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:42.540
 Uh restarted and just built on top of VIT

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:48.300
 It's not realistic because you can't do that while being backwards compatible and that's like a big deal for them

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:55.500
 So we'll have to be in framework effectively and while employing the webpack creator. Yeah. Wait, does he work there? Yeah, or one of the

00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:01.500
 I was disputed. I feel like oh really people referred him as a webpack creator, but someone else claims other webpack

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:08.780
 I don't know maybe okay. Yeah, so their only path was to okay. We're stuck with webpack and webpack api

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.940
 How do we make this better?

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:15.660
 So I think they went in this weird route where they try to smash together way too many ideas

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:19.580
 Hmm like if we need a successor to turbo to webpack

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.460
 Let's build something called turbo pack was right in rust

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:27.020
 Oh, but we also have this turbo repo thing, which is also a very good tool. Let's like

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:31.180
 Kill it for no reason and then rewrite it in rust

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.260
 So not only are we like rebuilding the entire everything like

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.420
 The 10 years of webpack. Not only are we rewriting that. We're also like trying to rewrite

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.700
 Turbo turbo repo and integrate it

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:48.700
 It's like a lot to take on and turbo repo is already working and I was already written and go and it's already fast

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.100
 It's beyond that. Isn't it the scope of turbo pack

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:57.500
 Doesn't it their vision is just like one thing that does all of the different. Isn't that everything that I just mentioned

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:04.060
 Well, there's other stuff, right? I mean all you mentioned was you got rid of turbo repo and webpack, but it also gets rid of

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.260
 I don't know babble

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.620
 Translation, right? Oh, well, yeah, that's because they're using slv's formatting

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.020
 So they've already done right right there. They've already done that work

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.780
 Yeah, but then formatting I thought formatting and limting and like all this different stuff

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.780
 I mean

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:23.260
 I don't throw anything in there at this point because it's it's just so early. It's the Rome vision. Yeah, it's the

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.180
 Rome

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:33.020
 Turbo pack. Well, how do I find the website for turbo pack? Well, I was talking to some people that about this and people were saying that

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:38.940
 uh, they've seen lee robs is like that of uh dev rel for

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:45.420
 Where so uh his tone around turbo pack has shifted where instead of referring to like

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:52.380
 When turbo pack comes out it's being shifted more to like if turbo pack becomes oh

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:59.580
 Interesting though. I don't I don't I'm like it's just a weird crazy ambitious thing

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:04.780
 I feel like it might have been started during zero interest rate era and now it's kind of like

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:10.300
 Do you really want to do this straddling? That's it's projects that straddle that line. Yeah, interesting

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.180
 Yeah, they're like kind of trapped. It's it's kind of funny to see that

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:16.540
 And now there's this new thing called RS pack, which is just

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:24.220
 another effort to rewrite in right back in rust wow like less less crazy. They're trying to like maintain the same

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:28.380
 API and then just make up internals faster, which I think it's like a reasonable iteration

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.020
 I think that's like probably maybe what verse i should have tried to do

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.540
 So now there's that

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:37.420
 I'm sure next was looking at that being like, well, they we can just let them do it and get all the benefit

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.300
 So

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:45.100
 Yeah, I don't know if that's gonna go anywhere. Hmm. I'm so curious. I'm so curious how it all plays out

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.980
 Uh, yeah, that's just broadly. I mean you're hitting on something i'm very curious about which is the

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.260
 impact of zero interest rates over a decade

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:57.900
 Still waiting for that shooter drop. I keep saying that like it's some ominous prediction

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.220
 I don't know. I just feel like

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.540
 It's gonna take years, isn't it? It's gonna be slow kind of like my exit from the internet

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.580
 I don't I don't know. I don't know. I don't think it's gonna be dramatic

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.940
 I'm just convinced. I've been thinking more about how

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.900
 Uh, there's a class of founders right now

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:19.740
 And i'm really excited for this class to graduate because I feel like it's gonna be some of the best

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.940
 founders that have been around for a long time because

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:30.060
 If you have succeed if you have succeeded in the next five years you did it during a relatively hard time compared to the previous five years

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.100
 I got to be honest the founders that came out of the previous five years all sucked

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:39.580
 Like I just feel like no one is impressive or like people that are like like at the level of like people like

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:45.180
 Yeah, as well as for gates or deep jobs like none of that really happened in the last five or even like 10 years

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.300
 But I think there's like an opportunity for that to happen again

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:53.820
 Just giving giving a little pressure and difficulty there. Yeah, what's what's the the cycle the phrase?

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:58.700
 Uh, it's like tough times. Yeah. Yeah, that whole thing. Yeah, yeah, exactly

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:02.060
 So our listeners have no idea what it is, but we know

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:08.940
 I don't think any single person could not know this. This is like such this code. It's so much

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.860
 I only learned it in like the last year. So apparently I've been living in the Ozark

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.900
 Oh, I have been

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.300
 Fun

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:24.780
 Vte turbo. Oh, Vte also has an interesting future ahead of itself as well

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:29.340
 I think they're like positioned insanely well and they want to see some very interesting things come out

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:34.380
 From them. What's the Vte? Yeah, what's the B before I go into this? I have a question

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:38.140
 But there was something I wanted to tie a bow on you know what I forgot. So it doesn't matter

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.540
 There's one of the oh, yeah, I was just gonna say on the downturns thing

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.620
 I guess when I think about historically

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.620
 downturns are very short like

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.420
 The dot com one of two years. Yeah bubble like bursting was like

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.460
 It burst it's fast

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:59.980
 Furious and then it was over. So yeah, I guess it's unrealistic to think that we're in some like long-term

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.300
 bad

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:07.900
 I don't know to press things are just so different too. Like if you look at some of the stocks from the dot com or even 2008

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:13.660
 It took those a very very long time to get back to the price they were at like decade

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.340
 Maybe in some places. I was looking at my portfolio and I was like

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.780
 Yeah, everything crashed and I was like, oh, so sad and sucked

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.100
 But then it just got back to where it was in two years. I can't imagine waiting like 10 years

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:29.100
 Yeah to get back to where I was 10 years before that. It's it's really crazy

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:34.860
 Yeah, just the timing like if you're like someone traditional retirement age like all that

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:41.820
 Math that would have sucked. Yeah, uh, okay. So the question I want to ask you was what's the v business model?

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:49.020
 Well, I mean, I know how evan makes money like evan has some information that I can't share publicly. Oh, okay. Well, that's fine

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.420
 I guess we'll say there's gonna. Let's just say there's gonna be stuff

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.860
 Veets futures gonna be interesting. Oh, oh

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:58.300
 And we're probably trying to sing in the next like you'll have

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.180
 Six months or so you'll have to tune in to the next episode

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:08.700
 But they are positioned insanely well because these smartest people in this space build on top of Veet

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.340
 You have ryan carneado. You have rich harris

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.980
 All the people that work on nux

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:19.020
 And then like the nitro thing that came out of nux like solid start is gonna be it's built on top of that

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:19.740
 so

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.500
 Astro is built on top of Veet

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.300
 it's like you have this one island of

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:28.700
 Webpack plus versale and all the people that versale was able to fund

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.980
 Yeah, then you have like the whole decentralized version of it

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.300
 Which is like all the people doing stuff

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:40.060
 You know, these decentralized way, but like kind of collaborating. Yeah, it's yeah. I like cannot

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:45.340
 It's the empire in the rebellion. I mean, you just if you've ever watched star wars

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.940
 There's never been a better like the fiction of the two sides

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:57.260
 Uh, good and evil in star wars in the dev community that just feels like this band of like ragtag rebels

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.300
 taken on

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:04.620
 The empire, right? Yeah. It's so fit. It fits so well

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.500
 Them just wearing black and every phone

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.660
 I know everything's black and white like it's

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:13.500
 There is a death star somewhere in versale headquarters. I promise

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:18.220
 You know, sometimes I see pictures from their team where like it seems like they're hanging out

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:22.860
 It's like an event or out of work or like they're like traveling for common and they're all wearing black and i'm just like

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:27.180
 What would happen if I worked at versale and I showed up to one of those wearing like

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:33.580
 Like a pink shirt. Would I get in trouble? Yeah, or one of your really cool like one of your cool outfits

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.460
 Yeah, exactly. I was really wearing my own noisy ones. Yeah

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:40.460
 Like what would what would like someone pull me aside and talk to me

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:45.420
 They probably there's surely a dress code that doesn't just happen by accident, right?

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:49.660
 I wonder if it's entirely social pressure. I might entirely be social pressure driven

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:54.860
 Just button spoken someone like me like the hats of reverse if i thought i was one of the annoying so

00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.060
 Someone like that has to work at versale. It must be someone annoying that works at versale

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.020
 That refuses to wear black. I mean they've hired some pretty big names

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:08.540
 So I would think somebody's their own person and they're like whatever. I don't do the whole evil empire thing

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:13.820
 Yeah, well, and then it's funny because uh rich hair is a works ever so and he's technically on the other one

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.260
 So he's like oh

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:19.260
 Who's it who's he that he's like the spy or like the uh the guy that changed his sides

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.380
 Is he door the Vader because Darth Vader turns out to be good at the end, you know?

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:28.940
 Oh interest. I don't I don't think it's the emperor down that

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:33.980
 The oh, okay. I forget there is a more dark character than Darth Vader

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:40.860
 Okay, then it's sorry i'm working out in my head who's who the rich hair is gonna pick up germel and throw him down

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:46.540
 Oh my god. You said it. You said it out loud. I mean obviously I guess germel if i'm saying that

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:51.100
 They're the empire then there's a figurehead interesting now. I really want to map this out

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:54.700
 You know what if our listeners care enough and are nerdy enough to map out

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:59.580
 Who is who in this star wars universe? Yes, someone do it. Please someone do it

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:04.860
 That would be amazing. Yeah, someone would do this someone will make a little image a meme

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:10.460
 It can be low effort. Just make something who's the one that profits off both sides. That's I think that's me

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:14.780
 Uh wait in star wars is there someone that like is it like job of the hut

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.820
 Boba fed or yeah, okay

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:22.380
 Orlando maybe just an independent mercenary. You're just making your money off of

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:30.060
 All the conflict. Yeah, I'm just I'm just benefiting off the chaos. I'm just trying to optimize for maximizing the chaos. Yeah, I love it

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.220
 I love it so much

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:37.840
 Oh, okay. I have an is Luke Skywalker just saw that in a chat

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:45.740
 Well, then then you have to fit you have to fit Jared and bun in there somewhere too because they're like how does bunn fit in

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:50.540
 Yeah, how does bun fit in like on a serious note in the like the landscape?

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:56.220
 Like you said if v doesn't they're not if they don't abandon yes, build and they don't use bun as a bundler

00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:02.380
 How does how does bun make its way into that? It's I mean, I think you would have to see

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:06.140
 New frameworks that come up that are bun native

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:10.460
 Which already is a thing like i'm already seeing some of that. I think at least yeah as one of them

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.980
 And but those have to become a lot more popular than

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.980
 the Vte hard framework. So yeah, it's again just a hard

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:25.580
 Path that we can't really envision at the end of the day. It always like I think probably like you think which is like it's kind of run somewhere

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.180
 and

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:31.580
 For us like we're running all our stuff on a day bs lambda functions. It's like

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:35.180
 At the end of the day if it doesn't run faster there

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:39.180
 You can't do anything. Yeah. Yeah, so

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:45.020
 That's tough. Yeah, they got to figure out how to and there's just no picture for cloud flare and bun

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.260
 Is there like cloud flares its own thing?

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:51.740
 Yeah, it's cloud flares so tightly integrated that it doesn't make any sense

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:56.620
 Like their stuff is already like crazy fast because the level of integration they do with how they deploy things

00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:03.900
 So if i'm jared and i'm trying to figure out how do we how do we get the integrations with deployment partners cloud vendors or whatever

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:11.180
 What is his best path forward? There is a path is building something as big as cloud flare or ws

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:16.700
 It's like jeez. Yeah, that's but that's the type of thing as a vc you have to invest in

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:22.540
 Yeah, I mean they can execute so like you get a team that's proven like that

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:26.460
 I feel like sick i'm on a huge problem, but man that that one scares

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:32.060
 Yeah, the thing i pointed out is name one hosting provider that has gotten big in the last 10 years

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.540
 Like extremely rare. It's very hard to do

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:43.820
 Um, so is fly in the last 10 years like they're they're kind of great. They're like so pretty early and

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:51.580
 Uh, they're doing everything right. Okay, so you're saying like gotten big like top three scale like the big big players

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:57.660
 And if anyone will do it, it's going to be fly and that's another problem fly becomes competitor, right?

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:02.620
 It really is like this big opportunity fly can't let that go

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:06.620
 Mm to someone else. They need to be the place to host bun

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.980
 And they've already they're like a blog post like a few weeks ago

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:14.380
 Like they're doing the work to be the best place to run run by already. Well. There you go

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:21.900
 Again, if you're running containers if you're not in the serverless model a lot of the work that bun did can be realized today

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.220
 Yeah, uh, it's why fly makes sense, but

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:28.940
 Interesting. I don't know. I guess that it's a future of this company is a big question mark and

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.300
 Exciting there's some exciting stuff on the horizon

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.380
 Finally something interesting that's our feet

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:39.180
 Yeah, so much interesting stuff. Did we already talk about all of it? Are we done? Is that it?

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:45.500
 I think so. I'll tell you the secret of eats once we get off. Yeah offline. Yes, that's our fun audience

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:49.740
 You don't get sorry everybody. You don't get to know the secret. We're gonna hang up so I can learn the fun stuff

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:54.540
 All right, we should break it up here. Okay

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.100
 All right, see you. Yeah
