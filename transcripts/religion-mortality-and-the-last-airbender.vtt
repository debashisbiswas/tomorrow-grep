WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.160
 Yeah, I don't feel guilt. I didn't I didn't grow up with a with a Western religion. There's no guilt in Eastern religions. Oh, you want to go? Hey, we just did the political that came out this morning, the political episode. Do we do a religion episode this morning?

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.400
 Is that where we're going? Yeah, I mean, I have I think I have some funny concepts.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:56.400
 Do you do you follow the news? Like do you have news sources that you consume? I think stuff makes it to me, but I don't think I follow the news. I don't think I there's not there's no, like, no, I don't I don't follow the news. If I think about all that stuff, I check.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:16.080
 I check Twitter and I check Feedly, you know, my sources on Feedly are just related to my work. Like an RSS reader? Yeah, exactly. I wait. Feedly is kind of crazy for me because I have been using it every single day. I probably hasn't been a day that I haven't opened it in the past, like, 15 years, maybe.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:39.920
 But whenever Google Reader died, if you look up, whenever Google Reader, I remember Google Reader. It's maybe 15 years, maybe it's been a little bit less. But I think I've used it every single day. And I actually wonder, like, am I their most active user or like, whatever metric they imagine? I mean, literally number one on the X. I mean, I clear it every single day. And it's been a habit. I've been the only habit I've kept for so long.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:52.600
 But yeah, the source, go ahead. There's no chance. You, what's that movie? Night of the Roxbury or something? You know, me? No, you night of the rocks.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:08.040
 No, not night of the Roxbury. It's like the guy he's like just done Coke and he's standing up there to press conference. And he's like, you, you, you, me, you, like, who's going to talk next? And he's just like freaking out. I think it's the guy from Night of the Roxbury, but it's not that to movie.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.840
 Somebody, anybody help me, please. Someone knows this reference. It is night at the right. It is night at the Roxbury. Apparently that is a movie.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.720
 It's not the Roxbury. Why did I think night at the Roxbury was like not a movie? What did I think it was even?

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.920
 I don't even know what that is. Okay. You don't know what? Never mind.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:34.400
 Well, I just get thrown off when you make a pop culture reference because it's like, I mean, it's a 20 year old movie, probably. So all of my references are like, they skipped a decade.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.800
 Okay. That was 11, 20 years ago. You were 11, 20 years ago. Oh, you're 30. Wow.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.080
 You are younger than me. I mean, just like five years. I'm 36.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.800
 Yeah. I'm still in the old man section. I think, okay, forming on Twitter.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.040
 Really quick. You said something. You said you wonder if you're the biggest feedly user.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:03.480
 And I wonder often my wife and I talk about if we're the biggest customers at Mama jeans, which is our local health food store.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.760
 We spend like, I don't know, all of our money there every month and have for years.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.920
 And we get invited like VIP things that they have, like they have these little like we've never gone.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.520
 But like, I just, I'm positive we're the biggest customer at Mama jeans.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.960
 Like I don't know if Mama Jean herself would ever listen to this podcast. She wouldn't.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.520
 But if she ever heard it, I'd love to get confirmation.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.720
 I'd love someone to tell me that we are the number one customer. I'm just, I'm positive.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.360
 It feels so good to have a spot that you're like, so loyal to.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.680
 I definitely want that. It feels like a second home.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.920
 Like when we moved away, I missed our home, obviously our family and like all that.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.520
 But I missed Mama jeans, like going into Mama jeans, even if when we weren't living,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.160
 we had sold our home that we loved to move to Florida. When we came back,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.960
 it's like we were in this little rental and it sucked while we were building.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.960
 We hated the place, but we went to Mama jeans and it felt like.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.120
 Yeah. We're home. Yeah. Anyway, okay.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.840
 Liz has that with a, with our coffee shop here that, with the one in her neighborhood

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.280
 that she walks to and ahead of time, she was like, I want Pete.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.640
 I want them to like know me. I want to like be a notable customer.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.000
 And she hit a milestone where somebody like knew her order before she ordered it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.160
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I made it.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.200
 Our problem at Mama jeans is, well, they have three locations that,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.080
 but we mostly go to the one, but they turns out like grocery stores, a lot of turnover.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.080
 So like the crew from, I don't know, eight years ago that we,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.560
 when we first started going to Mama jeans, a lot of them have left and it's new people,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.320
 but there are a few people who've literally watched my kids grow up.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.720
 Like a guy named Antoine, who does a lot of the stocking.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.600
 He, he's just like every time he sees Asa. It's what's up little dude.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.400
 He says that to him every time. It's like since he was tiny and now he's eight and it's crazy.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.320
 Anyway, let's see those arcs. There you go.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.400
 Yeah. I mean, I think about that even my street.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.720
 I'm like, if I really commit, I'm definitely committed to my neighborhood.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.920
 But I was like, if I take it further and I commit to my street, my neighbor had really small kids.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.560
 It's going to be really weird to see them like go off to college one day.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.960
 Yeah. Really bizarre. Yeah.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.320
 I mean, I've been in this neighborhood now for like we, the first home was eight years ago.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.000
 We were gone for a couple of years. Anyway, yeah, I've seen we've seen some kids.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.160
 You know, it just doesn't seem right. It's so weird when kids that you knew and they were little

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.320
 are now like driving and then graduating. And yeah, it's bizarre.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.080
 Yeah. It's weird. Okay. Okay. Religion. Let's do it. Fine. Fine.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.520
 Wait, wait, but what? But you asked me about news and never followed up.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.240
 Oh, oh, yeah. No, I just, oh, just I like, I don't know.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.360
 Like the recently people are talking about submarine on Twitter.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.120
 I've only seen like two people mention it, but they were very distraught.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.720
 And it just reminded me that like, I don't know about these things unless

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.400
 someone asked me to go look it up. Like I don't have any inputs.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.440
 Like Twitter now for me is just our friends, the people that I, you know,

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.320
 associate pretty closely with. I get on Twitch here.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.680
 If somebody doesn't say it on Twitter or in Twitch chat, I don't know it happens.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.760
 And I don't know. Is that bad? Am I like a bad citizen, not connected or something?

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.800
 I was surprised when, because I saw you reply being like, what submarine?

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.280
 And I was like, I'm kind of surprised. I was surprised that you didn't know about it.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.720
 And it actually made me think like, wow, I was like way more insulated than I thought.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.040
 Cause I, I also only heard about it because people were talking about it on, on Twitter.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.080
 Did you see, do you see a lot of people talking about it? Cause I, I even saw you,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.240
 I think say something about, or maybe Warren said something about, like,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.200
 can't do the memes or you can't handle people joking about it.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.040
 I haven't seen any memes or jokes about it. I've literally seen Annie say that

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.000
 she was kind of distraught over it. And that's it. I've not seen anything else.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.480
 Yeah, that's what I'm trying to remember. I could, I feel like I've been seeing it everywhere,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.600
 but then I actually don't know where everywhere is. I need to pay more attention to this because I

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.600
 actually, I must have seen it somewhere else. But I was realizing, I don't know where all this

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.040
 stuff is making it into my, into my brain. It might be, it actually might be feed leak is

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.760
 feed leads connected to hacker news. And hacker news is like, a lot of tech stuff,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.720
 but just like other interesting stuff that's happening. That's like, maybe relevant to everyone.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.600
 Yeah. I don't read hacker news. That's always like, I've always felt like an imposter when I,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.000
 I know like, Oh, there's a whole site for just us and like hackers go there and read stuff.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.240
 And I just have never enjoyed it. I don't know. I never rely on it.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.760
 It's funny because I have such mixed feelings on it because the most annoying people on the planet

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:37.080
 are there. I mean, you're there. That's like when you see someone at a place you're kind of

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:42.120
 embarrassed to be. It's like, well, wait, why are you here? But what? But I'm here. But why are you?

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:48.600
 You should be embarrassed. Hey, I saw, I saw Aaron Francis there once. Oh, really? I see everyone

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.080
 there. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because he actually writes really good stuff and it ends up there.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.520
 So he has to be there. He does not seem like the kind of person that would be in the comments.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.040
 No, I saw him in a comment, but it was a really typical Aaron Fatch. It was a nice,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.440
 positive process. Yeah, exactly. I'm now remembering this is before this is when I first started

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.640
 following him on Twitter and we didn't know we didn't know each other that well. And it was a

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.960
 thread about people hating Twitter. And he was in there being like, I don't know. I have a good

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:21.480
 time on there. And I was like, Oh, yeah, I know you. I was having a good time on there. But okay,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.240
 so obviously most annoying people and I want to be more specific about this. The problem with the

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:33.480
 Hacker News audience is that they're not dumb. They're smart. They're they can think about things

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:41.400
 and they can like form pretty convincing arguments and follow logic. This is why you're on it and

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:51.480
 I'm not. It's so perfect yourself. I mean, it's perfect. Like I can't form solid arguments and

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.280
 you're somebody who can be like, that's the whatever principle. So you belong there and I don't go

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:03.720
 ahead. No, no, you gotta let me finish my thought because the entire problem is a majority of the

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:10.600
 audience takes that skill and directs it in like the dumbest way. Like they will use their

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:16.120
 ability to form cohesive thoughts to conclude something that makes zero sense at all. But with

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.280
 like paragraphs of stuff that we read, it's like, this doesn't make sense. And you step back and

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.160
 you're like, wait, this actually makes no sense at all. But then technically it makes sense. You

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.680
 know, it's this really weird combination of like, if they were just dumb, that would be a lot simpler.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.960
 If they were just genuinely smart, they probably would have said something simple. But they're like,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.440
 there's a weird zone where they can like make all these complex things. And then you realize

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.840
 what they're actually talking about. And you're like, that just makes no sense. So that's why I

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.480
 hate it. That's one thing I noticed on Hacker News. The time I end up there, it's like how long

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.600
 the comments are people really, they put a lot of time into their Hacker News comments.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.040
 Yeah. What's the motivation there? Have you done that? Like, I feel like if you're there,

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.680
 you've probably commented like, do you write a big thing because you want to convince somebody

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.880
 of something or you want to look like you fit in or what is it? No, I never written anything big.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.800
 It just brief things here and there where I can chime in. I'm going to dig through your

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.080
 profile. Can you actually see people's posts? I don't know. I'm going to find one. You can.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.240
 You can. It's all out there then. Oh, yeah, you're a YC. You're part of a YC company.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.520
 You're a YC founder. But what? What does that have to do with anything? Well, it's just like,

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.280
 it's kind of like your little place where you're cool. I've been going to Hacker News for a very

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:32.600
 long time. Yeah, of course. Ten years, probably. I was just doing everything 10 years ago. I told

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.400
 you this. All I have is for five years ago. So true. The next year, everything will be 11 years.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.600
 That's just how it goes. Ever since I've been like a developer for 12 years, I've rounded up to 15.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:49.240
 I've been a software developer for like 15 years. Roughly. Yeah, it's hard to say. Yes,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.400
 very annoying people. And that's like, that kind of it's annoying to read that stuff.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.560
 That said, some of the most important technologies I've ever used, I've discovered from there. Like,

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.560
 I found Elixir really just kept popping up on Hacker News and it hit a threshold. We're like,

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.520
 I need to check this out because it's popped up enough times. And that was like really formative

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:14.600
 for me in a really important moment. So I continue to go there because, you know, if anything is

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.640
 out there that shows up that is going to be interesting to me, it's going to end up there.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.760
 The second thing is, yes, there's a lot of annoying people, but there's also some really

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.720
 genuinely smart people on like the most on the randomest topics that I don't know about. And I

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.880
 do get a lot of value from actually read the comments. It's weird because I was just complaining

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.280
 about it. I think I read the comments more than actual articles because, yes, there's always

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:39.640
 annoying people. There's also the person that is like just an expert in something that like lays

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:45.000
 it out really well. So you feel like it's good, a good use of time. I should look into it.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.640
 If I'm smart enough. If you don't even look into it, but for me,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.040
 yeah, you don't know if I should look into it. I know what that means. I don't know if you should

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:58.200
 look into it. I don't know if you quite make the cut, but yeah, just let me summarize it for you.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.760
 You don't have to go look into it. Okay. Yeah. You do. I mean, I said something the other day about how

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:09.640
 you just you just have this ability to like summarize and distill and all that. And you said it's just

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:15.720
 because you've read like 10 years ago, you read a bunch of books that now you can just ride that

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.120
 forever. It feels that way. Maybe there's just not that many ideas in the world. I feel like

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.520
 there could be infinite ideas in the world. Yeah, but there's like there's like there's like eight

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.480
 core things that are true and then everything is just an extrapolation of those things combined

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:35.800
 in different ways. And why is that like, like when it comes to human stuff, like just social,

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:42.040
 societal, philosophic, like when it comes to like, I think of like physics, it's like there's laws or

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.520
 whatever or is there, I don't know that they figure out there aren't it's actually all right. I don't

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:52.200
 know. But like physics, I can wrap my head around that with people stuff. Why are there like fundamental

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.640
 laws that kind of govern the way things will play out? I think there's just a difference between

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:03.800
 something being complicated and something being complex where physics stuff is really complicated,

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:10.200
 but it's not complex in the sense of like a billion human beings interacting with each other,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.800
 all different combinations of things that can happen. You know, there's always some stat where like,

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.760
 there's more combinations of this than like atoms in the universe, like the combination,

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.640
 yeah, that's what I think about when they buy complexity. So I think when you have situations

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:31.720
 like that, there's like so few global truths and laws that work. Again, this is also just from

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.720
 one of the books that I read. I was going to say, you just kind of did the thing where you just

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:41.560
 add like an answer to a very weird and complicated question. But this is also that it wasn't this

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.280
 in that scalebook that you read. Oh, maybe I love how you haven't even read it. I've read it and

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.040
 you know the principle and I don't. I shouldn't read the book. I should just talk to Liz is what

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:55.720
 you're saying. I was going to say my brain isn't distracted by hundreds of pages in the book. I just

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:01.160
 stored like a one, the one that you need information. Yeah. That's just another tidbit from a book

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.040
 since you probably haven't read it. Astrophysics for people in a hurry. I've heard of that, but I

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.680
 have not read it. It's the guy. What's his name? I can't think of his name. Neil Tyson DeGrasse.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.640
 Neil DeGrasse Tyson. The grass. Neil DeGrasse, I was like close.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:19.000
 Okay. You were right. I mixed up the name. Okay. Yeah. That guy.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:25.320
 There's a part in the book. Maybe this was from scale, actually. I think it was actually from scale.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:32.440
 No, no, it's only like 10 books. I matter. Yeah. No, it really is from the Neil,

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:38.440
 whatever one. So in a cup of water, this just blows my mind. Have you heard this? In a cup of

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:46.920
 water. Oh, I haven't told you yet. There are more molecules in a cup of water than there are other

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:52.600
 cups of water on earth. There are so many more molecules. You could put 15,000 molecules

00:14:52.600 --> 00:15:01.480
 from one cup of water into every other cup of water on earth. That blows my mind that it gets

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:07.480
 that small. I think of things on the big end, astrophysics, all that stuff, but on the tiny end,

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:12.040
 it's way bigger than I realized, way more. There's way more depth there.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.920
 Yeah. It's like mind boggling like some of these realities that we just go about day to day.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:22.280
 And it's like, it feels like the craziest sci-fi concept. Like, I mean, the other classic thing

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:27.720
 with that is, I don't remember exactly, but you know how atoms and molecules are mostly space.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:33.320
 And it's like, it's something like if you just took the mass. Oh, like between the electrons and

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.960
 that. Yeah. You just took the mass and put it all together. It's like some shockingly small like

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:43.240
 amounts, but you like touch your desk when it feels solid and hard, but it's like technically

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.880
 mostly space. Man, this is a great time to get into the religion conversation. I feel like

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:53.080
 we're talking about deep stuff. Yeah. What is our religion? We've kind of had this conversation

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:58.840
 together privately. What's it going to look like here? The thing that comes up for me is,

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:05.720
 because Liz grew up Catholic, and I grew up basically without any real strong religion.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:12.120
 Yeah. Technically, my family is Hindu, but it just wasn't that it's a weak religion is what

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.240
 you're saying, Hindu. Yeah. We're putting that on tape. We're going to put that on.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:22.680
 Actually, it's relevant. Like it's so extremely fragmented. And like from the beginning,

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:28.920
 the original ideas were like, kind of like think, think and make up stuff on your own.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:34.520
 So like over the thousands of years, it's like, it's just so fragmented. There's not like a strong

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.080
 identity or like strong rules around it. Yeah. Everyone has their own flavor. So it's pretty

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.400
 different. And the other thing that me and Liz always talk about is, my conclusion on this is

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.080
 just the way we were raised because of religion stuff. It might be that I'm a bad person, but let me

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:53.960
 explain. Everyone that listed this, we all jump to the same conclusion that you are a bad person,

00:16:53.960 --> 00:17:00.440
 but go ahead. She's constantly thinking about morality and right and wrong and what is right

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:05.880
 and what is wrong and like feeling guilt and like, there's this heavy like guilt thing with

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.720
 everything she thinks about or does. Yeah. And everyone talks about it. Everyone talks about

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:15.480
 the Catholic guilt concept. And I just do not have that. Like I'm mostly just thinking about like,

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.200
 does this make sense? Does this make me feel good or like, you know, I don't know. I'm never

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:25.400
 thinking about it like, is this moral or am I a good or bad person if I do this? Yeah, for her,

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.640
 that's like a very natural way for her to think because of, and we've concluded it's because

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:35.320
 how we were raised differently. Whereas the guilt concept is not as much of a thing

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:40.680
 in the religion that I grew up in. Yeah. So I would say the religion that I grew up in,

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:46.280
 which is Christianity, there's there's some guilt. Well, I mean, I wouldn't say there's guilt. I would

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:53.720
 say like, it's you can't summarize a group of people's beliefs based on your experiences. Like,

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:59.880
 I know there are people who hold those beliefs all over the world that don't display them in the

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.200
 way that the people around me did growing up. Yeah, I guess I should get some context. This is

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.800
 going to be hard. Actually, this is we're getting into some like, difficult things to talk about

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:15.320
 because of like, just when you go from like being raised in one setting, or one context,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.880
 and then you change that in adulthood, it's very hard. Like it's extremely hard to like,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.720
 leave prior belief systems behind, at least from my experience, it's been tough. And my wife's,

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:31.560
 she didn't grow up in it. Like I did though, like I grew up my whole life in Christianity.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:37.000
 And I think in adulthood, started asking questions that it just didn't, it didn't resonate with me,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.600
 mostly because I think the place I live in the world, like I think if I had grown up,

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:46.120
 you know, on the west coast of America, even it looks a lot different there than it does

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.840
 here and what they call the Bible Belt. There's just a lot of a lot of things that bother me about

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:57.400
 the people that I was closest with, and the way they display their beliefs. And yeah, I would say

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:05.160
 like, today, I just, and it feels really good to not try to have answers to every single thing,

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.400
 which is what I felt like everyone around me growing up had to have, it's like they had

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.760
 to build up this framework that protected their mind, or they would just fall apart.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:21.960
 Not dissimilar to how I fell apart on our last episode. Just like needing to have answers

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.520
 to every single question. And I think I feel really good now in adulthood after like a five,

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:33.960
 six year journey of this, just not knowing much of anything and enjoying almost the mystery of all

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.920
 of this. Like I can look at everything around me now and look at the vastness of space and the

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:46.040
 tininess of whatever atoms or molecules. And like, it just blows me away. And it does make me feel some

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:53.240
 sense of something in my tiny little robot heart. But it's just like not needing to have answers.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:20:00.120
 I guess I do like, I'll say that like, as somebody who's very into science and very into like,

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:07.240
 I don't know, modern thinking is what I'll call it. I do kind of feel like, I don't know,

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.760
 there's just some things there's no answers to. And I'm okay with that. Like, why? Why did all

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.800
 of this happen? Okay, I'm going to stop talking. I've said too many words. Go ahead.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.800
 No, no, that's good. I think it's funny because you're the way the place you jumped to was,

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.680
 I think, yeah, because that big part of it is like giving answers to things. And a lot of ways,

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:32.440
 sometimes I'm like jealous of that, because like you said, it protects you in a lot of ways.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.120
 Yeah. Sometimes I'm like, I mean, I don't think I would actually choose it, but I can see like,

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:41.800
 what's nice about that, you know, because it takes a while to be okay with not having

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.280
 answers to certain things. Yeah, it's funny, though, because I think just this is just what

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.920
 I've learned through talking to Liz and kind of seeing our family operates. Their version of

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:57.240
 religion doesn't seem as that part of it doesn't seem as relevant, really, like the here's how

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:03.640
 everything works and here's how where we came from, et cetera. Yeah, I feel like, and this might be

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.160
 just the Cuban thing or maybe it's like the cat, the difference between Catholic and Christianity,

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:13.480
 but I don't think it's that I feel like it's for them, it's more like, it's really just about the

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.400
 good and bad thing. Like here's the things we have to do to be good and like they're always

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.040
 striving to do those things. Some of those things are like genuinely good. Other things are kind

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:28.120
 of arbitrary, like you should go to church every Sunday or whatever, just kind of rules that that

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:34.280
 every religion has. Yeah, and I feel like they actually don't think about the larger existential

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:41.160
 stuff that answers for you. Yeah, it's a funny thing. I think the other thing that's weird about

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.920
 or interesting about their setup is, I mean, with every, like you said, every local flavor

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:54.120
 of religion is a little bit different. And for them, it comes from Catholicism in the Caribbean.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:59.640
 So a lot of it is like weirdly mixed in with like voodoo stuff. There's actually a whole like

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:05.480
 branch of it that's a, that's things called Santeria, which is like it's Catholicism, but like island

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:10.120
 magic combined together. Yeah, you had like a nice little like role of the are there or whatever

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.760
 that letter was. That was nice. You sounded like a yeah. Yeah, I've been here for almost a year.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.760
 I got it. I got to get that right. And like there's some people that are hardcore into that,

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.000
 but it's like a really weird mix. It's like the traditional stuff you imagine, but it's also stuff

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.720
 you never associate with it like like these crazy like tribal rituals and things. Yeah,

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.880
 but Liz is dead. They're not, they're not like that hardcore into that, but they do do some things

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:38.600
 like that like these little like, it's like magic. So when Liz applies for a job or like tries to

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.840
 try and like get funding or whatever. And if she ever tells her dad about her, her dad will ask

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.560
 who's the name? What's the name of the person that like makes a decision? And he writes their name

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.040
 down on a piece of paper and freezes it in a nice cube. Oh, wow. And that's like tech. Yeah. So

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.480
 that's like technically like part of the religion, but yeah, I'm sure you technically are in the

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.520
 same neighborhood of religion, you've probably never heard of anything like that. No, no, no,

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.080
 yeah, no. Yeah. I've heard that one. There's some snake handling I've heard of, but go ahead.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.280
 Sorry. Wait, snake handling. Oh, if you never heard of that one? No.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:14.280
 There are, I think it's, I think it's Christianity. There are sects of Christianity that they handle

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.360
 snakes. I don't know. I think it might have been in the Bible, but they handle snakes like the

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.920
 snake won't bite them because they're protected. Interesting. I think like on stage at church, I think

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.480
 I could be wrong. I could be mixing up. It could be another religion. And I'm sorry if it was.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.760
 I mean, that sounds like an Indian thing to me. Like when I think of handling snakes,

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.840
 like with the flute and the snake coming out of the basket. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like, yeah, yeah.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:39.880
 The cobra kind of lifts up the lid. Yeah. Are we going to, are we just like going to

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:45.160
 offend everybody in the world and this podcast? Like, did we just write off any chance of anybody

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:51.240
 liking either of us? So far, we've only talked about ourselves. That's true. So yeah, we're not

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:57.400
 poking at anybody else. It's our experiences within our religious backgrounds, or non-religious,

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:02.440
 or easy. What would you call your weak, weak, religious backgrounds? Yeah, it's like, yeah.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.480
 But going back to original point, yeah, like it's, it's weird to me that, I mean,

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.200
 I just love the way I normally do it. I don't think about it, but until like me and Liz are

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.840
 talking about this, like, yeah, she's like, thinks, like this guilt thing is such a good, such a thing.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.720
 And I guess for you, that Quovin is like the way the universe is, is kind of like constantly a thing.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.920
 Yeah. Like, okay, I'm going to say some things. And Chris, I'm going to let Chris

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.960
 decide whether these things stay in the podcast. You're wincing. Are you wincing that?

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.880
 I'm not wincing. Oh, you're smiling. Oh, you're smiling. You revel in these moments.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.480
 I guess, like, for me to get more specific about the kind of things that really, like,

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:44.040
 turned me off from Christianity, just growing up in like this setting where I honestly,

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:49.080
 I look at it now. I know hyperbole. I feel like it's brainwashing. Like the kind of things that

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.080
 children are subjected to, just the amount of fear and the amount of like, you're going to die and

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.640
 burn in hell if you don't accept this. And here's what it means. And then you're going to be worried

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.080
 for the rest of your life. If you did something wrong, and I know, like, people are going to say,

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:05.560
 like, people with proper theology are going to say, that's not how it's supposed to be. And I'm

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:11.400
 sorry, you're subjected to that. Maybe it's just a regional thing. But yeah, there's just a lot

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:17.560
 of things about modern day Christianity and just their stances on a lot of things just bother me a

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:24.040
 lot. And I guess I got to a point where I asked enough questions to break out of the framework

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:29.400
 that had been instilled in my brain and like other influences and just other like, you come like,

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.120
 you get on the internet, you're connected with people all over the world. You get this outside

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.840
 perspective, growing up in the Ozarks, like before the internet, you think I have no inputs now,

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:47.560
 like, I had no inputs, like, it's funny because that technically exists here as well. But it's

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:52.360
 almost like funny because it's not it's like so not effective. I think it's because like, reality

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:57.160
 is Miami is like, it's like a city and it's like a very like, in a lot of ways, it's like,

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:03.560
 parts of it are like the opposite of like religion. Everyone here is Catholic. So it's so ineffective

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.320
 because like, Liz will tell me stories of doing all the traditional stuff for like,

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.400
 you went to a Catholic school, they made them promise XYZ things. They like, straight up told

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.400
 them, they're like, you're going to go, you're going to go to college and like, people are going

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.360
 to say all these things and like, and challenge your faith and all of that. And just so ineffective,

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.960
 because that's literally what happens. Like, everyone just leaves and like, you're just, you're

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.200
 like, you're, so it's not effective here at all. So just kind of funny to like, and everyone went

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.440
 through this process and almost everyone arrives at like, you know, maybe not any extreme place,

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:37.800
 like maybe find like the right balance for them. Yeah. So for us, it's like not like a

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:43.000
 upsetting thing. It's just like a comical thing. But then it sounds like for you, it's like,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.560
 it actually is very effective in terms of like limiting how people think or what they expose

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:55.480
 themselves. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. I mean, I think in this area, yeah, I'll kind of lay

00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.360
 off some of the specific examples. But if we're talking about religion, I have to bring up the

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:06.200
 closest thing to Christianity that I would say did resonate with me or kind of does would be a

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:11.960
 guy named, I'm blanking. He wrote like a ton of books, the hero with a thousand faces.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:20.360
 He died. Michael, the hero with a thousand faces. Joseph Campbell? Joseph Campbell. Thank you. So

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:25.800
 Joseph Campbell has pointed out and written all these books about like the commonalities between

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:31.080
 all the world's religions and like the stories that are universal. And they almost feel like

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:37.800
 there is some kind of like deeper connection to all of these stories that I don't know that I've

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:43.400
 seen some of his stuff, some of his talks. And like, if that were what Christianity were raised,

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:49.000
 if I were raised in that, maybe I would have like continued to believe it and not been challenged

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.800
 or whatever. Yeah. So I don't know, people who are like on the fence, maybe looking to Joseph

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.120
 Campbell, he seems cool. Yeah, I don't like this is some people really hardcore and they're like,

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:04.200
 super anti religion or like they think it should all go away. I think for me, there's like a fundamental

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:12.280
 value that it provides. Yes. It does like never like teaching like how to be and just like in

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.840
 like genuinely good ways to like stories and things like that. Yeah, it is genuinely a

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:21.240
 fundamental requirement that we need as a society over the thousands of years. Like there's a lot

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:26.440
 of corrupted forms of it and like problems from like the specific flavor of it. So I like don't

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.120
 want to remove that as a concept because I think people are completely lost. I think when people

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.920
 need to figure out every little thing for themselves, they just start to go down really weird paths

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.800
 when like a lot of traditional wisdom just has the right answers for. Yep. And again, people need

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:45.480
 to find their own balance. I think people swing towards like, well, none of it. It's funny because

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.440
 they actually don't end up thinking that they think they're doing this because they're thinking

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:54.280
 for themselves, but doing the opposite of what everything the religion said is not thinking for

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.360
 yourself. You're just doing the opposite of it. Yeah. Yeah. You got to feel like what of it,

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.760
 what parts of it makes sense? What parts of it maybe don't make sense for you, which is hard,

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.640
 but you know, I think that's where we have to land. So for me, I know like when I have kids and

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:12.040
 when I raise them, something needs to fill that place again. I don't know exactly what it's going

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:17.640
 to be like. I know there's things in culture that do that extremely well. I think there's some stuff

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.600
 from like traditional religions that also do that extremely well. So yeah, we're not to figure out

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:27.560
 what that is. But yeah, I like to want to throw away everything. Yeah, you need to hurry up and have

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:33.240
 kids because this is a thing Casey and I talk about all the time that we do feel like because

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.360
 we're both kind of at this, we transitioned through this together actually independently.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:43.560
 Neither one of us really wanted to break it together that we weren't really believing any of

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:48.760
 this anymore. But then came to the same conclusions. This is actually really cool. We still talk

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.600
 about with our kids like we don't want to just we don't want them to be wandering and completely

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:57.480
 lost and lacking a lot of the ritual and tradition that like there's a lot of richness to that that

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:02.200
 people get and some people just get it. I think what you're saying is like with their culture.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.680
 In America, I don't think we have that like I don't think we have a default culture and community

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.400
 that sort of like thrives outside of a religion. So that's definitely something we feel like we're

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:17.000
 lacking because we're both kind of like wandering on our journey of trying to figure out what

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.080
 spirituality is and we don't want them to be completely, you know, just lost or susceptible to

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:28.760
 anything that blows their way. I don't know. Yeah. I definitely see like the impact of religion

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:36.280
 on society and how it benefits large people groups. It just when it feels like it's not for you,

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:42.760
 then how do you kind of like get the good parts of it for your family? Yeah. I'd like you to

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.920
 figure that out because I know you're going to figure it out before I do and I've had kids for eight years.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.640
 Well, the one thing, the one thing we everyone's going to make fun of me for this, but whatever,

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:57.080
 I think it's brilliant. But you know how I named Zuko after that show, The Last Airbender,

00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.720
 I think we've talked about this before. Yeah. The structure of that show is actually very similar

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:07.000
 to, I would say a lot of religious texts where it's like a primary character that's traveling and

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.360
 coming across various scenarios and like through them dealing with a scenario, you learn something

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:18.440
 about morality or whatever. Yeah. That's the exact structure of that show. And they do such

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:26.040
 a fantastic job of like demonstrating all the nuance and gray area of like things that maybe seem

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:32.600
 obvious. And like it teaches such good lessons where I can imagine like we could watch an episode

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:38.600
 and then like talk about it after like what did we learn? Like there are a few things coming in my

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.640
 head like it's in the world, there's like some kind of like war going on. And there's a scenario

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:52.200
 where a guy is stuck. He's like about to get crushed, I stuck in a cave. And someone uses

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.760
 some of the day they come across him and then somebody uses like the power they have to like

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.760
 to free him. But they're not supposed to use that power because that pressing force is saying that

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:07.160
 you can't use it. So rescue this guy and the guy's grateful. But the guy that they saved

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:12.920
 turns turns and turns him in to the back. So even though he was saved. So it's like there's

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:17.960
 really interesting thing on like, is that guy bad? Like whose fault is it? Like he like stabbed

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.600
 that guy in the back even though he was saved. But in situations like this, like this is kind of

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:28.440
 how people act. They like are like really stressed by this larger force and you can't really 100%

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.640
 blame them. Like yeah, he did do the wrong thing by turning this guy in. But also this is kind of

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.960
 what happened in situations like that, right? So like it like handled all these like really

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:43.800
 nuanced things really, really well. And I think that's like ideally what you want from something

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.760
 like this. Yeah, no, that sounds awesome. So we'll just turn on what was it called Airbender?

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:55.640
 The last Airbender. It's like a lot of seasons. Is there a lot of these episodes for seasons?

00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:01.000
 Yeah, I mean, I think, I don't know, but I don't know if Archer's old enough to watch it,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.400
 but Ace definitely is old enough to be into it. Yeah, it's fantastic. Even as an adult just to

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.640
 like learn about learn about life and all those things. And I don't understand how the creators did

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:17.160
 this because I realized they were actually around my age when they created the show. I was like,

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.800
 wow, they could like do all this. They had all this wisdom and they could like communicate it in

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:27.240
 this like interesting way at my age. Like that's really insane. But again, it borrows ideas from like

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.720
 religions from all over the world, their ideas from all over the world. It's pretty good.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:36.440
 Yeah, so we're, I guess we've kind of like, we've talked about a lot of religion. Where do you land

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:43.640
 on like spirituality as like a human concept? Or just like a thing that we need or don't need?

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:49.160
 Do you have thoughts on that? Yeah, I think it's just like it's personal like Liz. Obviously grew

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:54.040
 up Catholic but moved away from more of like the practical side of it. But she still is like very

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:59.480
 spiritual and she still prays every day and like does a lot of things. That's a big part of her life.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.680
 And it's important for her. I don't, I just don't have that. I never really had that as a habit.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:09.800
 Same. I've never felt, I've never felt like a spiritual person. And I don't know like,

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.640
 then when you have religion without any kind of like feeling like you're spiritual at all,

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:18.440
 it's just like, what am I doing this for? Really random. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it always felt a little

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.000
 awkward for me. But then I don't know if I should be developing some kind of spiritual

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.920
 body. Like if I'm lacking something that's just like would be very beneficial in life,

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:32.280
 both for me and for my family. Like I don't know if I'm just accepting that I'm like this very

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:38.120
 materialistic whatever person is materialistic, the opposite of spirit. I don't know. Like everything

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:43.640
 that I can see and touch that's the only thing that matters. Yeah, material world. Yeah. I'm kind

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:50.040
 of the same way, but yeah, I'm also a little bit, I can see myself developing more of that at some

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:56.520
 point because yeah, maybe lost interest in it. That's something like maybe I think at some

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.920
 a young age kind of lost interest in it. I was never developed it again, but I can see myself

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:06.520
 getting into it. If I imagine it, it's not something I'm like, I hate that. It's like, oh, I can see how

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:11.000
 at some point I can get into that. But yeah, it's just not something that even clicks or registers

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.920
 for me right now. Same. I don't even know how I would like work on it. Like honestly, it

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:19.560
 doesn't feel like a skill like I'm like, try to flex. I think I was just trying to change the

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.440
 subject. It's really hard to talk about religion and spirituality. I only recently had the conversation

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:30.520
 with my parents like in the last eight months, six months, something like that. Yeah, yeah,

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:35.000
 it's been very recent. Yeah, no, it's just it's hard. I don't know. Maybe it's this area. It's a very

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.720
 monoculture where I live. Just like, you kind of feel like you're going to get kicked out of the camp

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:47.800
 if you don't align with a set of things. Yeah, it's a me even here. Like I said, if we're not going to

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.920
 send our kids to like school school, I don't think we're going to homeschool them. But

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:56.040
 if we want to, and if we need to, because we can't figure out the homeschool thing,

00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.600
 the only option are Catholic schools pretty much because public schools are not good. So we would

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:05.400
 have to send our kids to Catholic school. And this is a funniest concept to me. Like, I'm imagining

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:11.480
 my kid like following things that are like just so random from my point of view, because it's like,

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.480
 what the hell? Like, I don't know about any of this stuff. And there's technically like,

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:22.280
 the parents get roped it. They're like, you have to go to church. And you get your kids get in

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.600
 trouble where like, like, the school has a weird power over you somehow. I don't really understand

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:31.160
 this. And I'm like, I'm going to start doing all this stuff. That's just like, for me, like just so

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:36.280
 random. It's like a weird situation I find myself in. And all of those as friends who

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:42.040
 all complained about like how stupid some of this stuff at the private schools they went to

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.200
 are saying their kids is the exact same school, because it's not a big deal. Like, they're still

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.680
 with decent schools and like, it's not like the worst thing in the world. But yeah, it just is

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.120
 the only option. And I'm like, if I find myself doing that one day, it's just going to be like,

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:58.360
 I would have just never guessed that. Yeah, yeah. It's the same way. I mean, we have most of the

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.760
 private schools here are Christian private schools in Catholic. I don't know. It's that same thing.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:08.200
 I just offended so many people. I think from my experience, it's super different. I feel like,

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:15.320
 I think the difference is that I think in Catholicism is the one where you can confess, right? Yeah.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:19.240
 Like the priest and you go in and you confess. Yeah, yeah. Can you do that in Christianity?

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.200
 I did. I mean, it doesn't. No, it's not a concept that I'm aware of.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.880
 I think that that has a huge difference because I feel like Catholic people are like insane.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:32.280
 I feel like they're like way more like crazy, like crazy, really, like, like more like,

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:38.600
 bought in because they can just try to find a positive reset. They can confess and reset. It feels like,

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:43.880
 it almost feels like they just don't have religion. And given this idea of like,

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:50.040
 you can confess and still be good. That just makes them do more crazy stuff, you know.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:58.520
 So I think it in practice is pretty different. Yeah. I mean, it's like, when you zoom out, though,

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:02.520
 if you look at it from like a completely detached view, it's like, well, they're pretty similar.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.800
 Like if you consider all the world's religions, like, yeah, it's true. It's funny.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.720
 Well, even within Christianity, just the number of like different beliefs and different groups of

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:18.440
 people that hold different beliefs and denominations and there's like, there's crazy variety even within

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.720
 one religion when you zoom in close enough. It's kind of like a cup of water. Look how I just

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.360
 brought that back. Oh my God. Look how I just brought back the cup of water and all the little

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:31.240
 tiny molecules. Do you ever really though, do you ever think about like the big questions?

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:38.360
 Like why? Do you ever think about that? Okay. So there's one that me and Liz always talk about and

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:43.320
 we don't have an answer for it, obviously, but we have a different concept that's funny. I want

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:48.920
 to see if you relate. So there's this concept of like, why something instead of nothing, right?

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:53.960
 Yeah. And if you sit and really think about it, I experience this really weird feeling when I try

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:59.080
 to think about it and Liz experiences the exact same feeling. The feeling is my brain like,

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.320
 it feels like my brain shuts off or like it just impossible for me to actually think about it.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:09.800
 And it feels like someone put like a block, some like censored my brain from being able to access

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:15.480
 this thought process. It feels like every time I try to think about like, why is there anything

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.880
 instead of just really nothing like I get this weird feeling literally feels like we're in a

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:25.800
 simulation and like we're not allowed to think about that one topic. You're hitting the edge,

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.520
 like you're bumping up against the boundary. Yeah, because I can't I just can't ponder that

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.920
 at all. It's just like just my brain just just stops. Yeah, I don't I've never thought about like

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:39.160
 that or I've never had that sensation, but I've definitely tried to think about

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:43.320
 some of these things and then you just can't. It's like your brain can't really comprehend

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:49.720
 much of it at all. I mean, it's just like, anytime I spend time thinking about that question,

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:55.800
 just the why question it's it's kind of like there's why I asked the question. There's just no, I'm not

00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:00.200
 going to get anywhere with it. I'm not going to like connect deeper with myself on some level that I

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.520
 don't know. It's just it's like there's no answering it. And that's kind of fun. I don't know. It's kind

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:10.280
 of fun to me. The mystery of all of it. All of this. Have you seen that Richard Feynman thing?

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:17.480
 Beauty. Yeah. Yes. Because I mean talks a lot about that. 100%. If you want to know how I view the

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:25.320
 world, my spirituality, my whatever, my views, that video so sums up so perfectly how I feel. And I

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:31.800
 know like putting myself on Richard Feynman's level, like, yeah, sure. He relates with me a lot.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:39.320
 No, I just like when seeing that video, you sent it to me. Oh, okay. It just like so perfectly

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:46.200
 put words to things and thoughts about doubt about all these things that, yeah, it really that that's

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:50.760
 about as close to spirituality as I think I've ever felt like I had an experience. I'm getting

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.440
 goosebumps just like remembering the video. It's such a good video. So now we got to put the link

00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:00.920
 in the in the show notes or something. If you just search Richard Feynman beauty on YouTube,

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:05.720
 you'll find it because it's like it's a video and he's narrating over it. And it's like he speaks

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:12.200
 about this just like so beautifully and well. I love him as a human. Like I think in so many

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:18.280
 different ways, I feel like he like I just feel like he lived life like to the fullest in so many

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:24.040
 ways. Like obviously was all the science stuff, obviously. But then like I don't know if you've seen

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:30.680
 his like his letter to his wife after she died. No, it's like insanely beautiful. Like I like

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:36.040
 getting like so he like lived the relationship in romance part of his life really well as well.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.720
 And then he was like he like played the bongos. He had all these other thoughts and those other

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:45.320
 things. I was like he just we just wanted it all. He like had everything. I love life and wanted

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:51.640
 every part of it. He said definitely someone I admire a lot. Yep. I've got the letter pulled up.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:57.000
 I know I'm gonna I'm gonna lose it. I'm gonna read it here on this completely break down.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.520
 Yeah. Okay. So now I want to say like if you're offended, I feel like some people are gonna be

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:06.120
 offended. I know at least my parents are offended listening to this. So I just have to say like if

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:12.360
 you're offended, just like maybe talk to me first of all, don't just like stew and be offended.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:16.440
 But like my goal is not to offend you. I don't want to offend anybody. It's just not my goal.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:21.560
 Like I don't I'm not trying to attack anybody or make you feel bad for how you believe or what you

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:25.880
 I guess like saying that you brainwashed me. Like maybe that feels like an attack.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.440
 We've had that conversation. Now I'm just talking about parents. I'm gonna stop.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.120
 It's just a complicated subject. You know, it's just a complicated like there's a lot of time and

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:40.760
 emotion and other things invested into it that people it's just a hard conversation to have.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.440
 But don't don't be offended and not say something. Come to me. We can talk about it.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:49.320
 Yeah. It is complex topic. What do you say? Yeah. What do you say to that back? I mean,

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.000
 you can't have nothing to say to that. No, I don't have anything to say to that.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.920
 I this it seems very personal for you and and you're between you and your parents.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.560
 So I don't I really am singling out my parents. It's not just my parents. It's like

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.400
 it's just this whole it's just my whole life. I mean, it's everybody I know. It's

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:11.560
 it's like you just kind of have to like, okay, so that's not true. There's plenty of people in

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:16.760
 this area. No, you know what? I want to stop. I'm gonna stop. I've talked enough about my history

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:22.840
 and my background. I don't need to never mind. Listen, it's okay. Everyone so loves you.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:27.240
 Okay, that's good. That's it. I feel better. I feel better now. I'm going to watch the Richard

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:31.880
 Feimann video again. And then cried. Yeah. And then cried, read his letter to his wife. Oh,

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:36.040
 geez, that kind of stuff. Did you see the poem that was making the rounds on Twitter? Yeah.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:43.240
 It's like dadless grasses. Oh my word. I refuse to read it. I read like two lines and I was like,

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:48.200
 I'm not going to do this too much. It's too much. I will say, too, like on the topic of religion

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.520
 spirituality, having kids definitely amplifies this whole conversation a whole not. It definitely

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.920
 raises the stakes of all of it because you do start like, I don't know, you just think about

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:03.480
 the finiteness of our lives, the mortality, the mortality, is that the word? Yeah. I don't know.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:08.920
 You just think about like, it's hard to imagine time without your kids once you have kids,

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.800
 not that if you don't have kids, you can't experience these. I'm just saying like,

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:18.440
 it definitely amps up the stakes, I guess. Yeah, I refuse to think about any of those things.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:23.080
 I'm just going to continue to think about how I'm going to be a disembodied head floating. Oh, yeah,

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.760
 you're going to float around space forever. So you're not going to be with me.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:31.640
 Okay, well, we've already gone so long. I'm just going to go a little bit longer because

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:36.760
 is that okay? Do you need to go? No, I'm okay. So I will say like, I definitely went through a

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:43.000
 stretch when I was first, I'm going to say leaving the faith that just sounds like a priest or something.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.960
 It's just like the phrase that came to mind and like, that is, that is what it is. I definitely

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:54.280
 went through a stretch when those when I was really feeling like this is I don't, I just don't

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:59.640
 believe those things and I don't want to associate with that group an existential dread that I had

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.840
 never experienced before that because before that you had answers. It's like, this is what's going

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:06.760
 to happen. You're going to die and you're going to be in, you know, eternal bliss with not everyone

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:12.360
 you love or whatever forever. Once you leave that, then it is this overwhelming sense of like,

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.280
 we're going to die and then we're not going to exist. Sorry, I did it. I talked about

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:20.280
 a thing you said you refused to think about, but like, it's a hard thing to think about.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.360
 I'm not going to engage with you on this because I just, I just don't.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.840
 Yeah, yeah, totally fair. Just keep talking.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:31.320
 For what it's worth, I ultimately, when I land on that, that like, that thought that like,

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:36.040
 all of this is for nothing, I just don't accept it. I just don't believe that. I'm not saying I

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:42.360
 believe there's like a person up above the stars that's like controlling things or that there's a

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:46.920
 god or that we're all got. I don't have any specific beliefs of anything. I just refuse to

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.280
 accept that it's all for nothing. I just think there's, there's some mystery to it. And that's

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.400
 where I land. I don't know. Does that make me spiritual? Am I a spiritual person?

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.720
 I think so. That's like a belief in something you can't literally see. Yeah.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.680
 But you feel it in your, in your core that it has to be that way.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.800
 Wait, why that? Because I feel like there's a lot of things I believe that I can't see.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.120
 I believe electricity works. I can't see it.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:11.640
 No, but you, the reason you believe it is because you know there's an explanation even if you don't.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.720
 I don't know though. I almost like love that I don't know much of anything.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.440
 You don't know like, what do you mean? Like I don't, I don't know. Like it could just be random.

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:24.040
 And this could all just be stupid. And why are we spending our time talking on a podcast?

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.440
 Are you talking about electricity? Are you talking about what you just talked about?

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:38.680
 Oh, no, no, no, the, the life thing, the existence, you know, there's something instead of nothing.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:45.320
 That, that thing. Yeah, I think for me that just has never been that important of a question.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:49.960
 I think people ask me like, oh, this is all for nothing. I don't, I don't know.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:55.240
 It just like doesn't even click to me as a good question. So I think if I do think about it, like,

00:46:55.240 --> 00:47:02.200
 yeah, I also feel like it's too weird that there is even something instead of just there being

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:06.360
 nothing. So it's that that owns already like a very special, amazing, incredible thing.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:12.760
 So yeah, that's, that's like enough for me for to feel like, okay, I guess that's like spiritual as

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:18.280
 well. Yeah, I do feel like this is a touchy subject. I don't know, like, maybe you're not the only one

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:22.600
 that feels like, you don't want me to talk about it. I'm gonna stop talking. Because maybe people

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:26.760
 listening, like, I don't want to think about this. Just like stop thinking about it. This was good.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:31.800
 It was something. It was, it was good for me. I don't know if it was good for anybody that happens

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:37.080
 to listen. But it was good for me. Was it good for you? I think we're out of the big topics now.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:44.680
 Oh, we are. This one. Shut it down. 33 episodes. Well, I mean, we could go back to not talking about

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:52.520
 huge earth shadows. I think people that not into these huge, crazy things, we're, I think we're out.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:56.120
 We'll get back then. We'll just be talking about like PHP next week or something,

00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:05.720
 something that's much easier to think about. There's some joke in there that I'm not able to

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.800
 put it together in a spot and have something about like, well, Laraville forever. There's one.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:15.480
 I mean, I can't, I can't forget the joke. Something about like believing in PHP without ever having

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:35.560
 hosted. There's something there. That's it. That's it. That's the joke. That's the concert joke. You are spiritual. Yeah, there you go. Spiritual believer of PHP. It's funny. Everyone is keep saying that every episode we record. There's always someone saying that Adam is doing

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:45.160
 therapy in public. I really, it seems like it doesn't. So I will say, I don't know if I said this on that last episode where things got a little unhinged. But I feel like I'm

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:52.200
 better from like a emotional health, mental health standpoint. I'm better than I've been

00:48:52.200 --> 00:49:09.080
 for a long time. I feel like, but I'm definitely susceptible to like talk therapy is good for me. Like my problems, but I get into isolation and all these things. I think talk therapy is very helpful. So yeah, an element of this is a therapy for me every time I get on a call. So I'm sorry, Dax.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:38.600
 No, it's not your my friend because there's a, I don't know if you know what Esther Parela is, but she's like one of the most famous. I see she's like, I don't know what her actual title is, but I've not heard that. He's a very famous therapist. And she does a podcast where I've never actually heard it. Let's listen to it or she has listen to it. It's just therapy sessions that people have agreed to be posted publicly. Yeah. And they obviously anonymize a person and she's like an incredibly good therapist. It's always, I think it's always couple therapy.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:45.160
 And it's a very successful, popular podcast. So well, maybe we can have her on and we do some couples therapy.

00:49:45.160 --> 00:50:04.800
 Yeah, just reach out. Another hour episode. Look at that. People can, people can listen to on two X. Yeah, that's right. We're just not listening. If you don't want to, maybe they hear the beginning and like we're going to talk about religion. They just check out. Okay, let's actually go. Bye, Dax.

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:30.160
 I actually like while we're in a part that's being cut out, I actually like that we have little things we can say that are just like just for the live show. You have to come join us here on Twitch. Otherwise you miss it. Okay.
