WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
 I don't know. Did I put you in a weird spot? You feel uncomfortable because just like two of your friends

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.680
 It's like mom and dad are fighting. Is this weird? I don't know

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.880
 It's cold here this week. I had to put see that's it was jacket on my on my chair

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.520
 I had to wear a jacket. Oh, yeah, in Miami. It was 55 degrees this morning, which is 55 degrees which is freezing

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:54.640
 Literally not it's from my perspective. It's freezing. It's crazy again. I spent like what 25 years in the Northeast

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.560
 Yeah, you know

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.560
 winters whatever

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.080
 Never felt great about them, but it was like, you know, fine. Just whatever it dropped to 55 after

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.800
 You know a year and a half of being in Florida and like my ears hurt

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.520
 I have my kind of sick

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.600
 It's just like my body. It is amazing how much we adapt like

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.320
 I mean the people living in Minnesota and they're like walking around in shorts outside and it's

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.760
 -14 or whatever. It's just part of it. My favorite thing that someone pointed out once was in the winter

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.200
 When it like becomes starts to get a little bit warmer. Let's take it's like 60 something degrees

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.000
 You're like super happy going out in shorts and like really excited

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.840
 But then in the summer when it becomes fall and it goes to 60 something degrees

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.240
 You're like putting on a coat and a scarf and totally different perspective. Yep. Yeah, it's just all subjective

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.440
 Yeah, I went for a walk and it was 24 degrees this morning. So I don't want to hear about your 55

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.920
 55 amazing for accent a video right before it was maybe laugh, which is him like

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.600
 It just him like walking through like ice be like

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.800
 It's so cold that you just hear that wind like blasting and you know, it's like 10 degrees

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.440
 Yeah

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.880
 55 oh my word. I did spend a winter in Florida. So I I know how it's like ooh

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.720
 Chili yeah, chili 60 degrees this morning the two weeks of cold we get every year. Yeah, but that's when everyone comes down to south florida

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.360
 It's like it's really cold in the northeast. So people come down there and enjoy moderate temperatures

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.800
 Snowbirds my mom and my brother are coming

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.360
 tomorrow actually and I sent them a screenshot being like it's cold this week and they were like

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.320
 Is it because like the range was like 60 to 75 like every single day. Yeah, the next week and to me. It's like

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.840
 Not great weather, but for them the alternative is you know 20 degrees. So it just occurred to me

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.800
 We took a month off. We came back and we're talking about the weather. Yeah, we've gotten we've gotten really bad

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.680
 This is the third time we've tried to start this episode if this fails and the recording doesn't work

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.360
 We're just gonna come back again. Maybe never again. Yeah, we could

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.400
 How you been we have I feel like we haven't talked. We I mean, we've talked but it's been very like work

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.760
 It's like I need things from you because sst

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.720
 It's not been just hanging out. I've been good. It's been a lot of just work stuff

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.120
 Really because we're trying to push ion out. We're actually trying to get it out today a little

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.240
 Are you serious paid up preview for people? Yeah, the only contract within there is the next JS one

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.080
 Oh, right. Uh, that's the most complicated contract. So if we can get that working then everything else is

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.720
 Is simpler. Yeah, um

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.240
 But yeah, we're we're pretty excited about it. We uh, we keep like pushing it further and further and

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.440
 it really feels like

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.800
 Finally, we can say that the product is gonna be a reflection of of our skills whereas before we just had like yeah

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.800
 Such an artificial ceiling and every single dimension that we wanted to improve things

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:14.480
 Uh like do you want to give some context and back up a little bit on ion because there may be people who don't follow you on twitter

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.760
 Yes, and haven't seen anything about it. Yeah, so, uh, we at sst

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.640
 Which is a framework for building applications on AWS are working on a new version of it basically and we're code naming it ion

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.760
 The key thing that we did is

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.480
 Previously we were built on top of AWS CDK, which is a very AWS focused

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.120
 Infrastructure as code tool. It's like built around deploying stuff in AWS

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.200
 We've been building on top of it for two years

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.640
 Just discovered all sorts of problems and issues with it

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.280
 And we try to work on as much as we can and we're really at the limits of what we can do

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.640
 So we said, okay, we need to swap out our core engine

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.280
 And we wanted to tap into the the terraform ecosystem and kind of access the wide range of providers that are there

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.760
 One that are like well maintained because terraform is huge and people

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.200
 Like so many people use it more than more than CDK

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.880
 And too, like it gives us the ability to expand beyond just AWS like potentially anything

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.720
 And we also discovered Pulumi, which is a kind of a layer on top of terraform in a lot of ways

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.360
 So is that a swapper engine with that and we've just been able to do every single thing that we've always wanted to do

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.920
 Our deployments for next day as just keep getting faster and faster like what

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.200
 When you deploy this I already like make a change

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.760
 It's like down below 10 seconds now to get to get it out

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.240
 Previously, this was like a several minute process. So it just kind of shows you the gap that that exists

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.440
 Yeah, basically it just gave us full control over a lot of things. We didn't have control over before so we can

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.240
 Tune it to our exact use case

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.040
 And then beyond just the performance stuff. There's just

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.080
 Each are wise there's just so many like cool things that we can do now and so much has been simplified

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:08.000
 But yeah, pretty excited about it. And yeah, we're gonna get this like alpha release out and then in january, hopefully get like

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.560
 a full like practical release out that people could actually use yeah like it what is the long tail here because

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.800
 As someone who doesn't use next day a site. I use astro site and like normal api stuff

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.760
 Is this like the next few months most everything is moved over is it like

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.000
 A long-term project of migrating stuff and maybe some of it never gets migrated. What should I expect?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.120
 Am I going to be using I on this year? I mean next year. Yeah, I think the contracts will actually pretty be pretty fast

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.680
 I think at this point like a lot of the work was one us learning this new engine. Just understanding exactly how it worked

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.520
 Making mistakes kind of figuring out our design for it

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.160
 but the next day a site

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.840
 comprises of like

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.000
 everything else that we do like it has

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.000
 You know all obviously all like the cdn stuff and it also has all the lambda functions stuff

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.760
 But also has like a queue in it for isr also has like it just has like every single thing

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.320
 so I think the

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.880
 Getting to parity with sse today with the rest of the contracts will probably be pretty fast at this point

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.720
 Maybe another month

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.920
 Like the dev mode with live lambda like that might be a little bit of work, but

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.800
 I don't see this taking super long. I feel like we can get to pretty much everything that

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.040
 We have already today and like a month or two

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.040
 Wow, that's sometime in january and then from there we can kind of jump forward to

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.080
 All sorts of things that we don't have now

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:39.120
 Yeah, no, this is exciting. Yeah, that is the one thing like sse is that in terms of developer experience is so great

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.520
 It's so it feels so modern in a world

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.240
 Speaking of AWS. It doesn't feel modern

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.280
 In terms of like web dev if you come from that background

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:55.280
 But did like the cloud formation piece the the piece that you guys can't do anything about historically it just feels like this

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:01.440
 Uh, yeah, this thing you're waiting on all the time. Maybe like drop back down into yeah the ancient world

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.640
 Yeah, so it's very exciting to think

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:11.600
 This could get better real soon. Okay, so I have like a like a really grand theory about this which is kind of funny

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.160
 So I've noticed myself

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:21.520
 Uh, I used to be like most days. I would have like extremely long stretches of time where I was hyper productive and like

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.680
 Not distracted at all

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.040
 Once I switched to doing all this cloud formation serverless stuff

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.880
 All that suddenly started to become a lot more difficult and i'm really convinced it's because

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:39.920
 Several times throughout the day. I'm waiting on cloud formation, which is which can be anywhere from like one to ten minutes

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.960
 Yep, and it just gives me opportunities to get distracted and that just becomes a habit and over time it just kind of stacks on like

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.320
 And so just kind of brings you to a bad place. So I feel like this is gonna fix my whole life

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.440
 Wow, that's the hopes that I have for I mean, I I see the logic that gets there

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:05.440
 Uh, I do I think I've talked up some of that to just getting older and more distracted and there's more going on on the internet

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.200
 Uh, we've talked about that

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.560
 But the cloud formation piece can't be ignored because it is a meme within like the AWS twitter community

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.040
 We all joke about like

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.120
 That we spent half our day waiting on cloud formation. Yeah, it's it's a gateway to getting distracted

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.920
 Like when you're in the zone what interrupts you? It's cloud formation

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.800
 Yeah, it's like you you're all the feelings of guilt

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.800
 Like when it's when it starts deploying and I know it's gonna be a few minutes

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.520
 I'm talking. I'm gonna check my email. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do that

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.280
 And there's no sense of like, oh, I'm breaking out of the thing I should be focused on because like I can't do anything about it

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.960
 I'm waiting and it's gonna update and then I'll get back to it

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:48.240
 Yeah, once that's gone. That's gonna be a reality call or a wake-up call. Sort of like oh, yeah, I have to stay focused on things like

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.360
 My development environment's no longer in my way. Yeah, and that's like the critical thing of

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.520
 Like the fundamental thing about good developer experience is a fast feedback loop

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.560
 That's like that's the only thing you really need to do well. And if you can do that well, everything else kind of falls into place

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.520
 So

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.800
 Uh, we did that with live lambda that kind of brought fast feedback loop to

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.920
 Functions within everything else

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.280
 Is still kind of slow. So yeah, it's it's it's also annoying for me because now that I see all of this

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.520
 Uh, I still have projects all of my all my projects are on

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.920
 SST like the non-ion version currently. Yeah, and now I just hate

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.240
 I want the new things so badly and I wanted to switch to it already

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.280
 But today, I mean today the next JS construct like the people are gonna be able to use SST

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.160
 And if you if you use the next JS construct

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.240
 And that's mainly all you do is you deploy your next JS side in AWS

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.800
 The ion piece will

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.800
 Pervade everything you do with SST like your whole CLIs replaced. Is that how it works?

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.600
 Yeah, the CLIs written in go now, uh, which also made it a lot faster. So many things there we

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.560
 We could optimize, uh

00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:01.280
 It doesn't require npm at all like you just install the cli on your computer and it can just do everything no

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.840
 Packages, no nothing everything is built into the cli

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.840
 Uh, we do have like javascript's code that we ship

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:15.120
 But we actually pack it into the binary. So it's not like it's like fetched again from npm

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.160
 Yeah, yeah, there's lots of cool things like that where we made it

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.800
 So it's just a cli and a snow config file and

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.000
 You're good to go. This is awesome. I'm very excited. Okay. So what else is going big?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.400
 I mean been going on that's SST world. Yeah, I feel like you've been all over twitter

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.720
 Just like making the rounds

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.680
 I feel like you blew up and got way more famous just in the month we took off

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.960
 I had to get back on the podcast before you decided you were too big for me

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:47.200
 That's a case maybe I mean, I don't know it feels like you you're you're a part of every conversation

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.400
 You're starting most of them. I don't know. I mean just reflective of me spent the most time on twitter of anyone

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.320
 Yeah, when he said you've just been really busy working like just I guess twitter does count that is

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:03.360
 It's part of your work. I'm just running. Yeah, I do feel yeah, I do feel like myself has been getting like the floor of

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.280
 the amount of visibility my stuff gets is is different now

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.400
 Uh, and I definitely feel like I also feel that in the replies in terms of like

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.360
 the random people replying to me

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.240
 But yeah, obviously the the thing we're referring to the past two weeks just me like slamming vercell on the head

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:26.480
 Yeah, that there's been a lot of that. Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to talk about that some more on a podcast setting?

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:33.520
 Are you tired of talking about me? No, no, I will try a company because there is a yes triangle company with okay, you know what I love

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.840
 So I've been referring to vercell's triangle company and I've been hoping that it sticks

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.680
 I've been getting people replying to me

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.600
 Angingly upset about something I'm saying and even they're referring to it as trial and company. So I'm like, it's working

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:56.240
 That's funny. Yeah, the next I'm trying to get to stick is top g for yammo. I saw top g. That's

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:04.560
 Funny wonder if he even gets a smile out of that. No, he doesn't. That's definitely too serious

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:11.200
 So basically what I realized a couple weeks ago was

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.240
 I talked to so many people that are

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.280
 uh, like kind of doing stuff

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.320
 in this industry for the people that either

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.280
 Run other open source projects or like they have

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:30.720
 Developmental companies or like yeah, everything's wide wide spectrum of like all kinds of people from pure open source to

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.240
 Commercial companies like doing all kinds of things. Mm-hmm. Every single person

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.960
 in private has

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.120
 annoyance and beef with triangle company everyone is like upset and annoyed and like

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.880
 Vaguely wishes they would go away. Yeah for all for all it's the same reasons that everyone feels which is like, you know

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:56.800
 There's create a ton of noise and it's just very there's a very annoying player to have exist. Yeah, okay

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.520
 uh in private

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.160
 But a lot of them don't feel super comfortable saying anything in public which makes sense because you know

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.880
 Conflict is annoying when you want to avoid it. Yeah

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.480
 Just like just on the on the baseline of just like there's friction to have conflict

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.800
 Yep, but then also like, you know, some sometimes they do somewhat have some kind of relationship with this company or

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:23.040
 Yeah, it's complicated. It's complicated. Yeah, they go to the invite only parties that can yeah

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.480
 Yeah, exactly. So but so then I realized like, you know what like

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:33.600
 This is actually a not a good situation because uh versatile just takes advantage of this

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.120
 And they say whatever they want and they always frame it and they get very like

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.920
 PR authoritative

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.920
 Yeah, authoritative way where it feels like if you you can't really like

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.560
 argue with them really

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.560
 Make you feel unreasonable very quickly

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.000
 So

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.720
 It's like this weird asymmetry where like they just get to do whatever they want and everyone just kind of subset in private

00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.720
 And I was like, let me just what happens if I just like crack this and I just yeah instead of being subtle

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.160
 I didn't just 100 percent straightforward of here's exactly how I feel

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.680
 That's what I did two weeks ago or like it was last week

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.960
 And I'm not going to stop. I'm just going to keep doing this because

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.360
 It's weird. Everyone's I kind of self-sensoring themselves and no one like really

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.760
 Says what they're feeling. Yeah, and I'm hoping this can like drive people to

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.040
 Do more comfortable saying it without I have no like

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.840
 It's so funny like I see this all the time and this is like a big success of their

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.000
 dev rel team

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.680
 Whenever someone has a problem with them like not even the category of people on time

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.200
 I'm just a user of herself

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.840
 Yeah, they feel compelled to like decorate everything they're saying with compliments

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.520
 Like I saw a reply in one of my threads or somewhere where they were like

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.960
 Oh my god, Vercel is so great and I like love you guys and you guys I think everything you guys do is great

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.560
 But I haven't been able to deploy to my site

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.920
 And it's like this is not this is like a very reasonable thing to be upset by and yeah

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.880
 They've just been able to craft this thing where people feel afraid to like

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.560
 Not be pinned as like a Vercel hater or whatever. So yeah, oh, I've seen that. I'm exactly what you're talking about

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.200
 Yeah, exactly. So it's just it's like it's a weird dynamic and I think everyone feels even people in

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:16.400
 Like there's obviously it's this competition like we're in a space and there's competing views and projects and everything

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.480
 But I think everyone would feel better if they just kind of went away in a lot of ways

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.200
 Yeah, so if you're a user of Vercel and you're happy with them

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.600
 You don't want you you obviously also don't want this. You don't want the rest of the industry feeling like I wish they would go away

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.520
 Right. Yeah, so yeah, and you have to be honest. They're very easy to to poke because

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.120
 It's just like a relationship with AWS like you you get to like

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.760
 Just say what you actually think

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:45.680
 And they're very like polished on their end and inauthentic and it just the the contrast

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.760
 I don't know. They can't reply really. Yeah, they can't yeah

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.960
 They do have that very for being a startup. I guess I mean they're a startup

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.000
 They do have a very like stodgy inauthentic

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.880
 Professional like persona

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.760
 On social and everywhere else. I don't know if that's just they've all gone through PR training

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.960
 You can see it and I feel like I even remember the shift and I hate I hate all that PR training stuff

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:16.240
 It's it's it's there's there's like the obvious part of it, which we like it just sounds fake

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:22.560
 But then the part I don't like is a lot of it is just weird traps and tricks to like move conversations away

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.520
 In like an unfair way. Like if someone complains

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.920
 Yeah, make them feel bad about being a complainer and then talk about something else, right? That's like

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.920
 Yeah, it's it's usually stuff like that, which you know, I just

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.280
 Cannot stand it, but it's very effective like it's it works

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.880
 And you can see it all the time, but yeah, like they just make so much noise

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.560
 Like I just I'm just sick of them being like we are the people you go to for performance

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:50.560
 We are the best performance people everything we do is for pushing performance and all I did was post the recording of

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.760
 their own app and

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.600
 if that is like

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:02.080
 If that causes controversy then that's a problem if a recording of me using your product cause controversy like that's

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.720
 That's not my fault. Yeah, right

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.520
 Can I can I chime in on the the SPA versus whatever?

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.680
 server rendered

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.200
 I think like

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.200
 it's all just current

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.280
 Limitations

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.780
 in in terms of like developer

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:27.120
 Ability or an experience or the tooling like ultimately there is a best

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.680
 Right like native apps like if you ignore the initial download time of a native app

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:37.120
 It just is better like it's better. It feels better using it is better

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.680
 right and eventually

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:44.000
 Tooling I feel like everything gets out of the way and everything every app can be that good

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.720
 No matter what type of app or site it is, right?

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.880
 Are there fundamental differences in some products and they should be done a certain way

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.880
 Or shouldn't it ultimately all feel that good regardless of how it's done

00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:01.520
 They should all end up feeling that good like the stuff you post. It's just like super fast client side stuff happening

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.200
 Everything should get there. That's that's objectively better, right?

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.560
 Yeah, and that's why I posted that poll asking people right after I posted the during the whole SPA debate

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.720
 I posted the thing asking

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.400
 What what generally feels better to you a native app or a web app and of course almost everyone said a native app

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.920
 And I was like well native apps for all effectively SPA is like architecture wise

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:27.200
 So why do they feel better? It's clearly not because most apps have this like initial data fetch problem

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.520
 Yeah thing that like next year's harps on

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.480
 Yeah, I think the key thing a little bit what you said is if you ignore initial download time

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.560
 so

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:42.560
 There's a whole category of products out there where ignoring initial download time makes a lot of sense

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.880
 There's some where that doesn't make any sense and it's to be honest

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:54.000
 It's for apps that nobody uses if you don't go to an app often initial download time is a big problem. So yeah, yeah, like if you are

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.080
 Buying a shirt from some company and they make you download an app. That's a terrible experience

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:06.640
 Sure you want everything next year's does it's probably optimized for that and I'm sure it works great if I'm ever building an e-commerce thing

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.120
 I'm probably gonna go use that because it's probably really fantastic for all that stuff

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:17.920
 But then the other category of things which is probably what pays most of our bills and pays people salaries is

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.480
 That's applications like productivity applications stuff that drives business

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:30.320
 Initial download or initial cost is like so negligible there and yeah, everything should just feel like

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.720
 a native app and at some point I feel like we I do remember like for years

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.000
 uh, I remember the web

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.440
 Being like we can be as good as native. We can be as good as it keep trying to like close that gap. Yeah, it does a gap

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.720
 And then at some point, I know it happened. I figured I looked away for like

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:54.080
 A little bit and then that like goal just disappeared like people aren't talking about that at all anymore. They're talking about like

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.960
 Websites and how to make your website load initial load faster and like

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.680
 Yeah, it just doesn't make any

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:08.800
 Sense of me for putting things that I work on. Yeah, I guess like I don't know if if how I posed my if I even posed a question

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:14.720
 I don't know if what I said made any sense, but I think about like our use case. We have a big website

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.720
 I would say it's not really an app and we mostly get people

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.600
 That come for a short amount of time from google

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.960
 And they get some information from our site and maybe they come back. That's that's what keeps us running

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.880
 But like when I think about how our site it's not a big initial download. It's not a spa. It's like

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.520
 clunky multi-page navigation

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.680
 That's really sub-optimal like it would feel as good as a local app in an ideal world

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.840
 And it would have all the benefits of loading fast

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.800
 Somehow you got to do both the same time

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.760
 And we're not there yet. Like we're not doing all the right things, but I just think like I can acknowledge

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.800
 Even our site it'd be better if it was all client-side rendered and if it was like fast

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.440
 on the front end like regardless of

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:07.360
 How people get to it and how right what they expect like there there's still room for improvement and I feel like everything's ultimately driving toward

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:13.840
 That that spa-like experience. Yeah. Yeah, and even for us and it's just kind of limitations

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.480
 Even for us that all applies in the other direction too, right? So

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.120
 All of myself is extremely client-heavy and that's great and has all this if we were talking about

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.880
 But there are some experiences that are bad because they're client-heavy

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.440
 The example I gave is

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.880
 Uh, if you get an alert for an issue

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.040
 And you click it

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:40.240
 You're going to see like a spinner while like the client side data sync happens and gets a new issue and then renders it

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.640
 Uh that experience should be

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.200
 Diverside rendered that would make things a lot better, but I imagine it's similar to you guys where like

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:52.240
 Like 95% of our flow is handled fine with our primary approach

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:58.000
 And we will eventually get to like the last 5% with like mixing an SSR and follow the reverse for you guys

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.680
 Uh, so yeah, you have to use everything. I was kind of my initial point with it all like I just don't like this

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.040
 Consistent thing that you hear from triangle company, which is

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.480
 We launch a new acronym

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:17.280
 Literally your sites are going to be great and i'm pretty plugged in. I don't even remember what the new acronym is

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:25.200
 ISA. What is it? T what is it? PPR PPR points per reception. I'm a fan. I'm a fantasy football player

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.440
 So P PPR means something. I'm sorry. You can't just repurpose it

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.400
 I guess the overlap that VIM diagram is not that large

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.360
 Like people who care about modern web rendering and football and to be honest, nobody really understands PPR

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.080
 I guarantee you like very few people will get it. The only reason I understand I've read a few things and I still know

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.160
 Yeah, but it's funny to me because this is like it's like held up as a holy grail

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.000
 And if you step back

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.120
 Like from the way they're talking about and look at what it is. It just delivers like a stupid shell faster

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.600
 Like you're talking about this stuff like it's so amazing

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.080
 Like you get to see a useless shell faster than you would have otherwise amazing great

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.800
 I get to see my navigation that I can't do anything with

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.480
 That I didn't come here to see like is that like this one talking like why are we this?

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.800
 Why are they like push

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.480
 They're on the throne of this like performance and like great experiences and all this stuff and it's just like yeah

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.920
 This other talking about is so relevant not impressive at all

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.880
 Yeah, I feel like they can't they can't actually highlight how great their thing is their new

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:30.960
 Thing without just comparing it to the previous new thing. They made yeah, it's like this is better than ISR

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.200
 Look at these reasons. It's like wait a minute

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.280
 But it's not good like it's not a big deal

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.880
 Yeah, just because it's a lot better than the last thing you did doesn't make it

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.880
 Worth getting this excited about as a twitter sphere

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:48.720
 Yeah, and a lot of their stuff is solving their own problems like the ppr thing like they made the problem

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:54.160
 Yeah, it only exists because they can't in the versatile architecture. They they can't render at edge

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.360
 Uh, so they do this whole like step build that

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:02.800
 Like statically computed at build time and they pitch it like that's like a crazy performance benefit

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.520
 But you're saving like one millisecond compared to something that can

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.480
 Render at edge so it's and it again took me a very long time to even like pull that apart

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.960
 Understand that so I just hate the amount of noise that it creates

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.360
 And I'm forced to spend time like digging into noise like I asked questions about this stuff

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.280
 And then yeah, just over and over and over and over at some point we guys like

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.760
 This is kind of a joke like we can't let these

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:29.760
 Just like drag them drag everyone. There's over and over again. Yep. Yeah, this stuff does matter like

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.600
 People there's a lot of people in the periphery who are not super plugged in

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.560
 Uh, I know from like my time in consulting

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:41.600
 The amount of clients that have some vague idea about like we should use this because I heard it's really good

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.960
 Like that comes up and then I spend energy like explaining

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:50.320
 For what they're doing like this is good or this is good and you could do either and it's not that big a deal

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.400
 But they're dead set on using yep x which maybe isn't good for what they're doing

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.800
 But because the loudest voices in the room

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.800
 Continue to beat certain drums. I don't know it is annoying

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.720
 The thing I told them to trade up was like you're putting the burden on other people to provide clarity

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.440
 Like you just say all this stuff that makes no sense and then

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.000
 The thousands of people are now dealing with

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.400
 Yeah going through that and trying to convince people of now here's what it actually means

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.480
 The other thing that I found interesting about this

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.400
 Uh is I was able to actually connect with some people that also are super into

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.960
 building snappy

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.680
 client-side applications, uh, so there's app which I've actually come across before prior to them even

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.400
 Uh, replying to they like replied to one of my tweets or quote tweeted or something

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.560
 Talking about their own app. It's called fae app. I think it's f-e-y-a-p-p

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.560
 And wait say it again f-e-y

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.720
 Yeah f-e-y

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.400
 app.com

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.200
 Okay, I don't know why that was so hard for my brain to follow

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.880
 Fae app

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.840
 Yeah, I think they're like wildest dreams to replace like the blue merg terminal. Uh, it's like a financial research

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:52.800
 Yeah

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.680
 tool

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.680
 But it's built in the style of

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.840
 these amazing client-side apps like super fast super like unbelievably fast

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.880
 Uh

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.200
 keyboard shortcuts for everything like crazy productive

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.200
 Really really impressive

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.480
 And they were talking about like hey like we're choosing spa also for all these reasons and look at our literal app

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.480
 Like look you can go look at it and try it

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.280
 And they talk about how like we are using actually as we're not like using any of the server-set stuff like what's yeah

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:23.600
 really a client mentor thing and uh and germos replying the thread like arguing with them

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.320
 And they're literally like

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:31.680
 Well, like we did it like here's our app and he's like no you can't do it like it's just like the

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.520
 Like the nine reality like there's an app right there being like

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.040
 This work for making money like this is our product and it's like this isn't really work

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.240
 And it's like what why like why is this

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.480
 Interaction that needs to be had there was a time like when next year

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:53.520
 Just doing like a spa with next year's was sensible and even like yeah, not frowned upon from versel

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:58.160
 Dashboard is an espa the spa. Yeah. Yeah, like it was just a good

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:03.920
 It was just a better default than create react app or whatever like it was just a better bundler slash whatever

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:09.760
 And then yeah the last few years next year's just become this like very opinionated about

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.280
 Like the server side of everything and how

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:19.760
 Bites flow in what order yeah to the client. Yeah, and it just reflects their customer base

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:26.160
 Which are which is not reflective of our industry. I think yeah customer base is like media e-commerce type situations

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.880
 And yeah, that's a big industry and they should serve them

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.560
 But like it doesn't apply to the rest of us. I think it's it's time

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.160
 I think there's like they had their time and I think everyone's kind of sick of them

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.640
 under the hood

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.080
 And you know I think their time's passed speaking of kind of sick at the arm bedroom right now

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.080
 Let's talk about other

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.760
 News and things that have happened on twitter

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.440
 I've got two things I want to call out things I saw on twitter and I want to hear your opinion

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:55.280
 But we could do something else for you to other first. No, go ahead. Okay. Uh first. Have you seen fascinating on twitter?

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.720
 It's like an account called fascinating and it posts

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.960
 Really fascinating things like facts or like

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.640
 Pictures like events in history like people things that happen

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.320
 I don't think I've seen that if you don't see this it just in the last week or so two weeks

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:15.280
 Maybe it started cropping up on my feet because I use the for you like I don't know if that's frowned upon

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:20.160
 I don't know I use I feel like I'm making like a political statement like I use I use the for you tab

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.640
 People have strong opinions about this, but I just started getting this like fascinating

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:29.840
 And and I remember hearing things about how like twitter power ties is like time

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.680
 You spend staring at tweets and the replies and then the ad model and all that

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:39.840
 And then there's like the the actual monetization like people who the creators getting money

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:46.880
 From time spent looking through replies. Well, it's turned into a cesspool of like you click on a fascinating tweet

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.920
 Because I click on every single one of them because they're not like short enough in a tweet

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.320
 You have to read more and then the replies are full of the same handful of counts

00:29:54.320 --> 00:30:00.560
 Uh that post even more fascinating things some of them related to the original some not at all

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.960
 And I end up in like a 25 minute

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.720
 Just like one fascinating tweet to sit me down a 25 minute rabbit hole

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.720
 I'm like on Wikipedia reading about these situations and these stories

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:17.760
 It's it's taken over my twitter usage and I wonder how many people this has happened to and like how much money is fascinating making

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:23.600
 I don't know you're just in a state of constant fascination. Yeah, they've just they've tapped into something

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.760
 They've prayed on my reptilian brain

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.560
 And I cannot get out of the replies

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.880
 But it's like this the same

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:38.400
 Seriously the same handful accounts somebody's gonna hear this and they've had this experience. Yeah, the same handful accounts that they'll reply with like a one-up

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:44.960
 It's like the fascinating tweet was this person did this thing on this date in 1962

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.400
 And then the reply tweet will be like, but what you didn't know

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.920
 It's so much more important and so much cooler. It's like they're doing this on purpose each other. I don't know. It's it's wild

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:59.040
 You gotta look it up. So are you like okay with this in your life? Are you gonna block them or gonna? I don't know

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.800
 Yeah, I the other day I thought like I should just like click a button

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.680
 I'm sure there's a button here in twitter where I can say I don't want to see fascinating tweets anymore

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:10.800
 I don't want to see them because just I'm spending too much time. The thing that's making me laugh so hard is

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.000
 whenever you say fascinating. I don't think of it as like

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.160
 The user name is like I don't want to see tweets that are fascinating

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.680
 I mean generally I don't I don't see anything fascinating ever again

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.240
 Like unless it comes from my friends on twitter

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.080
 Yeah, I think I do I need to cut it out of my life because it's it's a lot of time spent

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.080
 I don't I feel like I don't see anything

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.760
 From you guys anymore because I'm just reading these stupid awesome

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.400
 Historical facts. Yeah against you will

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:42.640
 Well, it's funny because the other thing I have noted

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:49.440
 Uh, well one thing you described sucks. I hate it. Yeah, one of the things I liked about twitter historically has been

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.080
 the stuff that just like

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.040
 Leverages your brain like that like on instagram and other places

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.880
 Wasn't as prevalent on twitter and now it's that we have to dodge it. I'm here too

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:04.880
 I feel like it's it's got to be a product of the monetization like they figured out they can make a lot of money doing these and

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:10.240
 People will read them. It's like it's working. Do they really make money from twitter paying them though?

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.320
 I don't know. I mean they get a lot of

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:17.120
 Whatever is on each impressions or whatever they if they like get a hundred x of views

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.920
 I do and they're getting paid hundred x as much as I am like

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.640
 I guess that is significant money. I don't know. I don't know who's behind these accounts

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.840
 It's not like a big media company. So it might be just an individual and it's like this is a great that sucks

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.280
 The other thing I've noticed which I hate is

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:39.840
 As it's on any post that goes big especially if it's funny if it's income some kind of like funny meme, whatever it is

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:49.120
 The replies are all just completely unrelated other things other like yeah videos or whatever and I hate it because like I want to see people like

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:54.560
 replying to the original thing with clever stuff funny. Just one is fine because relevant and the other

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.560
 Four is completely unrelated. I don't know. I don't know where that popped up about it. I think that's like

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:03.760
 Also kind of new instance. Yeah, I think it's it's all been part of the shake-up

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.240
 Like I agree and I think like tiktok

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:11.600
 They've got the like hilarious comments thing down like I look at my wife's tiktok right exactly

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.600
 It's like every you go to the comments because you know there's gonna be hilarious and they are

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.640
 Yeah, and there's no bit of unrelated anything there, but twitter's definitely turned into like

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:25.280
 Some kind of monetization game that people have figured out on the creator side. It's annoying

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.760
 Oh, you know what I think in tiktok. It's actually kind of simpler because

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.560
 it's like

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:39.280
 Like the tiktok posts and then just pure text replies, right? You can't like embed another video right? There's no media

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.320
 Yeah, it doesn't really make sense for twitter to be that constrained but

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.880
 I know that's kind of what allows for yeah stupid thing

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:52.080
 It just feels like an abuse of something and it's unfortunate because twitter didn't used to feel that way

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:57.440
 Do you I guess it might just be because I I really thought I mean I was worried about the monetization thing

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:03.920
 I didn't expect twitter to even have enough money to like give out to the point where this would create a problem

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:09.280
 Yeah, but the thing I always forget is dollars are worth different amounts in different parts of the world

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:17.520
 No, that's true. Yeah creators of india can afford. Yeah, like exactly. Yeah, so yeah, that probably makes a difference

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:22.000
 Yeah, it's annoying. I'm sorry that I call that india. I don't know if that felt offensive to you

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 You last a long way in india. It does

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.800
 Assuming elan's paying the same dollars all over the world. I don't know. Oh, that's a cool

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.520
 I guess they would have to like fake it but you have to like

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.440
 Reach. Oh, you could like be an american account

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.040
 But like all the dollars are coming from the advertisers at the end of the day

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:46.320
 So it has to be a percentage of whatever the advertisers are paying you'd have to reach american accounts

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.520
 Yeah, yeah

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.280
 The other thing I saw on twitter that I wanted to ask you if you saw this is just like yesterday. I think

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:57.600
 Uh a little new school versus old school. Did you see the theo and dh h back and forth? Yeah, I did

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:04.320
 Yeah, that's funny. It was good time. So just I may have missed even some of it. I don't know if more has happened

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.400
 I think the last thing I saw was theo calling out

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.480
 Uh, that this is the guy that skipped rails conf because

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:15.200
 There are other people keynoting. I don't know if there's any reply from dh since then, but yeah

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.360
 uh

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.040
 That's it too. Yeah, I don't know. So dh is the delays. You can talk. I think you're in a weird spot

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.560
 No, you feel uncomfortable

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:27.760
 No, because just like two of your friends because me and dh are best friends. It's like it's like mom and dad are fighting

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.840
 Well, no just dh hero of yours

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.120
 Theo friend of yours is this weird? I don't know

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.560
 Dh my my former hero. Oh, right, right. You have a complicated relationship

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.520
 Very common here relationship with the hh. Yeah, so the latest thing he's been talking about is uh once

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:48.800
 Which is his idea that people want to pay for software just once and get out of this

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.760
 Oh, is that what it is? I saw a reference to that and I didn't know what i heard about once

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.760
 Yeah, and that's a good domain to the thing he's trying to do it. Yeah, he has it

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.320
 He's got it. Yeah, he does

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:04.160
 The second one is the bundle list thing where like you just chip

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.920
 your exact

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.360
 Filetry

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.720
 Yeah, dials with filetry and then you just like pipe it in over a single connection

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.360
 And kind of seeing how far he can go with that

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.800
 Like with everything with dhh. I think he's not wrong. It's just

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.760
 True in a very narrow

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:26.880
 If you like constrain the world to a very narrow place like what he's saying makes a lot of sense and it's true

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.520
 Yeah, and I think people struggle

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.120
 With that both people that are against them both people that are like like what he's doing people like what he's doing

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.720
 Then they just try to like they think it applies way broader than it does

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.160
 People don't like what he's doing. I can't see that it does make sense

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.200
 Within like a smaller context

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.320
 uh

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:51.520
 So yeah, that was funny though. I see them go back and forth. I think uh to be honest

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.960
 I don't like

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:59.440
 That when people pull up like aren't you the guy that blah blah blah like I don't really like that because it wasn't related to the

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.480
 Oh, yeah, sure to the there's a name for that. Isn't there? I think there's a name for that

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.280
 Yeah, it just and the other thing is I'm I kind of

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.400
 My whole interpretation of that rails conf thing was like

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.680
 I think people reduce it to he didn't get to keynote

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:18.880
 So he's like annoyed and he's gonna skip the whole thing as protest because he's doing he didn't get enough attention

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:23.360
 Yeah, but to me, I think what was happening was that was during the time where base camp was just getting like

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.520
 Fried left and right for all the stuff that they were doing and he felt that

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 It was annoying or unfair that rails the thing he created is like

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.040
 Caving to this other external pressure that he's like kind of unfavourable character

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.680
 So I can see why why in his

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.080
 Point of view after like a year of that being like like fuck this like you're gonna take

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:50.400
 It's away from me for that reason. It's probably more complicated. That seems on the surface. Yeah. Yeah, I don't blame

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.480
 I don't blame them too much for that. Like uh, that's annoying. I hate I hate when people

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.880
 Get removed from the stuff that they created. It happens very often

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.960
 I mean the same ultimate thing also was like oh, yeah an example of that

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:08.880
 So, yeah, I just I don't know. It's it's complicated. I just I DHH is not a person. Just wish he would go away

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:14.320
 I think it would be better. He wasn't around. Yeah. Yeah, I did I saw all that interaction

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.560
 And I was kind of like oh like it's I can't imagine I have strong opinions about this bundling stuff

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.160
 Like seeing Theo tweet that stuff and then I saw another DHH tweet like right after that

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:27.040
 Just like ended up on DHH's profile and it's like talking about his cloud cost savings. I was like you

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:34.960
 Okay, I get to go after him Theo. Yeah, that idiot. I saw this morning. He posted his AWS bills going down. Yeah

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.920
 Yeah, yeah for him. It's great. Good for him. It's great when you have a business. That's not growing anymore. You find a way

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:44.640
 Like nobody uses base camp. Sure. Yeah. I mean, uh

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.840
 Someone said that they I think it was was it was it Ian?

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.800
 He was saying that he's got such a big following that anything he says is gonna sell

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.400
 And he can point to it to say like look it worked. Oh, yeah

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:02.400
 Yeah, which is you know, that's I think that is kind of like oh like you enough people just follow him blindly and

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:07.920
 Everything he do gets confirmed because of that. I'm looking forward to being at that phase where I can just confirm

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.720
 Look these people did it

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:16.640
 Okay, this is gonna be really abrupt ending to our first episode back

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.640
 But I have to be really bad because you bounce me around. I have a phone call. Yeah, can you tell?

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:26.480
 All right, we're excited to be back. We are excited. Thank you. Thank you. Yes

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:31.840
 I do too. Even if we don't publish them, I'd be excited just to do this and pretend like we have a podcast again

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.560
 But we're gonna publish them too. Yeah

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:40.960
 Once a week, we're gonna try once a week. Just yeah a little better quality versus quantity a little more

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:47.120
 Substance in each episode. Maybe it might not work. It might just be the same inequality but now less of it

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:56.320
 The knobs will figure out the right. Yeah. Yeah, we'll try. Okay. I'm gonna go pee. All right. See ya. Yeah
