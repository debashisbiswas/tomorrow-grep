WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.340
 If you're not met trash from person, I bet you're feeling some some promo right now from meeting trash in person cares about that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 I just the X logo. I just I just don't like it. I know I need to find the right way to articulate it. It conveys a certain vibe to me that's very familiar.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 And you know, it reminds me of like high school era. Maybe I feel like stuff looked like that during like the 2000s. Yeah, the early 2000s.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Yeah. Yeah. The first decade. Yeah. And I'm like, just something about it feels off. I've heard people complain about it and I guess I don't have any feelings about it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 I do miss the bird and the colors. Like I miss Twitter being kind of like symbolically and physically light. Yeah. And it does feel a little heavy with the X and the black and the monochrome.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 So I don't like that part of it. But I guess I don't like think the X itself is good or bad logo.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 I think to me, it's the X plus that like grungy background that the icon has. And that reminds me of like T shirts we made in high school or something or like, okay, I do know what you're talking about.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Yeah. Or it kind of feels like what like luxury or like premium stuff look like back. I don't know. Something about it just feels outdated or like corny almost. Yeah. And I don't, I don't even mean on that.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Where does that show up though? Is it actually on the icon or is it just is it Twitter.com that I say it's on the icon. I just saw it when I opened up the broadcast thing.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 It was like stream on X and I had that like that does also do is like kind of gold ish kind of background in a few places and that also reminds me of the 2000s.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Yeah. Yeah. But like we've talked about before, all this stuff is just so subjective. I'm sure like given enough time, I might like be into that aesthetic again if it like if I'm conditioned in the right way.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Yeah, it's interesting. I just saw, I think levels tweeted about stripe. It was like you saying that it's a bad sign. Like it's a red flag.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 I think he said it on a podcast actually, but it came up on Twitter. It's a bad sign. If you're MVP is like polished and looks nice and somebody was like, uh oh, and they like linked a screenshot of stripe because I had gradients.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 He said something about gradients. Like if you have all these nice gradients. Anyway, he quote tweeted that and was like, yeah, exactly look at stripes MVP and it's like this awful looking 1990s website because it was probably made in the 90s.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And then it hit me this conversation we've had before, which is like, is it actually awful looking? Or is it just that design continues to evolve? So everything from 10 years ago is going to look bad to us.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 And 10 years from now, everything now is going to look bad. Like, is there any real truth when it comes to design? We've had this conversation. We don't have to have to get it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Yeah, it's a classic spiral thing. Like we're definitely like getting with the upward spiral or whatever. Like we're growing and objective dimensions, but we're also circling back to like ideas at the same time.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Mm hmm. Yeah. Did you see? Okay. Speaking of design. Did you see the linear thing that I quote tweeted? So he physically poured oil on an iPad and they filmed it with a camera?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Yeah. So for context, then you're launched a new feature yesterday and they had this cool like animation for it. It was the logo and it had like this warping like refraction effect going over it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 I didn't think too much of it. Actually, when I saw it, I like wasn't actually that impressed by it. I was like, okay, this looks cool, but I thought it looked a little bit different from other stuff.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 I didn't stick out. Then I see a tweet from the guy that made it and he was like, oh, yeah, this was made by I just filmed myself pouring canola oil on my daughter's iPad.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Just blows my mind. Yeah. I'm like, that is. And he was told like, yeah, he was told like two days ago that they needed this. So he came up with this like on the spot too.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 So I guess I'm trying to understand like filming with a good camera. How do they then take that into the digital realm in like a high fidelity way?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 So it was an iPad image of their logo and he poured oil across it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 I've seen a few people do this now. Do you see the Vercel preview of their new website?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Is this the one where you can do the up, down, up, down, right, left, BA thing? I didn't know that was a thing.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Yeah, yeah. I saw Guillermo tweeted that and it unlocks like you can change colors and stuff. You can do all kinds of weird changes to the site.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Oh, that is cool. I got to try it. I got to say with my Vimeo first because that always triggers.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 I do too. Yeah. I'm like, it doesn't work. I about tweeted something like, I can't get it to work. And I realized, oh, that's the Vimeo command bar coming up.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Okay. So, you know, I was working on a command K bar, like the one for a console. Yeah.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 And I kept hitting escape and it wouldn't close. I did escape twice. I spent so long debugging this and it was a good Vimeo thing.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 But anyway, yeah. So you just just don't use Vimeo anymore.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 No, no, no, definitely use Vimeo. Just disable it for things that it's probably wrong. It's like DNS. It's probably good.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Yeah. Can we go back to the style thing before we get into the topic of today? Yeah. Yeah.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 What pants? Do you wear pants that are tight on your ankle or like bag? Yes, I do. I wear like jogger type pants and I've been doing that for a long time.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Me too. It came around, I don't know, five, ten years ago. You know, like when we were in high school, I'm a little older than you, but sometime growing up, you remember when like the flared out 70s look like the bootleg pants.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 Stuff was just baggy back then in general. Yeah. But there was like the extreme bell bottom. Yeah. Yeah. I was never into that. I've seen, I remember seeing that, but I always found it kind of weird.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 That was like my high school, like formative years. That's what everybody wore. Okay. And then whenever the tight around the ankle came out and became like the thing everybody did, I have stuck with that and I will never change ever ever.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Like it feels so much better to me to have like a, I don't know, tight clean pants against my shoe situation. Me too.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 And I think like that's how I know I perceive my dad is like, why is his fashion 30 years old all the time? Yeah.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 It's because you find the thing you like and then you're never going to change again. And I saw, we went to like a gap kids to get some stuff for the boys.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 And the style now is like these giant baggy pants. Have you seen this? No, is it back? Oh, my God. I'm not going back. I'm stuck.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Do you find it? I know it. If you're like, do you find yourself being a note if you see your kids wearing it? Well, they don't. I mean, we didn't get any baggy pants.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 But like theoretically, if they did, yeah, I would find that annoying. I think I would be like, Oh, that looks so bad. Yeah. I think I just, I've decided what objectively looks good now forever.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 I know style is constantly changing fashion is changing. So yeah, I guess it will be annoying. AJ told me that there was some research showing that people's music tastes like really codify at a certain age and just kind of freeze.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 I believe that that's their life. Yeah. Yeah. And I wonder if that just applies to things more broadly. It explains everything. Like, you always wonder like, sometimes you hear older people as in a certain music.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 I'm like, how do you enjoy that? Like, that just seems so, it doesn't even seem like music to me, but how did a lot of people like the Eagles?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 I don't get it. I don't. Yeah. But I guess that's going to be us. But it's funny to imagine it with the music that I grew up listening to. Like, it's funny to imagine the music music we listen to being like classics.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Yeah. Like you're kind of classic channel and it's like Kanye, like, what the... Is that really going to happen?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 All these. Yeah. All these. Okay. Let's jump in. We're going to talk about the next year's stuff, right? I got to say, before we get into it, I know I said this few episodes ago.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 This was how we started. Our first, very first episode of this podcast was next year's comp recap, right? So it's been one year.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Wow. And next year's comp is today. I know. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I just saw these tweets where people asked if we were going to react to next year's comp.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 When is next? I know it's today, but what time is it like, I think it's 10 Pacific, I think. Oh, is it five hours long? Okay. Here's the thing. I don't. I think it's, I personally, I'm not a big talks person. I know you aren't either. So I don't think it's going to be that interesting. I don't want to react to it for five hours. Okay.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Okay. But if there's like a keynote or like whatever, they're from Versailles messages. Oh, like the Guillermo keynote. That's probably the first thing. Yeah. I would enjoy roasting that probably. That would be fun. I don't know if I can schedule. Not like I just had something Casey needed for me today.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 So I may not be able to. But it's saddens me because of all of the things we just mentioned. Yeah.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 It's, it's, this is like one year in the making. Look at us. I wish we had made it to 100 episodes in a year. How many would that be? That'd be like two weeks? We do. Yeah, we took a break. We do two a week, but we didn't start that till. Yeah. Yeah. More recently. Yeah.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 I don't know. One year, 100 episodes. That just sounds cool. Two years, 100 episodes will sound cool. 68. We're one off. Are you kidding me? Oh, I just put 38 is the title. Oops. That's we've done more than that.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 Oh, we're one off. Despite being 68 episodes in, you're putting in the wrong title. I still haven't gotten your audio, right? Yeah. We'll never figure it out.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 We're probably better than last year because last year was when you kept putting our faces over, over the video.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 There's a little turk say something about that. It's true. That was a, that was good.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 I think Teige came on with this too, and he didn't know anything about next year. That's right. That's funny.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 Okay. So we're going to, we're going to read Kent's article. Yes. Yesterday, the episode, right? Can't release an article called Why I Won't Use Next.js.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 The spiciest possible title that could ever be. It's not just kidding. Yeah. So obviously in the position that he's in teaching people how to build web applications.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 A question he gets a lot is why is yourself not built around next year's given you do anything in web you're going to come across next year's really quickly.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 So imagine you get this question a lot and he wrote it up so he could just point to it. It's kind of like how I get the question of help me use Prisma in serverless like I get.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 That's like my equivalent. I should probably write an article like this. Why I won't use Prisma.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 You shouldn't be there. My article will be way angrier than Kent's is so. No, this is a really good article. I actually did read it.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Yeah, I think I saw I didn't see him announce or like posted on Twitter. I think I saw your quote tweet was how I saw it.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 And you said nice things. Yeah. I read it as a reasonable article. I think resonated a lot.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 And I felt those same nice things. Yeah. So are we going to, how do you want to do this? You want to just kind of like go through point by point? Yeah.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 This is the first for us. This is new. Like I know we've never done before. Yeah, it feels good. I mean, we just got started, but I like it already.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 Okay. Just if it is intro, you got new projects to work on or existing project. You've motivated upgrade.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 There are a lot of modern frameworks to choose from. You know, if you're not facing the choice right now, you may be trying to decide which framework to invest in the future to make yourself more marketable and productive in the future.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 This is actually something that from someone that builds dev tools. It's kind of interesting because the traditional startup thinks about things in terms of sales cycles.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 Like going from someone hearing about your product to them paying for your product.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 How long does that take? I think there's a similar thing in dev tools where someone hears about your framework.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 When do they first try it? And when do they first put into production?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 These are super long, you know, cycles, right? Like, yeah.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 The average person unless they're like, you know, a gun code in your engineer isn't going to like rewrite their whole app, just because they heard about a framework.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Once you probably have to have someone hear about it, then like in six months, you get a chance to try it.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 Then maybe a year later, they move to a different job and they're starting a new project, then they might actually use it.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 So yeah, as a good dev tools person, that's very tricky because I have to constantly be in the air.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 So that eventually they give it a shot.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Yeah, kind of just say that it's so hard for me to think or understand any of this context that you guys deal with because I do the consumer stuff.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 And we get people that do one query and then they sign up for Stammies Plus.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 So not that long.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 That sounds nice.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 Well, it's not very much money either.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 But like, even there, like they probably have to hear about Stammies a few times before they went and tried it.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Yeah, maybe they have to see a few tweets and then they're finally like, "What is this thing?" and then they end up on the website.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Yeah, probably.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 It's definitely tighter.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Still faster than, yeah, what you're describing.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 But it makes sense.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 Like when I think of from a dev perspective, like we don't just jump into new things all the time.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Like it's only every, yeah, like you said, it might be six months before we introduce some new tool into our world.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Yeah, I think it's something that people like, I think dev tool companies, and they're understanding more, but it's very different than it's almost like selling a product that's a complete commodity.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 It's like purely based off of brand.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Like all those companies that do like brand advertising and they constantly have billboards up and they constantly have commercials.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 And you're like, "What is this commercial even for?"

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 That car company.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Brand awareness.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 Things like that.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Yeah.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 It's very similar.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 So Kent mentions he's been using remakes in 2020. He loved it so much. He joined the team for 10 months.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 And I think we will remember this when remakes with its own company before they got acquired.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Kent joined and was working on it.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 It's a full sack web framework.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 The people are familiar with it.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 And Kent is using it as like the cornerstone of his new course, epicweb.dev.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Which Kent, if you're still here, I still so badly want to dig in.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 There's like a queue of things that I want to dig into.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 And I've just been in this like months long rewrite that has meant not touching anything new.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 But I still do want to play with epicweb stuff or the epic stack, I guess.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And maybe I want to take your course too.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Maybe I will.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 I buy a lot of courses.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 I don't take them all.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 I do buy them.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 I want to buy like one section from it.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Like I'm very curious about the off section because it looks very thorough and in depth and a few people have been like a few people that are working off of it.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 Like this is very comprehensive and I want to round out my knowledge.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 I don't want to buy the whole thing.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Kent, can I buy it in piecemeal?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 I get just the odd section.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 All the cart.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Maybe I'll get the whole thing to you.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 We'll see.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 We'll see how the subject goes.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 So he phrased this in an interesting way, which I thought was funny.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 He says, "As next JS is a very popular alternative to remix."

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Which is an interesting way to phrase that.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 That's nice.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 Yeah.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 I didn't catch that.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 I didn't interpret it that way.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 You might interpret things in the worst possible way, knowing you.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 No, I like it because you can frame it in either direction.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Yeah.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 It's kind of a power move if you interpret it a certain way.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Yeah.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Appreciate that.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 I mean, he has to like load this with a bunch of disclaimers because people get very upset

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 with any kind of opinionated article like this.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 Just if it is, whatever you use is probably fine.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 By the way, what was also really funny was when Kent posted this, there were so many

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 replies like immediately with like gotchas that were just addressed in the article.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 Like people out of themselves.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 They didn't read it.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 They didn't read it.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 They were like, "Your site is built on next JS.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 Ha, gotcha."

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 He literally talks about it a bunch of times in here.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Oh, I saw it.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 Yeah.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 He hired a team to make you his website and I think that there's a lot of that.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 By the way, Kent, if you're here, I know Kent was here.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 I love that you hired to make your website because of course you did because that's just

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 smart.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 Yeah.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 You've got time to make the website.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 You've got to make the stuff.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 Sorry, go ahead.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 And they're the most competent and actually that's what they have the most experience in.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 So, yeah, it makes sense to do.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 And that's this point here.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Your skill at using the tool to accomplish the outcome is more important than the tool itself.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 So, obviously, a million disclaimers.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 So, whatever you use is probably fine.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Bolded there.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 That line.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 And I stopped and thought for a bit and realized I'm trying to build stuff with technology that

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 I don't know very well.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Not the Astro stuff.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 We're loving Astro.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 But I thought I'm going to just start using Solid because you use Solid.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 You're so good at Solid.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 You know what you're doing.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 And I realized if I'm starting a new project, there's some ideas I had for a new project

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 that we've talked about.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 And I thought, "Should I actually just make it with Next.js?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Because I actually know how to do stuff with React.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 And I don't know what I'm doing with Solid."

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Wait, but do you know Next.js anymore?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Like the newest version of Next.js?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 I mean, probably not because it changes like crazy.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 But this line did make me feel like I've been chasing something and losing all of my skill.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Or abandoning all the things I understand really well.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 React.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 React. Next 12 or whatever it was when I used it.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Yeah.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 What are they on now?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 15?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 I don't know.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Okay, now you're making me second guess again.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 I just got to learn Solid, I guess.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Whatever.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 Fine.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 No, no.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Okay.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 It's definitely a valid thing because I was thinking about this yesterday.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 So I've been doing Solid for two years.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 You might have seen that thread I posted.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 I finally got to a place where I'm like, "Okay.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 It feels very complete.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 All the libraries I need are there.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 It all works together.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 It's great."

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 And I had the thought, "Oh, this is probably the feeling that people that use like Laravel

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 or something feel because all this stuff is just there and it works nicely together."

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 And we finally got in there the beginning of that with Solid.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 And it's after me spending years understanding it well.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Yeah.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 And it feels great to be there.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 And I'm unlikely to move at this point.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Because I'm at a point in my career where I'm not absorbing a bunch of stuff.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 You're never going back to bell bums.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 You're stuck with the tight jeans.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Yeah.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 Exactly.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 So yeah.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 Like I'm like, "Okay.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 This is what, as someone, it's always been adopting whatever.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 I can early adopt there.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 I never get that feeling of, "Wow.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 My tools do everything I need them to do."

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 And I'm finally starting to get that.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Yep.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 So I can appreciate that.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Can't believe you haven't been using Solid for 10 years.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Everything you've done in your career has been for 10 years.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 What's a max?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 I think Solid's maybe like seven years old now, six or seven years old.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 Believe it or not.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Oh, is it really?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Oh, I figured you were.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 Yeah.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 I mean, in terms of like the first commitment when Ryan first started working on it.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 Yeah.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Wow.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 So again, disclaimers, which unfortunately we all have to stack stuff with disclaimers.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 No matter how many disclaimers we put, we're still going to get a reply.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 It's annoying.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Yep.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Yep.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 Anyway, the web platform.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 So a big thing that remix and Kent and all those people are about is taking advantage of the

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 web platform as much as possible, using standards, learning them well, and building things that

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 help you use them better.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Main reason is if you learn those things well, they transfer.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 You know, the browser is going to be the browser, whatever framework's changed.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Certain things that are standard are going to continue to exist.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 They're all going to be backwards compatible, all kinds of stuff.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 And he brings up the example of enzyme, which is a testing library, if I remember.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 It is a wrapper over a bunch of this is one of my favorite parts of the whole article, a

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 bunch of overly helpful danger.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 Dangerous.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Yeah.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 I would say that instead of wrapping platform API, assessing library exposed platform APIs.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 It's not like building abstractions that prevent you from using or learning the platform API

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 directly, and how that that's not like a great long-term approach, because things shift.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 Stuff isn't transferable.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 I totally agree with this.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 And the big thing that I say all the time with SST is we're not trying to save you from

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 learning AWS.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 Our goal isn't to be like, you never need to learn it.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 We're going to protect you from it.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 Our goal is we want to expose it to you in a way that's not overwhelming.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 And over time, I genuinely want you to be an expert at AWS.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 And this is kind of the exact same idea.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 I'm tracking.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Did you want me to say something?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 I don't know.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Did you have a reaction?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Oh, no.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 This feels like school or something all of a sudden.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 Yeah, Adam.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 What did you think of this?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 I was drifting off just a little bit.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 You called me out.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 What did you think of this?

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 No, I thought it was great.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 I don't do tests so much.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 I'm not the one who tested it.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 So the specific example kind of went over my head.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 But the idea, I get the idea.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 Yeah.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 And I think it like I kind of like know the differences there between remix and next.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 And kind of where he's getting at.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 Yeah.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 Yeah.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.500
 I think this is like a tough thing because you can always make something look shinier and

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.000
 cooler by doing the opposite of this.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.500
 And when you're like in like a competitive space of the framework space when you're reaching

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.000
 out to people and you're trying to get people excited.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Yeah.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Like you're tempted to do those things.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 They're very short term because long term like Kent points out.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 These things are just very brittle.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 Yep.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 But it's easy to get sucked into that.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 But remix is more focused on like he says, exposing APIs as opposed to wrapping APIs.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 And you can kind of imagine how like it's, it's very easy for me to.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 I think a good thing that I try to look at, especially when using tools is.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 Can I imagine how this works under the hood?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Like, is it easy for me to understand what's going on?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Yeah.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 If it's not, I get kind of worried.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Yeah.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 And there's probably is like a AWS and like generally infrastructure kind of web dev nerd.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Uh, next JS is the thing that gives me the biggest feeling like that where I don't know

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 what it is doing under the hood.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 Yeah.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 It's the most, it's the furthest I feel away from my infrastructure.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 It's like thinking about an extra deployment.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Yeah.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 And I think he goes into that.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 Like just the difficulties of deploying next and the incentives and all of that.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 Yeah.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 I do.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 I feel like I should say, it's the disclaimers.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 I, I, we just said in the last episode that like, or I said at least, I feel like I've,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 I've been too harsh on Vercel and picked on them for the wrong reasons, maybe.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 I think if there is a right reason to pick on Vercel and next JS, it's the deployment model.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 I think that's the thing.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 It just, it bothers me how many times they've come back and they're like, no, it's easy.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 And the gas lighting on that is just, it's really annoying.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 Maybe they genuinely believe it's easy, but it's not.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 So like the rest world can, can confirm that.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 It's not easy to deploy next year.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 Yeah.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 But all the other things I pick on them for, I feel bad.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 And I take those back.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 No, it's okay.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 You can do that.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 It's like, it's just like a David Goliath situation.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 It's like, it's the punching up.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 It's really easy to punch up.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 Yeah.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 Because yeah, when somebody's huge and, and there's a lot of things that we've talked about

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 in this episode, I want going tomorrow.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 I mean, skills that I can use wherever I develop for the web.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 And it's a big thing.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 Like, is your framework, are you getting better at general skills by using your framework?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 I think it's, it's like tailwind and CSS.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 Like tailwind makes you better at CSS.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 Oh, you don't use tailwind.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Never mind.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 No, I agree.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Do you not see my tweet yesterday?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 I was like, I don't use tailwind, but they're like in the top three companies.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 I admire the most.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Tailwind Labs is a company.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 Sure.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 But you understand like enough about tailwind to know that like, yeah, no, I don't think

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 it's an option.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 My little experience using tailwind has taught me a lot about CSS.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Yeah.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 And that's how I think any framework should be.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 Yeah.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Yeah.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 Exactly.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 Like you, you pick up on things that you didn't know CSS could do because just because of tailwind

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 docs were so good and you discovered things in there.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 Yep.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Okay.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 Next part, independent.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 So this was great.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 This was a great little surprise because Kent had a whole section about open next, which

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 is our project.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 To be honest, when I saw this, I got to this section and I saw open next.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 I was like, oh, that's why DAX tweeted it.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 No, that's right.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Well, well, it's okay.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 That was a funny thing.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 I saw the article.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 I posted it in my team chat without even reading it.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 That was like, just by relevant and I started reading it and I was like, oh, look, there's

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 a section on us, but I didn't see that.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 Plus a surprise.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 Yeah.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 But yes, this is why we tweeted because I mentioned open this.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 So this is a, I joked in our team chat that this is, this point is like, we're cells greatest

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 fear.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 I mean, I'm being dramatic.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.960
 When, when we were at least open next, they were fairly upset with us for calling it open

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.960
 next.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.960
 Yeah.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:58.960
 Because of what the name implies.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.240
 And the point he's making is exactly that it's like people point to the existence of open

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:09.840
 next to argue that the framework is not very independent because if it was, why does open

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:15.000
 next exist and why isn't there open remix or open, Astro or open, whatever?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Yep.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.840
 So just kind of the context.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.640
 So the project open next, it's run by our community.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:26.560
 They work on figuring out how best to deploy or sell to a serverless environment.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:32.680
 Um, so taking, wait, did I say, or so no, the best deploy, next, yes, yes, yes, there,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.360
 it's not public info on how best to deploy this stuff.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.960
 You have to have a really deep understanding of both infrastructure.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.160
 So like understanding what's possible.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.600
 And also how next, yes, worked on the hood, all little features, all little details to

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.040
 like match these two things together.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.800
 What infrastructure do we actually need?

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.240
 This isn't public information.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.240
 It's not documented.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.240
 It's not shared.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.240
 It's not an open effort.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.240
 It's not collaborative.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.240
 This is like a reverse engineering effort where with every release, they look to see

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.080
 how it works and figure out what we need to change on our end.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.160
 Very tedious work.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.160
 Yep.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.800
 Uh, amazing that the community like spends the time to do that.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.800
 It builds up tools.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.800
 They've done all this stuff.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.160
 You figure that out.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.840
 Um, ultimately we don't think it should exist.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.800
 This is a product project.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.800
 Yeah.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.960
 We don't have like, can't point out we don't have this anywhere else.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:21.120
 Um, and the reality is, like you said, it is very difficult to deploy this on anywhere

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:25.360
 but for sale and get all the, all the features that, that work out of the box.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.120
 Anyone denying that is just flat out wrong.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:32.320
 Like they're not either they're like doing a very simplified deployment of next year or

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.800
 they work at Vercel and they just continue to say this, even though it's not true.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:41.160
 Um, we have thousands of deployments on this for that reason, like hard to deny that.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.160
 Yep.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.520
 But this, this is like, you, you don't, you can't really, this is a situation.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.760
 And I think can also make this point there.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.920
 This isn't like a moral criticism.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.320
 It's just an accurate analysis of the structure.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:58.920
 Uh, they are a host and they have a public open source framework.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.840
 Uh, they can solve a lot of problems that people run into by adding features in their

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.840
 hosting platform.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.600
 So they tend to build featured in the next JS that are like dependent on features of

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.080
 their hosting platform.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.080
 That's just the incentive.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.080
 That's just a structure.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.080
 Yep.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.440
 That's just the integration I would be doing the exact same thing.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.480
 Uh, most people would.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.800
 It is just the way it works.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.640
 Uh, and it's, there's a lot of benefits to that.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.440
 And that when you use these two things together, it is very beautiful and it comes together

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.440
 nicely.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.560
 Um, but there is a downside, which if you can't use these things together, you don't want

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.920
 to use them together.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.560
 It's a much worse experience than any of the other frameworks.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:41.680
 I, it never, the, the apple parallel here never hit me that it's like apple being the

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.760
 like integrated hardware and software.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.360
 It's like you need one with the other, it's kind of, it's that too, right?

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.800
 Like they, they have the apple at like the apple events and they draw a lot of like apple

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.800
 comparisons when they do like today and actually ask conf, uh, and their style, their, their

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.280
 brand guidelines, all that stuff, just very apple like, but this is like a very apple

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.000
 thing too, which is like, if you're going to have our phone, you're also going to run

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 our software.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.040
 You're also going to use our cloud services.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.960
 Like it's all integrated and it's a nice experience.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.560
 But yeah, don't try to take your phone and run something else on it or your Mac and run

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.560
 something else.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.160
 Like, yeah, that's, it's all very similar.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.160
 Sorry.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.360
 Yeah, which is like, I think that makes a lot of sense in a consumer product, uh, where

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:33.400
 you can really narrow a use case in the scope for developer product where like people have

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:38.960
 all kinds of configurations, all kinds of situations, like, uh, it needs to integrate

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.960
 with a million other things.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.960
 Yeah.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.400
 That set up, I don't think really makes sense.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:50.080
 And I, I would even say that I, I acknowledge it comes together pretty well.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.280
 I don't think it comes together as well as an apple products.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.280
 No, right.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.120
 I think it's like it comes together.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.120
 Okay.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.680
 But it's not worth, it doesn't come together well now for I'm like, okay, it's worth these

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:06.360
 other things to give up those trade offs, what if, what if Vercel is a consumer product?

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:11.960
 Well, I was just thinking in some ways, yeah, well, I was just thinking how like I'm going

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.760
 to redo my personal site and I'll probably just put it on Vercel.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.360
 And that's like the use case where I'm like, that makes sense on Vercel.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.720
 I don't really need to like tinker with it.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.520
 It's just like a simple page.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.440
 And I don't want to think about like analytics and all that.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.440
 I can just use Vercel analytics.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.920
 Like there are use cases where it just makes sense for me, but it's the like consumer use

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.960
 cases of mine where I'm just like a person, not like representing a company.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.960
 Does that make sense?

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.960
 Yeah.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.040
 No, I mean, I think that is like an unparalleled use case.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.960
 Like I can't argue that you should use anything else in that case.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:50.000
 But like a startup and like the idea of deploying my startup software on Vercel is just laughable.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.440
 Like I would never, and there's just so many reasons why.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.440
 Yeah.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.440
 I would say like philosophically, like the type of company I'm trying to build is in

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.840
 a lot of ways like the opposite of the way that Vercel operates.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.240
 So there's a lot of like, for me, when I see them doing certain things, I'm like, I would

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.800
 try to do the exact opposite.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:12.000
 Granted, the way they're building stuff is the way that every successful enterprise task

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.400
 company has been ever built in the last couple of years, but they're not doing anything like

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.400
 obviously wrong.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:22.840
 But when I see like their sales approach, their sales teams, like the emails that people

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.920
 show us from like what they get from Vercel, I'm just like, this to me, this is not the

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:35.120
 point of being a tech company, it's a very traditional and like salesy and just high

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.120
 touch.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.040
 It's not the type of company I want to build.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.080
 So, and I don't think that makes people happy.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.440
 I don't think it makes your customers, customers happy.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.600
 Yeah.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:51.280
 I think a lot of developers that talk about Vercel on Twitter and elsewhere, never get

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.280
 to that point.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.400
 Like they never have to approach the enterprise sales part.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.320
 They just use it for free and like Vercel's great.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.320
 Yeah.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.320
 Exactly.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.320
 I don't know what the funnel looks like, how those those convert into these big enterprise

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.320
 deals.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.320
 But I mean, I know it happened.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.320
 Yeah.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.160
 I mean, we get messers from people all the time being like, oh yeah, we're paying like

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.480
 their standard, their public pricing is based off of seats.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:20.160
 They're like, oh yeah, we have like, you know, five developers that work on this, $20 or

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:25.480
 $20, we're paying about a month, and then we got an email saying, oh actually, we need

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.680
 to be bumped up to like $6,000 a month.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:32.960
 It's like, oh, it's like crazy jumps like that because they go past some kind of thresholds

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:39.240
 wherever sales are okay, you're out of our like generous bandwidth and like compute tier.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.960
 And the actual cost when you, when you get, when you add those up, it's crazy expensive.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.880
 It's literally, it's, I think on a bandwidth, it's like a 10x markup.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.880
 Yeah.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.880
 We've seen these numbers before.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:54.000
 I think five to 10x across the board on, on all the raw resources, which I'm not fundamentally

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.920
 opposed to if something is delivering a lot of value, I'm so happy to pay for it.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.480
 I think most people are like overly conservative and trying to like cut costs here and there

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.960
 and like they lose a bunch of other things.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.320
 So the point is just hosting and it's just like a small portion of your product.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.320
 Yeah.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.320
 It's just, I don't know.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.400
 I like, I don't have a lot of faith in that setup.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.400
 I think hosting is like a goody business to begin.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.400
 Yeah.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:23.160
 And I think Kent points out that he, he's also worried about the fact that they're not profitable

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.280
 and you should worry about those things.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.280
 And yeah.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.920
 And the other thing I want to say is what I liked about this article is there's actually

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.520
 no technical details in there.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.480
 Really, they're not comparing like direct APIs, like capabilities or anything.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.480
 All right.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.800
 But this is the stuff that you really need to consider when you're like in a moral leadership

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.920
 position on like whether you're starting a company or you're making a bigger decision.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.400
 You're picking your vendor, you're picking the things you want to bet on and you need

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:54.000
 to understand like their business model, their culture, how they operate.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.880
 Like I don't want a vendor that like is building a giant sales team because I know how that

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.520
 gets used on me and I don't like those relationships.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.520
 So I like avoid companies like that.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.520
 Yeah.

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:10.120
 So you need to think about a lot of stuff outside of just the literal framework or the code

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.120
 that you have to write.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.120
 Yeah.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.720
 I think the all of that stuff's probably more important.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.720
 Yeah.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.600
 The interesting thing is interesting that like you don't hear a lot of people complain

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.000
 about Vercel pricing in our circles.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 Really?

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.480
 Like you're about a lot of time.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.840
 Oh, do you hear it all the time?

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.840
 Okay.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.840
 Maybe.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.120
 Well, yeah, I guess your customers like people who come to I get like I get like private

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.920
 conversations about those that yeah, I feel like the public discourse around Vercel is

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:37.840
 not that it's expensive and like you get it you get in trouble if you say, if you put

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.280
 any of that stuff publicly, maybe that's what it is.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.280
 Yeah.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.400
 I'd say like AWS is expensive, which is funny because it like Vercel doesn't have that.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.400
 Yeah.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.400
 Cause they have.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:53.240
 That would have come like a zero engagement policy with everyone saying anything publicly,

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.920
 which I'm taking advantage of a lot.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.920
 Yes.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:00.160
 You will say it's almost your whole persona.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.160
 Yeah.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.320
 But Vercel is not like that.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.680
 They like you if you like saying this stuff publicly, like you it creates a problem for

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.680
 you.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.680
 Yeah.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.120
 I really don't hear about it in private.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.120
 Okay.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.560
 So next year, I says eating react.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:19.720
 So the gist of this is, you know, with a lot of the react team leaving meta and joining

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:25.960
 Vercel, there's like more influence than ever on Vercel's goals and react goals.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.600
 Kent says, even when they were part of meta, he wasn't a big fan of it.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.520
 I think it was for him, the ideal model would be like a foundation model.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.960
 I agree with the foundation model for things that end up being low level open source tools.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.080
 So I think react at this point, it's a low level tool.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.000
 A lot of stuff gets built on top of it.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.480
 Programming languages, things like Terraform, like I believe that those make sense as a foundation

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.640
 model where those are going to open foundation with a bunch of different companies that might

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.360
 compete with each other supporting it.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.840
 I think that's like the healthiest setup.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:03.200
 So he mentions that here and he is worried that they're kind of going the opposite direction.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.880
 The benefit of them being at meta is meta and this is like there's pros and cons here.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.840
 It was a side project for meta at the end of the day.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.840
 They used it internally.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.760
 They built all their stuff on it, which is good because they're tied to it, they're committed

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.920
 to it.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:23.840
 But they don't need it to be anything besides a tool that solves their problems and a bigger

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.080
 ecosystem is looking higher out of, yep, they don't need to like build a direct business

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.080
 off of react.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.680
 And I think there's pros and cons there.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:36.200
 So obviously moving into Versa, which is an unprofitable startup that's in hyper growth

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.040
 phase, raised a lot of money, you're in a very different environment than you were in

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.040
 meta.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.120
 If you're someone working on a react that you now have stuff like deadlines, you need to

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.480
 like coordinate with countries, you need to like do all this stuff and you need to line

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.880
 up with the company's vision.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.120
 It is a very different situation.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:56.200
 And I wouldn't be surprised if honestly the team isn't necessarily adapting super well

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.200
 to that.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.120
 It is a new constraint that they haven't had since the beginning.

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.120
 Yep.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.400
 So yeah, I think I mentioned that this does worry him a little bit.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:11.080
 He also mentions that he feels the collaboration has gone down and I think he quotes Ryan Florence

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.240
 has mentioned this.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:17.360
 It seems like he's like debugging issues and like posting stuff, not in like a negative

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:23.360
 and positive way publicly, more like it feels like he's running into stuff that given someone

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.800
 like him building a framework on top of react with his level of region influence, he should

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.880
 have like more direct lines of communication, like understand a lot of this stuff ahead

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.520
 of time.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.560
 I definitely feel that the thing I met someone asked me earlier today, you know, where do

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.560
 you see like the lack of collaboration?

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.560
 Like what does that mean?

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.080
 Like where do you guys see that?

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:50.080
 With every other framework, we have direct lines to the people that are building it.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.760
 We can't we have influence over, Hey, here are some good features you can add that would

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:59.520
 help deployment and they've been implemented and added, we get told ahead of time of features

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.440
 that they're going to release so that we can prep our stuff, very standard open source

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.440
 collaboration.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.440
 Yeah.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.160
 Obviously don't have that with next year's at all, it's a complete reverse engineering

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.880
 effort every time.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:13.640
 So again, quite different from everything else.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.640
 It's like more open source.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.640
 Yeah.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.880
 I guess, are there any other companies with associate with these frameworks that have

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:25.960
 similar incentives or models and they just work around it or is versatile unique with

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.200
 their, their business model?

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.920
 I think they're unique in that they're successful.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:35.720
 I think everyone else has tried this has been a successful is my.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.560
 So like, yeah, a lot of their issues are like, they're uniquely successful, you have to give

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.560
 them credit for.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.560
 Yeah.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.560
 Yeah.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.000
 I'm trying to think like, who else does the open source framework, but paid?

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.560
 I mean, you've had failures, right?

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.280
 Like Gatsby was a big one.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.280
 Yeah.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:54.760
 So they were, so that brings up Netlify, which doesn't have a framework, but they kind of

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.200
 the same model, business model is for sell, right?

00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.200
 Yeah.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.720
 I mean, Netlify is also, I mean, I don't really understand Netlify that well.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:09.080
 They have to be a next year's host because next year's is hugely successful.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.240
 But it's always, always me an uphill battle for them.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.240
 Yeah.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:17.760
 They have to like build so much around it that's unrelated to next year's for people to be

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.480
 the end to Netlify your reason.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.480
 Yeah.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.480
 It's tough.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:25.240
 And they, and Ryan Carniotto works there, but they haven't taken this like direct head

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.520
 to head battle of China.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.800
 I feel like he's working there technically, but you never, it's not like a big part of

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.720
 their brand at all or their efforts.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:38.600
 You look at next year's in Versailles, like next year's in Versailles, like one thing.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.600
 Uh-huh.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:43.200
 And they unify everything and they like really push both those things forward together.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.960
 Netlify doesn't seem to be doing that for whatever reason.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:50.800
 Yeah, Gatsby is the other example, but they never figured out the business part of things.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.960
 And, and they ended up, you know, getting acquired by Netlify.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.960
 Yep.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:59.720
 I don't remember too many others, but yeah, I mean, it's possible this model just doesn't

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.400
 work or entirely make sense.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:06.400
 I mean, I guess remix got acquired, same thing, like they didn't ever have to get to the point

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.120
 of having a hosting business.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.120
 Yeah.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.760
 And I think Ryan talks about all the time now.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:15.760
 He's in such a better headspace being able to really think about super long-term goals

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:20.320
 for remix without, like he was saying, like if they didn't get acquired right now, they

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:25.800
 would be working on a paid product as opposed to working on remakes, which I feel because

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.800
 we're in that same situation.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.240
 We have an open source framework and a paid product and that split is, uh, is difficult.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.400
 We're okay with it.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.440
 Like we're like, we're not, I think our team, I think a certain people are like true open

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.400
 source people at heart.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:44.000
 I don't think our team is necessarily that, like our community who runs our projects better

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 than we do.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 We really are our forte.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 I wasn't going to say anything, but that's not, I'm not even exaggerating the other day.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.200
 I went to the open next homepage and I was like, wait, when did this get so good?

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.040
 Like they like deployed a whole new docs thing.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.040
 It's like so well run.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.000
 Like they have, they're so on top of all the issues, like they got all the integrations

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 going.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 Like it's a, it's a well run.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 Like Jay was saying that today.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.280
 Like I think we need to learn something from, yeah, from my community.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:16.720
 So, like we're more like, you know, traditional like startup be like build a product people.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.400
 But for someone like Ryan who's like very good open source, like I think that's a much

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.400
 better setup.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.400
 Yeah.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.400
 All right.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.400
 Experimenting on my users.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.400
 Yeah.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.400
 So this is another thing.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:31.120
 Again, this is, this is definitely like a, to me, I feel like this is a, it's such a

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.120
 good judgment thing.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.600
 It's hard to articulate like, this is exactly what you should do.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:40.600
 And for Kent's level of expectation of the amount of stability a framework should give

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:44.720
 you, he feels like next year's is not meeting that next year's will push back and say no,

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.480
 everything we're doing is a hundred percent backwards compatible.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.480
 It's true.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:52.080
 Like I think Guillermo tweeted the other day that the first screenshot that they put up

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.120
 of next year's like that code literally still works.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:59.040
 So backwards compatibility, you can't really argue they are there doing that.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.720
 But there is a lot of change and the change represents innovation like things that are

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.600
 trying to invade and push forward.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.600
 Yeah.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:10.280
 And it does get marketed very, in a way where people feel like they need to jump to it right

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.840
 away.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.840
 And they'll try to jump to it.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.840
 Things won't work.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.000
 Things will kind of be broken.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.880
 We see it with every single patch update change a bunch of stuff breaks and we have to trace

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.880
 it down.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:26.040
 Um, again, that's just a fact like you can draw whatever opinion you want from that.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:31.000
 But the fact is it does break a lot more than other stuff that pain you can draw from that

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.800
 is it's worth it because you like the direction they're pushing in and you do need to break

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.800
 things to get there.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.760
 Otherwise you get stuck.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.680
 I think we definitely are more on the side of breaking stuff just because we're a little

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.920
 bit earlier on than, um, then like, you know, kind of more stable frameworks.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:52.120
 So I understand that, but I also understand that like for as big as they are for how many

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:56.000
 companies built on top of them, this is just like a pain.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.800
 And he talks, doesn't he talk in this section about the, uh, just all the react features

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.080
 that have been used in the last year releases of next year's that aren't stable.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:10.120
 Yeah, there's a whole debate around that canary thing where like react as a canary version,

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.800
 but they're definitely so canary means it's ready for frameworks to adopt.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.600
 Uh, it's a very kind of confusing situation.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.600
 I don't, to me, it's not, I don't like want to get into like those details.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.760
 For me, it's really about what's it feel like?

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.760
 What do people feel like?

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.760
 Does it feel like it's good cheese?

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.760
 I feel like it's buggy.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.600
 Uh, does it feel like it's slow?

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.520
 I mean, a lot of people do say that.

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:36.840
 So for sure, on the RSC side, like the app directory stuff, the people, when the first

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.720
 version that made that available, everyone started using it and was like, the dead server

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:45.240
 is atrocious and they've improved a lot, but I still see people talking about how slow

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.160
 and painful it is.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:51.120
 So how much of this is like next year's comp and like for cell comp or whatever, they have

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:55.560
 like all these big tent pole, you know, conference things.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:59.360
 And it feels like stuff's going to be shipped on that date regardless of where it's at.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.360
 It's like Turbopack, the first announcement of Turbopack was like, you knew they just

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.640
 had to announce it, but it was like, it's alpha.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.640
 Actually, you can't use it.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.480
 Actually don't use it, please.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:13.600
 But there's kind of this like marketing driven development that I guess that's just comes

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.600
 with the success.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:18.320
 They've got a huge following and these huge marketing events that just comes with it,

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.040
 I guess, as I was saying earlier, like it's a very different environment for people that

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.320
 were at meta to now be in this environment where they need to like do all this coordination

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.680
 and get some out on time and all that.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:32.840
 Well, this has been reading the tell when to come, what's the refactoring UI?

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.360
 I think we've read that.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.360
 I own it.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.360
 Every time of it.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:40.840
 It's in your deep collection of, I think you own any everything, you probably own all

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:41.840
 the content.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:42.840
 I mostly own all of the things.

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:43.840
 Yeah.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.840
 All of the things people make.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.800
 If you like are considering making a course, you should just make it really expensive because

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.120
 I'm at least going to buy it and you'll at least make that sale and then you can kind

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.120
 of go from there.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.120
 Just make it look really good.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.120
 Yeah.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.040
 And you're probably even tweet like this is great.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.040
 Yeah.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.040
 Yeah, probably.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.680
 I mean, refactoring UI, the bits I read were really good.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.680
 Yeah.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.480
 I think I even use it to like reference like look up specific things.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:12.080
 It's a great book that it's like, it's hard to remember all the concepts in it.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.200
 It's something you have to constantly reference every like year or so.

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.200
 Yeah.

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.240
 She's been reading it and one of her big takeaways was she spends a lot of time.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.880
 She's reflecting on her own way of doing things.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.560
 She spent a lot of time figuring out how to get work done.

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.480
 Like what is a process to get work done?

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:33.640
 But she never really looked at it as how do I get quality work done?

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.920
 It was more around like we, there's all this stuff to do, what process do I have to make

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.840
 sure all gets done like never thought about like, okay, but what's the process actually

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.920
 make sure that that stuff turns out well.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.040
 And oftentimes these two things are entirely in conflict.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:49.640
 Like the thing that makes you the most productive and predictable and and you can estimate and

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:53.000
 you can deliver on time is very different from what you need to do to deliver quality

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 work.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.440
 That's kind of what is going on there like they are now in an environment where they

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.480
 need to make sure work gets done.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:05.200
 Very different than they can't make the decision that you know what, we need another year on

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:10.120
 this before we ask to tell anyone before we even know that this turbo pack is a viable

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.120
 thing.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.120
 Of course not.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.120
 You can't do that.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.120
 Like a stage are impossible.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.120
 Yep.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.120
 So they're experimenting.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.120
 It's not a good point.

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.120
 So too much magic.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.120
 Okay too much magic.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.120
 I think we're all going to resonate with this.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.120
 This is another thing.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:26.280
 Again, it's like a sense of judgment and you know, Kent is very experienced.

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.800
 He's seen a lot of code bases with a lot of people.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.560
 So you kind of have to acknowledge his level of judgment here.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.880
 He's not someone that's just like just doing this for a couple of years.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.640
 When people say too much magic and they have a lot of experience, I think it does come

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.560
 with like a lot of weight.

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.560
 We all like some amount of magic.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:51.640
 We all like not having to do tedious work, but there's some like invisible magical threshold

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.240
 that'll cross over where we'll be like, okay, now it's too much.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.240
 Now I'm scared of it.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.600
 Now I'm worried what can happen.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.600
 Yep.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.120
 And he points to the fetch API where they patched.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.480
 They do a global patch in the fetch API.

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:07.360
 And I think to a lot of people, this feels like focusing on some technicality of like

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.840
 a while you're like obsessing over this like one thing that they did just because it's

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:10.840
 technically weird.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:14.880
 I acknowledge a lot of things that are technically weird can actually be fine in practice.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.200
 But the philosophy around it feels off.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.200
 Yeah.

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.200
 Right.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:24.800
 It feels like is this feature so, so compelling that it's worth crossing this line here?

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:25.800
 Yeah.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.320
 And that's just there to add automatic caching, which again, guess where automatic caching

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.920
 works best in in verse L it doesn't work too great anywhere else unless you like really

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.120
 engineer for it.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.120
 Yeah.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:40.400
 So do you feel like that with like some of the magic stuff like you like the magic like

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.120
 kind of does it make you feel weird?

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:46.160
 I guess there's probably parts of it that I like and I don't realize, oh, yeah, that

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.600
 is, that is a lot of magic.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:53.240
 I think it ties into that point earlier that we talked about like not understanding how

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.240
 it works.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.080
 It bothers me when I don't understand how this stuff is even deployed, like what does

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.920
 the infrastructure look like?

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:06.280
 Like if I can't understand how all these features are actually implemented, then I feel bad

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.280
 using it.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.560
 So I think that's the magic stuff for me.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.560
 Yeah.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:14.280
 Like I wouldn't have even thought of a global fetch as a magical thing.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.960
 I think of that as like a, yeah, a philosophical thing that bothers me that they would think

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.960
 that's a good idea.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:25.080
 I'm sure that if we pulled up specific features of next year's in verse L I could, I could

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.280
 probably better articulate the magic I don't like.

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.280
 Yeah.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.800
 And I like definitely what acknowledged that this is a lot of it is emotional, but I don't

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.520
 think that discounts it like it feels weird.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:38.340
 It's just got a feeling like you don't, if you feels like you don't really get what's

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.560
 going on that just is a gut feel.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:46.360
 I can't rationally say that as good or bad, but you got to listen to those things because

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.160
 there's like some wisdom there is maybe not super easy to articulate.

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.320
 Do you think they view though the magic as like that's a feature?

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.440
 I mean, like look at all this that is done for you.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.400
 Is that a philosophy that some people embrace and as developers, they like it?

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:05.400
 Yeah, I think as someone building, I think I can relate to their point of view a little

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:09.560
 bit because there's some, I see problems all the time and I see like people making the

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.760
 same mistakes or see people doing tedious things and I want to solve it for them.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:18.160
 And sometimes I can like, yeah, lean towards like doing really aggressive kind of crazy

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:22.000
 things to make it so someone never runs into this issue.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 Yep.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.040
 So that pushes there because that's what the innovation is like you tried to solve those

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.040
 problems.

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.040
 Yep.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:34.080
 I think with this specific case, I'll actually give an example of why this is emotional,

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.720
 but it should still matter.

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:40.360
 So as someone like I was using app router like a few weeks ago, I don't know.

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.880
 Actually, I said, well, I'm so I would be concerned, I'm not new to it.

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:51.840
 Everything is so aggressively cashed by default, they're like very, very aggressive about guessing

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.880
 that you probably want this to be pre rendered.

00:48:54.880 --> 00:49:00.880
 And I find that really weird, like you build an endpoint API endpoint request, you like

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.880
 return some side response because you're just testing.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.200
 And it took me a while to realize like why it wasn't actually deploying properly because

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:13.280
 next year as looked at my code and they were like, Oh, you don't touch the request object.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.680
 Therefore your code's probably entirely deterministic.

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:19.200
 Therefore we can probably just build it at generate that build time.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.200
 Yeah.

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.520
 And then like, you know, exactly.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.840
 And that's like a very perform wouldn't do that, but it's like so unexpected and it gives

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:29.440
 you like a really jarring feeling initially someone, I saw someone reply mentioning this

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:35.060
 being like, they return something from their database without touching the request object.

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:38.880
 And then all of a sudden their build was trying to talk to their database, which is like in

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.920
 a VPC and you can't access it.

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:41.920
 Yep.

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.680
 And when stuff that's unexpected happens, like it's just a bad experience.

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.960
 It doesn't matter whether the thing, the feature makes sense.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.680
 If you catch people off guard, there's going to media negative thing there and you're worried

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.960
 that you're being dragged into like a complexity.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.960
 Yeah.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:54.960
 Yep.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:55.960
 100%.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.400
 Can I, can I point out a magic thing that I thought of that I do like?

00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.400
 Oh, yes.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.400
 Tell me.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.200
 I think, I think this is under the umbrella of magic things, like next font.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.200
 Mm hmm.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.200
 It's a next font.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:11.360
 You just like import Google fonts and it gets rid of layout shift because they like inspect

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.400
 the font files and calculate for a fallback font.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:23.280
 They calculate all the different, whatever measurements so that when they swap, whatever,

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:30.520
 lato, your custom Google font in for like aerial, there's no layout shift that, I guess

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.520
 that's kind of magic.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:37.200
 Like all that's going on, we just import that font and use it in your style sheet.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.440
 But I do, I do like that magic.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:43.440
 It's like stuff I understand, I understand what's happening under the hood and I just

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.960
 like that they took care of it all for me.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.000
 Maybe that's not magic because I actually understand what's going on.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.960
 You understand what's going on and it's something you would do every single time.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.640
 There's like no reason to ever not have that turned out exactly.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.640
 It's just boilerplate.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:54.640
 It's removing all that.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.640
 Yeah.

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.640
 Yeah.

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.640
 It's not like trying to guess and sometimes it's wrong.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.640
 Yeah.

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.640
 So maybe that's not magic.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.640
 I don't think that's what we're talking about.

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.720
 It is, Matt, but with this stuff, it's like we can't boil it into a bunch of simple rules.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:06.720
 Like there's a feel.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.240
 You know it when it feels off.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.240
 You know it when it feels good.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:15.800
 The other thing in the section that I found super fascinating is this mood tools thing because

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:16.800
 I didn't know about this.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:17.800
 I think I've heard of this.

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:22.600
 So Kent points out that in the mood tools days, the mood tools was like, I think I remember

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:27.760
 it was like a similar to jQuery, like expanded what JavaScript could do.

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:32.520
 But the way it worked is it would override your, like the string prototype.

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.560
 So it would add functions to strings that weren't actually there, kind of be injected

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.900
 by the library.

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:41.640
 And they added a dot contains feature to a string.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.240
 So like figure out whether a string contains a sub string.

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.240
 Super useful.

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.200
 Obviously should just be in a native thing.

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200
 Yep.

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.800
 They added it because everyone needs it.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:59.340
 And then when they went to implement dot contains natively in the browser, obviously dot contains

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:00.340
 makes sense.

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.640
 It's like what you think of like string contains.

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:06.160
 That's what you would want to name it, but they couldn't name it that because the implementation

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.360
 was slightly different and it would break all the existing mutual sites out there.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.280
 And there were so many of them that this was actually a factor to consider.

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.040
 And that's why it's called dot includes.

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.000
 And it is mind blowing to me that like they have to consider this.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.520
 It is is crazy that you have to consider this.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.520
 Like I never thought of that.

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.760
 And I can't believe that's what yeah, that that's the reason I thought they just picked

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:29.520
 includes because they were like the one was like, Oh yeah, that makes more sense for some

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.520
 reason.

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.520
 Those are a weird decision.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.920
 But yeah, they were forced into it.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.040
 And then the the GitHub issue he links.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:39.320
 It's funny because Sebastian who works on actually us now used to work on move tools and he's

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:44.160
 like in that thread talking about like 10 years ago.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.160
 That's awesome.

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.160
 I didn't I didn't catch that.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.160
 Okay.

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.160
 So that's magic complexity.

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.160
 Getting overly complex.

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.160
 Yeah.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:55.060
 So this is so you mentioned the server actions, all the weird side effects that they have

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:56.060
 to solve now.

00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:02.160
 The taint API, which we talked about in our last totally real yeah.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:06.240
 And I think this I get this also I get like I totally feel this as well.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:13.220
 It is so complicated and for a specific use case like a like a e-commerce or like a marketing

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:18.920
 site like a very specific use case, all the defaults and next and all the complexity is

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:24.040
 great because these are all things that those projects should be doing but probably didn't

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:27.720
 have the like they don't just have the energy to like cover all these little things.

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.720
 Yep.

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.480
 So I can see exactly what they're optimized for.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.200
 But the moment you're not on that path, it's just you're just waiting through all these

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.720
 features that you're turning off or working around.

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.720
 Yep.

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:38.720
 It is a lot.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.720
 Yeah.

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:45.080
 I have a couple of major versions since I use next JS but I was feeling it then even then

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:50.680
 this was before RS was the last version that you like I remember you so consistently built

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.680
 stuff in next.

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.680
 Yeah, I did.

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:56.080
 I mean it was right before for like two years, I think it was right before the RSC release.

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.080
 So was that 13?

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:58.080
 13.

00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.080
 Okay.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.080
 No, no.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.080
 RC was 13.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.080
 I'm out of use 13.

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.080
 RCs were released in 13.

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.080
 Did you use app router?

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.080
 Did you use all those?

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.080
 No, that's what I'm saying.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.080
 Like I never I never got into the app router.

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.080
 Everything was pages directory.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.080
 Yeah.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.080
 Maybe it was just on 12, I guess.

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.080
 Yeah.

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.080
 I think so.

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:15.080
 And you said you felt it even then that it was kind of getting a little complex.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.080
 I thought so.

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:21.560
 I mean, I know like it's it's been taken to another level with all the recent stuff.

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:27.400
 But I mean, I feel like 10, 11, 12, they were like pretty big features introduced in every

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:28.400
 release.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.400
 Maybe there were like more things that we just take for granted now or just fundamental

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:34.920
 things, image optimization and all that stuff.

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.280
 Maybe it's just like you need that stuff.

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:41.600
 But I mean, I still feel like having just gotten into Astro in the last year and built

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.560
 something pretty large with Astro.

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.920
 I feel like this.

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:45.920
 It's a lot simpler.

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:46.920
 The next year.

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:47.920
 I don't know.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:48.920
 It's younger.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:49.920
 So I guess it makes sense.

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:50.920
 But yeah.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:55.000
 And I think every it's so hard to prevent something from getting big and bloated, because you're

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.280
 always trying to innovate and you're always trying to push stuff and you're always working

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.560
 around being backwards compatible.

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:05.240
 Yeah, I am surprised at how complicated it is because I really don't feel like I need

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.240
 a lot of those things.

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.240
 Like I've never needed it.

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.280
 I still build stuff without it.

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:13.320
 I see people building stuff and other frameworks without a lot of those things and they still

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.320
 come out great.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.520
 So again, a little bit of a judgment call here.

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:20.800
 I think for some people, they see all these features and they're like, yes, like these

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.280
 are things that I need turned on.

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.640
 I would have to build them manually otherwise.

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:30.040
 But to me, it has to be like a narrow, somewhat of a narrow set of people.

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.040
 Yeah.

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.040
 Yeah.

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:35.120
 And he compares the remix saying like the goal for remix is to reduce API footprint as opposed

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.120
 to increase.

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:39.120
 But a lot more conservative with adding functionality and features.

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:42.080
 Wait, what the hell is the ability to manage stability twice?

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.720
 Oh, experimenting on my users.

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:44.720
 I guess that's different.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:45.720
 So he mentions.

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:46.720
 Yeah, it's a little different.

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:47.720
 Yeah.

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:48.720
 He has another section on stability here.

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.160
 I think we kind of talked about this stuff as part of the even if he didn't as part of

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.160
 the.

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.160
 No, yeah, the previous section.

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.160
 Experimenting on me.

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.160
 There's nothing super new here.

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.160
 Yeah.

00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:01.720
 I think the main thing here is react router in a lot of ways is kind of like a precursor

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:06.400
 to remix and there is a migration path from react router to remix and that that migration

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:11.200
 path will continue to be more and more clear as remakes implements RSCs.

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:16.000
 I think that's like the most interesting angle I see for remix where there's a lot of sites

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:22.700
 using react router and yeah, pitching switching to next.js was all with all these heavy features

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:27.920
 versus versus switching to remix, which feels like more like an incremental step.

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:28.920
 Yeah.

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:34.680
 So I'm skeptical that a lot of people are going to be choosing next in that situation,

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.640
 but yeah, we'll see capability capability.

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:38.640
 Yeah.

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:41.280
 He's talking about like why isn't this a comparison of features?

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:45.960
 But again, I think people talk about that to death like features and technical things.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:50.400
 But like you said, these are the type of things that probably not mattering more like philosophy

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.960
 in the direction they're going and whether it.

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:53.960
 Whether it lines up.

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:54.960
 Yeah.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:59.720
 Not like the ecommerce demo and how they were able to get a better user experience with less

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:05.400
 code with remix and actually as updated, I think they invented app router to like copy

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.400
 all those features.

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.400
 Yeah.

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.400
 Which is funny.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.400
 Which is fine.

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.760
 Like you should copy your competitors features, but you also got to give credit to the fact

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.960
 that remix got there first.

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.880
 So presumably they might get to the next good idea first as well.

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.160
 Oh, out of order streaming.

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.160
 Sorry.

00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:23.360
 I just I didn't notice that the first time I read this article.

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:24.360
 Yeah.

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.520
 And I think I saw some mention of it.

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:35.200
 Michael posted today that he feels like all of RSCs like all the features you get from

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:42.160
 RSCs could have been implemented in like a much stupider, simpler approach, like the headline

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:46.040
 feature that you care about like streaming and out of order streaming and all those.

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:49.640
 You, like I said, when you're picking stuff to build on, you are making bets.

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.160
 It's not any different than investing in a startup.

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:58.280
 You bet on what they're doing, how they're doing it, the people that are working on it.

00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.280
 And I will say that the remix team, you have to get them a lot of credit for getting to

00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.280
 some of these ideas first.

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.280
 Yeah.

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.280
 We'll see where it goes from there.

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.280
 Okay.

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.280
 I'm sorry.

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:12.180
 I was not listening because the X in the conclusion, that's your prerogative and I welcome

00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:15.480
 you to share your opinions on my take on X, YouTube, Twitch, et cetera.

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.480
 You see this?

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.480
 Yeah.

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:19.840
 Copy it in your clipboard.

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:20.840
 Okay.

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.440
 And then paste it like in your browser address bar.

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.440
 Okay.

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.440
 But you didn't know this.

00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:28.360
 They just picked a, they just picked a Unicode thing.

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:29.360
 It's not a custom logo.

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.560
 That's a Unicode character.

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.560
 Yeah.

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:32.560
 Yeah.

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:33.560
 Everyone was making fun of them for it.

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:38.800
 But it's funny because like, Oh, I commend them for it in some ways because I would never

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:40.160
 be able to do that.

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:44.440
 I would never be able to like emotionally ship that a co-character.

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:46.640
 But there's something so pragmatic about it.

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.160
 I have to like, I didn't know this.

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:53.800
 You were just, yeah, you're just talking on this logo and it's a Unicode character.

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.320
 I mean, I get that the grungy thing.

00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.320
 Yeah.

00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.320
 I agree on that.

00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:58.320
 But I mean, I don't like the way it looks.

00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:02.200
 But yeah, like there is some, how did I just learn this?

00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:07.000
 There is like a mindset to shipping a Unicode character as your logo that we can definitely

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.760
 learn from to some because wild.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:09.760
 Yeah.

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.600
 And I guess kit new, I must be living under a rock.

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:13.600
 Yeah.

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.600
 Huh.

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:17.280
 I just, when I pasted it in the dress bar, I was like, is this going to paste an X?

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:20.280
 Did he somehow like make the X render like that?

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.280
 Like, what is this?

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.880
 I just didn't expect it to like be able to select the text.

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.200
 And then it was the logo and my jaw dropped.

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.280
 I don't know if you saw it, but okay.

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.280
 Yeah.

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.280
 Sorry.

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:33.280
 Well, I guess that's kind of a cool feature because they're, they're domain, can this

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:34.280
 just be their domain name?

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.280
 Can they just be?

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.280
 Could it?

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.320
 Can you just use a Unicode character?

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.900
 There's like the emoji domain thing.

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:41.480
 Have you seen those?

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:42.480
 Yeah.

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.480
 Those are cool.

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.600
 But like, you can't type this in so I guess it wouldn't be.

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:46.600
 No, I guess not.

00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:47.600
 Hang on.

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.600
 What happens if you go to?

00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:49.600
 Oh, it works.

00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.600
 It works.

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:51.600
 Like that.com works.

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:52.600
 Oh my God.

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:53.600
 It works.

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.600
 What?

00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.600
 How did it do that?

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.600
 Wait, hang on.

00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.600
 We're going to, we're going to dig into this.

00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.600
 Let's open up the terminal.

00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.600
 Yeah.

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.600
 What do the redirects look like?

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.600
 This is wild.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.600
 Dig X.com.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:12.380
 It resolves DNS curl dash V. Yeah, 302 to Twitter, which is a tenant 302 to wow.

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:17.040
 So you can, you can use Unicode characters for .com.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.040
 Sorry.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.040
 I'm so quiet.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.040
 That's impressive.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.040
 That is so impressive.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:26.240
 But are there any, are there any of these single Unicode domains that aren't taken?

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.800
 Like it must be all taken or not.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.280
 The problem is people can't type them in.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.680
 That's, that's a real issue.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.680
 Why can't you type them in?

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.680
 What do you mean?

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:36.720
 Like if that was your only domain site, how would you, how would I type this X in without

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.720
 copying it from somewhere?

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.720
 Yeah.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.720
 You just had to copy it.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.480
 I feel like, isn't there like a code like it's like pull down something?

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.720
 I mean, some people probably don't know how to do that.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.800
 I know there's a way and I don't know if it works on Linux.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.100
 So yeah, I can't get over it like Google it every time.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.440
 Now I'm heading straight over to name cheap.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.440
 Oh my God.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.840
 Cole, you said it domains for you to buy.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.840
 Oh, no.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:02.840
 Oh, this is bad.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.840
 Let's see.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:04.840
 Or not.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:05.840
 Sorry.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.840
 I use domainer.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.840
 I like domainer.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.000
 They don't sell domains, but their searching thing is so good.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.400
 Do you spell it like it sounds?

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.360
 Domain of an R. Yeah.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.360
 DomainR.com.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.000
 Oh, wait.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.160
 If I type, I wonder if this X just turns into like a normal X?

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:30.560
 I think it does because even in my, like in my dev tools, I don't see that listed as

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.560
 a request.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.760
 I just see X.com redirect to Twitter.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.760
 Okay.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.440
 So maybe somehow it's, it reduces to a normal X.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.440
 That's an X.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.440
 That's wild.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.440
 I'm so confused.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.440
 Okay.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.440
 Sorry.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.440
 Back on track.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.440
 Okay.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440
 So conclusion time here.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.440
 I wanted to share why I'm recommending and teaching remakes.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.440
 I love it.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.440
 Okay.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.440
 So he concludes.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.440
 They're obviously both capable frameworks.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:59.100
 He's listed why he's betting on this one and he points out that his class is so useful

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:03.760
 even if you're still building on next year's, but I think lines up with the idea that remakes

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.960
 is closer to like web fundamentals and, yeah, and standards, choosing a teach remakes of

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.800
 a cookie to take on any challenge you face in full stack web.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:12.800
 So I think it's a great article.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.720
 I don't think I saw anyone really have like a negative reaction besides those people that

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.820
 were that didn't read it.

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:19.820
 Yeah.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:26.200
 No, I thought it was, I think it articulates pretty much everything all like my feelings

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.080
 and thoughts around, around next and kind of where it's gotten to.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.080
 Yeah.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.840
 And way better than I could have ever.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.840
 Yeah.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.840
 articulated.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.360
 He helped me realize the things I don't like about next.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.840
 The question is, what is his image?

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.320
 This is definitely AI generated.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.320
 Wait, what?

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.320
 What image?

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.320
 The title.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.960
 The title of the why I want you is this is like abstract art.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.720
 Are we supposed to read something into his is next the red and remixes of blues or something

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.720
 hidden in there?

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.400
 Do you see like a girl in the top right with like headphones on and three eyes and her

01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.400
 arms?

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.400
 I see that.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.400
 She's dancing.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.400
 Those old iPod commercials kind of.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400
 Oh, yeah.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.400
 Yeah.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.480
 Well, now we got to know, Kent, if you could let us know if there's something hidden in

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.160
 this abstract art at the top, that would be helpful.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.580
 I wonder if it is AI generated.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:18.240
 I feel like I just assumed it was, but I actually don't think it looks exactly like

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.720
 AI generated stuff.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:20.720
 Mm.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.200
 You know how they all have that like field to them?

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.200
 Yeah.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.680
 This is not screwing me that to me.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.800
 So I'm looking through his other articles, like his, all his little cover art, the kind

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.800
 of, yeah, nice mix of things, a lot of abstract.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:41.240
 I like, man, everyone that does a space theme, I feel like it always just comes out so cool.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.400
 Like the, what does full stack mean for Epic Web that article?

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.480
 I mean, Epic Web.dev is just all space themed, right?

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.480
 Oh, it is.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.480
 Yeah.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.480
 Like Ashrow stuff.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.040
 Also, like, I feel like you have so many.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.040
 I love it.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.240
 And you pick a space theme.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.240
 Yeah.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.240
 The Ashrow one is just to get to keep on giving.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.840
 It seems like they keep discovering new like, yeah, goofy things that they can introduce

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.600
 into the brand that fit.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.600
 Yeah.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.920
 That's the thing that I was trying to listen about, like when you pick a name for a company,

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:13.120
 you also kind of want to pick something you can play with in a million ways, which is kind

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.120
 of was hard to do.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.080
 But if you do pick that, it makes every single thing you ship a lot easier because you're

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.880
 constrained to like a certain theme, but it's also very flexible.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.880
 Good call.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.880
 All right.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.880
 That's the article.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.880
 Yeah.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.880
 For cell comp.

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880
 Wait, is it for cell comp for next comp?

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.880
 Next.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.880
 They still have for cell comp.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.080
 I feel like that is a thing, but is that was that a thing?

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.080
 I thought it was.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.080
 Maybe not.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.480
 Oh, so they do they do two a year?

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.480
 Maybe not.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.480
 Maybe not.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.560
 I don't see anything for for cell comp.

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:41.120
 So it's always next time wrong to make that up.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.800
 I feel like that used to be a thing on the day of next comp.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.840
 We read an article about why we did.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.240
 I wonder if you can't timed it for that reason.

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.520
 Can't let us know.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.320
 Did you write the article knowing that next jazz comp was?

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.120
 Was this a calculated strike?

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:07.920
 It's just a heart of next day as on their most revered day.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.400
 I do wish I was going.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.400
 It's such FOMO.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.400
 I hate FOMO.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.400
 Can I just add him?

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.400
 I had so much.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:14.400
 I know.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.960
 I had so much FOMO at at the Twitch con.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.880
 I was at Twitch con and I had FOMO.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.880
 Why is that?

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:21.880
 Describe that more.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:22.880
 What do you have FOMO for?

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.520
 Well, it's just like you want to make sure you're doing the right thing.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:28.600
 You're in the right place at the right time with the right people and like just like

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:29.760
 can't just enjoy it.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:35.120
 It's like min maxing everything about it because there's a lot of things you could do when

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.120
 you get there.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.160
 And it's like, I don't know.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.160
 I don't like it.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.160
 How do you get rid of it?

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:43.480
 I want no FOMO over anything in the tech industry.

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:44.480
 Yeah.

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:49.280
 I talk about this other day, but as stupid as it sounds, like I do get inspired by my

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.280
 dog a lot.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:54.040
 Like sometimes I see the way he lives life and I'm just like, there's something going

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.040
 to be learned here.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.520
 Just so in the moment all the time.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.520
 Yeah.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.520
 My kids are like, that's kind of what you're talking about.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.520
 Oh, yeah.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.520
 Exactly.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.840
 So he's never like, I could be doing this other thing, which could be better.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.840
 Yeah.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:07.840
 Right.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.000
 And that's the rules that you're doing.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
 Exactly.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
 Okay.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.440
 But if I have a goal this year, it's to not have any FOMO.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.880
 That's it because you don't want other things.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:22.880
 No, no, no, I might go to nothing, but I want to just not care.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.760
 FOMO is always going to be a thing.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:28.560
 But I think having FOMO at Twitch con, no, no, I'm getting rid of it.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.560
 That's unhealthy.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:32.600
 No, just like I can see how that's maybe annoying.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.600
 FOMO's okay.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:40.040
 If you see your friends hanging out and having fun, like, and you're not there, it's okay.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.480
 That's okay to fear missing out because you are missing out.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.480
 It's not really a fear.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.480
 We know you are missing out.

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.480
 Yeah.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.520
 I didn't have FOMO at all with Twitch con.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.280
 It looked so bad and not fun and terrible.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.280
 It was so fun.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.280
 You missed it.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.280
 It was so great.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.280
 I saw it.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.280
 It's fun.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:00.680
 I got to say, to be completely honest, and a lot of the pictures that you guys took, the

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.680
 background looked like shit.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.320
 I don't know what was going on.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.800
 Like, there was a picture of that milky scent of you and him.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.200
 They all these like shitty streamers.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:11.320
 But like you were in some like crappy, like, office and like-

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.720
 Wait, there was a picture of me and milky?

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:17.560
 They put like streamers on like just like half-assed streamers on the ceiling behind

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.560
 you.

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:21.320
 I didn't even know there was a picture of me and milky out there.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.320
 Milky scent.

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.320
 I really didn't take any pictures.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.320
 He sent it to me.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.320
 It was the two of you.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.320
 You probably don't remember because you were wasted.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.320
 Was I?

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.320
 Was it that night?

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.320
 I only did it one night.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.320
 Did it?

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.320
 The thing that you do have to go one night?

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.480
 I only had an alcohol on one night.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.480
 Okay.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.480
 I just sent you the picture.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.480
 On this board.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.480
 On this board.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.480
 Look at it.

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.480
 And do you get what I mean?

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.480
 Oh, wow.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.480
 That does look awful.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.480
 Where is that?

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.480
 Just look at the background.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.480
 Like it just looks so crappy.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.480
 All right.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.480
 That is a restaurant.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.800
 That's at this taco place and they're probably just decorating for Halloween.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.800
 That's not TwitchCon.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.800
 Wait, wait, hang on.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.880
 This is a taco place?

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.160
 Why does it look like a corporate office?

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.760
 I think that's a taco place.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:58.760
 I'm pretty sure.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.640
 I feel like that's the only place we ever went to eat.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.960
 They all love these tacos and we just kept going.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.280
 Did you have those elkordo?

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.120
 Did you have those elkordo?

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:10.360
 Was there for you there?

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.840
 And then coconut water the next time because I didn't want fries again.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.840
 Yeah.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.080
 There were no tacos for me.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:19.960
 When you come to Miami, I told you we have that restaurant saved for you.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.680
 So I am definitely coming to Miami.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.680
 Yeah.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.680
 So you mentioned on Twitter.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.560
 I mean, I'm coming for Miami, for React Miami.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.560
 Yeah.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:28.560
 And there might be another reason.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.280
 I feel like there's another thing that we might go because of family.

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.280
 There's something in Miami.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.280
 I can't remember.

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.280
 Like a reunion.

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.280
 No.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.280
 What do you mean?

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.280
 My family look like they're from Miami.

01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.280
 I thought you guys are doing a reunion in like a destination.

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.280
 No.

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.280
 My family.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.280
 What?

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.280
 Why are you saying something?

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:50.560
 You just said you might go to Miami for family.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.280
 I have no idea what to make of that.

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.280
 No.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.280
 Oh, I'm sorry.

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:55.280
 For my family.

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.280
 Like my wife and my boys.

01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:57.280
 Like something we wanted to go to.

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.280
 That's in Miami.

01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.980
 I can't remember what it is.

01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.280
 There's a jiu-jitsu tournament there.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.280
 The Miami Open.

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.280
 We'll see.

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:05.600
 I'll be in Miami at some point.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.000
 Is it the F1 race?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
 No.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.440
 There's an F1 race in Miami?

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.440
 Yeah.

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.440
 It was a...

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.440
 So Miami and Vegas were the two big additions?

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.440
 Yeah.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.440
 I was going to say Vegas was a mess because of all the F1.

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.440
 I know.

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:19.200
 I'm so jealous of all the people going to the Vegas F1 race.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.080
 Oh, going to the race.

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.280
 I thought you meant I'm going to Vegas before the race and having to deal with the traffic.

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.720
 No, I was like, you would be jealous of that.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.600
 You're so drawn to like disasters.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.000
 I'm drawn to being entertained by other people feeling awkward.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
 Yeah.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.200
 Uncomfortable or awkward.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.200
 Yeah.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.200
 What...

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.200
 You're like an F1 fan?

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.440
 Did I know this?

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.440
 You watched it?

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.440
 I don't know.

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.440
 I'm more lately.

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:47.600
 I haven't been super into it, but I love F1 in general.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.680
 I used to be super into it.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.360
 Like I said, we talked about the ice dish simulators and all that, but I've never been

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:53.360
 to a race.

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:54.360
 Oh, right.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.360
 I will go to the Miami one eventually.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.360
 You had it because they were so expensive.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.200
 Some of these have like 5,000 or minimum for seats and stands.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.600
 Vegas one must be insane.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.900
 I wouldn't be surprised if it's the most expensive sporting event of all time because

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.120
 one, it's in Vegas, two, it's F1.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:12.880
 F1 is already like a rich sport, like you show up at your yachts, like type of situation.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.120
 Then you have all the hotels that are like lined up on the strip and some of the rooms

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.440
 have like views of the race.

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.720
 Like that is going to be crazy.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.720
 Crazy, crazy.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:21.720
 Yeah.

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.720
 That's wild.

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:23.720
 I don't want to be there for that one.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.960
 It's going to like a couple of weeks, right?

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960
 It's really soon.

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.440
 Do we have anything else to talk about?

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.440
 I don't think so.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.440
 Okay.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:37.560
 I was just reading a message that I thought might be pertinent to this very episode from

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.600
 our editor in chief, Chris.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.600
 Oh, are we in trouble?

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.600
 No.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:47.760
 He's just pointing out, did you know you can stream to Twitter from Riverside, straight

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.760
 from Riverside?

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:49.760
 Oh, you can.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.760
 That's what he said.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:51.760
 Do we do that?

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.560
 I just saw a message from trash on Twitter.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.560
 Hi, trash.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.560
 What did trash say?

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.600
 He said, you can't afford a race.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.760
 Have you not met trash from person?

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:00.760
 No.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.200
 I bet you're feeling some some FOMO right now.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:06.760
 From me, trash in person cares about that.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:12.240
 When you put it that way, I thought you should have FOMO because I still haven't met him

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.240
 for in person.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.240
 Oh, yeah, you're right.

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.240
 situation.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.240
 No.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.240
 Trash is good people.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.240
 Good times.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.240
 I don't know.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.240
 Is he as small as I say?

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.240
 He is.

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.400
 Oh, how did I already know he was small?

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.320
 I wasn't like taken aback by your size, trash.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.520
 I just assumed you were small, but I don't know why I assumed that.

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.520
 Did I say that?

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.440
 Everyone talks about it constantly and people let me in with him and I find that right.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.440
 I'm not tall.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.440
 So I'm very.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.440
 I'm not small.

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.440
 Oh, I told trash.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.440
 Oh, that's so funny.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.440
 Yeah.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.440
 Oh, he told you.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:46.360
 I told trash that you didn't come and I needed a conference buddy when you were about his size.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.360
 Oh, yeah.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.360
 Oh, yeah.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.360
 This is your fault.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.840
 Oh, sorry, God, it's funny.

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:56.600
 You're five, ten or five, eight, ten, ten, five, ten.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:57.600
 Yeah.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.600
 Five, ten, five, eight.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.600
 Like that's a noticeable difference.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.600
 Oh, wait.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.600
 Which one are you?

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.600
 You're five, eight.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.600
 You are five, ten.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.600
 Yes.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.600
 Okay.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.600
 I thought I just gave you a couple.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.600
 Okay.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.600
 I wouldn't be this confident if I was five, eight.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:09.600
 If you're five, eight.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.600
 I don't know.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.160
 Some people snout would be different.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:16.440
 Sometimes the smaller, the more confident, like a small dog, you know, like a chihuahua.

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.440
 Oh, yeah.

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.440
 That's true.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.440
 Yeah.

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.440
 All right.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.600
 We really should go because this is getting boring even for me.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.600
 See you next.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:25.600
 Yeah.
