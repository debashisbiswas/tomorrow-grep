WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 This is going to be a really special episode because like always we have Adam who is my

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.320
 whitest white friend and we have Ken who is my least white white friend and he's going to be

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.760
 less colliding on this episode.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.680
 That was a good one, that was a good one.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.400
 He said he really is so fucking white it's unbelievable.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.440
 You know he's literally never left Missouri.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.880
 I've what I've left with. Ken has seen me. I went to Atlanta, I went to Atlanta somewhere.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.640
 Atlanta, what was that like? Did you actually go?

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.760
 No, no, no, I was trying to figure out if he I don't think. Yeah, yeah, I went.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.280
 Come for the render. Wait, what? Oh, no, I didn't go to everything.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.520
 I didn't go to all the extracurricular activities.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.080
 Even if you did, I wouldn't have remembered it.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.640
 It was clarifying. I have always completely out of control. It was fucking awesome.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.720
 Everyone says all about about render. It gets bigger every year.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.520
 That's what she said.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.760
 Oh, my fucking stomach.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:36.160
 Hello. Hey, there. How do I sound?

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.640
 Different. Does it sound lower or talk again? I might have just had it turned up too a lot.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.080
 I think more echo probably, right? Yeah, more echo. Yeah.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.360
 I moved. I can't even tell. That's crazy.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.480
 That's exactly the same, right? It really does.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.680
 That's so funny. It kind of sucks that it's so much effort to do this.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.880
 Like I had so much shit mounted on the wall. I had to like unscrew it,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.240
 move it over, re-measure stuff, re-screw stuff. You put in all that work and then there's no

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.040
 difference. You can't tell the difference. Yeah. Why is the audio echo-y just haven't

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.160
 got to be on the walls yet or something? I have no clue. I don't know what I'm missing in this

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.360
 room that was absorbing the echo. I think it's a curtains. I didn't put the curtains on.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.920
 Ah. Could be it? This side. But yeah, I can't tell. I might need to get...

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.800
 I had a rug before, but I got rid of that a while ago. I might need to get a rug.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.720
 Do you have any soundproofing? My entire walls are covered in acoustic panels.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.360
 You can see one of them over my shoulder. Oh, I can see that there.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.120
 Yeah. It's so... I like, my brain refuses to believe that they do anything.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.400
 It's just... Oh man, they do... I just can't believe it.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.800
 Like, I before this room was awful and now you can't... Like, if I'm in my office and my doors open,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.280
 people can't hear me. Like, when I'm yelling across the house trying to yell out from my office,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.240
 you just can't even hear... Like, it absorbs all the sound. It's crazy.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.120
 Do you think... So, I have this one wall here. I think if I just put some here,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.720
 it would, like, make a difference? I'm sure it would. I mean, every little bit would

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.280
 probably make a difference. I don't know the... Yeah, I might do that.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.000
 Like, I just went with the shotgun approach and I covered all the walls. I could have gone

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.280
 less if I were smart and knew how sound bounces around. I think you can, like, strategically

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.200
 place them. It has to do with where you're facing when you're speaking, I guess.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.600
 Yeah. Which I'm kind of leaning towards this wall, so I think it would make sense, but...

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.920
 I don't know. Yeah, I don't know why it would sound any different. It must be the curtains.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.280
 I like these big blackout curtains that probably did a lot.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.920
 It doesn't sound bad. Just different. Just a little bit different.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.440
 It's the only sign that you've moved.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.000
 It's crazy. I guess we're not going to stream, right?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.400
 Well, I can't because my... This is the worst day for all of this because I...

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.520
 So, of course, okay, listen to this process. I went on my Xfinity because I used Xfinity

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.000
 for internet. I went on the app last week, scheduled my move. They were like, "Guess what,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 you don't need a technician. You can just move your equipment yourself and it's all going to work."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.880
 And I'm like, "That's convenient." So then yesterday I did that and I plugged it in. And, of course,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.880
 nothing worked. My account was in some weird state that it got confused that I didn't have service.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.200
 The first I thought it was an issue on their end. Got that fixed. Still not working.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.960
 We had to send a technician. The technician comes out today. He goes to the box on the right

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.520
 and he's like, "There's no signal coming to this box." And he ends up having to run a cable.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.240
 He went across the street, pulled out a giant ladder, climbed up a telephone pole.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.400
 Ran a new line. Apparently the old line was just busted. I don't know. It was just up working at some

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.880
 point. Yeah. Ran an old line all the way across my house, then set it up. And now it's working,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.320
 but random websites are really flaky. They'll work for a while and they'll stop.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.560
 But then the whole internet's having issues today, so I can't debug what the problem is.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.480
 I think that's probably the transatlantic or whatever it was. There was a cable

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.840
 under the seat. Where was it? Isn't the Middle East or something that was damaged?

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.880
 Yeah, but I don't know if that one is affecting Miami, Florida. What's traveling across?

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.400
 Well, yeah, I guess, I don't know. The cascading effects of the internet.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.360
 Yeah. Maybe a stuff is getting me routed or something and stuff is overwhelmed.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.160
 It'd be weird to me if you ran a new cable and some websites are a little flaky.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:41.440
 That seems to match the symptoms. The point of the wire that carries Twitter is broken.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.920
 Like if you have certain colors on your website, they just get mixed up on the cable.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:55.920
 Yeah. So it's just annoying to debug. So I think I hope it's not because if it's an issue on my end,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.120
 like, I don't even know how they're going to debug this. It's just a hard thing to figure out.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.120
 I heard I didn't even read the article, but I heard Discord and there were like a few services,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.760
 all the Facebook services were out, maybe. All the Facebook ones. Yeah, there was a lot.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.760
 If you go to downdetector.com, there was like a spike in like so many unrelated services.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.600
 Downdetector.com. I've never heard of such as actually brilliant.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.600
 They don't even monitor anything. They just keep track of the number of times people visit

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.720
 their website. What? And then that that's the analytic. Isn't that crazy?

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.520
 Wait, say it again. They don't monitor anything.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.040
 So it's not like they have like servers pulling all these services.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.400
 If you search like is Twitter down and you click the link, it takes you to downdetector.com/Twitter

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.880
 and you like plus one, they're counter. And whenever stuff is down, a bunch of people

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.880
 start visiting this site and they're effectively self-reporting. Hey, I'm having a problem with this

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.960
 site. Yeah. It's brilliant. That is pretty smart. It doesn't work when you type in Twitter,

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:07.280
 because it's now X. Twitter outages reported in the last 24 hours. Huh. So yeah, lots of sites

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.840
 showing down on downdetector. Yeah. So I can't tell. And it's like, it's really flaky. I think

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.040
 whenever stuff is broken, I'm like hitting Google and Google seems to work. So I don't think it's a

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:23.680
 problem. I end, but yeah, it's just, I'm just not going to know, still in the process of moving.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.040
 I've been doing like a little bit every day. How long is this going to stretch out? How long do you

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.640
 have to get stuff out of the other house? No one's taking the other house yet. Like, I actually

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:36.720
 showed someone around it today. No one's, no one's pulled the trigger. So we're going to try to get

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:45.360
 it done by today or tomorrow. We did like one big push, Sunday and Monday. And so yeah, moving sucks.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.960
 At least I guess it's next door. So you didn't have to have a truck and do the whole loading the

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:56.240
 truck thing. Yeah. That part sucks. And like, if you put stuff in a moving van, it will get destroyed.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.120
 I don't know if you've ever like, oh, yeah, we move from New York to Miami. Oh, in a truck. Yeah.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.400
 Like everything gets destroyed. Like they all just fight each other. All your things just go

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.320
 at each other and they destroy each other. I move the most delicate LG OLED TV. It is like,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.840
 it is so okay. You know how they were like, they kept making TVs thinner and thinner.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.800
 They've got to thin now where like, I can barely move like whenever I move it, it's so, it's such

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.000
 like a scary process because it just like bends and like, yeah, it's too thin. Like a piece of paper

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.360
 completely fine, but they put so much work in like box. They like reboxed it. They wrapped it

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.440
 a million times to put in the box and they wrap the box of bunch and they put blankets all around

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:41.440
 it. So that one made it easily. Summer clothes got a little messed up. You know what's crazy about

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:48.080
 those moves. So those long distance moves from New York to Miami, they show up in a truck. It's

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.160
 a normal city truck and then they load everything in and you're like, okay, I guess they're on their

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.600
 way to Miami now. They're not. They go to a warehouse, then they unload everything. What?

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.880
 And then they wait a couple days or maybe like a week to like accrue a bunch of things.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.320
 Then they show up in a semi in like a bigger, like those bigger, bigger trucks like the tractor

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.880
 trailer trucks. Yeah, semi truck is what you're going to say. I think. Yeah. Then they load it back

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.000
 in, then they drive it all the way down, unload it into another warehouse, then get a city

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.200
 truck loaded onto a city truck and drive it to your house. So they wait until multiple people are

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.480
 moving to the same place and then they like transport all at once. Yeah, they have it all scheduled

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.000
 because like they like pick up, you know, three or four people that do like three or four days of

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.160
 city pickups, then they'll do like one big move. But yeah, the thing that sucks is your stuff is

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.760
 getting loaded unloaded like four times in that process. And of course, it's not going to get

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.200
 damaged. Yeah. Yeah. So in that move, I would say overall we came out not bad. Like our colds

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.520
 were actually fine. Just a box that was in them, but like got crushed. But the colds were fine.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.480
 Plates. We lost a bunch of plates. And I think that was, I think everything else was intact.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:04.720
 A little bit of our couch, like there was like a, like a stand, like the bottom portion that

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.240
 the couch sits on, like one of the stands in the middle broke, but like you can't really see that

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:14.560
 anyway. So yeah, overall, not bad. Yeah, I've, I've had movers move me and things went pretty well.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:20.080
 And then I move myself once things did not go as well. I am not as good at packing as professional

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.160
 movers. It turns out professional movers are so impressive. Yeah, they really are so good. They move,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:30.080
 they move fast too. So we had two guys come and help us yesterday morning, because we had a few

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.760
 heavy items like we're gonna have someone help us. And I think movers are always like one or two,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.000
 one of two stereotypes. And I've only ever had the first stereotype up until yesterday. The first

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.320
 stereotype is like, just the stockiest people you've ever seen. Like they're like squares and,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:52.560
 and like they can just lift anything. And they don't like look, like you never see them on the

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:58.240
 street and be like, Oh, that person's like really strong. It's just, they are like super dense.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:04.320
 Yeah. The two guys that showed up yesterday, both of them were like six foot four super lean,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.600
 and they looked like NBA players. It was like, they both look super athletic. Yeah. And they

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.120
 just were like, they just like lifted everything. And just when you have that much, I guess a leverage,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.360
 or both super lengthy, like super long arms, super long legs, and they were just like, huh,

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.440
 yeah, they make quick work of most of the things. And they're like, that was really easy. And I was

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:28.880
 like, that doesn't not look easy. But we have one of those egg barbecue things. Oh, yeah, big green

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.280
 egg. My dad's super happy. I have a I have a Kamado Joe, which is a red one. Wait, what?

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.560
 Is that better than the big green egg? I think so. But you know, it's like, what what really is

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.280
 a difference? I don't know who knew there were two companies that make egg shaped grills.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.920
 I learned something new today. I so when I bought this Kamado Joe grill,

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.800
 it's what's called Kamado Joe. The reason it's called that is because this type of grill

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.840
 originated in Japan called a Kamado grill. Obviously American version of it Kamado Joe.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.640
 And I remember I was like looking up stuff and there's like all these YouTube videos made by

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.280
 them. There's like a huge community of people like making YouTube videos for it. And like,

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.840
 they're big successful company. I'm like, man, it must be so fun to work at a company like this.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:19.920
 Like you do all you do is make these barbecues. Everyone loves your product. Like it's good time.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.480
 Like you genuinely everyone's super happy to buy your stuff. And you just go in every day and you

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:32.000
 like you make these egg shaped ceramic grills. And that's that's that's like your life and your

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.520
 passion and what you think about it. I think that's, man, that sounds really fun. You don't

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.920
 think you'd get bored? Like, I can't imagine that there's that much to think about. I mean,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:45.360
 maybe maybe they like improved their manufacturing over times. There's like, I will say the thing

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.160
 that they go crazy. Okay. So the grill itself, if you buy like the midsize one that you probably

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:57.760
 get, it's around like $1,200. If you go crazy with accessories, you can buy like $2,000 or $3,000

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:04.640
 with accessories on top because they have found a way to make this thing do literally anything.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.480
 So if you want to like cook pizza in it, there's like a pizza of an attachment.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:14.160
 There's a there's an airflow event at the bottom. And so we use to control how much oxygen it's

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:21.200
 getting to control the temperature. They built like this $400 fan that you like connect into

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.560
 it. And it's like a smart fan. It connects to your phone. And it keeps the temperature inside of

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.880
 the thing. And it like controls how much oxygen is going in. So it's like precisely the right

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:36.480
 temperature at all times. So it's like, yeah, so they go crazy coming up with these like additional

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.200
 things. That's not just making the round ceramic grill. Like that would get boring, I would think.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.280
 But if you keep coming up with new products, I guess that's exciting.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.000
 Yeah, I think the mission is just what's funny. It's like your ultimate mission is just so people

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.160
 make good food and are happy. It's like so simple and straightforward. And no one can really argue

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:05.200
 with it. Never considered life in a job like that or any other job really, I guess.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.840
 Yeah, do you ever think about like, like I wish I'd gone into this instead of what I do like

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.920
 a different industry or like my like craft is different. Yeah, like a completely different

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:23.120
 profession, just like a completely different job, not programming. Yeah, I do. But then I'm like,

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.880
 I just I have such a hard time imagining it because I can't imagine myself looking good at anything

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.560
 else. So it might when I try to imagine I just imagine myself sucking at some random thing. And

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.840
 I'm like, that isn't fun. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I just I just read something yesterday. Or no,

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:44.320
 I heard it on a podcast, I think. The guy Countyport wrote Deep Work, he was on the Rich Roll podcast,

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.440
 and he was talking about, I think that's why I read it or heard it. Maybe not. Maybe this is a

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.240
 completely separate thought, but it was about like passion and how you don't like, you don't

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.360
 like pursue your passion when you're looking for your career. It's like you develop a passion

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.360
 when you gain expertise in a thing. I don't know, maybe that's common knowledge, but kind of hit

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.520
 me is like, huh, I guess I wasn't passionate about programming when I started programming. I didn't

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.200
 know anything about it. But then eventually you become really passionate the more you do it and

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.120
 the more you like it and the more you get good at it and all that. Yeah, interesting. Yeah,

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.480
 once you're good at something and just addictive, because like there's no better feeling than

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.320
 family can know what you're doing. So yeah, I'm also addicted to things I'm terrible at though,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.640
 like jiu-jitsu. So I don't know what that's about. I think I'm going to be good someday. And that's

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.480
 why I'm hooked. I don't know. That's good, though. That's like what people struggle with, right?

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.160
 People have a hard time going back to feeling like they're a beginner. So if you don't have that,

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.560
 it's kind of like a superpower. Yeah, have you ever played golf? No, but I keep finding golf

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:44.240
 balls all around my new house. So I think the people that lived, you know, the three. Wait,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:49.040
 do you remember me telling you that I like live next, sort of these three frat guys?

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.480
 Oh, yeah. Is this their house? And now I live in their house. Yeah.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.120
 And now when I see the backyard, I'm like, oh, no wonder they were just always throwing parties,

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.440
 because this is like the perfect party backyard, especially if you're like a picture. Yeah.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.440
 Yeah. Especially if you're like that age, like probably very few people have access to

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.960
 like a place like that. But yeah, I would always see them with golf bags in the mornings. And I

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.400
 think they were just like hitting golf balls around in the backyard. I was like, you know,

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:23.520
 how the fake grass? Well, golf is a sport that's notoriously hard to master. And you basically,

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.400
 you go play golf and you're terrible. And you're chasing balls all over. You're digging to the

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.480
 woods looking for your ball. It's just like an awful time. But then you hit like one good shot

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.320
 every time you go. And that keeps you coming back. You think about that shot. That's all you

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.800
 think about after that round of golf. It's like, man, I hit that ball well. And then you come back

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.880
 for the next round and it's misery again. You're just you're terrible. Everything's going poorly.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.440
 You hit him in the lake, you hit him all over, and you get that one shot. And it's like a different

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.480
 club this time. Like, I actually hit a four iron today. That was amazing. So it's an interesting

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.840
 sport in that it's just pain all the time. But then those little glimmers of hope keep you hooked.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.120
 You get really addicted. I get really addicted. I get addicted to everything, whatever.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.480
 Well, it's funny because the way you describe that, I feel like certain like games or like

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.920
 mobile games are like there's things that are like engineered to have that exact pattern where

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:20.000
 it's like mostly frustration where they like feed you one little thing that feels like progress at

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.200
 the right cadence and then it's like the recipe for addiction. Isn't it crazy that like you read

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.560
 these articles about companies, social media companies and all these companies that are like

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.920
 figuring out how to like release the right amount of dopamine in your brain at the right time.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.960
 Like all this like engineering of addiction, like who are the people doing it though? Because like

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.440
 I've worked at tech companies, I guess. And like I'm trying to think who is the person that data

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.520
 scientists and do they realize that's what they're doing or are they just like giving a bunch of

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.600
 like data sets and they're like, hey, figure out how to make this number go up. Or does somebody

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.120
 know like I'm literally like engineering people's brains to be addicted to this thing. Is there a

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:02.160
 person at the company that knows that? I think there's it's funny because my first reaction was I

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:09.840
 don't think I think yes, but I think most people aren't competent enough to think that way. That's

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.120
 kind of what comes to mind because like when you're talking about this, I thought about Nikita beer

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:20.160
 and like he definitely like really thinks about this stuff. Oh, yeah, it's super aware of exactly

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.880
 the dynamics. I then I remember this thing I saw this new season reaction with him in Paul Graham

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:32.000
 yesterday. No, on Twitter, Paul Graham posted a chart. Okay, a growth chart had no labels that

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.840
 didn't say what app it was. It was and he commented. This is an interesting app because they get

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:45.440
 a big spike because this app relates to people's new year's resolutions with the app works so then

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.800
 like they actually retain all this people like so every year like a spike and they actually do

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.200
 retain them. And I was like, okay, that was interesting. Then Nikita beer replies going,

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.160
 is this a language learning app? And then Paul Graham was like, yeah, and then he like linked

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:05.920
 the company. I'm finally saying publicly. He just looked at it. I was like, this has to be a

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:13.520
 language learning app. Wow. Yeah, that guy, he's the, I guess, the world expert and like at least

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:19.200
 with phones, how to give people a dig to just something. Yeah, product. Yeah. Huh. And how to make

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.320
 it something people want to share and all those things. Yeah, he thinks about this stuff all the

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.960
 time, doesn't he? But I don't think of him as like evil. I don't know the person I'm describing,

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:33.040
 like at the evil big company is like, I'm going to make them spend more time on their phone. And I

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:39.200
 don't think of him that way. I think that I think the smarter you are, the easier it is to create a

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:45.680
 story that doesn't sound so evil to yourself. Maximizing shareholder value. I don't think anyone's

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:51.600
 out there like, I love being evil. All right. I'm sure they like wrap it in like all kinds of,

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.400
 all kinds of whatever. And you're not evil. It's not like you have to convince yourself you're not

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.280
 evil. Like you're not. It's just like, I don't know, where did I just hear about?

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.640
 Did I watch something? Did I watch a documentary or something? I don't know. I just, I feel like

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.200
 this is top of mind with like how much time we spend on our phones, how they're destroying all

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:17.600
 these social constructs and most of modern society. And we're all addicted and yada yada. I mean,

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:23.120
 it's the same stuff like we all know, but we keep doing it. Do you just like, do you think it's fine?

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.680
 And it all just might go away and like, we'll figure it out how to adapt and evolve with these

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:33.200
 things. I think I can speak in the QA. He tweeted something the other day that where he was like,

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:39.520
 I stare at my phone all day because it's so damn interesting. Something like that.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.640
 In a lot of ways, it can be that simple. Like, maybe it's just one of the most genuinely

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.800
 interesting things that's happening in the world. Not saying it's the only interesting thing,

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.040
 but yeah, maybe we wouldn't be so glued to our phones if they weren't the most interesting

00:20:53.040 --> 00:21:01.920
 thing in the world. I mean, his perspective would be that, right? Because he makes these apps that

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:07.120
 do really well. I know what it was. It was on the Bill Simmons podcast he had somebody on. I can't

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.720
 remember. And they talked about the future of everything, which I thought was funny because that's

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:16.240
 kind of what our podcast is labeled as, but we only talk about programming and stupid stuff. I don't

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:24.800
 know. No, this guy was like a research scientist or something. I don't know. He writes for variety.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.360
 I don't know. He's a writer. Wait, Bill Simmons podcast covers like random shit like that?

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.040
 Oh, yeah. Lots of pop culture stuff.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:45.040
 Oh, okay. Our guest is here. Look at that. So I have a funny story. I don't think I ever told

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:50.960
 you this can. But a few years ago, when I first found your Twitter, I was like, oh, this guy is

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:58.000
 hilarious. And then I was, I went to Liz, and I was like, look at this guy. He's an engineer,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.880
 but like, he's so funny and so different from what you'd expect. And she looks at your profile,

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.280
 and she like got kind of upset. She was like, are you guys just laughing at him? Because he's

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:18.800
 lying. I was like, you know, I totally get why she thought that you definitely 100% give off that

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.160
 vibe. That's so fucking funny. You know, it's, you know, here's a funny thing. So I get that a lot,

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:33.200
 right? But what also happens a lot is anywhere I go internationally, especially in Europe, right?

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.160
 It doesn't matter like what like, you know, like you think like of like a Swede, it's like this

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.080
 tall fucking blonde guy or something, right? You think like, oh, well, you know, Italian, right?

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:48.240
 Mustache and all that shit. But no matter, no matter what country you're in, there's always

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:56.880
 that like phenotype of dude that is like the bald, like so three fuck, right? So inevitably,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.400
 inevitably, whatever I'm over there, like they'll try to talk to me in the language because they

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.760
 think that I'm from there, just because like there's that fucking guy everywhere. You're right.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.680
 Yeah. If you're in Turkey, totally see if you're in Greece, totally see it. Like, yeah, you kind

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:16.160
 of work anywhere. Like, I don't fucking speak Polish. I'm like, I thought I was fucking

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:22.320
 I had this unbelievable. I have the same thing everywhere else in the world. Like, if I go to

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:29.040
 I'm anywhere like, well, and they think I'm like Dominican, if I'm in Asia, I think I'm like from

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:34.560
 Middle East, North African. So I definitely, I definitely blend in as well. I believe it.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.080
 What about you, Adam? The people mistake you for it. They mostly think I'm white. Yeah,

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:44.400
 they mostly think I'm Caucasian. That's what I get a lot. That's fair. Yeah. What is, uh,

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.600
 what does this might cover you have on there? On mine? Yeah, it's white, you know, it's my

00:23:49.600 --> 00:24:01.360
 it's like a place in the UK that sells these colored, of course, and they're not colored.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:09.280
 Yeah. It's amazing. Every single SM7B owner in the world, it looks like this. And then of course,

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.920
 your mind is one is a one is a one one. Yeah, it kind of makes me look like white.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.160
 It's like fucking lip scan on it from like, yeah, I noticed it aggressively the other day.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.680
 I noticed that the mind's getting kind of gross and the white shows it really bad.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.120
 It's like, I guess I touch it. Mine just covered in like a lint and dog hair and

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.560
 Oh, that's bullshit. I don't even know. Can you clean this? Do you clean it?

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.320
 Okay, no, I don't know. I don't know. You guys replace it. It's really just

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.880
 replacing. Just be a consumer DAX order. It's like, it's like the, um, like,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.360
 did you see where they, they, uh, they clean like the stadium seats? No, like burn off the first,

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:47.200
 like you never saw that. No. Oh, dude. So like, like, imagine like some like,

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.120
 like minor league baseball stadium, right? That's been there for like 30 years and the seats,

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.160
 they now like plastic looks real shitty, like subway seat, right? Like an old playground swing.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:02.080
 There's this dude and he goes around and you take like a blow towards like a roofing torch

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.720
 and you go, and it's like brand new looking. Wow.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.680
 We're gonna burn off a layer. I like melts back the first layer or some shit, but like, dude,

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:16.400
 like you want to talk about like a satisfying video, right? You see these videos that are like,

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.560
 you, you watch it and you're like, right? Yeah. You know, have you ever been, have you ever like

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:27.200
 power washed? Oh, yeah. I do. Yeah. But like this shit, making a seat new again? Oh,

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.200
 did you? I watched it. I'm like, oh, this is just.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:38.960
 Did you, uh, did you see the thing where the person was cleaning the, I think it was like a

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:44.240
 bus seat that was fucked up? So you know how like bus seats are like fabric, but they're always

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.200
 like some crazy ass pattern. Yeah. The crazy pattern is there because they're fucking disgusting.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:55.840
 Like he was pulling out a bucket of dirt out of the bus seat. Oh, that's good. And people like fall

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.920
 asleep on that with a fucking mouth and eyes on it and shit. Yeah. So if you're on public,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.480
 don't sit down. That's what I've learned. I've seen a lot of videos on buses to show

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:11.120
 all these things happening and I don't like it. I mean, I've never really taken a bus.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.840
 I mean, I took it in New York sometimes. People thrown up shitting, pissing. Have you ever been

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.080
 have you ever been in like the back of an Uber where you like could tell that like, you know,

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:27.280
 there was some partying going on prior? Yes. Yes. We've, I think we've all been there.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.360
 I'm like, did somebody puke in this fucking car? Oh, I definitely puked out of a lot of

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.840
 Ubers. I feel like I've always made it to like pull a window open or pull the door open.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:44.800
 It's a, it's a good sweaty looking hair tie in the floor. Oh, man.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:52.240
 I saw, I saw you were saying the weather was good by you. You were doing some outside stuff.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.720
 Well, the, the, uh, the weekend was lovely. It was unbelievable. It was like 65 degrees.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.920
 I mean, it's been like like 22 degrees. Yeah. So when it's like 65 degrees and like,

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:06.560
 it's like that like nourishing sun, you know, like, like I don't know. This time of year,

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.800
 like the sun gets brighter. Like it wasn't as brighter. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Um,

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.080
 and like now it's just like bright as shit and like you can like sit there and it's like 65

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.720
 degrees out, but it feels like 75 because you're getting kind of toasted if you're in direct sunlight.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:24.560
 So when that happens, you know, like if it was in the middle of summer, 65 degrees, I'd be like,

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.440
 I'll give me a hoodie. But like now 65 degrees. I'm like, oh man, I was like, I'm gonna go out here

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:35.360
 shirtless and make hamburgers. And that is a thing though. Like I remember, because I went

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:40.880
 living in the Northeast, uh, when it would get a little cold in like September, I'd be like freezing

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:46.320
 my ass off and I wear a sweater. Same temperature in March. I'm like in shorts without a shirt on.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.920
 And it feels fucking amazing. Yeah, fucking cowabunga.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:56.720
 Kim, do you have a, an egg shaped grill? No, I actually don't. And I actually have like a

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:02.080
 a portfolio of grills. If you go out of my deck right now, there's, there's three or four grills

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:08.640
 in a row. Wow. Like the pellet smoker, the, the gas weber, the flat top blackstone. I think

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:14.320
 there's a, yeah, I have like a, uh, uh, like a charcoal. It's a funny grill. It's like a little

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:19.200
 charcoal grill, like a apparently some kind of like Japanese kabob grill or some shit, but uh,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.480
 it's, it's paid by supreme or at least in collaboration with supreme.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.840
 I was like, oh, I'm like, uh, you know who got it? Eric Lewis. Eric Lewis was like,

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.440
 I just got the supreme grill and I'm like, I'm like, I must have it when I like stock X.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:40.640
 You got this stuff. We got our stock X. Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. I even bought it after market.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:45.600
 What is stock X? I've never heard of stock X. It's like if there's like popular sneakers

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.440
 that like sold out and you want to buy them for double the price, you go on stock X.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.120
 Oh, okay. You don't get the initial drop. Yeah. Okay.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.480
 Yeah. They're a hot start up for a while. I know a few people that work there. I think they're in

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:01.680
 New York maybe. Uh, which one of your girls do you use the most? What's your go to?

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:08.560
 That's hard to say. Probably the webber right now. Yeah. Um, but it's, it's different things,

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.720
 right? Like if I'm going to make smash burgers, I'll do it on the, um, the flat top.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.760
 A lot of breakfast on the, on the flat top. Um, one thing that I do

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.360
 hilariously on the flat top is hibachi. Oh, did you do all the tricks?

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:29.200
 I'm okay now. Like, so I got it. Like I got it. Like I was like, oh, this is like,

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.400
 this is like a hibachi thing. So I have to do about you. So I did like private hibachi

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.880
 with like my immediate family. Um, and then my wife's sister found out about this

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.200
 and said that, oh, you like, you have to cook hibachi for everybody. It's like an endless summer.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:47.200
 So they go and they get me like the hibachi hat. Oh, uh, headband.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:53.200
 Like, uh, the whole, the whole setup, even like the little dude who pisses out the,

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:59.840
 the onion volcano, the shorts come out. So like I have, I have, I have all the paraphernalia.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:05.760
 Like if you, if you were there to witness it, it was unbelievable. Cause like made like,

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:13.520
 like canonical hibachi, but like was shit faced the entire time. Like, I think I drank like

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:20.560
 two or three bottles of sake while cooking it. And I had like traditional Japanese music playing

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:26.640
 way, way too loud on the outdoor speakers. It was like a real, it was just a real event.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:31.680
 It was pretty funny. I haven't, I don't think I've met anyone that can drink like you.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.800
 Cause the last time we hung out, so Ken showed up and he already drank like six old fashions

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.200
 or something crazy. Uh, I couldn't even tell that he were drunk. I think he had like three or four

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.840
 more again at the place. And I was like, I think if I had three or four, I'd be like knocked out

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.960
 a lot of practice. I'm like, all right, I'm going to go hit the hotel jam. We'll see you later.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:56.800
 And you wake up early too, right? I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think today was five.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:02.720
 Yeah. Do you go to bed early? Like what, what is, I don't imagine you go to bed early.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:07.680
 It's, it depends, right? Like, usually it's like an 11 30 type thing.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:12.000
 11 30 to five. But it can go as far as three. It can go as early as 10.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.360
 You still get up early when you stay up late? Yeah. Oh, that's the, that's the funniest part.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:23.280
 Is that no matter how late I go to bed, I still wake up at the same time.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.360
 Yeah. I know that feeling. Yeah. So I can like be out till three and like wake up five and I'm like,

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:35.280
 well, fuck here we go. Still drunk. Yeah, like all like wake up and like vape a little like go like

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:42.400
 drink like hotel, faucet, water. I'm like, ah, do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.400
 You know, like when you've drank all the water bottles in the hotel room and it's next morning,

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.560
 like they haven't before I should give you enough to sit there and like cup and faucet water in your

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:57.120
 mouth. Like this is like a such a problem in hotels. Like I feel like I'm always like,

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.360
 you think a hotel gives you like figures of the war situation for you, but they never do.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:07.520
 I just insta cart. No, I insta cart big packages of water to the hotel. Yeah.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.760
 Is that not a thing people do? I always have like tons of fries that you said that,

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.520
 but that was literally never crossed my mind in my whole life. I mean, I travel like three times a

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:21.440
 year. So I'm not going to like not have water when I'm away. It really depends on the hotel.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.600
 Like there's like this really nice hotel in Chicago that I used to stay in, where like

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:31.600
 every night before bed they would put on like opera on this Bose thing. So like you walk in and like

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:37.440
 opera is playing in your room and yeah, yeah. And there's like they had like branded like milk

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:43.600
 cartons of water that were really, really cute. And like they'd have like a water for you and like

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:48.480
 the slippers like on like a folded towel on the ground. Right. And it's a funny thing because I

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.160
 would slay the water and like I can't tell you how many times I walked in like shitface and then

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.920
 woke up in the morning and the opera is still playing. I never turned out to turn it off.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.440
 That and like, do you know when you walk in a hotel room and it's like the introductory

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:14.880
 fucking like it's like, it's like, it's like welcome mister. I'm a TV. I never shut the shit off.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:21.760
 I don't I don't really watch TV. So like never. I just fall asleep and I wake up and I should

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:31.360
 still go. That's funny. Yeah. Yeah. It's a weird thing. Like I like, I know some people will go

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.040
 and they'll watch TV, but I don't. I just like fuck around on my phone. Oh, yeah. I mean,

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.800
 does anyone even use a TV today's in the hotel? Like what's a point? Some people do. Some people

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:45.040
 watch TV. Do people still buy porn on TV? Like that one I never understood. Like, is that still

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:52.720
 thing people do? It's still a thing that you can do. Well, I stayed at a hotel the other day or like

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:58.080
 a couple months ago. And that was like so prominently featured as a feature of this TV. And I was like,

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:04.880
 who is still doing this in like 2024? It's expensive. It's like 20 something bucks expensive. I did it

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:10.240
 once in Atlantic City. And it was more of like a joke thing. Yeah. Was it worth it? I was like,

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:22.160
 dare my wife? It wouldn't know. No, no, it's not like a like a solo thing. Like, how do you not have

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:28.480
 access to this? Yeah, your phone. Exactly. I just doesn't make any sense. It's just like the wrong.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:34.240
 It's like a commercial category, you know? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, even if you want to pay,

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:39.360
 this election is gonna be better on your phone. So I don't get it infinitely better. There's

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:44.400
 and there's some like hotels here. Like it's more motels. It's still like advertised that as like

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:50.160
 a feature of the hotel, like on their front signs are like what? Motel. Adult films,

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:56.880
 exclamation point. Yeah, dude. I mean, it is Miami. So a little different. Speaking of when

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:04.000
 you're moving here, I don't know. I'd like to. You know, that's that's largely rates dependent.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.360
 Yeah. I know. We're all traps right now. Mm hmm. Rates and price. And I'm like,

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.960
 fuck, dude, I'm gonna have to live in this place. I mean, these worst places to live. But

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:19.120
 I'm like, stuck in New Jersey for us in my life. I lived in a five mile radius for 38 years so far.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:26.320
 So it's not like devastating, but yeah, Adam's in the same thing, right? Yeah. I mean, well,

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:30.720
 we moved like two hours away. I've been the Ozarks my whole life. Adam's lived in Florida for a year.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:36.480
 Oh, I didn't. I lived in Naples. Yeah. How'd that go? It was good. I mean, Naples is different

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.320
 than Miami. I don't know if you're aware, but it's, you know, I know. Very old people,

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:46.320
 which is our speed. We brought the Ozarks to Florida. It was nice. I remember I was asking

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.680
 you and you told me about the Ozarks. I was like, oh, man, that's like, that must be amazing. You

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.040
 like go out on like boats and go fishing and you're, and you're, and you're, it's the funniest

00:35:53.040 --> 00:36:00.240
 fucking thing you can go to. No, I'm a bit of an endorsement. I was like, dude, that's the funniest

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.160
 thing I've ever heard my entire life. I've never gotten hunting like all my friends growing up,

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.880
 like got out of school to go deer hunting. I've literally never, never been in the woods and hunted

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.520
 an animal and I live in like the capital of it in the world. Oh, it's like the best. I had deer

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:19.040
 soup for lunch. I saw you like that venison stew for the week. That look good. Yep. Yeah,

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.200
 it was tasty. Did you kill the deer or did you like buy it at the store? Yeah. Wow. Just like

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:29.040
 went out in the woods in New Jersey and shot it. New Jersey's got a lot of. Wow. Really? I just

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.800
 think of the population of deer. Yeah, it's a problem. Doing so is actually like a conservationist. Yeah,

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:44.480
 serve. Yeah. Yeah. I encourage it. You're managing the habitat capacity. I just don't imagine woods.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.640
 Like, are you close to New York or not so much? Here's the thing about New Jersey and a lot of

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:56.000
 these places, right? Is that along the edge, right? Like the ocean? Yeah. Right? It's all,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.520
 it's very built up. Yeah. Right? But like you go like one or two towns back and it's like

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:07.680
 extremely wooded. Okay. So there's actually a lot of like, like woods. Yeah. I guess I've never

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.360
 been to any part of New Jersey that's not connected to New York City. Yeah. Well, that's

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:15.200
 the thing. Like you have no more Jersey, right? And that goes actually in a little bit farther.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:21.520
 But down by me, I mean, you go like one or two towns back and you are just in the woods. Yeah.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:27.280
 I mean, it's called the Garden State and the place where I'm from is, it's like almost rural.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.800
 Like it's built up a little bit now because all like a bunch of suburbs got put in there. But

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:35.440
 if you're driving along the road, like you think you're in like a rural area,

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:40.400
 so New Jersey is small, but it's actually pretty beautiful in some parts minus the parts that are

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:46.400
 like spewing out of New York. Like everything else is pretty nice. It's interesting because

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:52.960
 there's a lot of variety in such a small space. You know, like like down like where I grew up,

00:37:52.960 --> 00:38:02.480
 it's like it's like Laguna Beach. Everyone's like surfing and like up north and it's a funny

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:10.720
 thing that happens because like most cities are contained by their state. Whereas New York City

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:21.040
 is like at the absolute dick tip of New York State and like the sprawl like when you would like

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:26.400
 look at like Greater Atlanta, right? Like you know, you have like all these townships that are like

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:33.200
 still Georgia and they're like Greater like Greater New York is is like mostly New Jersey and like

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.720
 Connecticut and then like you get like like Westchester and stuff like that. But it's funny to me

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:43.680
 that like everybody in New York is like fucking New Jersey, you know, from New York to right like

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:49.680
 literally half of the New York metropolitan areas in fucking New Jersey, including the Statue

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:54.480
 of Liberty. You're from fucking Ohio fucking moved here two years ago. Shut the fuck up.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.520
 It's unbelievable.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:06.320
 Yeah, that's very accurate. That's that's the vibe. I mean, yeah, Ken described it once as

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:11.520
 mid-westerners work. Yeah, like half New York. It's super accurate. It's crazy accurate. It's

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:16.000
 like a checklist on like they got to live in New York for two years before they leave and they go

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.400
 there and then yeah, it's like you see that all the time. They go there and buy some expensive

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:28.400
 boots start putting down New Jersey. New Jersey is great. I feel like more people should consider

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:34.400
 it as a bad rep because of the butt of every joke, but honestly like it's some pretty good spots.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.880
 It's a little expensive and it had over legislated. Yeah, it is. In my opinion.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:45.120
 However, like there is a lot going on. I think that was code for something,

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:49.360
 but I didn't get it. No, no, it's not code for anything. You know, there's like a variety of

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:54.560
 things to do. There's all kinds of shit going on. A lot of different, you know, like if you go like

00:39:54.560 --> 00:40:01.360
 Northwest, it's like woods and mountains and shit. And if you go like all the way down south,

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.880
 it's like the word of shit.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:09.280
 Are you sure you have the pineberries? I have been to South Jersey like twice.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:17.200
 Yeah, yeah, that could really, really interesting. There's like dudes like like NASCAR jackets on

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:25.040
 and you're like fuck, he's going like yeah, it's wild. It's a it's a really diverse. I mean,

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:29.200
 the people too super diverse. Like you'll run to every kind of person, which means there's like

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:35.280
 every kind of food also, which is I took that for granted. Like whenever whenever I meet people

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:39.280
 from anywhere else, like they just don't know about certain kinds of food. Like my wife didn't

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.720
 have Indian food until she was like 24 or something. And it's like wild to me. It's the best. It's

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:50.160
 unbelievable. I word. Yeah, I can't believe you have Indian food in by you, Adam, right? You said

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.280
 there's a place you're not supposed to wear shoes and you're not supposed to wear shoes in Indian

00:40:53.280 --> 00:41:01.760
 place. I don't yeah, but you know what? I don't think you know how hard like Indian food and

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:07.680
 Edison, New Jersey goes. It's like getting pizza. It's like it's kind of like getting pizza in the

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:13.200
 rest of the country. Yeah, right? Like if you get like pizza outside of the Northeast and you know,

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:18.880
 okay, Chicago, I hear you, but you know, you get like outside of there, right? Like the pizza is

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:24.240
 like, you know, I'm sure pizza is delicious and it's good, but it's not the same. If you're out in

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:29.040
 like like Edison, there's like levels to the shit Jersey City, right? Like it's not just,

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.920
 it's not just like the one kind of Indian or the one good grade of Indian with the red and green

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.640
 salt, right? I don't really eat. I don't really eat Indian food here in the Ozarks. I guess it's

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:43.760
 just when I travel and we make some stuff, but it's not, I'm sure it's not what Dax could make

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:51.040
 or his family could make. I don't know. I can't make shit. No, no, no, I can't make shit. My mom,

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.840
 though, my mom is an amazing cook. I think you've talked about it before. It sounds so good. Yeah,

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:04.880
 so it's funny that Ken brought Edison. Let me pull up. You know, she would not mind dropping

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.680
 some shit off, I'm sure. I was just trying to go over there, but yeah, no, no, no, I'm coordinating

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:18.240
 this very specifically. Yeah, Adam, you don't understand when Kansas Edison, New Jersey, like,

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:24.800
 if you go there, you will think you're in India. So I moved to New Jersey, like, I guess it was like

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:31.440
 30 or 25 years ago, something like that. And it was kind of Indian back then, but now it's just like,

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:35.440
 it's just every person you see is Indian, every business is like an Indian business.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:40.320
 Like it is insane. And it's like spreading from there. It's like, like, like street signs,

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:47.040
 like Gandhi street. And that happened so quick. It was like the last three decades, I would say.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.640
 And then there's like specialty supermarkets where you can get shit that you like can't get.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.120
 Yeah. Yeah. Like, I know there's like the, there's an Asian supermarket, you can get like durians there and

00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:00.160
 shit. Oh, yeah. Those are the smelly ones, right? All kinds of like wild import shit.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:04.160
 Yeah. Yeah. The forbidden ingredients.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:10.800
 Well, you know, it was a trip was the, the bats temple. Did you see when I posted about that?

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:15.120
 I saw it. I saw it. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not right. So like, apparently, like,

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:20.160
 one of the largest Hindu temples, like, I don't know, like second or third largest in the world or

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:25.920
 something they built, not even in that part of New Jersey. And like, in like the woods part of

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.280
 near like, I was out at like there's like this like sculpture garden, right? We can go to this,

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.240
 like French restaurant and get all tipsy off champagne and then walk around like a sculpture

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:37.040
 garden. And it's fucking sick. So we do that from time to time. And we're like leaving and

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.880
 we're like kind of shit face, right? And I mean, not like shit face, but we're buzzy.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:46.000
 And my wife's like, Oh, do you want to that? That that temple's by here. You want to go check that

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.400
 out? Because like you hear like they imported like fucking like a billion dollars worth like

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.280
 forever marble to build it and shit, right? You're really whatever. So like we were like,

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.720
 yeah, let's check it out. We like pull up and it's like the crazy shit you've ever seen in your entire

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:03.040
 life. The crazy. It's insane. There's a tweet. I was like, I don't know how this I don't know

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.200
 how this is going to go, right? Like I'm going to walk in here and like, you know, I don't know.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.880
 But I walked up and they were like, mad, cool, right? They're like, they're like, Hey, check this

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:24.800
 shit out. They're like fucking sick, right? And I'm like, I don't even think it worked there.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:34.080
 Yeah, this what I like about in India, honestly, I think there's like a section of every race that's

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.280
 like this where they like come up to you and they're like, I don't care what you look like.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.800
 Like you don't care what I look like, just show me how this shit works. Like show me

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.480
 what's going on. That's like what any people are like. And it's that's great.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:49.360
 Yeah, it was it was nuts. I had the the meta glasses on. So like, I just walk through there and I was

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:55.360
 like taking pictures of shit. And it's like a movie. It's a crazy. It's like, you know how you go

00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:00.000
 like Disney and like they like recreate like Paris and like you walk through there and you're like,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.320
 Oh, wow, right? Like, like, it's like that. But it's like real, not like made out of styrofoam.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:14.960
 Yeah, you should you should look it up Adam. Just it's be there. Yeah, there's a tweet or something.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:19.440
 PS temple, New Jersey, just Google image it. It's like it's outrageous. It's a kind of thing you

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:23.440
 expect to see in other countries from like a thousand years ago or something and they built it

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:27.520
 in the last like 10 years. Whoa, it's like the most well built thing in New Jersey currently.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:36.240
 That's insane. So it's like a whole city. It's like a whole complex kind of thing. And they have like,

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:42.080
 they have like restaurants, stores, yeah, it looks like multiple buildings, community center kind of

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:47.840
 thing, movie theaters by volunteers, 12,000 volunteers. No, no, no, no. Okay, so there was a

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:53.040
 little bit of a scandal. That's where it gets a little scandal with it where they were charged

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:58.640
 with like straight up slavery or something insane like that because I brought over a bunch of people

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:03.280
 from India to work on it. And the people were claiming that they were like physically trapped

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.200
 in the facility, like in the place where they were building it and they were being paid like

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.440
 $1 a day or something insane. There were allegations of exploitation. Yeah,

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.960
 I think it ended up, I don't know, I got like smooth over where like it wasn't really that,

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.800
 but I don't know who knows what's going on. But yeah, man, you're going to build something that

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.280
 crazy. So surprising, some fucked up shit is going on. It's amazing. Yeah, we're going to have to put

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.560
 pictures on the show notes or something. This is insane. Have you guys ever used chat GPT voice?

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.200
 I use it all the time. I got a shortcut button for it on my phone goes right to it.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:38.000
 Yeah, it's just like as I'm leaving there, I'm like, wow, that was really something,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.800
 right? Like I have like a 40 minute drive in my house, right? So like popped open chat GPT voice

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:48.000
 and I'm like, hey, like what's what's like that whole particular sect all about? Like what's

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.560
 what's the story here? You know, I want to know more. And it was so cool. I was like,

00:46:52.560 --> 00:47:00.160
 it like gave me like 20 minutes of material. And it's funny because it like stops and it's like,

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:12.080
 um, well, it's not like a robot voice necessarily like it'll do like those like transition noises

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:20.800
 in speech, which is it makes it oddly fluid. Yeah, considered like using it for Wikipedia

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:26.240
 style, like just like a podcast because chat GPT is super verbose. And that's the thing that

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:30.720
 drives me nuts using it for like work stuff. But if it's like, I'm in the car and I just want to

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.960
 listen to something and having it like read me about something I want to know about, that's

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.880
 that's an interesting use case. I like it. How the fuck do grain mills work? And you just

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:46.640
 I did exactly they if I'm alone in the car, I just like pick some random thing that I want to

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.320
 like, I've always had a question about it. I don't know how to do it. I just talk back and forth to

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.640
 it. And it sounds so realistic. Like this is like true from the future. I was doing a

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:59.840
 because I just moved to have to go patch up all the holes I made in the other house. So I was like,

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:03.200
 just having a conversation about learning how to do it. And I feel like I can show you how to go

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:08.400
 do it now. I asked every question that I possibly had. It's a it's great. Yeah, it's it's back

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:15.040
 all time home, boy. Yes. So many techniques, though, there's so many different options.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:19.040
 So you got to go like mesh and everything. I don't think I made any holes that big, but I got to see

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.640
 the mesh is cool. That's like a cool technique. Like who came up with all this shit? There's like

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:27.200
 eight different ways you can patch a hole. It's wild. So when we were, you know,

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:35.120
 done in a 20 year old degenerates, we rented this house and oh man, we used to like skateboard

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:40.400
 in the living room, like go from the kitchen, ollie up onto a table and that kind of thing. And

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:44.640
 then I, you know, constantly like punching and things like that. So they were like huge holes

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:51.120
 in the wall all the time. And we figured out that you could actually use spackle and fix it with an

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:59.600
 empty 30 pack cardboard. You just put on the inside of the wall and then like spackle over it.

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.800
 You put on the outside of the wall and then outside and then just sand it a little.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.920
 It wasn't some fucking immaculate wall to begin with.

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:13.200
 You can see like the taping and everything like that, but he provided the structure required

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:23.280
 for the spackle tank, sanded a little do a color match on the paint. Speaking the car,

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.480
 there's really funny thing happened this morning. I'm going to drop my kids off this morning.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.240
 I told them I was going to pull up in style. So I played in sync by, by, by. I'm going to like

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:37.680
 flip the fuck out. Like, like bad, like trying to get me to turn it off. Like, yeah, like embarrassed.

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:44.480
 And I'm like, I'm like, wow, I'm like, how can you be so irrationally angry over the arguably best

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:52.000
 boy band of all time? I say that because, you know, there are battery boy camps out there who,

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 you know, are just itching to disagree passionately. I was a battery boys guy when I was growing up.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.080
 I didn't like to think as much. I knew, but I could tell that like I was wrong. I could tell

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:12.800
 that everybody else was. I was in like the minority side. Yeah. Yeah. Speaking of battery boys, when

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.400
 is that Kanye song going to get released? Is it one of those things that's never going to come

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:22.320
 out? I think it's on this. It's scheduled for the next one. But I do too. I think it's.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:28.000
 Yeah. I mean, I don't know with him, right? That's like, apparently they were going to be like three

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.960
 albums and it was going to be like the eighth of each month or some shit. Like for three months straight.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:36.400
 Yeah. So it's like a three part. It's like, it's like,

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:44.480
 first vultures one versus two, but I was fucking shocked that it wasn't on regular vultures.

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.960
 Me too. I was like, seriously. What do you think of that album now?

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.480
 I mean, I don't know. I really like it. I mean, it's okay, but it's not like

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:55.920
 like a Pablo caliber. Yeah. I didn't like it initially, but I just kept playing on loop.

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.280
 And now I'm super into it. I was like, wasn't doing it a bunch of times.

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:03.840
 I like it. I'm just not super into it. It's hard to accept that maybe the peak has happened.

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:08.960
 I think everybody's going to fix that. That's going to be that's going to be such a summer banger.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:14.000
 That's true. When that drops. Yeah. Can you imagine me like fucked up in a hot tub?

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:24.960
 It's like, oh, you set you up. Yeah. Slam two white clothes together.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:34.960
 Well, I was like, it's 9 a.m. Your kids even listen to music. Are they into that yet?

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.800
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They listen. They listen to a lot of different music.

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.920
 You know what they listen to? They listen to like the background music for their TikTok.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.760
 Oh, yeah. So like, whatever is, whatever is another TikTok they're into.

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.560
 They go and find the song and that's like there. That's how they find music now?

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:54.400
 Yeah. They're like, it's all the soundtracks, all the shit, right? So like, the one is like really

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:59.040
 into like the Stranger Things soundtrack, which is hilarious. It's like a hilarious way to like

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:07.120
 sideload classic rock. And then like the other one is like really into Barbie. So like that whole,

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:11.120
 I don't know what you would call that music. Was that a, wait, the Barbie soundtrack?

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:15.360
 Like the movie for the movie. Yeah, there's a Barbie soundtrack. So I have a record player

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.040
 in my living room. You know, like one of those ones that has like the speaker built into it.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:24.880
 So it doesn't really bump, right? It just kind of like plays it at like a very casual level.

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:28.240
 So like when they, when they're into music, what I'll do is I'll get, we'll get the records.

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.400
 So we have like a variety of records of, you know, absolutely classic stuff.

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.680
 Then we have like some, some more recent things, right? That shouldn't even be on records,

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:40.080
 but they are like Stranger Things soundtrack. You're the Barbie soundtrack.

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:45.920
 One funny thing. That stuff on vinyl. That's awesome. So me and my wife went to a Snoop Dogg concert

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:52.880
 and it was fucking awesome. But like there, we ended, we said, oh, we gotta get something for

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:57.120
 the kids, right? So we went and got like this, some like Snoop Dogg merch, right? So it was like,

00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:04.960
 this like Snoop hoodie and like saw some other shit, right? And then my oldest order got like

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:12.320
 into Snoop. So now she has the doggy style vinyl. She thinks Snoop is hilarious. We had Snoop on

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:20.400
 the Snoop. She has like a, she has a Snoop poster in her room. But it's hard with the merch.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:24.160
 That's how you gotta like, it started with the merch, concept it. Yeah. And you can't just show

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:29.760
 them music, right? You need to show them like why it's cool. And then they're like, fuck it. I'll do

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:37.040
 the music. I'll take it. Okay, I have a clarifying question. Is Snoop on the, on the stoop? Is that

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:41.280
 like elf on the shelf? It's that kind of thing? Like you put him, you just like set him on the

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.720
 mantel or something. What do you do with him? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Same kind of thing. Yep. And you

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:49.760
 see like watching over them and like, is there some story you tell them? No, they're the kids older.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:56.640
 Yeah. Yeah. So I say that Snoop on the stoop watches them. And if they're bad or bad enough

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.960
 that he's going to, he's going to call some, some lokes to pull up.

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:08.080
 Actually, Snoop does Snoop kind of just chills for the most part. He's not like, I don't, you know,

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:13.440
 out of respect for Snoop, go and put him in all these elf situations. The other elves, right?

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:19.040
 It's like, it's like, oh, look, look, he fucking, you know, is tied to a candy cane on a ceiling fan.

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:28.320
 We don't do that with Snoop. I feel like Snoop's everywhere because he did that thing with Martha

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:34.800
 Stewart. Yeah. I remember there was a Jeep. This is a long time ago for all this AI voice stuff

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:41.760
 came out, but he did a voice for your GPS. And he would say shit like, that's also go round and

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:47.600
 round the round about round and round the round about. But yeah, he like, he like does everything.

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:51.280
 He like, merchandizes the fuck out of himself. I always wanted that. I wanted like 50 cent.

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:55.120
 And you know, like, did you ever play the 50 cent video games? Yeah, dude, those are crazy.

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:58.480
 Blood in the sand. Well, I was like, the funniest shit that he would say. He was like,

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:04.400
 hey, man, watch the fuck out. Like, usually don't get that video game. Like, that would be so funny

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:12.240
 for GPS. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that'd be great. I mean, now with AI, like, we could probably have

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:17.920
 whatever we want. Those video games were insane. I think the entire premise, like he did a show

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.160
 and like some unspecified Middle Eastern country where they shorted him.

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:31.360
 He's going to commit murder over it. He tries to pay him with like a jeweled skull,

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:38.400
 which is then taken away by like a third party, who like, he's got to go get the skull from,

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:43.920
 but like, they, they run the area. And then yeah, there's like trash cans on fire and he's doing

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.400
 like front flips, like shooting dudes with like the tally ban outfits. You're like, what the fuck is

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:54.720
 going on here? 50 cent blood in the sand. I was like, oh, man, dude, this is like, I swear

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.040
 it. She was like, I can't tell if it's nostalgia, but I feel like stuff was just more fun back then.

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:03.680
 You just get like all this like really weird, wild shit. And I feel like you don't get that

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.800
 as much anymore. I feel like they're, they're, they're a little bit more decisive about what

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:10.640
 they put out. Is there anything more calculated? Yeah, for sure. Like that, that would never have

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:17.440
 gotten past all the layers that exist today. Yeah, not today. Yeah. You know, speaking of pretty

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:25.920
 sense, I was probably late to rap music, but I still remember into club was a first like rap song

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:32.080
 I ever heard. And I was like, holy shit, like what is this? I had never heard anything like that.

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:37.280
 Your first exposure to rap? I think so from like, I like have a memory of being like,

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:43.760
 Oh, well, yeah, you're like 32, right? Yeah. So into club, I think maybe I was like nine or

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.880
 something. I was in like high school. I'd say with me, I don't even know what the hell he was saying. I

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:52.080
 was like, I think the lyric is like sip Bacardi in the club. I thought that was all one word. I

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:57.120
 thought he was just saying some like, I gave it some kind of meaning. It's funny when you go back

00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:01.760
 and like the lyric is something completely different. You just heard it wrong. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:05.760
 it's a kid like I even if I knew the lyrics, like I didn't know they have to sip Bacardi in the club

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:14.800
 and stuff. I mean, Ken might have at that age, but I didn't. Hey, this is Chris, podcast editor,

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.080
 just letting you know the conversation with Ken Wheeler will continue in the next episode.

00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:23.040
 Here's a little tease of that conversation continued with Ken Wheeler. So what is the answer?

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.720
 Somebody has the answer, right? Somebody's looking out for this. What are you going to adapt to?

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:32.880
 You can adapt to become a plumber. Nobody has money to pay plumbers. And now you have 100 million

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:47.840
 new plumbers that just entered like, yeah, oh, that's going to go awesome for plumbers.
