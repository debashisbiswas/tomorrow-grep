WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 this is weird man this is weird to be like right next to you i know uh so we're in the same room

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.240
 we're in the hotel room this is the very biggest it's a very special episode of tomorrow.fm

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.560
 it's special but it's also like maybe the loosest definition of what this episode is going to be

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.640
 about that we've had because it's like we could talk about stuff that's happening every

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.840
 event we don't really want to do that and there's lots of people doing that so we're going to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.760
 just talk about it's our first tech conference but the first episode of this we were booking

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.520
 sessions for this yeah and we talked about how the first tech conference we've ever been at

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.840
 yeah so we're here yeah it's a sequel yeah so we it's almost over we're flying out tomorrow

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.400
 you're leaving tomorrow right yeah i'm leaving at noon okay i'm playing at like five a.m yeah and

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.320
 that's maybe my first subject would be like going to a tech conference and the physical implications

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.640
 of that yeah how do you feel physically right now actually pretty good oh good i slept like 10

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.280
 hours last night i got last night i went to bed at 7 p.m. pacific your your east coast times you actually

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.760
 have had even worse than me all week yeah but did you just like go to bed on time did you do something

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.760
 that i did not do i've been this way my whole life i just leave like a rock no matter where i am

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.000
 see my wife would tell you i'm a really good sleeper or at least i follow sleep really easily

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.280
 all the time but this whole week i can't follow sleep i can't stay asleep yeah i don't i don't know

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.200
 why i took it so badly i feel like there's all these people from europe that came in people from

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.240
 australia they're like 20 hours behind their normal schedule and they all seem fine and i'm like

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.800
 dragging myself through the expo hall i don't know what i did wrong if i just i mean we talked about

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.080
 it we had some drinks i'm not even part of it uh i haven't done that in three years so that maybe

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.880
 that's it i haven't done anything like this yeah in three years i've i've gone to the grocery store

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.360
 and like been at home for three years straight i don't think i've like gone to a thing at all

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.360
 let alone a tech conference like this yeah sometimes my body's just completely unprepared i mean don't

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.800
 get me wrong i don't feel great okay yeah i think the thing that really threw me off was

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.280
 you think you're just gonna have a normal day but you're just you know meeting people and stuff

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.560
 but it's really hard to have anything close to a normal day like i was forgetting about my meals

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.720
 i was eating breakfast like i wasn't showering at the right time like it's really hard to keep up with

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.160
 anything normal while you're at a tech conference of this size or there's stuff pulling you in a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.440
 million directions and fitting in anything that you need just to stay alive is it's kind of hard yeah

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.880
 yeah yeah what's your what's your just like first impressions of tech conferences in general

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.800
 yeah i'm very surprised actually so i've like we said i've never been to one before

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.800
 and the reason i've been to one is i never saw the value i just thought it would be kind of bored

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.920
 the whole time and i didn't so i've never been to one i was surprised i ended up really liking it

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.480
 yeah and my one of my takeaways is oh i should be trying to do this as much as i possibly can and

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.320
 not because of any of the things you would expect out of tech conferences kind of it kind of caught

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.320
 me entirely off guard you know you think you go you listen to people talk and you know that's the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.040
 conference but really we didn't go to any sessions so me and Adam did not go to a single session the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.840
 whole time we were here all those things you saw us sign up for we just did not not do um we spend

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.840
 all their time just hanging out walking around um running into people that we only ever see online

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.360
 i'm just talking to them in person a lot of really cool people it's great to see people's

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.400
 personalities in real life uh it was just really fun like you know i haven't had this much social

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.400
 interaction in a very long time and to be able to do that with people that i already kind of know

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.600
 from online that are all interested in all the same things uh yeah it was a lot of fun yeah honestly

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.800
 for me i felt like the last few years and they've just been like an exaggerated version of my

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.800
 whole career which has always been remote always been from home but i feel like these last years

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.240
 have been like this incredible amount of isolation and just like building anxiety i've never felt so

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.040
 anxious on the internet or just in life i think so much of it's just that only having digital

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.800
 interaction honestly the thing i take away from this and i want to go home with is like

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.920
 i need to have more adult interaction i need to find a way for my wife to have more adult interaction

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.280
 it's just like i haven't done this and i mean i feel like my whole working career kind of overlaps

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.760
 with my adulthood and so much of it is lacked something about this like you said it's not the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.480
 tech conference stuff it's none of the actual content of it it's just like being around people

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.440
 who have interests that you have and just interacting with them in person i was always like the biggest

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.320
 advocate of like remote from home all that stuff and i still am but yeah i want to do this more and

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.160
 i didn't expect to come out of it being like because i don't like travel like i've definitely

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.320
 done that in the past i don't like a lot of the trappings of it and just the eating and all like

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.760
 like we talked about but just like something about the camaraderie and the hanging out with people

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.360
 i got to figure out how to do that living in the Ozarks and like for my wife somehow i know she

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.120
 would love that interaction it feels like something was missing like there's a void yeah and i i don't

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.520
 really consider myself a super social person i don't think you said that either so same thing

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.160
 i work remotely my whole life i didn't really feel like oh like this is a thing that i needed

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.320
 but even as someone that's not a very social person being here makes me realize wow like that

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.080
 is like a whole part of life that is just missing i don't think you noticed it that much when you

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.800
 don't have it but yeah it is they're just like something something not there and yeah figuring

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.040
 how to like get that in our lives more is definitely important it's i don't want to go too like deep

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.320
 and philosophical here but i do think i've heard people say it's like community it's like there's

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.680
 something in our society today just lacks something they had for all of humanity like all of societies

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.400
 have been built around this kind of like communal living not communal living but like

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.440
 this sense of community and belonging to something and while i felt like i had that like you said i

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.440
 didn't feel like i was missing it yeah the online nature of the you know tech community it is different

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.400
 it's different and i'll concede that yeah there is like some biological thing where some part of

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.720
 your brain is activated when you see someone in person and it's just not there when even through a

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.960
 video chat whatever it's not it's not there is it amazing to you how few people this is kind of

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.560
 shifting gears but how few people you actually recognize like when you see them and when you've

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.240
 only seen them in their avatar or whatever yeah like it actually takes a bit even people have

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.240
 interacted with a lot like i thought i really knew what they would look like it's just something

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.680
 about running into them in person is totally different yeah that's that was actually very

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.680
 hard i feel like next year before i come to the conference i need to like make a list of everyone

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.760
 and their avatar just like study it yeah we had so many awkward moments or someone would come up

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.240
 and we'd be like uh you look kind of familiar and then we look at their name tag their name tag

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.960
 would be facing the wrong way and then we look back at them and then we figured out but yeah

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.280
 it's uh people look different in 3d that they're convention really that's a lot yeah i got to say

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.680
 Corey clean didn't recognize me that that was kind of a little moment for me i just thought like

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.680
 we've interacted on the internet he's this big like it he doesn't i just thought i was gonna get

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.000
 i don't know even you've learned i don't handle rejection what uh maybe something you didn't see

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.800
 online yeah what about the conference itself like this one is a big one i think compared to other

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.080
 tech conferences like yeah what are things you've learned that you want to like take in next year

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.240
 yeah i think uh everyone said to us that if we've never been to a tech conference board this is a

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.760
 crazy one to start with because it is so big um i don't know if i can really put the words but i'll

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:38.720
 try uh biggest is a big place every hotel is way bigger than a hotel you've been at just a single

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:45.520
 hotel you can get lost in for hours and that's not even the whole conference big reinvent covers

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:51.760
 several hotels each one is gigantic there's people and despite that it's completely crowded it's

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.960
 like rivers of people going around really understood how big the AWS community is i think 60,000 people

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.440
 are here the number doesn't mean anything to us but when you see it in person it is it's not really

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.760
 really crazy the scale of it uh here is is insane and i don't think i don't know if there's any

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:12.640
 conferences this big at least in the tech world outside of that um yeah in terms of what i you know

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.240
 what what you should do at reinvent like we said like i said earlier um we definitely underestimated

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:24.640
 so the sessions are in different hotels and i think we book sessions not considering what hotels

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.160
 they were at and because there are different hotels you just don't want to leave like once you get

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.640
 to one hotel it is a complete journey to get to another one just to get to the exit in the current

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.000
 hotel you're in is a journey that's going to go on make it so parking a lot is hard um so we should

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.960
 have just booked sessions in the primary hotel which is the Venetian no essentially we didn't go to any

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.240
 of them uh but next year you know try to book them in the same same hotel you know where like do

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.640
 other tech conferences have the same kind of a setup where it's basically like there's a keynote

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.160
 and there's a bunch of sessions is that reinvent specific or is that yeah i think i think most are

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.640
 so much smaller they have like stages like they might have like two stages and there's yeah that's

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.040
 what i've seen on twitter yeah exactly they have somebody come up after the next person they just

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.680
 keep going through them yeah so this is unique it's like every room and every hallway this hotel

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.040
 has a session going on yeah in parallel like the whole way yeah it's overwhelming yeah but i might

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.880
 have popped into one if they were here at the Venetian and we could have just like hey that one sounds

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.760
 fun yeah but i'm not next year i don't know if i plan on even i guess there's an advantage to

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.880
 pre-booking even if you're not going to go because you could it's like optionality yeah but yeah i

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.960
 don't think we missed anything not going to sessions i feel like the meeting people the hanging out

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.240
 people yeah that was the thing yeah we the main thing is like find a place to park where you see

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.840
 people coming through pretty often and then just stay there and you end up running into everyone

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.200
 yeah that's what we did and it worked out really well uh what do you think about the expo uh it's

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.920
 a lot visually like it's kind of over what just you want to set the stage a little bit it's just like

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.640
 all these boots but i guess they probably do other tech conferences maybe on this scale just just

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:06.000
 it's like the biggest warehouse room you've ever seen massive yeah like to take you like 10 minutes

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.680
 a walk from one end to the other just walking pretty fast probably more than that to be honest

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:15.920
 and just packed with these boots and different size boots you know you know you're normal and

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.440
 the size is still pretty expensive i think we were talking to some of the people and they were

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:25.280
 saying the smallest boot you can get there which is like half of one side of a booth is 50k and we're

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.600
 talking like three feet wide four feet wide it's just a little kind of like place for a laptop yeah

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.240
 exactly the smallest thing you possibly get and then the biggest ones are like like a million yes

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.840
 for the booth um so it's a huge room with all these things and some companies go all out and have

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:45.520
 these crazy setups and with these lights and projectors and their logo and like these games and and

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.400
 all this crazy stuff yeah yeah there's a data dog slide that's on the expo but yeah it's like a slide

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.240
 going down a floor we still have which we didn't do no we didn't do that yeah i think i only had

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.680
 it open certain times yeah and there's always a line yeah it's just a lot of people i just haven't

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.880
 been around so many people maybe ever but definitely not in a long time it is surprising that despite

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.440
 how many people there are we were just running into people we recognize yeah like 60,000 people we

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:15.680
 probably knew like 50 of them and i think we found all of them and it wasn't that hard yeah that's

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.240
 something i'm ever saying to you pretty early in the conference is like all at the same time i didn't

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.320
 i couldn't have ever believed that the AWS community was this big or that there's that this many people

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.800
 that care because it's like there's just a fraction of the whole community the people who are willing

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.000
 to fly to vegas from wherever they live so it makes this AWS community feel so much bigger than i think

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.160
 it is what i'm hanging out on twitter but at the same time like that group that hangs out on twitter

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.600
 feels so much smaller than i realize like it's this weird dichotomy where i simultaneously feel like

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.080
 more people are interested in this thing than i realize and maybe like less people because of the

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.360
 niche the little thing we care about nativeish community is this every tiny or part of it right

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.560
 yeah yeah and you know they read the the zone we were hanging out in was the serverless zone but

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.520
 it wasn't even called the serverless zone it's called the modern application zone and it was combined

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.720
 with the Kubernetes stuff so it was yeah very small community um i guess this one makes it fun

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.800
 right we we know everyone in our space and yeah we all know what we're we're thinking about it

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:17.120
 talking about yeah yeah so you don't feel awful i feel really like physically i mean i'm definitely

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:24.240
 ready to go home like i have not showered correctly in a while i don't feel clean i feel like i'm

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.640
 like what a correct shower is i don't know i just like my shower to home and anywhere else i'm just

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:34.560
 like this is not a good shower i like everything at home and everything feels foreign the food

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:41.200
 the the shower the bed yeah all of it i sleep with it do you use it this is random do you care

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:47.200
 about this uh do you use like uh one of the bed coolers yeah i do an ooler no i use i have an eight

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.920
 sleep oh that's the one that's like built into the mattress right yeah well it's it's a cover that

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.880
 goes over the mattress okay but you buy the whole mattress from them right i got a crazy lucky situation

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:02.000
 someone in my building when i lived in new york uh had bought one and very quickly they had to get

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.400
 like a doctor prescribed mattress because that's a back issue so they sold it to me for five hundred

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.920
 dollars the whole setup and only cost like three grand yeah um but yeah it's very nice so yeah i do

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.480
 use one of those things makes it impossible to sleep in a hotel exactly i turn my down all the way

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.800
 i can use myself at night if you're used to that like cool to the touch all night and then you get

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.040
 in one of these just i sweat the whole thing yeah the bed is just i have to keep rolling the

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.920
 different sides of it to like find a cold spot yeah yeah we're princesses so i guess yeah yeah

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:38.480
 it's like a little extra uh what are your tips tips people coming to this uh well one i think just

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.880
 overall i do recommend it like i recommend coming to that if you've ever been on the fence and you're

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.680
 like and i know people haven't harder like having to fly from europe i can't pretend to say i know

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:54.720
 it's going to be worth it for you but for me coming in kind of skeptical like 100 worth coming and to

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.560
 your point like i would like to find more tech conferences to go to because we do have other interests

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:05.040
 that are not just AWS and reinvent so i definitely want to find other opportunities to travel to hang

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.520
 out with a bunch of like-minded people uh that's not really a tip just kind of like if you're on the

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.360
 fence in terms of tips for this because this is all i know about tech conferences uh i would have

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:21.120
 come more prepared i maybe i don't know like how i could fix the food situation it's like you're

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.200
 just eating out the entire time for a whole week here and i don't know i guess most tech conferences

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:31.360
 aren't a whole week that's kind of part of the problem yeah uh what can i do to make a sleep situation

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:38.160
 better i would just i would make myself i would come in with like a very strict schedule for myself

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:43.200
 like i'm always going to go to bed by this time and i would not deviate from that like i think i

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.800
 didn't realize somebody said it last night when i was like i could clearly visibly i was like exhausted

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:54.080
 at seven o'clock and i'm walking out of the hotel to go to the next one to go to bed and the guy said

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.760
 it's a marathon not a sprint and i would have like come in with that mentality that you got to make

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.920
 it through the whole week without physically being exhausted i didn't even walk that much i thought

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.160
 like everything i heard leading up to it people would have like 20 000 steps and it's like you walk

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.520
 constantly i guess those were people that are going to the other house yeah exactly we stood a lot we

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.800
 were standing the whole week so it's pretty sedentary yeah eight pretty terribly yeah and a lot of just

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.720
 self-control uh slept terribly and just didn't go to bed at good times so i would fix all those things

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.040
 and and that's my tip is like take care of your physical self so you can actually like make it through

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.720
 the whole congress without just being exhausted yeah i think another random thing bring chapstick

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.920
 yeah oh yeah it's so dry this is so dry there's so many people everyone's like coughing people are

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:42.000
 getting nosebleeds all of our lips are just chapped completely yeah yeah data dog was giving out uh

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.480
 day a dog been a chapstick which you know they've been here a bunch of times clearly they know they

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.640
 know what you need yeah that's like 3D chips right there they were they were prepared if they would

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:56.160
 have little lotion bottles i think that would have been the next move yeah uh on the coughing note how

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.200
 much i mean what do you think like 2022 now what is the percentage of us that are going home and

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.240
 taking covid well everyone says that and i fully expected this that we're gonna get some kind of

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.400
 you you go home and you're kind of sick i really don't want that to be the case like i've a lot of

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.600
 work i don't i don't want to be sick right now um but i think it's about to happen we'll see if we

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.160
 get lucky we're not gonna get it i'm convinced like the next whatever the next pandemic thing is

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.000
 is going to start here in attack conference yeah so if we get something it might be like the next

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 covid yeah i mean it had enough time and enough people at this place to mutate into something

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.560
 completely just it is really i tried to explain to my wife just like describe it visually just the

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.800
 number of people at all times like a river going both directions everywhere you are in this hotel

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.520
 every hallway is just completely packed you're like cattle which is really interesting too uh

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.800
 today the keynote Verner gave his keynote and they had like this whole slide and this whole thing

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.200
 on the big video display of all the birds like swarming around and talk about like did you see

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.680
 that yeah and i just i thought about it at the conference how humans are really good like we

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:03.520
 do somehow like move together really well yeah but yeah i don't know i think i will come back i

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.000
 think it's it's worth coming to i think i don't know what the next thing i guess react Miami you're

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.400
 gonna be yeah that was gonna be easier for me because i get to go home yeah that's in yeah you

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:18.640
 live in my life in my bed oh wow yeah okay i'm moving to vegas i'd be ready for an entry in that

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.400
 get the family accommated just out of my dear whole life around this one week yeah right

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:29.680
 are there any what time when is react Miami like if i want to come to that when it's in april

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.520
 oh i thought it was way sooner oh it's in mid april so you have time to tell if you want to go

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:39.360
 yeah um yeah but that it's like way i mean it's a whole week because it's uh it's not react my

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.240
 amazing whole week but there's a Miami tech week thing and a bunch of people come in for that there's

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.720
 a few different conferences going on at the same time and react Miami is actually inside of a

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.960
 bigger conference it's like a part of a bigger conference i think it's only let me just wonder

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.760
 one or two days uh it seems extremely well run i saw videos from last year oh that's another thing

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:04.480
 reinvent insanely well oh wow yeah they coordinate so much like every nook and cranny of vegas

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:09.520
 has something reinvent going on it's all super super well done whoever all the people doing

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.680
 logistics and coordination like i know that they're maybe gonna take a week off next week then they're

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.000
 back to planning the next work yeah yeah i can imagine not a work mistake it's insane actually

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.920
 amazon's really good at executing just in general yeah even though a lot of people move around within

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:29.120
 the AWS organization or they leave the company or whatever everything stays so stable with AWS

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.520
 products and like how they're not they don't break things it's all that like stuff that's in contrast

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.800
 to the other cloud providers and i have to think it's just like the amazon culture works yeah it

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.120
 trickles into things like conferences where you can just see they're very good at stuff and they

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:47.360
 just they execute very well it would take so much to coordinate this thing and to not have any

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.240
 major hiccups there was not a single i know they've done like 11 years but like not a single hiccup

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.960
 even at the smaller level like the individual boost way hang out like those are so well ran and

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.520
 just like taking care of things that you would think like that we wanted you know just like having

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.960
 a place to go hang out that's quiet and to get something to drink and eat and they're just thinking

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.320
 of everything it's a little level and at the big level yeah and they don't fully control everything

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.400
 they control what they do but they're coordinating all the vendors and all the guests and everything

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.480
 and just wrangling everyone throwing together that stuff is very hard i've done a little bit of that

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.280
 small scale and it is difficult yeah i do feel like going to other other tech conferences would

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.240
 not be as smooth as this would felt like if you're we're pretty spoiled yeah good first one to compare

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.720
 everything else do yeah except the bars all right you got anything else on this no i think we're good

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.480
 okay it was cool to do it in person this is nice yeah we'll just we'll just do this every time i'm

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.400
 gonna fly to your house yeah yeah for every episode we get on tonight oh i'll come down to Miami okay

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:48.400
 i'll bring the whole family all right did that end it no that last part oh wait no no 15 seconds

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:53.680
 we got 15 seconds till it's 20 minutes let's keep talking i can play some music for 15 seconds at

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:59.200
 the end but let's just keep talking i'm gonna come on this out and then it's gonna be like 19

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:09.600
 minutes and 12 seconds okay that's fine oh wait wait we did it okay nice yeah
