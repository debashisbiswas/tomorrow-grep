WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
 Ooh, say more. Say more words. What does that mean? I'm not following because I'm not smart.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:41.520
 Hey. Hey. What? I don't know. Are you tired? I am something. I am tired, yes, in the metaphorical

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.600
 sense, in the large scale sense, also the physical sense. I'm tired. I think you haven't been sleeping

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.320
 a lot. I wasn't, I wasn't sleeping a lot. I get these little bouts. I don't have to talk about

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.360
 on the podcast. I talk about ad nauseam on stream and probably Twitter. But I do get these like,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.760
 these little bouts of not sleeping, where I feel like I don't need sleep. Like, I literally just feel

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.400
 like, like four or five hours is fine. Six hours is like sleeping in. I go through that for like,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.880
 a couple weeks, and then I crash, sometimes, I mean, sometimes longer, sometimes a couple

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.640
 months, and then I crash really hard. And I go into like, sleeping a lot, not a lot, like,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.560
 seven and a half hours is a lot for me. And I will say the last couple of nights, seven and a half

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.800
 hours. So I'm doing a little better. But last night, the 4th of July, we stayed up late, fireworks,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.080
 all that stuff. So I slept in. The power was out all night right after literally right after the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.280
 fireworks show, and our neighborhood does like a little fireworks show. As we're driving home,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.600
 it starts raining, and then like this crazy thunderstorm. And like, I'm sure people were caught

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.000
 out. We were the first ones to leave. We got a four year old. I'm sure people were out there

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.320
 just standing on the sidewalk, getting drenched. I mean, it just started pouring and like crazy wind.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.440
 Our furniture on our porch is literally all on one side of the porch. I get got blown

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.680
 across the porch. I mean, like trees down all over the place, power was out all night.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.200
 So we've had some power outages since we had solar. We've never had to run all night on

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.440
 battery like that. But the air conditioning doesn't run when the solar is out. So it's just very hot.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.880
 Summer here is air conditioning. Like really, it just uses a lot of power to cleaning. Yeah.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.400
 So they left it off the solar circuit. It's like the only thing in our house that doesn't run

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.480
 on battery, which our battery lasts so long. Like we use like 10% of it for eight hours overnight.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.400
 I'm like, why not just put it all in there? You know what I mean? Let's just not sweat. I don't

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.360
 always turn off the AC, right? It's weird to like, yeah, like physically disconnect. They were,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.160
 yeah, they were really like not wanting to put it on this special circuit for the solar thing.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.840
 I don't know why. It's the amperages or something, something about electricity

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.440
 that I don't understand. Anyway, what was I talking about? I'm tired. Oh, sleep. Yeah. So I

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.480
 actually did sleep enough last night. I've been sleeping the last couple nights, two nights.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.640
 It's not the best. You said you slept late yesterday, but what does that mean for you?

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.440
 Like 11 p.m. Yesterday, like went to bed late last night. Yeah.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.960
 10 decks 10 p.m. was extremely late for me. We go to bed at 8 30. Okay. 10 p.m. would be going

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.560
 to bed like early for me. Yeah, I'm sure. Most most people, most normal people. That's another

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.000
 thing. I just have this sense that I'm not normal. You know what I mean? Like, no, you're not. Do you

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.640
 ever just feel like you don't belong in the society you live in? Like we're just so counter

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.080
 everything in our society. And I get that sense whenever I try and do something with other people.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.120
 Like last night we went to my parents' house and they like, they're eating, they eat late.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.440
 We don't eat late. I just feel like this like Ferrari. You eat later than grandparents.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.000
 It's earlier than grandparents. No, earlier than grandparents. That's really crazy. I know.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.880
 That is really crazy. Everything in my life is so hyper specific and so not the way people do

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.680
 things. And I feel like this like well-oiled machine that if it gets off by like a micro fraction of a

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.320
 deviation, everything collapses. Like if I go to bed an hour late, my life is ruined.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.240
 Why do I feel that way? Because that's how you set it up. Did I do that intentionally? I think

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.560
 semi intentionally and semi as a side effect of a bunch of other things. Well, could you please

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.640
 tell me what all the other things are? And I could start fixing it because I'm going insane.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:32.160
 Okay, so I have this really, really large grand analysis, but I've also been trying to be better

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.720
 about not like I've been trying to be better about is letting people live the way they do.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.760
 Yeah, but I'm invited. I want to live differently. Or I don't want to live differently. I want

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.320
 to stop feeling this way. And I feel ways. I have frustrations and they're bubbling over.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.560
 Yeah. So I mean, I know you're asking for it, but like I think the reason that I have been

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.840
 intentionally trying to be better about this is I spend like an inordinate amount of time like

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.680
 thinking about kind of stupid things, really, like for any topic that somebody has kind of

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.680
 thought of, I feel like I've spent 10 times as much time talking about it or thinking about it.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.480
 I feel like that too. I mean, about you. I feel like when you start talking about things,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.760
 I'm like, how have you spent so much time thinking about this thing? Because I've never thought

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.280
 about this thing. I literally will just sit and stare at a wall and just think about like

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.640
 stupid shit like this. And so whenever I get into these discussions, I end up sounding like

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.760
 overwhelmingly persuasive, but it kind of was like a unfair setup. You know, I've just been trying to

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.640
 like be a little bit more aware of that. I can still get into it, but could you give me

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.160
 yeah, get into it. I mean, I don't care at this point. I feel bad for the podcast listeners,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.200
 but I need this conversation. And this is when we have these conversations. So I'm sorry.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.000
 It's we'll talk about something. Just hang on. We'll talk about tech and coffee and whatever.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.200
 We'll talk about stuff. Just give us a bit. I just need a little mental health cleansing.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.320
 The reason we're doing the podcast early, by the way, I'm going to go to jujitsu. I need to like,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.440
 I need to wrestle. I need to like exert a lot of force. I haven't been doing a lot of like physical

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.600
 activity the last couple of weeks, just too busy. And when I do that, when I neglect that, it just

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.000
 gets bad. So anyway, that's why I'm doing it early. So continue. Okay. So let me, let me

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.880
 hear how to start. So I think what is not normal. And I want to say not normal. Because I think

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.640
 there's actually a lot of people that actually are on the same track as you, just like the very

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.960
 and very extremes. I wouldn't consider myself at all in like that same kind of space. But there

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:41.520
 are a lot of people. So I've observed this interesting thing where so you have like a hyper optimized

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.880
 life in a lot of ways, like you're always looking for different ways to push different

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.960
 dimensions of it. So understandably, you end up with a very brittle day to day, because like,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.360
 if it's so pushed to a certain space, like you said, one thing goes off, like, it's a delicate

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.000
 thing. It's like, yeah, they're driving F one car, right? Like if a tiny thing breaks up.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.440
 Yeah, that's why I said earlier, it's like, I feel like it's a Ferrari, like you put a little bit

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.960
 of the wrong kind of fuel in it, and it just everything blows up.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:15.040
 Yeah, exactly. But if you step back to where that all comes from, I think there's something

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.560
 really interesting. So I'm going to describe a scenario to you. Okay.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:30.320
 Imagine a person that believes in that there is a book that has truth in it. Okay, there's a

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.920
 fundamental truth about the world. They don't have the time say a Bible.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.360
 Sorry, it feels like I'm describing. Yeah, they don't have the time to

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:47.120
 deeply go into it. So they rely on an interpreter who is dedicated to interpreting

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:53.680
 this text. Okay. Okay. And they spend time with the interpreter to like understand

00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:00.720
 like the takeaways from it, daily rituals, what to do, what not to do, what to care about,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:07.920
 what goals, et cetera. And it helps them, you know, live their life. And it also helps them

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:15.040
 deal with like existential problems, like death or like life, just all the busy questions in life.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.160
 Yeah. And if I asked you what that sounds like, like you said,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.040
 sounds like the Bible, it sounds like religion. Is there anything else that you think that it

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.000
 sounds like? You're going to say like next year's or something? I don't know.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.000
 Well, do you think there's anything in your life that fits this pattern?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.720
 Like does that sound familiar from like my worldview? Like I'm describing the scenario of a person

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.240
 living like engaging with life in this way. I don't feel like I do, but do I? Tell me.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.880
 I think you you have. So when I describe this, everyone thinks, Oh, that's obviously religion.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.480
 There's another form of this that is one to one exactly the same. The internet or something?

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:00.080
 It's like your relationship with Huberman is actually exactly this. Huberman. Oh, I didn't even

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.280
 see this coming. I totally didn't see it. Listen, can I just say, do you even know that I don't listen

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.760
 to the Huberman podcast? Did you know that? It's an example. Okay. It's a general example. So I,

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.960
 yeah, of course, you engage with it to some degree. But you can imagine that there are people that

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.880
 have this exact same relationship with them. Yeah. They believe in this concept called science.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.440
 They believe it has fundamental truth about the universe. They don't directly engage with it.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.840
 Because you know, who can as like a hobby, you rely on the interpreter,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.880
 interpreter you do rituals. Yeah, you live, you live your life. Well, it really is exactly the same.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.440
 And I shouldn't clap back with I don't listen to it because I do so many things that like come

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.040
 out of his podcast. It's just I hear them from people. I don't like actually directly consume it

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:51.280
 so much. Yeah. So I think everyone category, like when I describe this way, people, I think the

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.520
 net reaction is, oh, it's not the same because it's like the root thing is science, right?

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.960
 But it is the same. Yeah. It is eerily like the exact same as the other thing. And there's

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.480
 actually a thing foundationally wrong with it. I think the only thing that's wrong with any of

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:13.760
 the type of relationship is when you actually. So I think it's great when you understand that

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:20.080
 you are engaging with these things because humans need like culture and rituals and like they can't

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.640
 decide every little aspect of them of their life on their own. So they engage with they like choose

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:30.800
 a vibe of something that provides this that they click with. And they're following it. The problem

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:38.320
 comes when they actually literally believe that their choice is like the fundamentally the correct

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:44.400
 one. And it like starts to like, you know, conflict with other people's other people's things. But

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:50.320
 I think that the tricky thing with the science one is I don't think people actively chose it.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:56.640
 I think people what I think people believe is that actually is true. Like people literally believe

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:04.160
 it as as strongly as like the most religious faith oriented person would believe in their thing.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.560
 So am I a Scientologist? No, that's a different thing.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.320
 But that that that that just has the word science in it. But to be honest, this isn't any different.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.680
 Like, so the thing for me is I obviously, I'm not saying scientists fake. I'm not one of those

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.560
 people that are like, oh, it's, it's, you know, a scam. But I do differentiate between complex

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:30.000
 domains and non complex domains. Ooh, say more, say more words. What does that mean? I'm just not,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.640
 I'm not following because I'm not smart. I think the great advances in science that we can think of

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:41.200
 have been in the physical sciences, like, you know, like physics material. Yeah. So like, you know,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.960
 there's stuff we've just got about the universe formula is math that there's like a unified model.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:53.040
 It is for most of physics history, it's not as a complex domain. Like it's just individual

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.320
 properties that apply whether you're looking at a single pebble or you're looking at a giant

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:04.240
 planet. It's like the same. Yeah. It scales to the, like the rules scaled to both. But there's other

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.920
 domains that are complex. Think about psychology, think about economics, think about biology.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:16.960
 These domains are domains where if you zoom into the micro, it's pretty simple. But then when you go

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:24.080
 to the macro, it's like an impossible complex, like, like one cell versus a billion cells is like

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.960
 infinite complexity, right? It's so hard to understand anything about it. And this is where

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:36.160
 I think we, I think as a culture, we kind of assume that we like don't differentiate between

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.560
 these two things. We kind of expect the truths of the physics world to also apply to complex

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:46.320
 domains. Yeah. And that's why you can see everything from, again, it takes like psychology research.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.520
 None of it replicates, like at all, like the research is horrible, like it just does not.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.560
 Oh, what do you mean, like replicates? Like, oh, like the, the each study kind of stands alone.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.600
 No one ever finds like, no, no. So, so when I say replicate, I mean, someone will find,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.440
 discover a finding and then 10 years later, someone will redo the study and they'll be like,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:12.240
 oh, it like was wrong. Yeah. Yeah. Like they, like no one's reproduced the results of the study.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.720
 Yeah. Like each study is just kind of like an ad hoc thing that stands alone without.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.800
 Yeah, I gotcha. Okay. And we can kind of see this even in our lifetime. Like we live through a

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:27.280
 lifetime where in biology, like fat was the most evil thing ever, that there's like a zone where,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.360
 you know, fat is like, oh, we found out it's actually not that bad. And it turns out it's like sugar,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.840
 you know, like it's, it's really, it's like the eggs thing where it's like eggs are good or eggs

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.840
 are bad, just depending on the year. Okay. Yeah. There's a study that's for all too, like, you know,

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.000
 period time where we obsessively focused on it. And now we're like, do we even understand what it

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.440
 means? So the problem is it is a very complex domain. Just like all the topics that religion

00:13:51.440 --> 00:14:00.400
 talk about, it's very like crazy and like mind bending and weird. But people are set up to sell

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:06.640
 it to you as oh, it's not. And I think you can accidentally like put your life into a pretty crazy

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:14.240
 place because, again, this belief in, yep, you know, science and the truth and, you know, and all

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:21.920
 that. So I think there is in the world right now, a really large trap that is pulling people into

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.360
 that stuff. And it's not like 100% bad. But, you know, you can see how it's very easy to like get

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.240
 sucked in infinitely more and more and more and more. So it's just the internet, like, is it

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.360
 internet native problems, like being on the internet so much? Is that how we're getting sucked in?

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.800
 Am I blaming a big bad boogeyman? Yes, in this case. But I think like I said,

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.960
 this is like an ancient thing. Like people need rituals. People need rituals. People need to be

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:54.560
 told how to underline need. Yeah, yeah, is there and it's built into humans. The problem is the

00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:01.120
 default in modern society. In this internet age, we all kind of get, we're seemingly getting pulled

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:07.600
 into this similar state, this thing that's filling that void. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And I think people,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.840
 it's okay if that happens and you're aware of it. It's not okay if you act. I think a lot of people

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.840
 believe that they don't need that, but they're still getting sucked into it and not realizing it,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:22.880
 right? And I need this too. Like I also do this, but I think my approach for it is I try to pick

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.080
 like everyone kind of needs like a leader type person to look at and like model their life after.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:34.160
 I'm very particular about picking people that seem really happy, seem like they have the type

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:41.600
 of kind of life that I would want. I feel like they value things that are correct. I do find

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:47.040
 that a lot of people that are in this position, don't seem happy, seem really afraid if you really

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.920
 look at how they live their day to day, but still are in this position where they're like leading

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.920
 into millions of people. So you're saying the people, and I'm not picking on Huberman,

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.960
 but the person in Huberman's position, like Huberman represents that the person you're talking about,

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:06.400
 right? That seems like they don't seem like they actually model a life that you would want

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:11.760
 necessarily. Yeah, this is all like gut feel. Like when I see Huberman, I like look at him and

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.960
 like I can look at his face away talks and I just like, I don't sense happiness. I don't sense like

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:22.080
 this is a fulfilled life. I sense like sense like weird desperation. I have the equivalent person,

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:28.560
 by the way. So I have a guy named Mark Sisson. Same exact thing. He does exact same stuff with

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:34.880
 Huberman. Huberman, he like has been a lot of time focusing on things like nutrition and exercise

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.760
 and all of that. And he has the way he talks about it. But when I look at his life, I'm like,

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.080
 this is like the happiest dude ever. He's got such a great life. I'm so jealous of him.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:50.640
 And everybody clicked with him is, and again, this comes out a personal choice, right? So he used

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.680
 to be an ultra marathon runner, like crazy, crazy like distances like pushing himself to the extreme.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:01.440
 And he like almost killed himself doing that. Like he like destroyed his body in a lot of ways.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:07.760
 Yeah. So now he has this really interesting balance of like doing things in the optimal way,

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.800
 but not forgetting that the point of life is to have fun and be happy and to enjoy it.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.360
 Like he always talks about, he's like always talks about exercise being like,

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:20.320
 for him, you know, I don't go to the gym because I have fun going to the gym.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.720
 I go to the gym so I can go play ultimate on the weekends. And I can keep doing that

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:30.160
 in my 60s, 70s, 80s. I can take 70 something now. So, you know, like that just clicks for me.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:35.280
 And I understand that I'm like kind of taking his word. He might be wrong about a bunch of things,

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.520
 but I'm like treating him as a leader. Yeah. Not believing that there's truth involved,

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:44.480
 but because I'm fulfilling this need that I have. So that fulfills your ritual need or like

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.600
 the whole thing we described that everyone seems to have a need for that that guy is kind of your

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.800
 like, he sets the rituals in place that you kind of follow. Like when I have questions,

00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.480
 like I need an answer, I think that's where I'll go. But again, it's like really mild for the

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.680
 most part. Like I just like the way he views life and it clicks, it clicks for me, you know,

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:10.320
 and he seems happy. So that seems like a good leader. Okay. I think I'm going to replace Huberman

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:15.680
 in my life with Wim Hof. He's awesome. You know, Wim Hof is. Yeah, he's great. Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.440
 And people are going to think it's just because of the cold exposure. Like I just like full baths,

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.040
 but that's not it. He's just he just seems happy. He does he seems happy, right?

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.160
 I don't know much about him. So the black seat, he seems happy.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.600
 Yeah, I don't know if he's offering answers to a lot of the things he doesn't seem to care about much.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.920
 He just like goes up in the mountains and is under where but that in itself is,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:40.000
 you know, something a detail. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, I need less. I need to have less

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.280
 answers to questions, I think, in my mind. I think I have too many answers and it's stressful.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:51.440
 Yeah. So if you saw a tweet yesterday, like the more money you have, the more like

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:56.160
 increasingly complex griffs you have to avoid. Yeah, I was trying to imagine what I saw that

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.800
 tweet. I was trying to imagine what what you what spurred that what griff. I feel like so much in

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:08.480
 my life. And I feel like I've gone through this phase where I was at a point where I had no money,

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.360
 you know, earlier in my career, then I started making a good amount of money.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:16.640
 Then like all these solutions to all my problems started showing up, like, oh, you have this problem,

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.960
 here's you have this problem, you're just solution. But like, it just, it technically solved that

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.800
 problem. But then it created a new problem. And then there was a solution for that. And there just

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.200
 felt like this cascading thing. And I got like hit a point where like, like just ejected out of it.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.680
 And I'm like, none of these problems are actually real problems. They're things that I would totally

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.120
 forget about and not notice if someone wasn't in front of me being like, Hey, remember this thing

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:43.200
 that you have a problem with? Yeah. And I just feel like, yeah, like the richer you get,

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.520
 they're just more and more incentive for people to like, you're like, Oh, like you have this problem,

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:53.200
 like, you know, yeah, by this thing, you know, and it's just so and I feel like so much of my life is

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:59.200
 just dodging that now. It's just, it's so effective. Like when someone brings up something, you're like,

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.720
 Oh, yeah, I should be paying attention to that. Or like, that is something I need to fix or that

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.640
 is something I might as I've definitely felt that. And here's what the next day as punchline goes.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.800
 Yeah, next year is a great example of that. Yeah. Like we solved this problem. Uh oh,

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.080
 here's a new problem. Okay, like we've met this new thing. And then okay, that fixes that. Okay,

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.480
 no, but here's another literally had those problems this morning. I'm extremely stressed this morning.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:26.000
 And about 20% of it is next year's and it's so stupid. They're catching or weird caching thing.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.840
 Yeah, I've let this be a thing in my life that stresses me out, but whatever.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:38.480
 I was going to conclude anyway. So anyway, yeah, maybe we don't talk about any of this anymore,

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.240
 my mental health or any of it. Because I just don't want this to become my therapy. And it is

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.920
 kind of I'm sorry. Listen, I've tried therapy. I've tried the better help thing. This isn't your

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.720
 therapy. This was just talking broadly. I don't think it was. Yeah, broadly. It wasn't too much

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:59.360
 about you. I mean, my conclusion is like, I think for you, if you feel like your life is very brittle,

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:05.360
 it doesn't have to be like you kind of doesn't have to be. It's not inherent to my personality.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:11.840
 Because I feel like I'm so like, like, I have this like weird hair to your personality.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:18.320
 But it's also that I'm saying the world is set up to tap into into that the world is set up to

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:23.840
 tap into that. Okay. So the world is taking advantage of my personality. That's what you're

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:29.360
 saying kind of. Yeah, I mean, it's not just you like it's like a problem. We're all like very lost

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:36.400
 right now because we've given so much freedom to choose and we're like reinventing our lives

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:42.640
 over and over. Do you feel lost? Yeah, I do because I'm also seeing all the same stuff you are and

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.480
 I'm also thinking about all the same stuff where I'm like, should I be eating this? Should I be

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.840
 doing that? Like, should I be doing this thing? People are saying I should be doing that. And it's just

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:56.480
 like, it all sounds so smart. But below all of it, it's just like, just lost. Like, everyone is just

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:02.160
 kind of like completely lost. That's a great, great way to describe it. And I feel I can hear

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.760
 myself when I say like, yeah, lost is a good way that describes how I feel. I can just hear a lot of

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:13.120
 like people yelling on the other end of the podcast with like their solution or like their beliefs

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.400
 or their like, you're lost because you don't have this. And I get it. I've been there. I've held

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.200
 belief systems where I felt that way about other people. Just like hear me out. Like, I've tried

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:31.040
 things. I've done things. I've believed things. And I'm not unhappy with my broad worldview in terms

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.440
 of like, it's the nitty, it's when you get down to the details. Yeah, yeah. It's the day to day

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:42.160
 that like, I just constantly blame the internet. And it's stupid because the internet isn't really a

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.720
 thing. I don't know. What am I blaming? Like, the physical network that is the internet? Like,

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:53.040
 I'm blaming the information. I've not done a good job of putting constraints on how I consume

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.560
 this thing that's available to us now where we have the world at our fingertips at all times.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:04.400
 I've not done a good job of shielding my brain from the wrong parts of it or something. And

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.400
 that's what I blame. I don't it's not like I'm blaming big companies in the internet. I'm not like,

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:17.440
 it's not a boogeyman thing. It's just like, I don't feel like I've done a good job of balancing

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:24.000
 this very powerful thing that we have in our lives, this ability to communicate and consume

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 and do these things at any given moment. I haven't balanced that with like, stuff that we just need

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.840
 as people. I feel like you just need people around you. You need to like, have like, socialization,

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.880
 but I just basically shut off in terms of the physical world. Like, I literally just don't interact

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:47.840
 with people within a hundred mile radius of me. I don't know. Like, I happen to live in a place,

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.880
 but I don't really belong there. I don't really have the things that people probably need.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.040
 You know, we've talked about that before. But anyway,

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.840
 me and Liz were talking about this too. Liz does something the other day. She was like,

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.760
 I think the only thing I care about anymore is like being around people I care about.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.520
 And it's just become so-- I feel that in my soul.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:15.280
 Yeah, it just becomes so hard to do that. Like, it's like so rare that we get to actually do that.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.520
 So now it's just become like the number one thing we try to optimize our life around.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.920
 Like when I went to go visit Alan in Maine,

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:27.200
 his family has been spending summers in that island in Maine like forever.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:33.280
 And I was like, we should just do that. Because at least literally we're like willing to like

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.960
 go there and spend summers in there just so we can hang out with one person that we're close with,

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:43.120
 like one group of people that we're close with. But for us, there's like nothing else that matters

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:48.800
 more than that. It's crazy that like, yeah, all of us are so crazy isolated. And you're right.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.360
 It's like, this comes up in the most trivial things, right? It's like the micro nitty-gritty stuff.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.120
 Yeah, yeah. Like I think about our parents, like I'm our parents, like our grandparents.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:04.240
 They never once thought about like, what should I be eating? They never once thought about it.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:10.240
 Like, I think it's maybe different because in America, that was maybe a very bad thing.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.560
 But my grandparents were in India. They never once thought about what they should be eating.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:20.560
 And it was fine because it was all healthy, good food anyway. Like not a single day,

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.720
 not a single minute of their life they spent thinking about that. And like,

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.400
 that just leaves so much more room for thinking about other things. Like, they're not worried

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.880
 about the nitty-gritty at all. It's been established. It's been that way for years and years and years.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.280
 Yeah. There's also like every other aspect of my life. Yeah, like activity, physical activity,

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:42.240
 moving, like exercise, all that stuff. Do you think though, is to play the other side of it,

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.800
 like you mentioned in America, maybe that would be a bad thing to not think about it.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.640
 Do you think there's something about our environment here? I'm going to say in the US

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.480
 because I don't have any other context. Maybe it's the whole Western world. I don't know.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.760
 But do you think there's something about our environment that's sort of like actively hostile

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.640
 against you just having a default lifestyle? Like, if you just live the life that society

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:07.680
 sort of like seems to be defaulting to, like in India, your grandparents, they were surrounded

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:12.720
 by a culture that was like setting good. Here's like a good food environment. Here's a good

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.840
 whatever environment. And if you just live a default life here, you're going to be healthy and

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.400
 happy. Do you feel like that's the case in the US today? Or do you feel like corporate interest or

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.680
 something have created an environment where if you just default to the default, you're going to die

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:31.120
 at like 80 and you're going to be on meds from like 55 and on for low blood pressure or whatever.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.560
 Like, there's all these things that are going to happen if you just default to the default here

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.400
 in America. Do you think that's true? Or if I just Huberman myself into that?

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:43.280
 No, I think that that no, that is true. But it has nothing to do with what I think it has to do

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:49.360
 with is America is young and has no, it has no, it has no culture, like it has no ritual. It has

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.440
 no like unified thing. Like, you know, again, going back to India example, this is like an

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.240
 ancient civilization with rituals that have been around for thousands of years. There's a lot of

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.400
 wisdom in those things. There's so many, I think we've taught those before. There's so many examples

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:08.960
 of if you look at certain dishes that like pair a bunch of ingredients together and then like later

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:15.200
 science will tell us like, Oh, this one ingredient is actually potentially, you know, has this thing

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.400
 that can kill you. But when paired with this other ingredient, it like neutralize it, there's like,

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.840
 nobody understands that when they're eating the food, but there's like this ancient

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:27.520
 something over the years built up with it. Like most older cultures, if you look at their,

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:32.800
 the food they eat, it tends to be right, nutritious covers a full spectrum of everything you need.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.760
 Again, nobody understood why they're doing any of that, but it's just built in. So I think America

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:44.160
 is young. So it doesn't have have that's and the like we're exceptionally lost here, I think.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:50.240
 Yeah, so we're young, but we're also like a mix from a technology standpoint, we're very mature,

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:56.240
 or like we've done things, we've been able to create things that like in India, 100 years ago,

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.520
 they weren't going to be able to create some of the food and some of the things we've created in our

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:05.760
 society. Do you think any of it's part of like the timeline we're in just like where we're at in

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.640
 terms of technology? Because we can make very delicious tasting things that are not really food

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.760
 anymore. And that's like a big part of the default diet in America. I'm getting on the food thing

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.720
 a lot. Maybe this is just about food for me. Maybe I'm too hung up on food, but I do feel like the

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.840
 default American diet is called like the standard American diet and it stands for sad or like sad

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:31.520
 is the acronym. And I think there's something to that. Sad diet, it's just sad. Yeah, but I think

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:39.440
 that's only that only proliferated because there isn't an existing thing that's like established,

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:45.200
 right? So I see. So if America were older and we had like in a if we had come to the right answers

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:50.400
 over a long period of time, which is what other cultures have done basically, like I'm sure every

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.160
 part of the world is now dealing with this to some degree, just because of the globalization

00:28:54.160 --> 00:29:00.160
 stuff. But yeah, obviously, like you could like your grandparents or maybe your parents,

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:04.480
 people your parents age were probably eating a lot of like really crazy stuff. People my parents

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.480
 in age in India were not like it hadn't really made up there. And like it's much harder to

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.400
 displace like their routines and everything. Like when you have a billion people all kind of doing

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.040
 the same thing, it's that they've been doing for thousands of years. It's like a lot harder to

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.680
 disrupt that. You can imagine like other countries to like just like imagine like Japan, like it's

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.880
 like it's hard to imagine them doing kind of stuff that we're doing again because they have like these

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.600
 rituals that they back. So yeah, it's hard for me. I think it's hard. I'm just I'm trying to compare

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.760
 like India and America. And it's just hard for me because I don't think like a thousand years ago

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.800
 at the early when they were young, when India was young, whenever that was, I don't think they were

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.960
 like, let's start with McDonald's cheeseburgers. And then we're going to evolve to like,

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.840
 Yeah, I think you're right that there's like the laws and also having the amount of freedom and

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:56.400
 power that you do now. Right. That's like a bad combination. Yeah. Yeah. Like there's a period I

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.200
 feel like in like, I don't know when this was maybe I think I think it was like after the 50s.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:07.040
 I feel there was a period that was like, let's try to make food as weird as possible. Yeah. I feel

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.120
 like the post World War II, there was trying to make like the craziest stuff. There were like,

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:17.600
 here's orange juice, but it's like a cube of ice. And here's like, here's jello. And there's like,

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.440
 it's like this wobbly crazy thing. And there's like something in it. You know, it's just like all

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:27.440
 this really weird era of being like, we can engineer anything and yeah, experimentation stuff came

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:33.680
 out rebellion. Yeah, we're just young. We're teenagers. America is doing weird stuff. Okay,

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.840
 that's enough about food. I feel like we should talk about something that anyone that listens

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.160
 podcast would want to listen to because I've just I've taken over. And I think this is like,

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.560
 probably I think what we talked about is probably, I think a lot of people could relate to what

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.120
 we talked about. Yeah, I think this is like the problem of our time. So maybe this is like a

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:55.600
 another problem of our time. And it's not unique to me that I feel like such a snowflake. Like,

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:59.120
 there's so many things about my life that I think like, I just want to rant and I want to

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.360
 complain about this stuff because I'm so frustrated. And I think like, no one can relate with me.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.960
 I don't I don't feel like I have relatable problems. But you know what I mean?

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.440
 You are an extreme individual in a lot of ways that's in a very unique way. And that's what makes

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:17.360
 you interesting. But I think the root things are stem from, I think people can relate to

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:24.800
 are universal. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, if you're also lost, let's form a support group.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.440
 What's everyone? So I guess we just need it's everyone that is lost. And I think we all just

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.040
 need to acknowledge that we're not smart. We're lost. Because a lot of this stuff sounds very

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:38.320
 smart. And then what's the next step after that? So I've acknowledged I am done. I believe this

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:46.480
 genuinely. I am not smart. And I am lost. Now I believe you all of it is true. What do I do now?

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.480
 Find what you really care about? Like, what is what is the thing that you really care about?

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.400
 What I really care about? I think it's what you and Liz just said. I think I do crave like ever

00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:00.720
 since React Miami, just like hanging out at your house for a week, realizing like, I just don't have

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.880
 that in my life. I don't have like people that I just want to spend time with. And I had that

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:09.680
 earlier in life. I feel like in school, you've got like this built in, you know, we spend a lot of

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:14.000
 time together friends. Now it's just like my family and I love my family. And I know my family

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.520
 needs this too. Like my wife would say the same thing. Like we just need people. We just need to

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.280
 be around people more. And I feel like the isolation has gotten more extreme over. We've

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.040
 been married 15 years. It wasn't like the beginning of our marriage. And I feel like it's just

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.400
 progressively gotten worse. And I don't know what the driving factor is, but we got to fix it.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.480
 Yeah, exactly. And this again goes back to just these older ways of living. Like this was never

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.520
 a problem historically. Like, you were you were never like, how do I stay and how do I make

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.640
 sure I like stay in touch with my community? Like no, your community was your whole life.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:47.040
 And there was no escaping. Yeah, right, right. Which has other problems, right? So we've been

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:52.240
 granted the ability to escape those problems, but we've lost all this stuff. So yeah, it's crazy how

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.840
 and it's funny you bring up this school thing. Like this also goes back to

00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:02.080
 like these older structures. I think the school education system was so stupid and it was so

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:08.000
 much of my life in it. And it sucks. And it was not optimized. And I think it set up a lot of it sets

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.600
 up people for like a lot of misery. But it did provide the thing you're talking about where

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:19.120
 you don't have to try at all. And you would have you have certain needs that are like just

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.520
 met and fulfilled for like years, potentially even would even set you up for a lifetime with

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:28.640
 like, you know, friends, stuff, but how in the world the like it's like it's decimated.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:45.760
 I post this other day. We have a friend whose wife has I literally haven't seen her in like

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:51.520
 five years. Like she's always avoids hanging out with us. And my last memory of hanging out with her

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:59.120
 was we were at this Vietnamese place getting and I talked about how more it was like a really

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:05.440
 great character. I've heard this. Yeah, I would do a horcrux. And you got really pissed. You got

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:13.680
 really, really, really, really I think that was like, she like was like, Oh, Dax is a bad person.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:19.600
 Like that was her like definitive. You know, I said something that definitely told I was a bad

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.840
 person and she should avoid me. So yeah, that was it. Bold. Well, it's not true or not. It's a

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:29.200
 sorghum. I'm gonna say, but it's funny. People on the table next to us also found it funny and

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:37.760
 started getting into it with us too. Could we talk about fur? Is that how you say it?

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:43.600
 Oh, he said faux, I think. It's fur, huh? Yeah, I have this thing where I apply very

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.840
 inconsistently. There are certain things that I feel like if you pronounce it a certain way,

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.240
 even if it's correct or being pretentious. So I say it the wrong way on purpose. But I'm just

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.560
 thinking sometimes I just do it. Like, I think with fun, I feel like I hear enough people saying

00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:01.200
 that where I'm not like showing off that I know how to say it by saying a certain way.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:07.040
 Okay, I just looked it up. I mean, it is spelled P-H-O, but we'll go with fun. I'm good with that.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:14.720
 But it is. I love. Speaking of what's going on right now, I need to like distract myself. Do

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.680
 I? Maybe I don't. Maybe I need to think about my problem. I think I want to distract.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:23.120
 Let's just go on right now. Oh, this episode sponsored by Terminal Coffee. You can buy your

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:28.720
 coffee in the terminal right now. S-S-H terminal bot shop. Literally right now, you can do it,

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.400
 because we launched- Open up your terminal bot shop. S-H terminal bot shop.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:39.040
 Did you see the multiplexer thing I posted? Yes. Oh, I can't wait. I'm so tired of having

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.680
 multiple panes open to do this stuff. I just want to like cycle through it.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.560
 It solves a bunch of problems too. Like, it's not like I have to kill them all the restart.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.720
 Like, it's going to be nice. How soon? How soon are we talking here?

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.560
 I'm hoping I've had a set the next day or so. Oh, nice. I'm close.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.880
 Everything moves fast with SST. It was fun, because the way I built it was,

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.920
 I actually didn't build anything S-C specific for the multiplexer. I built like a very simple

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.480
 multiplexer that can show up multiple processes, and I'm like using it for SST.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:15.600
 Isn't it crazy how deep into the terminal we've got? Yeah, we've really got deep.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:22.240
 We're in deep because I finally understand all this stuff that I never really got.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:27.360
 Like, I never really got like, how is SST working? Like, it's like streaming to me. Is it like a

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.880
 video feed? Yeah, there's things I care about now that I just never ever thought about.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.440
 Like, there's like, yeah, how much data is being transferred over an SST session.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.960
 Not a thing I cared about a year ago. Now, suddenly, I'm very concerned with the internals of these

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.760
 libraries we use and how it all works. And I'm amazed at how capable the whole terminal

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:53.040
 system is. Like, it really is. Yeah. Again, it's obvious if you think about the fact that we're

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:58.080
 using the OVIM and the OVIM is a terminal app, but yeah, it can work locally, it can be streamed

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:03.040
 over as stage, all that stuff. But it is wild, because the stuff, this technology is old,

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:07.680
 the concept of terminal is extremely old. All those escape codes are very old, but yeah, you can

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:16.240
 use it to do anything, and it's a it's wildy, but that's the same terminal that shot.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.200
 Yeah, we we haven't talked about since we launched, right? We haven't had an episode since it was

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:27.120
 Monday, we launched with four new blends. And I think we've officially sold more than we have

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:32.480
 in our first round. Feels good. We don't sell the rent the coffee that we sold in the first round,

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:37.680
 no blend. It was a limited time run. Now you can buy four different blends that whatever

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:43.520
 matches your preference. We've got a light medium roast. Yeah, and a decaf. A decaf,

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:49.760
 which is really popular. Surprisingly, it's a less popular for sure, but like there's a good

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.600
 map. It's surprisingly more popular than I expected. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's all the people who want

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.400
 to buy our coffee through the terminal, but they don't drink coffee and they're like,

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:02.080
 I can do decaf maybe. I think the 404 is a decaf button. I think that one has the best packaging.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:06.240
 That's my favorite. It's the coolest package. Yeah. If you were just buying them for the packaging,

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.560
 it's the coolest for sure. We really get photos of the coffee packaging. Yeah, we do.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.480
 On the website or something because they're not in the terminal. So you never see what you're

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:21.360
 about to get. It's like, I figured that, well, we should post photos for sure. I figured we could

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.120
 do that like a week out. So we can, yeah, we'll take some photos here. I should be getting the

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.320
 coffee soon, right? But also people are about to be gets people. Some people are getting their

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:33.600
 coffee today. So I'm sure there'll be tweets and stuff so we can retweet those. So people,

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:38.800
 people would, yeah, you're just reminding me, I got stuff to do. I got, see, this is the problem.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.280
 Like, I'm like, oh, I'm going to go to jujitsu at 10. And then I'm like, no, I got so many

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.280
 things I got to do today. Why do I always feel like I have so many things to do? There's always

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.360
 going to be so many things to do with work. It's never going to be like, oh, I really don't have

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.760
 that much to do right now. It's always going to be there's so much to do. Why is that? Is that how

00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:01.760
 everyone feels of the work is this universal? Because you are, you're like running a business.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:06.160
 Yeah, so how it feels when you run a business, when you're running three businesses, this is

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:12.080
 how you feel. Yeah, exactly. Because it's like, the thing I always bring up is being a freelancer

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.720
 and going on vacation. And whatever vacation costs twice and out. Yeah, it's like, that exact thing.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:22.160
 It's like, it's not like you're done with work. There's always more stuff you could be doing.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.520
 And you're getting paid for every minute you work, which is not the case when

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:31.440
 you know, you have a fixed salary. Yeah. Yeah, it's like yesterday is a holiday. And it's like,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:37.680
 I'm not taking off on 4th of July. It's not like, ah, my day job is giving me the day off.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:43.360
 So I'm just going to hang out and barbecue. Like what? No, I don't get to do that. There's always

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:48.800
 so many things to do that every moment seems precious. I don't like that feeling though. I don't

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:54.640
 like that feeling of it's just, it's this never ending treadmill that I will never get off of.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:40:00.160
 That's what it feels like. Well, it's funny because holidays are exciting for me because

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:06.080
 external things coming into my life slow down. Yeah. Like support questions or people ask me

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.120
 stuff. So holidays are days where I can like really focus. Sorry. I don't stop.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:16.560
 The stream of my support request keeps flowing. Yeah, so that is super nice.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:22.880
 But yeah, I don't know. It just, I'm sure eventually something out or maybe not. Yeah,

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.800
 eventually it'll slow down. Sure. Yeah. Uh huh. That's what, yeah. No, it won't.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:32.800
 My one of the, yeah, I imagine the beginning of the podcast. Uh, I, Warren Buffett,

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:40.080
 he's 90 something years old and he's so, I bring his up so much. He's so articulate. He's so

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.680
 all there, especially, you know, we've been seeing Biden in the past week. He's like,

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:49.120
 his mind's a hundred percent there. And guess what? He worked probably every minute of his life.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:54.960
 Okay. I like that. I work a lot. I choose to believe that, again, none of this is based on

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:59.920
 factor science or anything, but yeah, it makes sense to me that he's, that makes sense. I mean,

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:06.720
 my grandpa lived to be 94 eight terribly. I mean, like he was completely unhealthy and every metric

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:11.840
 like had to have his arteries from his neck scraped clean and all that like just didn't do a lot of

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:17.680
 things lifestyle wise you would think would keep him tick until 94. But perfectly there till he

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:23.360
 died mentally and he was working until he was 94. He had a clothing store. He ran for 60 years or

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:29.600
 whatever and went to work every day thinking about how you can make these jeans a little cheaper for

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.080
 people about like that kind of stuff. I mean, like, I do think there's something about having

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:41.120
 your work and having this like mental exercise every day. I think that's good. Yeah. I just,

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.480
 but like when I talk about this with Casey and how stressed I am and how overwhelmed all these

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.160
 things there's so much going on. It's like, well, you got to cut something out is for your answer.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.920
 And it's like, I don't, there's nothing I would cut out. I love all the things I'm doing. Like,

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.560
 it's all good things. I want all these things. I've narrowed it to four things and I just,

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:01.680
 why can't I just feel good about the pace? I think it's the pace. Why can't I just feel good

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:06.080
 about the pace that like just naturally happens? Why do I feel like everything's going too slow

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:10.560
 and I got to go faster? Okay. So I have a perfect metaphor for this. And I think

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:18.160
 I'm going to be able to explain two things at once. So you know how when there's like a road

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.160
 and there's a lot of traffic and there's always like always uncomfortable amount of traffic. It's

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.280
 like annoying. They expand the road and then it's like the same amount of traffic even though there's

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:34.240
 twice amount of amount of room. Yeah. And the reason is like every individual is willing to drive up

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:39.120
 to a certain level of discomfort. So that's just a level that it's always going to be at. If you

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.200
 add more capacity, the discomfort goes down. So then more people start driving and then discomfort

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:49.360
 goes back up. The natural state of everything is just going to be discomfort. Because if you cut

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:53.600
 something out, then you're going to be like, huh, I feel good now. And then you're going to feel like

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.960
 I can probably do another thing and you feel it with something else. And again, you're at the zone

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.120
 of discomfort forever. Yeah, I describe it as a liquid. It's like it fills the container. It's

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:06.560
 not a gas. Like it will fill the container. It's probably more like a gas because it can be compressed

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:13.200
 or something. And like it ultimately, maybe it can't. I don't know. But it fills whatever crevice I

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:19.040
 give it. If there is an opening, I will fill it with something to do and it's overwhelming.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:23.920
 Okay. Yeah. The thing that I mean, let's talk about this a lot because it feels like every time

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:30.560
 our life gets settled, we seem to completely randomly make a decision that just inserts chaos

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:36.640
 into it again. It's like, we were going to move from New York to Miami, chaos, chaos, chaos. Okay,

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.280
 it's kind of settling down. Okay, let's get a dog. Chaos, chaos, chaos. Okay. The dog is like

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.800
 kind of grown up and like, you know, he's, he's like chill now because yet another dog. Really,

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:49.040
 let's kind of kid, you know, it's just like, we're always just resetting. We're going to move again.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:55.440
 Yeah. It's there's always something. There is, before we load up, there is one tech thing that

00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:01.040
 happened this week. That is interesting. Have you seen all this stuff with RS pack? No.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.400
 Have you ever heard of RS pack? Is that a rust thing? What is it? RS pack.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:09.120
 Okay. So do you remember how? Wait, can I guess? Hang on? Hang on. This is going to be fun. I'm

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:17.920
 going to guess somebody rewrote a bundler in rust. I've never heard of RS pack in my life, but I just

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:24.400
 know that's what it is. Okay. Great. So a couple of years ago, I remember so at their conference

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:31.360
 was like, introducing turbo pack, the successor. Oh, yeah. And then the webpack people were like,

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:40.320
 what? Wait, what do you mean? Not people that were diverse. I was just like the people that

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:47.280
 well, the guy, yeah, the people who actually worked on webpack. Yeah, we're so working on

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:53.520
 Webpack. We're still working on Webpack. And that like annoyed people enough that they kicked off

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:59.920
 RS pack, which is just targeting the existing webpack config and API. I just need money.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:05.200
 That's where they went wrong. So I continue. No, no, wait, just listen, ground up in rust.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:10.160
 And it's okay. A lot of these engineers work at bite dance, which is a company that owns TikTok.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:17.360
 Oh, and you often hear from them. They are like, they're insane. These are like some of the craziest

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:25.680
 engineers I've seen. They shipped RS pack with 100% working with Webpack faster than turbo pack,

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:33.280
 even replaced next to us. And they started pretty sure. And they move super, super, super fast.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:38.480
 So we're gonna say it's like hit a milestone where like you can totally replace Webpack. It's

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.000
 faster than V. It's faster than like, you know, it's great across the board is winning.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:49.040
 Last week, Zach Johnson, who is someone that works on it works at bite dance said, Oh, one of my

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:56.160
 coworkers is like, gonna get RS pack building next to us just for fun and getting a lot of test

00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.160
 pass. And we're planning on throwing it out. Oh, this is hilarious. Sounds useful. So I've

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:06.240
 messaged him being like, like, what is this? This sounds like really useful for open next. Like,

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:11.440
 can we talk about it? And he goes, Oh, it's funny. My coworker was like, can I can we donate this

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:18.240
 to open next? And then so we got in a call and I was talking to him. And they like take this stuff

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:26.560
 so seriously, they are like, if the way bite dance treats things is, if there is a large user of an

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.960
 open source project, they treat like a business product. So they will literally like fly someone

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:35.440
 to you and work with you having issues with it. Like they're just like, just on it and like,

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:40.240
 just crazy engineering power and resources and stuff. So they're literally going to build an

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:46.640
 alternate compiler for next year's that targets, like your code, like the next year's APIs,

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:51.040
 but doesn't depend on like the versatile build output, which like is constantly changing and

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:55.280
 breaking it and all this stuff. So you can maybe say it's like a successor to turbo pack.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:01.440
 Yeah, the senator is going to launch yet as a successor.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:09.200
 But what's cool about this is that completely decouples next. It's like the biggest way to

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.360
 decouple it next from Vercelle because you just target the same API. Sure. They sell design.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:17.760
 But a lot of places where they like really mess with stuff is in the build process where they like

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:23.520
 make certain things like overly complicated as a side effect of making it like work nicely with

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:28.080
 certain products that Vercelle offers. So an example of that is Vercelle has a cash like a

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:34.080
 proprietary caching product. But if you just made an x-ray as work with module federation,

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:38.080
 which is like an open thing, like you wouldn't really need that, but they make it network with it.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:43.040
 So things like that, it would just fix. Yeah. So yeah, it is wild that now there might be this.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:47.280
 We might be getting this like crazy set of resources to help with open next.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.640
 Cloudflare also coincidentally has been talking about doing the exact same thing.

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:55.040
 So they're also very potentially into this. So it finally feels like interesting.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.280
 We can kind of band everywhere together and have this like

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:02.480
 completely separate alternate solution. Yeah. A way of doing of doing next,

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.880
 which I'm pretty excited. A lot of potential pretty excited about.

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:10.240
 Okay. These engineers are insane. They're like so fast. I love these kind of stories.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:14.560
 I love learning about these. I do feel like we haven't even scratched the service on what

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:18.720
 people are capable of from a software development standpoint. I feel like we're just discovering

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:22.960
 like there's these people who are insane. I mean, I've just seen it in the open source community,

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.320
 and especially people you found like, Oh, look at this library that this random 15 year old

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:30.640
 Nindia made. And like, Oh, this person's a genius. Yeah. And I feel like there's just more and more

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.400
 of that. And then you start like putting them on little teams together and just like,

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:38.400
 there's no telling what we're going to be able to build. It's amazing. Yeah. He was the guy

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:42.160
 was really like, I'm pretty sure I can get all pages router working in a weekend.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:47.680
 Like, Oh, cool. That's funny. That sounds great. All right. We got to get up here so I can go

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:53.840
 to Jutsu. I, uh, I'm realizing I need to, I need to do some physical exertion. I'm sorry that I

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:57.760
 just truncated the only interesting part of this podcast. You guys had to listen to like 40 minutes

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:02.800
 of existential crisis. And then you get like a little blip of Dax talking about tech that's

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:08.320
 actually interesting, such as life on the tomorrow. People don't care about the tech part. I'm very

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:15.920
 don't care. Maybe not. We just need to position the podcast appropriately. I guess it's not really

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:20.000
 branded as being a tech podcast. So I don't know why I feel like I have some obligations branded

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.520
 about as being tomorrow. Yeah, it's about tomorrow. It's very broad. It is very broad. We can basically

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:30.640
 talk about anything we want. It's about how the future requires us visiting our past. Oh, that was

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:38.480
 deep. Did you just make that up on the spot? I'm going to change our tagline and those scripts

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:43.120
 with the podcast and everything. That was so good. You're going to be the person I put in that place.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:47.360
 I need that that wise person in my life that's not Huberman. It's going to be Dax for me. No,

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:52.480
 it's got to be someone in the next phase of life. No, I'm going with you. You're a little younger

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:58.720
 than me, but I don't care. There's no rules. There's no rules here. All right. Oh, one hour

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:14.080
 exactly. Let's just stop it now. Okay. Bye.

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:20.080
 Oh, no, I didn't hit the button. I can't reach it. There it is. Okay. My trackpad died.
