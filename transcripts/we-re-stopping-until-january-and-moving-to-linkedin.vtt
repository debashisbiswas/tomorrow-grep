WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
 we talked about we're going to take a break mm-hmm we're going to take a little holiday break are

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.000
 we cool with this tax this was all in text and I couldn't tell if you like if you cried a little

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.920
 no i'm pissed

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.640
 i was just looking at linkedin because you're starting to post there is that why you said that

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.160
 is that why you tweeted that i am a hundred percent serious i really want all of tech twitter

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.040
 just to switch to posting on linkedin for a week i think it would like permanently change

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:57.600
 the vibe of linkedin i just saw you replied yeah i i'm for it let's do it i you know i realized

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.960
 like there's more people on linkedin that care about it to be us than twitter probably by a lot

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.920
 like i don't know why i don't post anything there yeah it's like this annoying thing that's in the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.880
 back of my head where i should really be building some attention there yeah but it would be a lot

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.080
 more fun if at least a bunch of us were there and it was kind of the same by this twitter hey we're

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.440
 there we're doing it we're gonna be on linkedin i gotta go clean it all up i just went through and

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.640
 like decline like a hundred something so their notifications are so meaningless i know the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.800
 notifications tab is just full of like some person posted a thing that's not a notification

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.880
 you shouldn't send a notification for that i didn't ask get notifications for random people

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.640
 posting things yeah it's that and then like they have like the connection concept and the

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.720
 follower concept so i switched it to be follower by default which i think makes sense i gotta go

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.680
 through and remove all my connections because i don't actually want to start over what did you

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.160
 do did you like clean it up or did you just pick it up well i didn't know at some point i switched

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.200
 over to the creative or whatever creator profile thing where you can have followers but i've never

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.040
 touched the connections honestly i've never even looked at them i don't even know like i just go

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.880
 through randomly and i look at people that ask to connect and i'm like yeah nah yeah it's like if

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.680
 they're obviously a recruiter no if they're not sure why not yeah but that's that's my thing like i

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.400
 had i've had different phases over there i haven't used linkedin and gears but before when i had it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.280
 i just had different logic with who i would accept and who i would decline that would change over

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.000
 time yeah so now i just have i have like no idea what a connection means for myself i'm just gonna

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.440
 delete everyone and start over i think if there's anyone meaningful that i remove like they'll find

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.280
 a way to reach out again like you know it's not yeah i respect that but it's so hard for me to do

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.080
 that it just feels like i'm slapping people in the face if i unfollow them on twitter or i linkedin

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.200
 though come on i guess on linkedin who cares yeah i don't know it's hard but my problem with linkedin

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.880
 is like why why do you have to wear like a polo shirt to be on linkedin like what is the deal

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.000
 with the lack of authenticity and the like like people aren't this way the way they are in linkedin

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.960
 that's not how people are or are they that way in person like i think to some degree or some people

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.400
 just there's like this professional persona that we learn to be and they just become that way but

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.120
 it's so fake i mean not like people are trying to be fake i'm not trying to slam individuals

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.800
 but like if you really sit and think about how you act when you put on a quote unquote professional

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.240
 whatever uh what are you doing right now just closing my door oh okay it sounded like you're

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.680
 beating something like poor zuko what did you do like if you really if someone genuinely just

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.160
 stopped and thought about how like their professional persona in their workplace or on linkedin

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.600
 is not a reflection of them as a person like they are a different person at home than they are on

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.400
 linkedin then i think they'd realize i'm not slamming them not saying they're a fake person it's just

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.720
 like you're being fake on linkedin and you're being fake in your workplace on twitter i feel like

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.960
 everybody's just themselves like you're literally just yourself the way you are in your home you're

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.080
 not like putting on a mask to get on twitter yeah i love that about twitter but i don't understand

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:27.200
 what it is about linkedin that can't have that and that's exactly why i want twitter to crash linkedin

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.160
 because i think that's why i don't want to be there it's just this weird vibe and i think if a

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:39.120
 bunch of people showed up and like you know acted differently yeah i think they would be more effective

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.760
 i think that stuff would get a lot more eyeballs and attention and eventually that'll change

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.520
 the vibe of at least our corner of linkedin so that's what you're hoping is to change linkedin

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.680
 not just get some experience that we all go back to twitter better people no they opposite

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.760
 okay i want it i want us to not change at all and then just show up on linkedin and change

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.560
 and just change linkedin yeah that would be amazing actually i didn't even honestly know you had a

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.760
 linkedin just seeing that you're i don't know how to find the thing i just you just did this everyone

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.960
 hapture everyone has a linkedin just not everybody advertises it let me clean it up and then we'll

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.720
 connect i'm already looking at it too late oh no this is awesome okay am i even connected to you

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.880
 okay we are connected cool i just don't think about linkedin at all i'm gonna figure out how

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.280
 to remove everyone and it's it's gonna be some stupid thing where to go could you leave me at

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.120
 least well i have to understand like should we follow each other or should we connect like what's

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.680
 the difference both probably i don't know that's for me confusing i feel like i shouldn't have had it

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.440
 like a second adding going from one thing to two things means there's like what four combinations of

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.960
 but you follow me and be connected you can be connected following each other you know very

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.360
 complicated it started though i think linkedin started without the idea of following people it was

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.440
 just connections yeah it was all connections yeah i remember i actually remember like over a decade

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.560
 ago whenever we first got on linkedin i remember like people bragging about having 500 connections

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.640
 on linkedin like that was the thing yeah do you remember this are you old enough to remember this

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:18.080
 but it's a stupid system because a connection is mutual so it just means that it erodes any meaning

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.520
 for you on linkedin to have a high number of connections yeah i guess so back then it was like

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.800
 a sign of your importance you're connected you're a connected individual yeah but that also means

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.600
 you're like if if you have 10,000 people connected to you that also means you're like following 10,000

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.880
 people which just means your feed is just complete noise at that point yeah i guess so yeah i've never

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.280
 thought about how linkedin has a feed that's hilarious so that's why i follow people is to

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.160
 to see them on my feed huh i i guess like i just want to go in there and treat it exactly like

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.080
 twitter and then not change anything yeah no we don't have to learn linkedin we're just gonna

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:01.360
 yes okay let's do it it might be good i'm trying to think if i should like change my uh whatever

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.040
 like because the big thing about the zebra work history on there i want to like maybe i should

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:12.080
 make it funny oh yeah make it funny i i i don't know if i've looked at my uh at my profile there's

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.720
 so many like like when i go to my profile there's like a million of those progress bars being like

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.600
 which university do you tend add it in and it'll be at step six of seven you know it's just

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:28.160
 it's just so like so deep in the in codification process yeah there's like a million things you

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:35.840
 can dismiss oh wow i have used linkedin i'm open to work apparently i have a i have a recommendation

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:42.400

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:59.120
 seeing wesley and saying we have to connect on twitter uh or somewhere and he didn't have a twitter

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.200
 he's on linkedin so we're connecting on linkedin and i had forgotten about wesley but here's the

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:10.000
 story uh the first conference i ever go to was that render in inlanta i was i was too too far gone

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.040

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.320
 the first conference the first conference was it was you it reinvent reinvent yes okay so flashback

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:28.880
 six months or whatever it was uh at reinvent i came out of we went to something the wax museum

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.600
 thing we went to that right yeah yeah i don't even know if i had drank that night but i was just so

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:40.960
 exhausted it was like day whatever too many of seven and just like walking around vegas

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.600
 for that whole week like we're just i was just beat and it was like a late night again and i'm

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.600
 walking out of that thing i left that thing early because i was just so tired i just had to go back

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.680
 to my room and just like sleep and walking out of the the the thing i'm telling a very long winded

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:02.480
 story uh walking out of the uh was placed the wax museum right he is standing outside the door

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:08.160
 and i never met wesley didn't know him but i recognized his face i think he used to be on twitter uh but i

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.400
 he worked at a bs still worked at a bs sorry i recognized him i was like i know you from somewhere

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.680
 and he was like i don't know you from anyway so we struck up a conversation i just told him like

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.440
 this is my first reinvent i'm exhausted i think i'm just going to go back to my room and he had been

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.680
 to like a lot of reinvents and he's like yeah it's a lot you need to just pace yourselves at these

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.680
 tech conferences it's like oh it's my first tech conference well it's nice meeting you and i went

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.920
 to my room and i went to bed uh next tech conference i got to is render in atlanta uh like six months

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.760
 later and as i said had too much to drink i'm on the rooftop bar there's like a party thing after

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.240
 one of the nights at render and i go to the bathroom and i come out and guess who i run into

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:55.520
 Wesley Faulkner two conferences two appearances i decided at that point he's my guardian angel

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.640
 he's just showing up whenever i need to be like put to bed

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:06.880
 and like telling me to slow down and go go home at him uh no so i have conversation with him this

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.400
 i'm pretty drunk so it was a little like i was probably way too much i was just like oh my god

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:19.360
 Wesley i remember you from tech the reinvent thing and i had never like whatever i had never

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.120
 met you and now i've seen you at both tech conferences i've been to so flash forward

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.600
 to uh last month when i went to twitchcon in vegas guess who was at twitchcon are you serious

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.720
 wesley Faulkner for his first time he never known to twitchcon he went just because he wanted to like

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.920
 see what it was all about he works at amazon you know i check out this twitch thing i bumped into

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.120
 him the first day and it was at primes panel it was just like i'm really convinced he's not a real

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.760
 person he's not really following me somehow around he's not real he's an angel or something and the

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.760
 fact that he's on linkedin doesn't really help either because i don't think anyone right in

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.360
 is a real person none of the people on linkedin are real yes sorry that was a really long story to

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.240
 kick off you just you just started the stream on twitter and i just went on this giant story telling

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.080
 adventure sorry about that but you said he didn't have twitter so you followed him on linkedin or

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.640
 you connected on linkedin yes that's how we yeah so we're connect on linkedin uh linkedin is good

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:17.520
 everybody i don't know all that to say linkedin place to find angels and heroes and everything

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:26.160
 absolutely heroes uh that that uh weird vc event i went to a few weeks ago i saw someone like two

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.720
 people met or like we were in a group and someone was like oh let me get your contact info and they

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.920
 pulled out their linkedin app and they had like a linkedin qr code and they like scanned it and

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:43.440
 i was like wow wow what is this world i was like i was like i hope nobody asked me to do that because

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.880
 i have to be like i don't have linkedin and they probably give me a little bit weird like what do

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.920
 you mean you're not linkedin like how do you get anything done in this world uh but yeah like in

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.400
 that world it's just all done through linkedin so yeah they went from business cards printed in

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.120
 their pocket to linkedin qr codes did you ever have a business card someone gave me a business card

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.800
 at that meeting and i was like wow when people still care around i mean like if you ever had one with

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:13.920
 with dax on it like i think i yeah i think i did yeah i did i'm not judging i don't think i ever

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.080
 used it no no i'm not like hesitant i'm just like trying to remember yeah i think i did i'd like to

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.520
 so a company that acquired my first company i remember they printed up business cards and i had

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.920
 a bunch and i don't remember ever carrying them around or ever giving out a single one yeah yeah

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.560
 no so we we had them it sent me is like when we were like five people yeah which is funny now

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.280
 looking back and i don't know if i ever gained anybody i know i had some i had like a little box

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.800
 of them yeah it's just a fun relic from the past it's like now we all kind of know like what i don't

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.640
 know i guess it's maybe it's not a relic maybe people still pass them around i don't know i guess

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.880
 that i just i got one the other day but the thing i don't get is like i don't know why he gave it to me

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.800
 he should just let me take a picture of it because now he's got to like restock the one i took and

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.240
 also i don't remember where i put it i think it's like in my pocket somewhere and it might have went

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.680
 through the laundry so it's just it's just not i lose yeah any physical piece of paper is just

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.960
 toast there's no way i'm keeping that thing it's going to end up in the trash the iPhones have like

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:19.920
 that nfc thing now where you can like put them together and then you can get contact info oh but

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.920
 i don't necessarily want like share it i don't want every random person i need to be in my

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.840
 contact book i guess oh that's another topic have you looked at your contact list lately i've

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:35.360
 cleaned mine up i've cleaned mine up and it's in a great spot okay i've had that to do for like 10

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.320
 years yeah like since my first iPhone i've had a concept yeah it's i've never cleaned it up and

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.480
 sometimes i end up in it like when i'm trying to i don't know just trying to call somebody and you

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.120
 don't go to the recents you just like start scrolling and you see some names in there they're like oh

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:55.200
 wow that's a that's a child just like some random person from high school yeah exactly what are

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.360
 they doing in here like what would happen if you hit that number your whole life could change oh it's

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.360
 true they probably don't have the same number at this point right i don't know how numbers aren't

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.800
 exactly like permalinks feel like i've had a lot of my friends have had the same phone number forever

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:14.000
 i've had a ton really if you're in tech you just like rotate phone numbers because you like don't

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.200
 fear that switch you like do it more yeah i like that it for stupid reasons a bunch of times but yeah

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.720
 my friends have had the same phone numbers since they were let's have got the first one i kind of

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.800
 like the reset to be honest sometimes it's like doing backups from your phone like when you get

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:32.480
 a new phone sometimes i just don't i'm like now i start over yeah yeah it's nice my my bank you

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.360
 use mercury right i use mercury yeah and i use bricks for my other one oh right rags you actually

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:43.200
 have a startup uh when i was on bricks they like they booted me cycled all our cards yeah i got

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.120
 boo different bricks that was the whole thing but then mercury i think this is the second time

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:53.360
 they've cycled my debit cards yeah the debit card but i don't use a debit card at all oh really

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.840
 what did i use i use their credit card i use their uh no because mercury has

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:03.840
 their credit card they have a credit card how do i not know this okay the only reason i use it is

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.240
 because i don't have to have like a separate credit card it's nice just have it all integrated

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.000
 in one place yeah i know i'd rather just have it all in one place yep i totally hear you but the

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.920
 annoying thing is you have to keep 50k in that bank account and like i only want to keep like 25k

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.800
 in there so it's it's like a little bit a little a little annoying yeah that's a big buffer for

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.200
 what i do intro how do you know they had them it's not like an amazing what it's two percent cashback

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.040
 but whatever that's like pretty much roughly the same as what you get is it called a merchant card

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:39.200
 their standard card no it's called i/o it's like mercury i/o like it's a different thing okay i'm

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:46.400
 gonna look into this maybe more if i did maybe not what i was gonna say the reason we got on this

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.520
 track uh they just cycled my debit card everything was set up with that debit card and it's kind of

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:57.040
 nice it's like a resetting of all your sass subscriptions and stuff no this doesn't happen anymore

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:03.600
 what have you not seen what's been happening lately no so i am a prolific loser of credit cards like

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:09.920
 i will lose my credit card several times a year and before when i would get a new number

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.520
 so this is my personal credit card so amx not the mercury one yeah i would have to go and update

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.520
 everything and it was a little annoying but it was fine because it was a reset right now i don't

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:23.360
 have to update anything because it just updates automatically every single place yep are you serious

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.600
 they just call get my new card which is so annoying because it's how do they do that i think it's because

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.960
 they've all integrated with something like stripe and then stripe does that because there is some

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:40.800
 like protocol for like uh credit card carriers to push okay numbers okay so maybe just not with

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.520
 debit cards yeah maybe you can't escape you can't escape uh yeah it might be it might be mine were

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.920
 all like i was just noticing all my payments were failing like what's going on oh they changed my

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:57.040
 debit card yeah but if you have like any of those like fancier credit cards like amax or chase or

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:02.080
 buy even like the apple card yeah it's it just updates it works very nice so i do have an apple

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.160
 card i don't think i don't think i have any other credit cards anymore i used to have like the

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.640
 travel cards and do all the like nerd wallet stuff where like we put everything on it and we got the

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.280
 points and starwood preferred and blah blah blah i used to do all that and then eventually we were

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:20.320
 just like you know it sucks not knowing how much we spent this month until like we paid a credit card

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:25.040
 maybe we should just use our debit card and then we did it sucks having to put a pin in but it's

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.040
 kind of nice like wait hey i don't understand why you have that problem what do you mean you don't

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.640
 know how much you spent to under the month because there's no good personal finance tools tax you

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:38.880
 need to go oh no i mean it was just like you have like two different things you have your balance

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.040
 like in your checking account but then you have like a credit card balance so it's like if you're

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.600
 not looking at both you don't really know i don't know it was just like this delay among i think

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:53.360
 we went to the other extreme we only use our credit card so that's what we did so just to get

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.200
 maximized the points or whatever we paid the balance every month but we only used a credit card for

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.680
 everything and then eventually we did like the amex platinum and all that i mean we were just like

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.880
 doing the whole thing and then eventually we just got tired of like the like we weren't spending

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.760
 money we were like building a number up and then paying and then spending money on that number

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.760
 it just felt weird there's like a delay so here's my setup the thing with the other thing i like with

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.360
 the mercury so my business account is a mercury bank account that effectively is is like my

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.880
 whole bank account it's like the only one that i really have uh that has that credit card but that

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:33.280
 credit card gets paid every day oh it pays it every day so like it's it's just like moving between

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:38.560
 two internal numbers in mercury so it's not like yeah right it did you can set it to pay out every

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:45.440
 day so yeah just all the all the business charges go there um then we we still have our amex we

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:51.120
 enlist each have i have one like everything else goes on there and that does get paid out once

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:58.720
 uh once a month we actually do use some of a good amount of the benefits of uh of the amex

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:05.120
 platinum but i don't like optimizing the points or anything i feel like it's a lot of work yeah

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:12.160
 and just like a general cashback thing is like almost the same yeah no i'd prefer just the cashback

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.800
 thing i think we are starting to travel again and it looks like we're only going to travel more and

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:23.360
 more because kc like travels revival stuff i'm traveling for just do stuff that sounds so dumb

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.040
 it's not dumb uh embracing it out loud i'm embracing it i'm a traveling white belt okay

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.320
 listen i want to get the competition experience now so that at bluebell every time you say that

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:41.600
 that you're gonna say i'm a traveling white man like i forget that it's white belt i mean i am that too

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:47.760
 both things can be true uh yeah no we're like booking travel a lot and it just feels like we're

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.320
 probably leaving a lot of travel whatever miles on the table or whatever but i don't know i don't

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.400
 lose sleep over it it's just hard yeah i don't think it's that much more compared to just i mean

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.840
 yeah a debit card you're not getting any back so but i did it right it's been a cashback card and

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.400
 like doing the travel point optimization i don't know if there's enough of a difference for me to

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.440
 care that said we do spend all of our points from a max on travel that's like the only thing we

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.160
 spent it on yeah i do remember getting some free flights like spinning points or miles or whatever

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:22.800
 and it was like this is nice we did it yeah we saved up enough this is like a very linked

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:30.240
 in topic i feel like talking about credit card maxing travel points credit yeah i forgot i was

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:36.320
 looking at your linkedin uh let's see did i ever tell you this scheme we had going with the massive

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.880
 amount of index points we were accruing at one of my previous companies i've heard of this kind of

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:46.240
 thing not from you i don't think or maybe i did but go ahead okay so here's a here's a really funny

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:52.240
 setup so i worked at a company that facilitated transportation for much bigger companies so

00:21:53.920 --> 00:22:01.920
 they would spend like a hundred thousand dollars a month through uber through us uh but it was a

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:07.760
 funny setup where we actually would pay uber first and the company would pay the balance plus

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:13.520
 markup like once a month there was like some kind of yep working capital window but uber accepted

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:20.880
 this payment through a max and i don't understand why they did that so we were a tiny like four or

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:27.440
 five person company and we were spending in amax as much as like a thousand person company and

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:32.640
 literally we had like amax assigned an account manager to manager to us to like schmooze us and

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:38.000
 stuff and give us like free mix tickets and all this stuff and he was like so happy with us because

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.160
 our spend was just growing up without him having to do any of the usual stuff and uh we were literally

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.800
 baking so much that we could fly like one person could fly around trip to like japan every single

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.760
 day like that's how much i make points we were getting and we just turned that into like an employee

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.720
 benefit yeah yeah no kidding though it was really uber that was fronting that because uber was

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:05.120
 paying their amax fee to accept it oh right it's the amax fee so that that fee that three percent they

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.920
 have to pay or whatever what is it is high amax like high plus right yeah i mean do you remember

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.800
 when like people didn't accept amax like i don't know because it was 15 years ago it was like really

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.440
 common but uh i was just so used to people when i'd pull up my amax platinum it's like oh i'm used to

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:24.320
 it you don't accept it that's fine yeah but now it seems like everybody just eats it which is great

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.320
 i guess yeah i mean i i don't know if the cost went down or whatever but yeah uber was eating whatever

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.800
 uber was paying back to amax amax was basically giving us a cut of that yeah that was like this

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:38.720
 funny little scheme and to be honest i think if we like really focus on not growing the team we

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:44.400
 might have been able to fund like our whole business like our whole business could just been like this

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.480
 can you turn that into cash is there a way that could be this cash and that's like the least

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.680
 efficient but but that's a lot of cash like at a certain scale it's yeah it's it's enough

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:58.400
 um i'm just thinking of all the business opportunities now how can i weave open ais

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:07.520
 announcements into this okay create an amazing startup with travel points arbitrage and gpt i don't

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:12.160
 know it's got to be something do you just feel like stress when all these announcements and open

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:17.360
 AI i have this like existential bread not like we're gonna lose our jobs just like i should be

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:23.040
 using it i am a developer i definitely i get what you're talking about for sure it's like i kind

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:30.080
 of feel that but then i another part of me is like i think i'm just in a different phase of my career

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.640
 where like that's not the type of opportunity that makes sense for me i think it's for someone

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.720
 that's earlier on and they can like really get ahead if they catch something early and it's just

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:45.200
 like yeah i don't know it's it's a it's a weird feeling i want to see more yeah i think like

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.640
 i have decided at this point i do not want to build another software company like

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:57.920
 still in the middle of the first one no desire to like be an indie hacker and build like a

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:03.520
 b2b thing or something i don't know i'm not doing that like there's a lot of avenues our careers

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:10.000
 could go and that's just one i've kind of blocked off i think like my problem with all of the people

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.760
 that are jumping in and building things is it's way too many people building a thing they can build

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.640
 in two days because open AI made this new API i was like yeah a million people can build that in two

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:26.560
 days but where are the like existing apps just getting amazing functionality now because this

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:32.240
 stuff's available feel like yeah like established companies that have really cool products and not

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.640
 like the big big ones obviously we've seen a lot of stuff good AI integrated but like the like

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.360
 middle sized companies and applications their thing can just get so much better now if they found the

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:46.880
 right way the creative ways to leverage this stuff right yeah i think it just takes time uh yeah i

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:54.080
 think that's kind of what i was talking about too like i don't think jumping if the if a new announcement

00:25:54.080 --> 00:26:01.440
 from open AI like enables some like one week or one month project that's like not interesting to me

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.480
 because i'm like i don't even know that's gonna make sense and like it should have made the idea

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:12.240
 should have made sense even before the new open AI feature came out and that's yeah i agree that's

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:17.520
 like where i see most of this stuff i i don't know it's it's hard to think about good way to integrate

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.440
 this stuff i'm sure it'll happen but yeah i even like as a user i'm not really using

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:33.360
 AI outside of chat gbt in any product at all yeah no same i just i think i told you i just got

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:39.360
 excited about bedrock as like a way to cost effectively within my own AWS account do some

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.240
 things with llms if i so chose and then i don't know the opening i stuff does make it feel like

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:49.280
 they've got such a lead just like being able to do the image to and from like you can send images

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:55.280
 yeah i know it's like they have a stuff that needs to get like way way way better i try to do bedrock

00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.960
 and function i was like this is a lot worse like meaningfully worse yeah well clod 2 that's on is

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:08.720
 that on bedrock clod 2 did you tell me that was good yeah it's good and that's on bedrock yeah no

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.520
 that's definitely the best option i think but because i heard i heard somebody say like gpt4

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:18.400
 and clod2 are the only llms that really matter right now yes i agree all the others are so far

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:24.560
 all the ones are just like noise yeah but even then i don't know it is it is i i think at the end of

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.520
 the day i just don't have many many good ideas that are like for that's a critical part that said

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.640
 this new open AI the context window increasing like we can shove our whole podcast transcript in there

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.760
 mmm i saw rocks tweet that yeah what would we do he said that and he's like i'm gonna build so

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:45.120
 many things and i couldn't think of the single thing is my brain just so slow you just set a line and

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:51.680
 it was like how i feel at the end of the day i just don't have many ideas out of the out of context

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:58.000
 completely that is how i feel i just don't have a lot of ideas i just don't have many ideas i'm

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.760
 sure there's cool things what yeah what would you do so you stick the whole podcast transcript i

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:07.200
 wouldn't do anything but i think some like riverside could probably do something uh probably

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:12.320
 like or you know the thing we wanted to do where we like automatically generate clips like that's

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:17.840
 another way to do that yeah so clip generation i feel like that should get better because if you

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:24.320
 have the whole episode in context then you can really determine what are the best parts i wonder

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.960
 how they're doing it today if the context is not large enough to fit the whole episode like

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.800
 how do you really know what the best parts of the podcast were if you can't see the whole podcast

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.680
 at once yeah and you could have fit it and clawed this whole time so i don't know maybe if they were

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:43.120
 oh really something different but yeah so yeah that's like the only place where i'm like okay

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:48.880
 there i have a problem and i can see this kind of helping with that problem yeah but in general

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.480
 yeah not a ton of ideas i mean some of those personal finance stuff i definitely want to

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:58.880
 integrate in because i guess that i think that problem is you have to like be you have to be

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:04.000
 disciplined enough not to force it and i think a lot of the places especially even in the big companies

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:10.400
 it feels a little forced because it feels like they need to make sure they have they can say

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.760
 they have it in there to like deter people from thinking oh they're not doing it in the space

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:20.320
 like the Shopify was a great example like they they put AI in there and it looks cool there's

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:25.440
 some cool demos but i'm like this just feels like they only did it so they can say they did it and

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.840
 i'm sure they'll continue to improve it but is it making a difference for anyone like is it on

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:34.240
 the consumer side like if you're on a store that's part of our shop how you'll see this or no no no

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:40.320
 it's more for your like operation stuff but like writing your product descriptions and stuff maybe

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.840
 no i think it was more around like business questions like i don't know it gets to the demos

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:53.120
 are interesting but the question i always have is with all these demos there's always a user

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:58.160
 that has a question that needs to be answered and the demo is them typing in the question and getting

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.720
 the answer from the AI and i always wonder like that's very cool but is that the best way

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.080
 for that user to have asked and answered that kind of answer that question and i think for some

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:14.320
 things yeah but i don't think we have a good handle on on that on that really like i mean even for

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.360
 those personal finance thing like i you can imagine someone being like oh i want to know how much i

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:25.840
 spent on over last month and that could be like a natural language query but is that the best way

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.960
 or is just like a ui grouping like common services that you can just scroll through is that like

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:36.640
 just a better experience yeah you know there's a more discovery in that one versus you having

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.720
 to come up with exactly what you want this is a question we asked for a long time at samus

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:46.640
 like i mean we've been doing NLP stuff for 10 years now and it was it was always like we could

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.320
 build this feature and there's like wait a minute i think that's a feature where like a drop down

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:56.240
 is just better than like it's not actually a thing you're gaining by being able to ask a question

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.640
 for that so there are definitely things like that yeah like sometimes you need to guide the person

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:06.080
 in building the query where you need some kind of a structured UI like a drop down so you know

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:12.000
 what the options are that you can pick from versus just a blank text box so yeah it's like how many

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.760
 things is a blank text box the best input and i don't know like i'm still waiting to see someone

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:23.040
 do it so well where i'm like oh that's how we should all be doing it or like yeah they figured it out

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:30.560
 we're all we're still in the fart app era as jay likes to say i've already seen a lot more of the uh

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:36.800
 just since yesterday with this all these announcements a lot more of the utopia is coming takes like

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.880
 oh my god again people worried about money when we're all about to have everything for free like

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:48.640
 what i guess just gonna snap our fingers and ai's gonna change the world we're all going to just

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:53.440
 sit around and watch it do our bidding yeah i don't i know that just keeps coming up and

00:31:53.600 --> 00:32:00.320
 there's like a so much fear around that but i i have no idea it's just like we talked about

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:05.680
 for just so far removed from anything that i'm seeing in front of me uh it'll be funny if we're

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.400
 wrong and that does happen we're like wow no right it turns out that was it i mean it'd be

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.920
 great we'll have all the time the world to talk about it because we don't have to do anything

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:18.480
 we'll all just have income from the ai yeah it was like debating what the right like the moral use of

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:24.480
 your free time is i think we're a little ahead of ourselves arguments around like that's not a

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:30.960
 good way to spend your free team on it i don't think we're cynical like i think it's just different

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:37.440
 time horizons like sure maybe like on some time horizon humanity figures it all out and we live

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:43.840
 in an era of abundance and there's not so much scarcity maybe i hope so that'd be great but also

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.640
 like i don't remember is there ever been a technology that came along like a transformative

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:54.080
 technology and then like suddenly people worked less like yeah it can't happen until you're

00:32:54.080 --> 00:33:00.240
 you until the last one until the last one there's always work to build the last one is using there

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:06.320
 is the last one yeah it's the hypothetically like uh a tongue and cheek no i don't think hypothetically

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:10.960
 like i don't even know what the last one could i guess the last one would be the one that can

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:18.720
 discover the rest on its own which i guess is mmm ai uh yeah until that's like there's always

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:24.080
 going to be no matter work do you ever think about how there is so much diversity of life

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:33.760
 on our stupid little planet like australia koalas kangaroos like how different just across

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:40.320
 our little planet life has evolved into these very weird shapes and sizes and different things

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:46.000
 and then you think about the size of the universe and you think like what could be out there

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.640
 you know what i mean like even on earth it's like it's crazy that life just finds like every

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:57.680
 simple crevice of earth there's like some form of life yeah something has crawled in there and

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:02.880
 like figured out how to live and every little crack uh it's like it is like a it really feels

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.840
 like an infestation you know i just i don't know the ai thing i just think about like is that the

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:13.120
 natural path that life takes it gets so smart it creates like artificial things that gets

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.800
 so smart that they create i don't know and then i started thinking like we've talked about this

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.920
 before where like it could just be unique to earth that evolving means getting smarter

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:28.240
 it's not necessarily the case on all planets oh right right evolving could mean i mean at one

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:34.400
 point on earth evolving meant getting bigger and with bigger teeth and yeah like scalier and scarier

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.480
 and if that's just a direction permanently like yeah you you would never event ai

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:45.120
 yeah right this went this went into some weird places i should note we talked about we're going

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:51.680
 to take a break mmm that was out of nowhere sorry mmm i don't know why i dropped that in the middle

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.280
 of the podcast but we're gonna take a little holiday break yes are we cool with this text this

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:02.160
 was all in text and i couldn't tell if you like if you know i kissed if no i'm down for it yeah break

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.320
 till next year so this is going to be our last recording yeah i just want to make sure we don't

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:13.440
 lose it you know oh because you're afraid i'll just stop doing a thing you're afraid i'll stop

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:18.480
 doing something because like i'll just do something really really harder than not do it again why would

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:25.840
 i do that now i i had the same mind i've done it as well so yeah yeah no it's easy once something's

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.720
 kind of like shelved to like never take it off the shelf uh we won't we have to get to a hundred

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.400
 there's just there's no way if we had already gotten to a hundred there would be a real flight

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:42.000
 risk here but it's in reality you in your arbitrary goals again like it's just like it's it's never

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.040
 like a small goal it's always like a big goal but then somehow you just stop it just makes no sense

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:54.880
 it's like you know it's like imagine someone working their whole life to get into the nba

00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:00.560
 and they finally get into the nba and then they just they're like oh this is good enough for me i'm done you know i'm done and they

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.800
 retire immediately that would be yeah that would be extreme but i guess i've been things that are

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:10.800
 similarly yeah that's like i took your your concept it's my thing yeah i'm a printer that i didn't

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:16.640
 explain the break so we've got holiday travel i've got holiday travel i don't know you don't travel

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:21.760
 anymore i forgot but like would have been out next week anyway and then it's like december is just

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:32.000
 like one big christmas tree yes and like it's just like it's like a whole holiday month and honestly

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.960
 for me it's like i've felt so much anxiety over not recording the podcast not publishing not putting

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:43.760
 it out there like we've got chris who helps so much it's just the like i'm not doing any of the thing

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.400
 like the the little clips anymore i did that for like a couple weeks stuff when you do to grow it yeah

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.880
 and that like grows it that obviously when you start doing that like you just you're getting

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:57.120
 yourself out there in front of more people that can resonate that you know more people also that

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.560
 are like those guys are idiots i don't want to listen to them but you get more people that are

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:04.320
 like i would like to listen to them and you just kind of have to do that you just have to like

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:11.440
 it's just the the content hamster wheel of like get your little selves out there and

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:15.760
 not doing it gives me a lot of anxiety but also just don't really have the energy to do it i don't

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.320
 know why like i have the energy to do a lot of things i don't know why that just sucked my soul

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:25.680
 enough that i haven't done it so it's like i need a little pause i think the holidays are a nice

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.800
 little reset and then yeah new year get back on that and find a sustainable rate of doing it i did

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.800
 wait too many i was doing like 10 clips for every episode it was just intense that's the thing i do

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:42.880
 yeah just a little just a little just like a couple for each episode you know and we can start

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.680
 posting on linkedin we can post them on linkedin i'm going to spend this holiday break on linkedin

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:52.960
 if you'd like to hang out with me uh i've already connected with aj's on linkedin i just forget

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.200
 all these same people we hang out with twitter on twitter are they're on linkedin not all of them

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:01.440
 just there's like three of them on linkedin but i mean just because they have a linkedin account

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:06.880
 this is pretty sure they're all on linkedin i just they just don't tweet about it really hey i

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:12.160
 hate that that's the stupid little art style that linkedin has like with all their illustrations

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:17.440
 what where just like those like color just whenever i mean i don't know if you can see any but whenever

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.760
 there's like there's an illustration style on linkedin for whenever they do an illustration of

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:28.320
 something oh like linkedin themselves yeah yeah or people oh i see oh yeah i see one right now and

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:36.960
 so it just reminds me of like just generic like 2015 landing badge that enterprise it's also just

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:43.680
 like what if if we all get on there it'll be fun if we don't the few of the vests that do it like

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:49.920
 you're just throwing yourselves to the wolves it's just constant like to spam from these recruiters

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.280
 it's like the whole purpose of linkedin is just to get you in front of recruiters i feel like

00:38:53.280 --> 00:39:00.080
 or is that just the software that the messaging the like my message tab has like a million messages

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:08.800
 from people oh look a message from kdc you're part of an exclusive group of new experts wow man

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.920
 how exciting look at you we're bringing together top experts to share their knowledge

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:21.520
 wow yeah it's just hard to know what's real on linkedin nothing's not these people

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:30.480
 yeah messaging tab it's just all ads it's all ads from random people yeah it really is

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.320
 whoa someone's looking for an elixir engineer

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:42.400
 hey hey you know elixir uh-huh right don't you oh look now there is a recruiter selling me

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:50.240
 recruiting services mmm yeah like he will recruit for you on your behalf yeah

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:58.800
 again i see stuff from bank of america for some reason why why why seven connections follow bank

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:04.720
 of america why would you follow bank america why would yeah why would you follow bank america

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:10.320
 i'm they have hashtags people use hashtags on linkedin that's actually a thing hashtag i really do top

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:17.840
 free hashtag ai courses i actually see a piece of content that i like i just scrolled along enough

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:23.600
 to to see something i like it's a chart from from uh cost and usage in AWS and i've been

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:28.480
 staring at those a lot lately so it grew up my attention and the content is good

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:33.680
 it's good content there might be really good AWS stuff on yes i think it's like twitter you have

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:38.400
 to put in work secure at your feet i understand what type of bad stuff can happen and once you

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:45.920
 get that then you probably have a good situation yeah it's just good i'm excited i'm gonna post on

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:51.280
 linkedin probably about as much as i do on twitter i'm gonna put capitals in my linkedin posts i

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:56.720
 don't know if you noticed this uh i won't be all lowercase on linkedin so i'm putting on my fake

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:05.440
 my fake self capital you're already not being treated wearing my mask i know i'm just gonna ignore

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:10.640
 your uh reply i hearted the other two i'm just gonna ignore yours completely someone like mine

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:16.720
 yeah i'm just gonna troll every single one of your posts i'm just telling you now that's

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.880
 one reason i got on that sounds fun that sounds fun i feel like aga probably strikes right balance

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:26.240
 on linkedin so like he's got a nice he might be the same person on both yeah i think so we're gonna

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:34.400
 we're gonna see i am gonna like a professional oh my god but not annoying professional vibe

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:44.160
 what were you saying i followed him and i asked if i wanted to turn on post notifications oh look

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:48.000
 he has a link on his profile ask me about your cold starts

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:57.920
 that's awesome he really is the cold star guy isn't he he just he does all the work that everyone's

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:03.280
 way too lazy to do i feel like he's really good at doing the work and everybody else is like i

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:08.800
 wish somebody would do that work and he does the work he does the work and then i just take credit

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:17.200
 for it this is mine i love that folks from j oh man i do we have the most toxic work culture

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:21.280
 i think we might you probably do you guys troll each other really hard on twitter

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:27.360
 but it seemed good fun so is it really toxic i'm out there trying to like you know talking

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:32.000
 about the thing that i worked on and like the exciting direction we're going in jay just like

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:40.080
 look at his idiot you guys understand social media so i don't think you're toxic i think you

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:45.040
 want to be perceived as toxic i'm sorry you're not the sunday war the the meetings on sunday that's

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:50.560
 a little i don't know maybe a little toxic i love it you just parked up you just got excited i just

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:57.120
 love everyone hates it uh dare you have meaning us what is the deal with weekends can i be honest i

 that the world stops it's like i get so excited on monday that like okay finally a business day

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.880
 things can start happening again there's things that need to happen but like what do you mean the

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:17.840
 world stops let's stop just like all the things that are in progress if you got people working for

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.280
 you on stuff you're excited for them to keep working on that stuff because you want to see

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:26.560
 the progress there's no better feeling than like there's a thing being done right now

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:32.240
 by someone else and i'm excited for the outcome i love that feeling i just love hiring people to do

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:37.840
 stuff and i love like when they finally surface something it's like oh it's so good yeah you're

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:42.080
 right that is great that is that is great but it stops on the weekends because everybody goes to

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:47.840
 their family barbecues and whatever and then like i don't know you got stuff shipping you got stuff

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.080
 coming to you can't get it on the week i guess that's changed stuff delivers on the weekend that's

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:57.920
 changed a lot yeah people yeah i know i guess different areas because my friend just moved to

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:04.480
 portland main and everything shuts super early and like stuff just is not open on the weekend and

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:11.520
 i'm like damn that is annoying if i had to like i was nice for them people who work but not so nice

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:16.000
 for everybody that lives but like it's it's just like i think it's just a decision like he was

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.480
 just grabbing it's funny because it's not like everywhere else they're forcing everyone to work

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:25.440
 seven days a week they're just staying open and having additional employees that overlap shifts

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:30.400
 on the weekend i'm assuming their day off their day off is on different days yeah on like he's there

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:37.040
 whatever he was like he's like he was like he was like oh Alan he lives in portland main sorry you

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.320
 just moved from new york yeah like uh the beginning of the summer yeah he's like is there some kind of

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:49.760
 agreement between all like the stores being like nobody violate this treaty and open on saturday

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:55.120
 because a moment one one of you does it we all have to do it but like there is a crazy incentive

00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:00.800
 to be the first one to do that but they haven't but somehow no one's knowing it's like wow there's

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:06.960
 like a social contract it's interesting when like a town can do something like that when they can

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:13.200
 kind of set themselves apart and be like kind of it's progressive in a way like we're gonna push

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:19.920
 back on the the pace of society and like the american defacto like go as hard as you can

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:27.280
 it's nice when you said portland main my brain went why did you say the state i know where portland

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:34.400
 is and i was like oh yeah there's two points yeah that's why that's why you said it always got

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:39.920
 a clarify that's great for them but someone like me won't move there and that's fine they don't want

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:46.160
 so i know well yeah i mean i couldn't i couldn't do it but what's what's Alan's does he know people

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:51.600
 in main is that is he from there originally uh so his family it's his weird quince so his family

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:56.720
 used to spend a lot of summers in main like they had a house there and he grew up in san francisco

00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:02.960
 maybe spend a bunch of summers there and then his uh fiancee is from main so her family's there oh

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:06.800
 but they back in new york like that was just a go random quince and it's the main thing so they're

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:12.400
 gonna they're living there for they're getting married next summer and they're gonna live there

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:18.080
 get married there and then grab where they're gonna go that's awesome but yeah it seems nice

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:23.680
 like portland main seems very cool very nice oh he's in the sun yeah no i've heard good things

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.320
 i've i've always wanted to visit like that area of the country i'm gonna have been to like boston

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:34.960
 and we drove down the coast of canadicate but i've never been like further towards me yeah i've

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:39.520
 been to main before i went whale watching when i was a kid in main and we were getting really sick

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:45.280
 on the boat i did see some whales though is that like a winter thing only in main probably i have no

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:49.920
 idea i think i was kind of wild coming back yeah okay i just i have more questions but i'm not gonna

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:55.920
 ask what kind of whales it doesn't matter never i think they were humpback whales probably hump

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.760
 back is what i was thinking yeah okay you know we used to see whales in the hudson too every once

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:06.960
 in a while what for real yeah like right next to manhattan yeah how about that learn something new

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:12.400
 every day whales they get everywhere so i'm really hungry i'm really like i want to eat so

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:17.280
 bad and it's so hard to not be distracted every thought when you're hungry every thought is just

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:23.600
 like oh whales in the hudson man i could use some food man i could eat a whale it's like it's like a

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:29.360
 it's just at the end of everything i think it's like i want to eat i have to cut i have to lose

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:36.000
 six more five more pounds in less than two weeks i think i can do it otherwise your wife will leave

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:45.920
 you no no i'm committed to a weight class that i am not in but i'm gonna get there and i don't know

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:51.040
 if i can i don't know if i can actually lose that much i'm gonna have to like do the dehydrate thing

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:56.560
 so you're eating less and like doing much of cardio is all you're doing yeah i wear a weight vest around

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:01.840
 the house and i'm just doing pull-ups and push-ups and squats and running up my stairs constantly would

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:06.880
 you tell siri to stop it try and talk about it you know what siri just said siri just went virtual

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:12.400
 assistance don't eat like i thought i was asking thank you for that color commentary what is this

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:19.200
 going to get replaced in lm when is siri google home all that's seriously is the worst it's been and i

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:25.600
 think about that era like the alexa google assistant siri i mean siri was the first right of the major

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:31.760
 voice assistant so i don't remember they're all so bad now compared to like if you use the open AI

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:36.880
 the chat gpt voice thing yeah it's so crazy it feels so crazy talking to that thing yeah

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:43.680
 yeah i use my google home a lot so i wanted to be replacing the lm asap yeah same i bet google

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:48.320
 they'll do that right they'll be there i'm not sure about alexa's always been the one thing

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:54.480
 i'll say about open AI and about chat gpt and just probably the current generation of lm's more broadly

00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:00.320
 they're so verbose and they're so dorky like can somebody fix the problem where they just like

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:04.800
 everything they say is so dorky is that just the product of being average like when you average

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:11.920
 out all of human history is just dorky yeah it really makes you think about the concept of taste

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:19.040
 and what it means because fundamentally this thing is showing us that the average can never be

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:26.560
 tasteful but it makes you wonder are there people that yes like the way chat gpt sounds is there

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:32.240
 anyone out there that's like yeah that sounds good i bet people on linkedin do i feel the type of

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:38.480
 people that would like that would show lincoln maybe can we stream on lincoln uh we got the streaming

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.880
 to twitter for yeah we can't age and stream on lincoln oh it's really a thing yeah you stream to

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:48.080
 lincoln i was really just being stupid but we can actually stream live to lincoln okay next podcast

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:54.720
 in the new year we're streaming to lincoln i can't wait that's builder linkedin audience over the

00:49:54.720 --> 00:50:00.720
 next yes two months and then we'll drop and then we're streaming yes oh we will not we will not fit

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.280
 in especially in a live setting but we're gonna try if there were if there's such a thing is good

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:15.120
 taste that implies bad taste yes people who have bad taste still prefer they still like appreciate

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:19.840
 good things right they're just not capable of like yes making it themselves conceptualizing it

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:24.880
 yeah so i feel like someone that's a good point you know what i mean like i feel like everyone the

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:30.080
 masses can understand when like a big paragraph just sounds dorky and dumb and like nobody talks

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:37.200
 like that i feel like everyone can appreciate that but only so many people can write good right

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:43.040
 well here's here's the thing with chat gpt though like you can tell it to respond in the style of

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:48.160
 x and x could be something that you feel if you ever gotten it to be like something you would want

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:53.200
 to like post send your name or something uh i haven't used it for this purpose but so lizz is

00:50:53.200 --> 00:51:00.400
 on us a bunch where she needed to do a bunch of copywriting like brand copywriting and she

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:06.320
 identified a brand whose voice she likes a lot and then she really wrote like write this in the style

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:12.560
 of you know the brand and it's not getting nailed it but it did enough where she could like take it the

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:19.440
 last ten percent and ended up with a good result okay so yeah you still need people kind of creating

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:24.000
 that so you can like say like copy them but it is funny because now anyone can have it like those

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.200
 people would have hadn't been hired yeah before to do that but now they put it out there it's uh

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:36.160
 you can emulate it pretty easily so yeah like it's kind of weird like can i just tell chat gpt

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:43.360
 to always talk like x person that i like no matter what it's answering but that might solve it i

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:48.640
 guess if they're a public enough figure and they've they've put out enough stuff on the internet then

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:54.800
 huh i'm gonna see if it can do the primogen can i just respond to everything like the primogen

00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:02.800
 is that what you want is that what you're uh no is that what your ideal communication

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:07.680
 oh i'm i'm too dorky to be the primogen no not as yourself i mean to interact with it's not like i

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.440
 want to sound like this person it's like when i get answers from chat jbt yeah so i guess i'm not

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:17.440
 thinking about like how it responds to me and i have to endure reading the dorky text it's more like

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:22.880
 i'm generally using it trying to create like generating stuff like website copy or i don't know

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:28.000
 just like a response to somebody like if you're ever trying to create stuff that you would send

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:34.240
 somebody or put into something it's just it sounds so like i would never use those words but that's

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:40.800
 why this job of this taste job hasn't gone away like you now need to go and curate you have decent

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.800
 taste you want you need to curate things that match what you think is good taste and then give

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:50.320
 that to chat gpt and have it feed that to chat gpt okay and now that the context window has

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:55.520
 is the increased context window the gpt4 turbo stuff made into chat gpt or not i don't think so i

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.200
 think it's only the api right now interesting they're curating that stuff is still going to be

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:04.960
 important i guess the the style that it speaks to me doesn't bother me the verbosity does and it

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:09.920
 always like puts so much pressure on like coming up with something else to say it like i have to come

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:15.200
 up with another follow-up question i want to just be more chill i want to like say half as much

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:20.240
 and then just be like i'll be here if you need me and then i can just thank you for what you know

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.920
 i mean it's always like i know you mean it's like all the time we're like all right what's next what's

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:31.600
 next you would like to dive into like i don't have anything else yeah i hate that yeah i feel like

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:36.480
 with the right system prompt you can probably get it have you played with the system prompts i i

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:41.200
 kind of know what they are it's like chat gpt don't people do a lot with them i i i haven't done much

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:46.320
 with it i've done a few things that annoy me like i i make sure it knows i'm like a technical

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.800
 person so that when it gives me answers it doesn't need to like explain what a computer is you know

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:55.760
 it's yeah yeah you can just tell me the end answer for those who don't know the system prompt is sort

00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:02.480
 of like you are a lab assistant at stanford and you're going to like that stuff right that's the

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:07.920
 system prompt for now like we're telling it what it is and what it should how it should also like

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:13.520
 your preferences like i prefer like i am a software engineer i prefer brief answers like

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:17.680
 show me code examples instead of explaining like you can just like any like annoyance you have

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:21.600
 you can just throw in there ultimately all it's doing is like copy pacing that back into the

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:27.520
 top of the oh every single one of your problem effectively sort of i only want yaml yeah exactly

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:32.080
 like the list of languages that you typically use like oftentimes i ask it cdk questions and it

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:39.600
 gives me python cdk mmm like nobody wants python cdk go only please go

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:48.480
 why is the cdk in multiple languages i wish i wish we had stats on the distribution

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:53.840
 yeah there's no way to get that is there we just went a lot of different places at a very short

00:54:53.840 --> 00:55:01.040
 amount of time i know the chapters in our podcast are hilarious well hey there's something that

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:04.800
 the new context window could help with oh yeah we can just throw the whole thing in there and we

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:09.920
 can say hey coach us tell us how we should stay on one topic what should i have topic what should

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:14.480
 our topic have been this episode what should we have spent more time it'll stay linked in like you

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:19.520
 should have dove more into the intricacies of professional manner behavior on linkedin

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:27.840
 we still have to do a fully ai version of our fully ai episode all right i so i have access to a

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:33.280
 thing that looks pretty good in terms of creating ai videos if you had it too we could make like

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:38.400
 we could just like type out a podcast or have chat gbc create one yeah yeah exactly it's not

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:44.800
 in the new context okay we're doing this we take all of our previous podcast whatever fits in

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:50.960
 128 000 tokens and we feed it in and we say this is gonna cost like 20 dollars isn't it we feed it

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:56.240
 in and we say write a whole new podcast episode 60 minutes please and then we take that and we dump

00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:00.640
 it into the video thing and we make this is gonna be great have you seen the hacker news automatically

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:06.560
 generated podcasts no okay so they generate like a not joking one yeah so i think it's a company

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:11.040
 that company there's a company behind it it's like a new company i think it might be a yc company

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:17.040
 they are like trying to build tools to build ai podcast and to demo their stuff they do like a

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:22.880
 daily hacker news podcast it's very it's surprisingly good like it has all like that podcast music and

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:27.440
 like the different transitions and everything yeah and yeah it's just it's just an ai voice

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:32.160
 describing like some of the top things uh like summarizing what was in the article talking about

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:37.200
 the debates that happened in the comments and it sounds pretty good like i was waiting for

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:42.320
 something in my car the other day and i headed on i was like wow it's it's a little slow i think i

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:48.640
 would like tune it a little bit but it's way better than i expected it's a great way to catch up on

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:54.080
 everything interesting man are we getting into a world where there's like just all the

00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:58.080
 contents automatically made and people aren't doing anything but that's content about other

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:03.840
 content you know yeah well what someone doesn't make the other content still what other content

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:10.880
 like that ai podcast is content about articles people wrote and comments people wrote oh okay

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:16.480
 yeah yeah but like i don't know could i feel like we could actually just pass in our dumb transcripts

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:21.760
 and it could probably spit out something that looks like one of our podcast episodes

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.960
 and we could just be on autopilot and we'd never show up on the mic again right yeah maybe and like

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:31.920
 that's true if we feed it all of our transcripts and then every week we just give it a bunch of

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:36.800
 stuff to happen on our news and on twitter like i feel like i could actually do it and then what

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:42.160
 are we even doing anymore like what us humans listening to fake humans talk about things like

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:47.280
 what just seems like i don't know the matrix or something we're all hooked up with our brain tubes

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:53.200
 to the thing and i don't know there's a milestone i'm waiting for man to reach and i'm very excited

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:59.680
 for it because i think it like it's representative of a lot of things changing at that point which is

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:06.000
 i'm waiting for the first movie star to license their likeness oh that's kind of happened isn't it

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.080
 and let a studio make a movie that they had no part in and i think we're not that far from that

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:17.280
 i feel like that's like within ten years of technology will be cost-efficient to like do that yeah i mean

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:22.160
 if they can already create south park episodes how hard would it be to create yeah like the voice

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:27.040
 now like the voice generation that's like is very good and you can also it's not to be that crazy

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:32.880
 either you can have another actor doing the acting and then just overlaying and then just

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:38.320
 replace their face yeah yeah just a double and i mean they do that already like they're already

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:43.520
 like 80 percent fake right like yeah exactly so much of that's not real camera footage and they've

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:49.920
 done it with actors that have died like when prince uh was he actually says oh yeah uh huh uh

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:55.120
 they did that with her they did that with a few people and yeah it's still definitely a little

00:58:55.120 --> 00:59:00.400
 bit uncanny valley but i can see how next couple owners it'll get there yeah so it's a point like

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:05.360
 yeah like what what is your job as an actor it's to get famous enough that you have an audience yeah

00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:11.600
 and then from then on you can produce other movies a year if you want you know and that's what we

00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:17.680
 need more movies on netflix with the same actors yeah like it's not already impossible to sift through

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:23.680
 the amount of movies we could watch a positive spin on this though is a good actor can play a role

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:28.960
 that they don't have the right look for but they maybe have everything else you know how what do you

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:37.920
 mean if i am the right person to play i don't know elon musk in some elon musk biopic i'm like

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:43.440
 the best actor i'm like so good at acting like elon musk i can't do that because i look nothing

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:49.520
 like him like i would never get that role so it could look like elon musk but it's you you have like

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:54.400
 the mannerisms down or something yeah like that or like i'm just like the right person to like if

00:59:54.400 --> 01:00:00.640
 you look nothing like the person how could you be the best person but it's it's possible right but

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:07.040
 you can look like the person and not be a good actor at all so that's true yeah okay and there's

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.480
 been probably plenty of those the thing i brought up so i'm talking a lot about this exact topic

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:17.600
 yesterday uh andy circus played golem and smegel and lord of the rings yes and that was fantastic

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:24.160
 acting and he's done that a bunch of times he played uh uh like the chimp in the kind of day it's

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:31.680
 really an amazing job but he had the mannerisms of like a non-human creature so people can do it

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:36.160
 interest and he didn't have to look like those things at all and we've kind of already done that

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:40.640
 but now doing it with like other real people huh yeah there's actually a movie about this concept

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:47.280
 too there's a movie where like it's about the future where uh what an actress licenses ourselves yeah are

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:52.480
 you serious is this oh okay good movie my brain hurts i don't know where we're headed

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:59.200
 tomorrow i want to use your likeness and make content that would be fun please do i'd love to not

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.960
 make content for a bit that'd be great it won't be content you like oh well can't be beggars can't

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:11.920
 be choosers right yeah well this is it's like a goodbye i know i'm not gonna talk to you till next

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.720
 year stop it no that's the thing i told you we have to still get on the phone or just i gonna record

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.920
 it and i'm not going to you for not promoting it i don't want to talk to you unless it's being

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:29.200
 recorded because i don't know what you're going to say to me i'm not going to feel safe unless it's

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:35.920
 being streamed in real time oh man to several people streamed on linkedin specifically to several

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:42.560
 people yeah but yeah this is a goodbye well i do have i do have to pee and as far as everyone knows

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:49.280
 i'll be peeing until the new year they don't know that i'll ever stop peeing because they're gonna

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:54.720
 hear i had to go pee i'm gonna leave to pee and the next thing you'll hear is sometime in january you

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.040
 might not i mean you might never come back coming back in january might not they might just think i

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:04.640
 died i'm saying you might not come back yeah what there's no guarantees in life that's true we might

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:10.640
 just replace me with an ai adam i'm not dropping it forever we'll be back when there'd be a crazy

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.440
 ending though what what would be the ending it would be a crazy ending to the whole series if the

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.960
 last thing we're saying is like we're gonna come back and then we just never come but that not that

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:25.360
 crazy that seems very plausible to me it does look very the most likely outcome if i do replace you

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:29.760
 i'm gonna pick i have to pick someone that would like really enrage you that would like really

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:33.600
 annoy you i don't know who that person would be yet but that would definitely be my angle i think of

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.600
 somebody that that fits the bill but would be funny and i won't feel like they're gonna hear

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.640
 it and be offended can't think of anybody i got not very good at spotlight i think about it thought

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.960
 there was that there was the line earlier in the podcast what was it i just don't have many ideas

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:56.400
 i just don't have many ideas i just don't have many ideas i think it's a day i just don't have

01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:01.040
 any ideas let's sign off with that all right we'll see you next yeah
