WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
 Dax, do you use Daxchess?

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.380
 I don't use Daxchess, but I did watch the conference, and because I don't use Daxchess,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.820
 I was pretty confused for most of it, so I honestly would just love for you to explain

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.340
 to me everything they're talking about.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.340
 Oh geez.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.500
 I don't know what percentage you understood, but probably more than I did.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:42.380
 [music]

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.380
 I use Daxchess all the time.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.820
 I think that's been my default for like three years, and I'm so confused.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.100
 All the React18 stuff has been confusing me for weeks, months, I don't know, a long time,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.820
 and now I'm just, I've literally just finished watching all of the next Daxchess Comp videos,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.060
 so my headspace right now is I'm swimming in information.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.060
 Overwhelmingly, I feel like it's so much to take in, and yet so little.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.700
 If you think about the big conference, or the big keynote bullet points, or the three things,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.640
 it's like Turbo Pack, so all the rebuilt we'll talk about, all the build tooling, it's like

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.260
 the Apple Silicon move, they're doing it all in house, they're building it all in Rust.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.380
 Then there's the layouts RFC, so there's, that's like the whole routing, next 13, like

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.900
 the core of it is this layouts RFC, which we'll talk about, and then the third thing

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.340
 was like components that make things nicer, like using images and fonts.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.660
 It's like higher level web stuff, okay?

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:57.700
 So the first one, I think the reason I feel so overwhelmed and confused, oh geez, I just

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.860
 woke up and started watching videos this morning.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.620
 Dax is having a look at like my hairs everywhere, mad scientist style.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.860
 The overwhelming feeling I have, I think is because of React 18, I think it's just I still

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.380
 don't fundamentally understand, maybe you understand some of the React 18 stuff.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.580
 That's where I really struggle is like, high level I understand server components, but trying

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.380
 to like parse out what is React versus what is next versus what is Vercelle just feels

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.380
 like this impossible task.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.860
 So that's like my high level meta comments and thoughts, I don't know, like you asked

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.340
 a specific question and I'm just rambling, because it's early and I don't know.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.900
 I mean, overview is helpful.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.980
 Yeah, on that last point, what is next, what is React, what is Vercelle?

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.420
 I think the thing you said is accurate, they're kind of like Apple, trying to own every piece

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.220
 of it all the way down to the build tooling, which results in probably really cool experiences

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.860
 like very cohesive if you're in the next world, it's probably going to be as good as it can

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.860
 possibly get.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.860
 But there's some interesting, I don't know if you're following along with the conversation

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:09.940
 the other day, there's some interesting implications of it for it because technically React isn't

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:19.020
 like owned by Vercelle and at least for technique, yeah, at least for the history of React so

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.700
 far it was, you know, shepherded by Facebook, Facebook never really directly needed to monetize

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.700
 React, right?

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.700
 Right.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.540
 So it was somewhat neutral, but now it seems more and more governed by a company that directly

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.540
 monetize React.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.660
 So I think there's a lot of questions around what level of influence is Vercelle having

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.100
 over the React roadmap, I think some people pointed out yesterday, yeah, it is a little

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:52.380
 weird they merge React server components and release it as a beta to time with like a marketing

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.380
 effort by Vercelle.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.580
 That doesn't seem very, very neutral.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.460
 I think as an end user in the short term, it's like, oh, that's great, like everything's

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.940
 working together, that's good, but it does bring up questions for, I mean, other frameworks,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.220
 I think the only other framework using RSC is hydrogen right now, which I haven't heard

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.000
 of before all this, I've heard about it now.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.720
 I've been hearing about them forever and it was always just like they're waiting for React

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.100
 server components to be a thing and there's waiting and waiting and all of a sudden like

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.580
 next needs in, it's like, boom, ready to go, right, so there's like, yeah, there's some

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.260
 kind of, I'm curious how that plays out in the long term, if this like level of influence

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.580
 and bias ends up actually hurting the ecosystem and even the core framework.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.460
 Yeah, they had the live Q&A right after the keynote and the React, what's his name?

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.460
 I forget the React core contributor that was on the panel.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.540
 He didn't actually, Lee Rob didn't introduce the people on the panel, so I couldn't even

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.860
 watch the video and get the names, it's like I know, I know who Tim is, I've seen his face

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.660
 on GitHub, but the other was, yeah, I mean, you're talking about the guy, I think he was

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.060
 in a plaid shirt.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.300
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's, he's like a, he made Redux maybe with Dan, yeah, he worked

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.300
 on it with Dan.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.540
 I'm bringing Dan as a name too.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:18.220
 Yeah, well, he sat there and said that next year, 13 is like the real React 18 release

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.860
 and he backed up on Twitter and tried to say like, well, what I should have said was,

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.340
 if you've listened to that answer, I mean, he very like lays out the case that this is

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.460
 actually what we needed to showcase all of React 18 and we really couldn't show it until

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.460
 next 13 came out.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.300
 So there's a lot of coordination there, I don't know, yeah, I don't know how I feel

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.300
 about it.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.300
 Yeah.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.500
 And there was a thread with, I think it was from Dan Abramov.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.460
 He was talking about, okay, like let's step back and zoom out and talk about what React

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.980
 is and he describes it as, you know, an architecture with certain patterns and it leaves room for

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.980
 implementation.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.060
 So there's a core architecture that you can take advantage of, but it's up to like last

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.500
 mile frameworks like next JS to, you know, assemble everything together that fully takes

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.980
 advantage of it.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.700
 And he phrase it as next is the first framework to do this and give you a fully packaged thing,

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.060
 you know, which is great and I think it's a realization of that vision, but it also makes

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.820
 me wonder, is it the first or is it the last, right?

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.220
 It's a common thing where you build this like big reusable thing, but only ever use it once

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.740
 because how many variations of it do you really need?

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.740
 Yeah.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.420
 And that's a good segue into like bullet point number one, I guess, in terms of next JS kind

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.420
 of turbo pack.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.780
 It's a good segue because I think the big question is like, is this just the next JS

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.780
 build tool?

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.860
 Or is it going to be a bigger thing in the ecosystem?

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.740
 Or other people going to use it?

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.140
 Like they say a lot in the conference and in the talks.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.700
 There's like one very specific turbo pack, Maya gives a talk about the details of turbo

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:56.420
 pack, like dives into the it's going to be so extensible in the plugin system and like

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.860
 all this.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.980
 But that's all just kind of like talk.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.820
 And I think that's the biggest thing about turbo pack.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:07.060
 I was very excited reading through the docs, like looking at turbo pack early and thinking

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.420
 like this could be this could be really great, but then you quickly realize it's like it's

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.420
 still very early.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.580
 I think it's one of those deals where there's a date on the calendar where there's going

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.580
 to be a conference.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.980
 They're going to announce turbo pack.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.340
 They've got all the cool visuals explaining the performance benefits and all this stuff.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.660
 But like it's just going to be what it is right now.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.060
 They're calling it alpha.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.900
 It doesn't support some things.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.260
 There's there's like dynamic isn't supported.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:38.500
 It's only dev mode, so there's no production builds yet, but basically, versatile is decided

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.300
 they're going to build all the tooling for your JavaScript stuff.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:48.020
 So all of it is going to be built with native technologies, Rust mostly, and that they're

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.020
 going to own that thing.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.420
 They're not going to use Vte.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.460
 They're not going to use any of the community kind of like the stuff that like people are

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.620
 mostly moving to, right?

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.700
 Like most of the framers are kind of congealing on Vte, I think.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.700
 Is that accurate?

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.900
 Yeah, I would say so.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.180
 And they're just going to sort of like carve their own past.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.380
 So they've got the successor to Webpack is how they're pointing it.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.660
 Yeah, all written in Rust, they're going to the turbo pack kind of like a play on turbo

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.660
 repo.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.540
 It's all going to be one thing someday turbo, the rewriting turbo repo in Rust.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.060
 There's just a lot to take in, but I think the overwhelming thing is like feels very

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.700
 Apple Silicon like they're going to do it all in house.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.340
 Yeah, in her talk, I felt like she only lacked the like cool room that the guy, the Apple

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.740
 M1 guy talks about the processors, like they needed that.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.660
 She was just sort of like a little circle in her talk.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.660
 But yeah, I don't know.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.140
 What are your thoughts on turbo pack?

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.420
 Yeah, I think part of me is really excited for it.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.780
 And let me try to, I have a very specific reason why.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:57.540
 So like you use CDK, you know, I work on SST, there's a challenge when using something

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:05.220
 like CDK or SST because, you know, with these tools, you're defining, you know, infrastructure

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.060
 you need as you're going to get deployed AWS, but you're also describing the build artifacts

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.060
 you need.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.060
 You're like, I need this function built, I need this function built, I need this front

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.900
 end built, et cetera.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:23.940
 So these tools end up being both a infrastructure as code tool, but also a build tool.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.100
 But they don't have advanced build tool capabilities, like what turbo repo has, right?

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.140
 It doesn't, there's not like built in way to do caching or like, you know, skipping

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.380
 builds that, you know, no, where nothing has changed.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.700
 And CDK builds can be pretty slow.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:42.900
 And I want, ever since I started using turbo repo, I'm like, wow, I wish this functionality

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:48.380
 worked inside of CDK, because from turbo repo perspective, CDK builds is one thing, it's

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.340
 either going to build all of it or it's going to build, it's going to skip it because it's

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.140
 cash, which is helpful, but you know, it's not granular.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.900
 So I've been looking for a way to take all the learnings from turbo repo and put it in

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.900
 CDK.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:06.260
 So only rebuild functions that have been been that have changed only build front ends that

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.260
 have changed.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.860
 But there's a lot of work to build that.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:16.660
 So with this turbo pack thing, I'm kind of hoping, oh, if they expose those library,

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:22.300
 I can suck in all that functionality into SST and get all that great, all that great

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.220
 stuff that they built and even integrate with some of the remote caching stuff can be compatible

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.780
 with any of the remote caching providers that they'll eventually do.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.740
 So it seems very promising and I'd love to like centralize on that instead of kind of

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.700
 continuously rebuilding everything they've already done.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:43.340
 At the same time, it's kind of like, like you said, the scope is so broad, right?

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.860
 I would have been happy with just like turbo repo, but kind of polished up and made more

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:48.860
 as a library.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.860
 Yeah.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.140
 But also like building their own, you know, transpiler, like doing all these things, but

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.980
 in their own dev server, like they're a different approach of how they hot reload all these

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:58.980
 things.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:04.140
 I'm sure for their very narrow, specific use case, once they, you know, hit that, it's

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.500
 going to be amazing, but it's kind of impossible to really build something great if you're not

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.500
 dogfooding it.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:18.220
 And I'm kind of wondering how much are people in next JS and then in Vercel thinking about

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:23.100
 non-next JS users and like thinking about their workflows and what they need, whereas

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.380
 V is a much more decentralized thing, right?

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:30.140
 Every framework kind of centralized on it builds optimal workflows contributes back.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:34.900
 So I'm like, I like the structure of the V project more.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.100
 And I think Evan, you also had a good thread on comparing and I think he made some good

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.780
 counterpoints acknowledged the stuff that Turbo Pack is doing well.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.780
 Yeah.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:48.580
 It's a, I don't know, the all the examples, like of this very early turbo pack thing when

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.140
 they talk about the performance, the starting point is like 3000 modules.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.540
 So like you have a react project with 3000 files.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.620
 Is that a lot?

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.620
 That's a lot for me.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.620
 I can't imagine.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.020
 Is that not just like I, it includes your node depths.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.020
 Okay.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.020
 Okay.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.020
 So that's more realistic.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.020
 We all have roughly a million of.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.020
 Yeah.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.020
 Exactly.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.020
 Okay.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.820
 That makes way more sense than I'm thinking like in my like pages directory and my components

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.060
 directory having 3000 files and I never worked on anything like that.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.060
 Okay.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.660
 So that makes way more sense than I, I guess the, the parcel, I'm going to totally blank

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:26.300
 on everybody's name, but the creator of parcel tweeted, he was disappointed.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.180
 They didn't reference, because the big thing about turbo pack is the incremental.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.220
 It's same with turbo repo, like incrementally building, only building things that change.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.220
 Right.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.220
 And he was, he tweeted.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.220
 He was disappointed.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.540
 They didn't mention it at Nick, she has comp as like inspiration for the incremental build

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.540
 stuff.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.500
 They mentioned basil at Google, uh, actually maya and her talk does mention it because

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.660
 she wrote it for partially, which I didn't know.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.980
 This is all very fascinating.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.220
 She works for herself now because everyone works for herself now.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.140
 So there was some inspiration taken there, the incremental build stuff.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.780
 But he also pointed out, or maybe it was Evan that pointed out, we're talking about like

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:06.920
 going from 0.9 or 0.09 to 0.01 seconds in terms of the HMR reload, I think is what the

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.980
 example it was Evan.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.580
 So how much does all this matter in practice?

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.340
 Like how much does, I mean, rust, I know there's a lot of benefits besides performance.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.380
 It's like building all their tooling and rust, probably easier to maintain.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.820
 I think rust really good about that.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.820
 Right.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:25.820
 So there's reasons, but I do wonder the big question for me is, is this just next year

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.780
 is build tool or will it become a thing in the broader ecosystem?

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.180
 Will people write plugins for it?

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.420
 Will that be a thing?

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:37.540
 I think people pointed out SWC like there are no third party plugins for SWC.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.340
 It's all been written by herself.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.460
 And is that another, is that what's going to happen here?

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.460
 Does it matter?

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.460
 I don't know.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.460
 Yeah.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.460
 I do wonder about that too.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:50.740
 And even, I don't know if you saw a thing about, I think it was one of the Webpack core

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.580
 contributors.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.740
 And he was saying it's weird they branded it as a successor to Webpack because I'm still

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.740
 working on Webpack.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:58.740
 Yeah.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.940
 Let me do it in releases.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.940
 Yeah.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.460
 So the positioning is definitely weird in a few places.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:10.140
 And yeah, I do wonder, like some of these other rich ecosystems, I think you do have

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:16.140
 this thing where with a completely open ecosystem, 99% of the plugins are garbage and you're

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.300
 sifting through them to find the one present that are good.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.300
 Yeah.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.540
 And so, I'm assuming every single thing that they publish is going to be pretty good.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.660
 So yeah, it's honestly the same thing as the Apple versus Android thing.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.140
 It's very familiar to that.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.340
 If your choice is on Apple, but everything's going to work together and be great, but if

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.220
 you ever need to go outside of what they think you should be doing, it's just going to be

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.220
 a pain.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.220
 Yeah.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.220
 Yeah.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.220
 Yeah.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.220
 I do use Apple stuff.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.220
 And I guess I do use NYXGIS and I've deployed Vercel.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.220
 What am I talking about?

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.220
 I have no complaints.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.260
 It's all going to get better.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.360
 One thing that's missing from Turbo Pack in this very early alpha release is Tailwind.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.980
 You have to like run it in a sidecar.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:56.980
 That bummed me out.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.980
 I don't know.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.140
 Maybe it's a little thing, but I feel like everyone uses Tailwind, right?

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:06.180
 And there was a thing in the QA where Maya actually answered a question about Tailwind support

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:11.140
 in Turbo Pack and made it sound more ominous like, oh, yeah, that's a JavaScript thing.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.700
 How are we going to like, we're going to have to create some system for running JavaScript-y

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.980
 things like JavaScript plugins in this Rust thing?

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.980
 I don't know.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.700
 Like, maybe it's not just as simple as like they didn't get to it.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.460
 There's actually like a whole thing they have to do.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.460
 Yeah.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.300
 It is tricky because an ES build and SWC also run into this.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.380
 People want to write the plugins in JavaScript, which makes sense.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:36.820
 But the core is in Go or Rust and the interrupt might slow things extremely down unless you

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.500
 build a fairly limited plugin system.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.100
 So yeah, I can definitely see the challenges with that.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.940
 It did sound like, at least I've been seeing the talk you're referring to, but at least

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.180
 when they were up on stage altogether, it sounded like, oh, yeah, it's going to come.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.180
 We just haven't gotten to it.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.180
 Yeah.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.180
 Oh, I think so.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.140
 They don't want everyone like package JSON scripts looking like that with concurrently.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.140
 Yeah.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.140
 Yeah.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.140
 Yeah.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.140
 Yeah.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:05.700
 I definitely just having done this thing where you like have a big event.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.900
 I don't know if a company as big as Versailles is a more sophisticated way of doing this,

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:14.300
 but at some point you just have to pick a date for the conference because you need to like

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.420
 lead up time to do marketing, like all the stuff that goes into planning that, you sound

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:24.620
 like randomly pick a date and then you just try to get as much package into that date as

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.380
 you can.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:30.740
 And which is why I think a lot of these conferences, it's like very exciting, but then it's always

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.300
 like, oh, this is an alpha or this is coming out soon or this is like, you know, partially

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.300
 complete.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.700
 It's hard to time everything together like that.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.700
 Oh, for sure.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.900
 And Apple does a really good job with it where like, you can order now, but they're Apple

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:47.220
 and everyone else is trying to be Apple, or at least Versailles is, but even at hardware

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.220
 or software.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.660
 It took them a few years to get to that, right?

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:50.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.500
 First you conferences was always like coming in fall of next year.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.500
 Yeah.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.500
 I can remember so those.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.500
 Yeah.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.220
 Last thing on Turbo Pack, I thought I had one last thing.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.220
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.220
 Yeah.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.860
 I love the graphics and all the talking points around like it's like 700 or 600 times faster

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.860
 than Webpack.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.260
 It's like that's such a self burn because the only reason anyone uses Webpack anymore

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.460
 is because I'm the X.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.460
 Yeah.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:16.660
 It's like, who uses Webpack and Tobias works there and, I don't know, I just thought that

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.660
 was funny.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.460
 Like it might as well say a million times faster than Webpack.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:21.460
 Yeah.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.460
 Yeah.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.980
 So this performance stuff, I think in practice is binary.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.420
 It either feels instant or you go and do something else while you're waiting for it to.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:34.260
 And once you pass that threshold, I don't know how much these tight, like V hit that

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.180
 threshold of, I start it and I know it's going to be ready right away.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.180
 I build it.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.020
 I know it's going to be ready pretty much right away.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:47.300
 So yeah, I'm sure these incremental things are good to do, but as a good end user, it

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.020
 doesn't feel like a game changer for me.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.020
 Yeah.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.700
 So that's, so that's Turbo Pack.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.700
 I did.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.700
 I said last thing.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.580
 There's one last thing, uh, spilt kit.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:01.820
 So we're terrorists at Vercel and, and the whole spilt kit has already changed bundlers

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.820
 twice once.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.820
 I don't know.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.820
 And now Vercel's building their own bundler does felt kit move to it.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.820
 Does that cause drama?

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.420
 Am I trying to create something that's not there?

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.420
 I don't know.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.380
 I just, the whole ridge here is there is confusing me.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.380
 Yeah.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.380
 Go ahead.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.380
 Yeah.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.380
 I mean, cause it didn't, it doesn't.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.380
 Rich hair is also, is any of the creative roll up as well?

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.180
 I think so, but they move from roll up to V. Is that right or no?

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.140
 Or they move from something to roll up.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.140
 V uses.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.140
 So V is like a.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.140
 V uses role.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.140
 Yeah.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:34.380
 It uses role for production, but then they use their like, yes, native ESM thing for

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:40.140
 depth, which I've always loved that pattern, but the total repo talks seem like they were

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.140
 saying that isn't good.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.140
 I don't know.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.140
 It still makes sense to me.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.140
 But yeah.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:50.820
 So he uses, so if Velki uses V right, uh, but they moved to it from something, right?

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.820
 I think so.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.820
 I don't remember.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.340
 They've already had a, like their pre version one was felt kit, but they've already changed

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.340
 bundlers once.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.820
 And there's like the mumblings of what they really, what they change again to move on

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:02.820
 to the versatile thing.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.340
 Cause rich worship rich said something in the pre show that was like, how awesome it was

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.100
 to work at resell and get to build a work on smelt full time.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.540
 Is there no other company that would pay rich Harris to work on smelt full time?

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.100
 I feel like he could find some more.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.100
 I don't know.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.100
 I don't know.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.340
 I'm sure he courted like, I'm sure he did like a whole round of.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.340
 You think so?

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.340
 Yeah.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.340
 Cause I know, I know Ryan did.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.340
 So it's all Js.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.340
 Yeah.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.380
 He talked to literally everyone and he's at Netlify now.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.380
 Is that right?

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.380
 Yeah, he's yeah.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.380
 Sorry.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.380
 He's at Netlify.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.380
 Yeah.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.340
 And he like, of course weighed the personal compensation, but also weighed, you know, like

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.020
 in terms of the best positioning for solid Js as a product.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.020
 Yeah.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:48.500
 Going to resell is tricky because you are in a company that has a clear competitor.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.500
 Right.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.500
 So I can see why some of that's tricky with, with Richard at Vercel.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.500
 Yeah.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.500
 I don't know.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.620
 I think I just have a hard time imagining five years from now how all that plays out.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.620
 Yeah.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.620
 That's good.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.620
 Okay.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.620
 I've never used soap.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.620
 So I should just stop talking.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.620
 I don't know what I'm talking about.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.620
 I'm not even a front end engineer.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.620
 Why am I talking about any of this?

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:21.660
 Okay, so the second bullet point, the layouts RFC, this is probably where you, you hinted,

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.620
 like you don't follow a lot of it because you don't use next year's and maybe I could

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.620
 be helpful.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.620
 Maybe.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.620
 Maybe not.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.620
 Yeah.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.620
 Okay.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:35.420
 So this was the next year, 13, the big thing is taking advantage of all the react 18 stuff.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.820
 So server components, layouts.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.820
 What else?

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.540
 I mean, that's, I mean, that's the big ones, right?

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:48.900
 There's just unified data fetching now, which I learned yesterday or today watching all

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:54.860
 these talks is actually like experimental underscore use coming out of react to an experimental

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.860
 use thing.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.100
 I thought it was just used, but it's experimentally used.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:03.220
 So basically this one way to fetch data, it sounds like that you don't in next year.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:08.460
 So previously in next year's, I keep forgetting you don't use it previously.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.020
 There's like three different major ways.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.060
 There's SSG and SSR and ISR, right?

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.340
 And they have different like named functions that you export from your thing, your pages

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.340
 specifically.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.100
 Those that sounds like are kind of like not going to be there anymore.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.900
 You don't use those in this new world and the app directory.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.500
 You just fetch data in one way, and they do all these optimizations at runtime to like

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.500
 D-dupe.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.980
 And I don't understand how the ISR part, like how cache still are revalidated.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.240
 I don't understand how that gets replaced, but they may, it sound like it does.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:47.820
 So now you can define like a layout in a directory, layout.js or TS, and that defines this sort

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.820
 of server component.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.420
 Well, all components are now server components by default, they can fetch data and allegedly

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:57.500
 not send a lot of JavaScript that's not needed to the client, although that's been talked

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.780
 about already on the internet, like they still send the same amount.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.780
 I don't know.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.980
 People have been building React 13 or next year's 13 apps and seeing more JavaScript in the

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.500
 client bundle than before.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:14.220
 So I don't know what it all means, but apparently eventually we'll send as a little JavaScript

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.220
 to the client as possible in some point in the future.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.420
 I don't know when that happens.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.420
 That's the layouts RFC.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:26.740
 But then there's also client, you can create client components, which I learned also is

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:32.020
 like this weird string at the top, this used client, you just put that at the top and literally

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.020
 in a string.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.180
 Like comment, literally a string, like the used strict thing.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:41.780
 Yeah, like you strict, exactly, but it's like used client, and that's a client component.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:42.780
 Hmm.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:43.780
 I don't know.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.620
 I don't know how it's all going to, like I've not done any of this.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:52.220
 So, yeah, the promise though is less JavaScript from the client someday, go ahead.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:57.580
 Some of that is familiar, like the use RFC, which I did read through.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:02.980
 I think the trajectory I see, maybe I might be wrong about this, but I think React Queer

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:11.060
 is very sort of got people used to this pattern of just any async test goes into this thing.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:16.260
 And you automatically get certain properties, like whether it's completed, whether it's pending,

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.700
 you know, the actual value, things like that.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:24.500
 And then there's something called create resource added to solid.js, which is very similar to

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.500
 the use hook.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:32.220
 It's like a core level primitive that you pass in any async function to, and it returns an

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.260
 object that has, you know, the value if it's there, if it's loading, et cetera.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.500
 So that's native to solid.js.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.740
 Because it's native integrassable, it's suspense stuff.

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:44.860
 So if you have a suspense up top, and you have like, you know, nested series of components

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.940
 that are all that I'll have resources that are waiting on, it can just wait on all of

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:49.940
 that before rendering them all.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:56.180
 So it fixes that pop in issue, and that integrates nicely with SSR, and it's just like works really

00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:01.580
 nicely all around a little bit easier in the solid world, because the implementation is

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:06.500
 kind of simple, because it's just reactivity based, whereas use and react probably needed

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.940
 a lot of work to implement correctly.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:14.740
 And it's probably why it's still in experimental, they're trying to figure out what it is pattern.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.980
 One people like it, and two, if it's implemented correctly.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:24.540
 But this kind of brings me to a broader feeling I've had where, you know, I don't use Next.js,

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:28.020
 but you know, I'm pretty familiar with front end stuff.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:35.100
 Watching the conference and all the Q&A and all that, I was surprised that I didn't understand

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.740
 most of it.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.900
 And I kind of got this feeling of, I generally don't complain, like I know there's a general

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.740
 complaint around front end really complicated and it moves fast.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:49.460
 I definitely hear that, but I generally don't feel that too much, just something like this

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:55.020
 is my hobby, I'm like into this stuff, the more changes, the more fun it is for me.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.580
 But I was looking at some of this and I was like, man, does this really have to be this

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.080
 complicated?

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.860
 I am like barely falling along.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:03.860
 Yeah.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:10.620
 It seems really hard for what seems like pretty simple outcomes.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.620
 Yeah.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.180
 If you felt the same way.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.420
 I totally feel the same way.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:19.700
 And I think that's like the voices in the community that are like hard on the other side

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.460
 that have been saying it's all too complicated, this could be way simpler than this and even

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.620
 have offered up solutions to make it simpler.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.220
 They're getting louder and louder in my head as I listen to this stuff.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:34.020
 And I think like how many layers deep are we in this stuff that I can't fully grok.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:39.260
 And I feel like I've been using React for like eight years, almost a decade.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.260
 And it still doesn't all click with me.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.780
 Like I still build stuff every day where I'm like, wait, oh, yeah, of course, no, I can't

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.780
 do that.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:50.460
 But like that stuff, the cognitive overhead, it does feel like it's reaching a tipping

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.900
 point for me and maybe within the broader community.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:58.180
 I do wonder like one of the talks kind of made the case that like we need these layers

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.700
 of abstraction to do things that scale from startup.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.620
 It's totally the SST thing from startup to like mega company, like we need these things

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.980
 and you stand on the shoulders of Vercel and you can build this thing and you know it'll

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.380
 work for 100 million users like it works for 10 users.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.420
 Do you think there's truth in that?

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.700
 Like, is that why we need all this complex stuff?

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.500
 Is it just not there, like eventually it'll be simpler, but we just need more layers?

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.500
 Yeah.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:30.660
 I mean, I'm biased because I use solid and I see a world where it's not like you're absolutely

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:34.540
 beginning to pick it up and they're like good to go, but so much.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:39.300
 I felt like like a weight that I didn't know was there just like dropped out of my head.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.300
 Just so much.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.780
 I want to get that out of my head, yeah.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:48.460
 I went through this thing where when I first started using it, I was like, because it looks

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:52.300
 so much like React, the first two months, I was like, oh, I get it, like I'm doing it.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:57.660
 I'm building stuff and I was building stuff, but two months in, I realized I was making

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:03.260
 everything overly complicated because just my like React training.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:08.900
 And once I shed all that, it was like, wow, I'm back to just dealing with DOM element and

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.820
 like touching them directly and like everything is just so straightforward.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.660
 So I feel like it doesn't have to be this complicated.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:24.540
 I think React is incredible in that a core idea from 10 years ago is still like relevant

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.460
 and the main way people are doing things and they've been able to shift and adapt it.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:32.700
 But at some point, you know, everything, everything goes through its phase of that, you know,

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.100
 I'm into solid just right now, there's going to be a time where I hate it.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.980
 I've been to this with enough with enough technologies.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.460
 I know that it always happens.

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:46.140
 So and what about so solid kind of like removing that react burden?

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:52.340
 What about like what next provides and all of the, so I guess if you're using VIT, you're

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:56.620
 using things that are, they've solved like we don't have to think about Webpack or transpiling

00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:00.540
 or any of that stuff anymore, but like what about the get the data fetching, the get server

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.540
 side props equivalent?

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.620
 It's like, if you need to do stuff, I mean, I think you don't really do this much.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:10.140
 You mostly build like client driven, like rich apps that are used by focused groups of people.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:15.500
 But do you think that that's, is the Astro like does Astro and solid get me like 95% of

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.980
 the way there with what I'm used to in next?

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:18.980
 Yeah, exactly.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:19.980
 And so you're right.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.660
 Most of my time has spent on like long session apps.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.900
 So they tend to be SPA's, but even when you build an SPA at some point, you have to build

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:33.220
 a marketing page, blog, like just other things like that.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.380
 And yeah, so things like next and in that category, these meta frameworks, yeah, I'm

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.780
 not going to set up SSR on my own.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.260
 I remember used to having to do that.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.260
 And it was terrible.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.500
 I never actually did it right.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.940
 And I think that was even how next described it when I first came out, they were like, nobody

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.080
 does this, right?

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.620
 So yeah, I mean, they're great.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.540
 But it's not really next for me.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:02.500
 I think next is a great job packaging, this complexity into something pretty digestible.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.940
 It's just when I get peaks into the underlying stuff and I get that you don't have to do

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:07.940
 that right away.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.780
 You can be a beginner and stay at a high level.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:16.420
 But you know, you never feel good if the stuff you're sitting on feels like really chaotic.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.420
 Yeah.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:21.860
 You want things to feel like simpler at the low level and you're kind of surprised that

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.940
 when you dig into it, you want to be surprised.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.020
 Oh, this is a lot simpler than I thought it was.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.340
 Because the other way around it's kind of, you sort of feel uneasy, at least I do.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.340
 Yeah.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:36.220
 So that was the whole middle point of the conference of the keynote, like, is this layouts RFC and

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.300
 now rolling in the next year, 13?

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.340
 And it does, I think, leave me uneasy.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.940
 I just feel like there's so much that I don't understand and I don't know why I don't understand.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.940
 But maybe it'll all start making sense.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:47.940
 I haven't used this stuff.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.460
 Maybe once I'm using server components and I'm creating client components and it all just

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.460
 makes sense to me.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.460
 I don't know.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:58.580
 The react contributor on the Q&A did say there will be a learning curve as people start

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.660
 thinking about the distinction between the two.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:05.460
 Yeah, but then I just think of the Brian LaRouze of the world and like what they think of

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.460
 all this.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.460
 It's so hard for me to hear that voice in my head.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:14.580
 I think he would die if he watched the conference, I think your heart would just stop.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:20.340
 Okay, so then the third thing was like, I don't even remember the name that they use,

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.740
 but it's like higher level web components.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.700
 So it's like, you need to serve images in the right way.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.780
 So let's just go through them.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:33.020
 There's like next image, there's next font, there's next link.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.260
 Next image and next font or next link existed.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.940
 They both got better by removing stuff.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:43.580
 So next image, you don't have like all the JavaScript stuff.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:47.100
 I think they're using like intersection observers and all this, whatever they were doing before

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.660
 with all this JavaScript now just uses the native browser stuff.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:54.980
 I guess it's far enough along now with browser support, it'll load images based on native

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:55.980
 browser API.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.060
 So they basically stripped out a lot of the JavaScript.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:03.100
 And now next image is lighter, more accessible, better, just uses the platform.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.100
 So that's next image.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.820
 I think, I think that's only available next 13.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.180
 I don't know if they'd already rolled that out or not.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:12.860
 But next link, you don't have to put anchor tags in anymore.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:13.860
 Again, you don't use next year.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:14.860
 So this may not make sense.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.500
 No, I'm familiar with that.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.980
 I have used next, so I'm familiar with some of the patterns.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:19.980
 Yeah.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:23.300
 So you had to have like an anchor tag just like this naked anchor tag in your link tags,

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.300
 which is always dumb.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.780
 Now you don't have to.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.820
 So now your links don't involve anchor tags about, no, I know they're probably rendering

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:30.820
 anchor tags.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.540
 I just know people like Brian or Lou would hear that like, great, we don't have to do

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.540
 anchor tags now.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.540
 And then next font is new.

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.160
 I'm so hyped about this one.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.700
 There's a fourth thing we'll talk about, too.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.700
 I'm all over the place, I'm sorry.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.900
 The next font thing was maybe the most excited I got at the whole conference because the

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:53.340
 number of times I want to use a Google font, I search on Google fonts, I find it.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.300
 And then it's like, you could just drop the script on your page if you want to be bad

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.300
 and do bad things.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.700
 And I'm like, not going to do that.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:04.540
 I'm going to look up again how to do the best thing and self-host it and preload.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:10.660
 And the inline the CSS, and then also you got to do your, is it optional?

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.580
 Are you going to swap it like a chump and have layout shift?

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.180
 Like what are you going to do with the font when you get it?

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:20.020
 The problem I have with that whole thing, I always spend forever just like remembering

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.700
 all the places I have to put stuff and then I use tailwinds, I put the font and tailwind.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.140
 I do all that.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:29.820
 And then the best path for performance, if you want to like check all the web vitals

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:34.620
 boxes is to use the optional font loading strategy, right?

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:38.780
 And optional means everyone that hits your site and then leaves and never comes back

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:42.580
 sees the dumb basic font, so this is not your custom font.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:46.460
 So like the first load of the page, it's probably not going to load the font fast enough, even

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.460
 with your preload.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.100
 And they're just not even going to ever see the custom font.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:54.780
 So it always felt like you either have layout shift or you only show the cool font to people

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:55.780
 who come back.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.980
 And I hated that.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:01.580
 So I love the next font, you just use a font from Google fonts, like you import it into

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.900
 your thing, just like you import any other module.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:09.420
 You choose like enter or whatever the font is, they download, they self-host it.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:13.140
 I know you've used something that does something like this in node modules, but it self-host

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.140
 the font.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.140
 It does all the preloading.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.140
 It just does everything.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.140
 It does all those things.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:22.060
 But then also it sounds like it uses a swap font loading strategy and it uses like margins

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.060
 and stuff.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.500
 There's some browser API for it, I guess, for like accommodating, like making the font

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.820
 not layout shift when it swaps in, which sounds amazing.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.060
 If that all works, I'll be very happy.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.060
 Got it.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:40.340
 So does it basically know for each font, like some dimensions of what the font would take

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.340
 up?

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.340
 I believe so.

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.060
 I think there's some CSS property, right, that's you adjust it.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.700
 So then there's no layout shift when it swaps.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:47.700
 That's pretty awesome.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.700
 It is awesome.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.700
 I'm so excited about it.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:54.900
 It's also done being like hyped up about this font thing when the whole conference, that's

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.520
 the only thing that really got me excited.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:02.180
 The fourth thing was the OG generation, which they actually put, they posted this on Twitter

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.180
 a couple of weeks ago, but they announced it at the conference.

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.260
 It's actually really cool.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:12.580
 You can render dynamic social images with React components.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.500
 It's some weird like stripped down, they've made like their own thing that turns a React

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:21.260
 component into an SVG or something, or I don't know, or into an image.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.460
 You can use like a subset of tailwind.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.460
 Sorry.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.460
 I'm talking too much.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.460
 Go ahead.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.460
 No, no, I was just listening.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:30.220
 Yeah, that was actually one of the old SSD tutorials was building something like that

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:34.740
 where you can build a OG image generator, like a serverless thing where a lambda function

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:35.740
 generates it once.

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.300
 But yeah, having that built in is great.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.260
 There's even like whole SAS tools that just help you with this, right?

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.260
 I know there's that.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.260
 Oh, yeah.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:48.540
 Cool, and that I think that's like the whole fully integrated vertical thing, the Apple

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.300
 model of like, we're going to have everything you need.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.300
 That's where it's really nice.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:56.540
 I do love like, it's the kind of stuff that'll hook me like I'll keep using next because

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:02.020
 of next slash font and the OG image generation like that stuff was just like really annoying

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.740
 little things that it's really like, I don't like having to manage those on my own.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:11.300
 So I do like that they because they do the hosting with Vercel, like they can actually

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.740
 pull off this vertical thing that cross cuts several different areas.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:21.140
 Like you're writing this component in your thing that renders an image that gets served

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.180
 at the edge and all, you know, all that comes into play there.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:27.660
 But you can't really do that if you don't own the full thing.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:28.660
 So it's pretty cool.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:29.660
 Yeah.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.660
 Yeah.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.180
 And I think these, some of these other meta frameworks, they kind of have to build in

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:36.300
 a neutral vendor, neutral way.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:40.460
 And that does limit some of some of their functionality, like they couldn't build like

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.900
 an ISR feature, for example.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.420
 Yeah, it makes sense.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:52.860
 So okay, high level thoughts or do you have anything on any of the app components or

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.860
 any of that last bullet point that you care about?

00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:04.060
 Well, I mean, again, it's probably a negative thought, but I did have a moment during the

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:09.140
 conference where I was like, we're all sitting here gathered around watching this thing and

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.820
 excited and we're talking about a link component.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:17.180
 Like I get there's a lot of underlying routing and lots of deep implications there, but it's

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:23.820
 like, you don't have to put a tag inside this other tag and that's like, you know, one of

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:28.660
 the main announcements and I was thinking back to how I always go this way whenever Unreal

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:34.060
 Engine has like a new version and then they do their demo, I'm like, yeah, they're showing

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:39.920
 off how you can create like entire universes and like perfect fidelity without any work.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:44.700
 And our equivalent, our industry is like, oh, like this tag doesn't need to go in this

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.100
 other tag anymore.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.780
 And it just makes me feel pretty lame.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.700
 Yeah, no, it is kind of a lot to do about nothing.

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:57.140
 Yeah, it's hard because I do get excited about some of these things that are pretty trivial

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.300
 things.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:03.540
 And when you think about like how outsiders, people who aren't web developers would view

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.540
 what we do.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.340
 Like they wouldn't think we'd be excited about the things we get excited about.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.340
 I don't know.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.140
 It's like Apple, it's the whole Apple parallel.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.180
 It's just been all over the internet.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:18.660
 I mean, everybody's like got their memes about how Versailles is very much creating this Apple

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.660
 of the software world.

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:27.500
 I want to talk like high level, Versailles, economics, their Apple comparison.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.940
 I think the Apple thing, the reason that reminded me of it is like they announced a new iPhone

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:35.540
 every year, and at this point, nothing really changes.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.420
 We get excited about the littlest dumbest things.

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.260
 It's like a new camera.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.420
 That's exciting.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.120
 But it felt very like that.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.220
 There is a lot that they announced, and I don't want to discount that they have a lot

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:51.500
 of people at Versailles working very hard on some cool problems, like all the rest stuff.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.500
 I don't know.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.660
 It's exciting.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:57.900
 But the things I'm most excited about from the talk, from the conference, do feel like

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.260
 pretty trivial improvements.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:05.940
 It's just like quality of life improvements at this point.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:11.140
 But maybe it's just because I don't understand all of the partial hydration, and which parts

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.820
 of my page won't have to re-render.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.540
 When they say won't re-render, do they mean on the server or the client?

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.540
 I just get so confused that maybe I don't understand how big this is.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.900
 I'm excited about next font.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.260
 I don't know.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.940
 Well, it's your worst pain point, so.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.940
 It is.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.940
 Yeah.

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:29.580
 It's sad, but that is my worst pain point.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:39.100
 I figure high-level thoughts on like, Versailles and how they pull all this off, I guess.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:42.780
 I can't help but watch that conference see all the lead up to it, which they brought

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:48.180
 everybody to San Francisco to be like, "Oh, they didn't bring us, so not everybody."

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:53.300
 They brought everybody to San Francisco as this crazy developer party where all the celebrities

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.980
 in Devland are hanging out, and they have this whole production.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:01.660
 It's this crazy, nobody's seen it in the tech world, but then I can't help but think about

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.580
 the fact that like, do they make money?

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.580
 I don't know.

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:08.800
 They've raised $350 million, but do they make money, and is this sustainable?

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.140
 Is this like, are we going down?

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.940
 Are we going, is this a sign of the end?

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:14.940
 Yeah.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:15.940
 Yeah.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:21.900
 There's always moments you think back to when there's been a downturn of like, obviously

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.340
 that was like the top or whatever.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.340
 Yeah.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.340
 I don't know.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:30.220
 I think I have a few, like with everything else, I'm pretty confused.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:34.300
 I just feel like lately in life I'm just pretty confused, most of the time, especially when

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.820
 it comes to the web world.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:42.140
 I'm sure they're doing fine as a business.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.580
 You can't be this beloved and not make money.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.580
 Sure.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:53.020
 Maybe you can, but I feel like you know you got to, I'm sure some dollars are coming out.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:57.580
 I think the place where, and this is going to come from like my bias and the stuff I

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.940
 work on, I think for most of my career, I never thought of myself as a web developer.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:07.260
 I thought of myself as, I work on software and oftentimes that software has like a web

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:14.380
 component, like we have a dashboard, whatever, but you know, the meat of the value is in the

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:20.700
 back end or like whatever, you know, business logic we've written, et cetera.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:25.140
 So like web, the web part was just like a tiny piece of the whole thing.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.620
 Of course, web has gotten a lot more complicated.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:34.260
 The experiences people get are, or expect are a lot more sophisticated, but still in my like

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:42.140
 overall stack, it still to me feels like it's just like this component of the whole system.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:50.140
 And having a company trying to just monetize just that portion of it, I don't know how much

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.420
 money I'm going to want to ever give them for this, at least for the stuff that I work

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.220
 on, right?

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:59.580
 In my overall bill, I would expect my front end to be like a minuscule fraction of the

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.380
 bill, compared to like my database, right?

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.780
 All these database providers that are coming out, like I know they're going to be making

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:11.260
 tons of money, like you'll play, you'll pay plants, kill whatever, because that's like

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.900
 everything you care about, right?

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:20.780
 So I kind of wonder with wherever cell focuses, it's for people where the web part is the thing,

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:26.580
 the whole product, and that tends to be, I think I'm maybe missing some things, but it

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.900
 tends to be things like e-commerce, right?

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.500
 E-commerce like that, your web platform is the product.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.260
 The faster it serves, the more money you make, you know, the higher quality, et cetera.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.260
 That's what you care about.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:41.180
 But these aren't like software companies that are making tons and tons of money.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:45.340
 They pretty much have like tough margins, and they are pretty sensitive to prices.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.340
 Yeah.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:50.580
 And we see this a lot because we help people deploy next on AWS.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:55.140
 A lot of people are coming to us to switch over to deploying next and AWS because they

00:41:55.140 --> 00:42:00.900
 got an email from Versailles saying, "Hey, you're like way over, or like fair use thing.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:06.820
 You know, we'd like you to pay like, you know, 75K a year for your usage."

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.340
 And that's like pretty tough for some of these companies.

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:15.660
 So I do, I'm sure that's not like all of Versailles business, but yeah, like how much value can

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:21.860
 you get just doing this web portion of it, unless you start to capture like, okay, it's

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:26.440
 going to be the whole backend and we're going to host your database, you know, Yeah, I keep

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.440
 waiting for that.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.740
 I keep waiting for them to like make the obvious moves like they figured out a good developer

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:36.740
 experience and how to create really performant web apps, like, what about all the rest of

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:37.740
 it?

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:40.760
 If they did the front end, where's the rest of it?

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:46.820
 Are they going to start venturing into data and to actual APIs that just seems natural,

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.900
 but they just, I mean, we would just go through another next half and they're not hinting

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.900
 at that.

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.820
 It seems like they're doubling down on to your point, making this small part of our

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:58.060
 broader applications better.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:03.340
 Like if I think about deploying a web app on AWS, if I were not using Versailles, it's

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:09.580
 like I spend all my money on DynamoDB and whatever, if you're using a relational database,

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:14.520
 you know, whatever, Aurora or something, I said relational, if you're using a SQL based

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:19.260
 database, if you're using like, those are always a big expensive thing.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.260
 And then you spend like nothing on S3 and Cloud front.

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:25.500
 And maybe that's because I don't make apps that people use, but ultimately I do, I see

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:30.760
 that parallel, like they are focused on this one part of a broader thing, but yeah, I guess

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:34.140
 e-commerce that is mostly the thing, I don't know.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:38.380
 And they mentioned e-commerce in the conference, like as like these major e-commerce companies

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:42.740
 that use Next.js and Versailles, I don't know.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:43.740
 Yeah.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:48.380
 And e-commerce is also hard because they serve a ton of impressions because the whole thing

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:51.820
 with e-commerce is you drive as many people to your platform responsible and you convert

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:52.820
 a small number of them.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.820
 Yeah.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.220
 And people like look at a lot of images, it's like heavy content stuff.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.220
 So that's why these bills add up.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.220
 Yeah.

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:04.380
 So yeah, that whole space, I'm sure they'll win and I'm sure winning looks like a massively

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.340
 successful company.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.340
 But it feels tough.

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:14.260
 It feels a lot tougher than focusing on some of these other just high, higher value areas.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:19.660
 And I think the, I guess the reason if I look at what type of company they are there, really

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:24.380
 great at focusing on DX, like solving the last mile problems on top of other infrastructure.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:28.060
 Like, you know, they're building originally built all on AWS.

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:34.580
 They have stuff on workers, but I think to sell like more infrastructure type products

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.140
 like a database, you kind of have to be an infrastructure company.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:42.020
 I don't know if that's like really in their DNA, like they're not, you know, they're not,

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:45.220
 their core competency isn't managing like a cluster of servers or anything.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:51.060
 It's more focusing on the last mile on top of someone else doing the other stuff.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:56.980
 I think I'm more confused than I was when we started this and I don't know.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:57.980
 I don't know where it's all headed.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:02.580
 I do feel like we're in weird times in this, I don't know, this landscape right now, not

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.580
 just next year.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:09.020
 It's just like more broadly, I guess web like, I don't feel like we're in weird times over

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:12.060
 in like back end land or cloud land.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:16.980
 I feel like it's just like, that's a play, that's a parallel like AWS actually is just

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:21.620
 making a criminal changes to all these wonderful primitives that we can build on reinvent.

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.940
 I expect nothing to blow me away.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.780
 It's all very stable and this web world is so weird.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.900
 And there's so many people with strong opinions and they all have platforms and they can voice

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.100
 those opinions.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.780
 And I don't know what to think anymore.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.180
 But I do think DevRel sucks.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:42.660
 That's one thing I'll say coming out next comp, I just don't hear more about this.

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:48.180
 I just don't know like, what do you think about Vercel is like a culture, like an influencer

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:53.420
 of developer culture, like they're trying to create something that really hasn't existed.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:58.020
 I mean, there hasn't been a DevTools company that looks like Apple when they put on an event

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:04.140
 and that like brings in all the dignitaries and like has this very flashy, glossy appearance.

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.780
 How do you think that plays out for them?

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:11.300
 Like does that get them more usage like do developers want to use Vercel because of events

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.380
 like what they just did yesterday?

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.020
 Yeah, I think it definitely does.

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:22.140
 I mean, there's no reason why the Apple strategy wouldn't work.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.220
 And I also think there is merit to it.

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:29.060
 I kind of think of it as if you're able to pull off good design, it's because you figured

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:32.020
 out all the other parts of your business and you have left over time for this.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:36.580
 So when I see good design, I think it is a good signal of something.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:38.980
 Most companies are like scrambling to figure out their core product.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:44.340
 They're never going to like get to the aesthetic stuff, right?

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:48.700
 So I do treat it as like a real valid signal.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:53.060
 I think for me, like we've talked about before, whenever I see something getting popular,

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:55.500
 I start to hate it.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:47:00.540
 It's just it's completely irrational and there's no logic to it, but I'm like, next

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:03.060
 JS is like the top dog right now.

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:08.140
 So I'm looking for, you know, like whoever's going to get the angle on them and like what's

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:13.500
 coming up next and how are they going to like fumble their lead.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.500
 Yeah.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.340
 So, yeah, that's how I think about you.

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:22.820
 Yeah, no, my feelings are probably like, they're all just driven from like FOMO, I think.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.980
 I wish I was at the conference, so I have salty feelings about the conference.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.940
 It's a lot of jealousy too.

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.460
 Oh, yeah, for sure.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:30.460
 Definitely an angle.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.860
 I'm a sucker for aesthetics, they nail design.

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:36.340
 I mean, they're folks, I know I've seen some of them on Twitter, they're really good.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.140
 Like, I love all of that part of it.

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:42.980
 I think the dev role parts the part that I'm like, eh, it feels very fake and just how

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:46.820
 many developers are really like positively influenced when they watch if you saw that

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:47.820
 pre-show.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.340
 Like watching that pre-show, I don't think that helps for sale.

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:55.260
 I think developers are a pretty like scrutinizing bunch.

00:47:55.260 --> 00:48:00.900
 I think we can smell out inauthenticity, inauthenticity, I can't say that word, but

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:03.380
 we can smell it when things aren't authentic.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:10.220
 Yeah, I think I fundamentally, the thing that I have an issue with is I don't believe really

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:16.580
 in this 100% dev role where that's like just your entire job.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:18.740
 I just find it weird, right?

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:24.020
 You spend, you work at a company, you learn to like their product, you spend a bunch of

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:28.580
 time like just evangelizing it and explaining to the world why everyone should use it.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:32.860
 You get a lot of followers, people look to you through that job.

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:38.340
 Then some other company is like, hey, you have a lot of influence and followers, here's

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:44.780
 a bunch of money to come to our company and now say that you love our product.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:48.900
 You've seen this cycle because this dev role role has been there long enough where you've

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:54.660
 seen some people like switch companies and all of a sudden they're like vision for the

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:58.860
 future and what software looks like is somehow centered around the new company they're working

00:48:58.860 --> 00:48:59.860
 on.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:05.940
 Yeah, the incentives there just don't make sense to me.

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:11.100
 It's one thing where someone's creating the framework that they think is a future and

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:15.100
 they love and they really have this vision and therefore they're evangelizing it and

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.660
 they're committed to it.

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:22.500
 If that dies, they can just go hop on to the next thing like it's a large level of commitment.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.060
 Dev role is a very low commitment.

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:27.380
 You can switch and there's lots of opportunities.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:32.860
 So yeah, I don't know how seriously I can take some of that and the authenticity thing

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:38.020
 is also kind of there because you're supposed to, you're like pretending like you're representing

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:43.060
 yourself but you technically can't say anything that wouldn't be on brand for the company.

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:44.500
 So yeah, it's just really weird.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.500
 It's weird to me.

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:46.500
 It's weird.

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:50.740
 There's definitely a few like prominent dev role folks that have moved around enough that

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:54.180
 I just don't know where they work anymore and it just means nothing to me.

00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:58.260
 And they have big audiences and people, I don't know, I'm sure the people paying them

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:02.820
 and hiring them think they're getting this asset but it's just so watered down.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:03.820
 At this point.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:08.340
 And I just think the whole career arc, it's mostly like engineers that are good at stuff

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:11.180
 and then they start talking about the thing they're working on and then people hire them

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:15.160
 to do dev rel and now they're like getting more and more out of touch with real engineering

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.860
 problems every day and they're probably not that good at actually like being in front and

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.420
 facing like representing your company.

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:26.060
 That's the overwhelming feeling I get is that like these dev rel, they should just hire like

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:27.060
 actual TV people.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.780
 Like you're going to make this amazing event and you're going to have somebody stand up

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:35.780
 on stage and not look like an idiot and I'm trying not to be like, I don't want to call

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:40.060
 out people like I ultimately, I think they're good at what they did and then they get put

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:43.460
 into a situation where they're not so good at the thing they're doing now and why?

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:44.460
 Why are we doing this?

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.460
 What is the dev rel thing?

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:46.460
 I just, I don't know.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.460
 I have friends that are dev rel.

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:52.780
 I don't think it's a terrible role and I think there are reasons that they exist.

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:59.580
 I just think sometimes they're not properly scouted and hired, I don't know.

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:00.580
 Yeah.

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:05.220
 It's like, I think in most other industries, they do hire professional people that are

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:07.580
 just like good hosts and good like them.

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:08.580
 Yeah.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:09.580
 It's a skill.

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:12.340
 And it's not like an engineer necessarily has that skill.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.340
 Yeah.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.340
 Okay.

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:18.060
 I'm going to stop because I'm just salty.

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.060
 I'm just FOMO.

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.060
 I missed.

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.940
 This just looked like an amazing time.

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:26.900
 Like all of them playing ping pong and all of that looks like so much fun.

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.900
 Okay.

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:28.900
 I guess we should wrap this up.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:29.900
 I don't know.

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:30.900
 We've been talking for a while.

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:31.900
 Next.

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:32.900
 Yes, conf is good.

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.900
 I'm going to make a video about it.

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:34.900
 It's a, I don't know.

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:39.380
 I'm trying to keep it short, but it's like 10 hours of stuff that happened.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.380
 I couldn't believe how many community talks.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.560
 So many community talks.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.060
 They were happening in parallel too, right?

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.060
 Yeah.

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.060
 There's the two stages.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.060
 Yeah.

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.340
 The J and the S stage stands for JavaScript.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.500
 I just looked at my other camera.

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.500
 I'm used to being on Twitch.

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:57.020
 Whenever I say something tongue in cheek, I always look at that camera.

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.540
 JavaScript.

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:03.780
 Are there any talks that sit out to you so far?

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.940
 So they're just kind of all over the place, like what?

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:11.580
 I guess the one that stood out the most is there's somebody making like this.

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.940
 It's like a music synthesizing library.

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:16.740
 I forget the name reactatizer or something.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:20.940
 And he just did a whole talk where he's like making beats with like react components.

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:22.780
 It's kind of cool.

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:23.780
 Yeah.

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:24.780
 The rest of it.

00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:25.780
 I don't know.

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:29.500
 The DevRels being DevRels things like they're a DevRel for a company.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.420
 This talks about Vercel, but also here's what our company does.

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:33.420
 But no, this is about Vercelle.

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:35.620
 That's not that literally saying like this is not what this is about.

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:38.900
 It's about Vercelle and how Vercelle enables us to make this awesome product.

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:42.460
 Let me show you this awesome product.

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:44.540
 That's just the whole conference thing, I don't know.

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:48.860
 My feeling with that is it's cool to invite other companies, but just let them talk about

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.620
 how awesome their product is like it's like weird thing where they're trying to tie it

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:52.620
 in.

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:56.380
 Like if PlanetScale was there, you don't need to be like tied in a Vercelle, just be like

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.380
 here's our product.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.380
 Look how awesome it is.

00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.380
 Yeah.

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.380
 PlanetScale.

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:01.380
 It's exactly.

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:02.380
 It's better for both parties, I think.

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:03.380
 Yeah.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.380
 All right.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.380
 Thanks again, Dax.

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:06.380
 This has been fun.

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.380
 Yeah.

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:08.380
 Thank you.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:08.380
