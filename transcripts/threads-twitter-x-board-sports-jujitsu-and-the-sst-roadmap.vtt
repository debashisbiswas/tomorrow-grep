WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
 Okay, I forget every time recording somehow that's the day the lawn people are here.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.680
 Yeah, yeah, I'm not distracting at all.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.680
 I'm good.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:40.920
 Okay, I just forgot how to say.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.320
 Why why is everyone so wrong on the internet all the time?

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.840
 Oh, what's happening now?

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.280
 Just everybody is wrong.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.280
 And I don't understand it.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.480
 I want to change my mind, like I want people to come in with informed opinions and convince

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.800
 me otherwise of my position makes me smarter.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.000
 Why does anybody do it?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.400
 It happens occasionally, just very occasionally.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.520
 I feel like you're always post stuff.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.800
 I would say like the thing you're saying probably isn't too different than what I would say,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.800
 but I feel like you somehow.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.800
 That way I'm saying it, no, somehow you find a way to phrase it where like you just attract.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.040
 I forgot the word for this, but maybe it's like pettentry, like all the comments that

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.120
 are like, point out like the trivial, yeah, technically, well, technically, or like you

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.120
 forgot this exception.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.400
 I feel like I see you going that happens to you all the time, like you say something.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 I read it.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.680
 I'm like, okay, I get the point of what he's saying.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.440
 But then all the replies are just like, well, you forgot this one thing, or you forgot this

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.440
 other little detail.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.080
 And I feel like that's unique to you, I feel you get sucked into that.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.600
 I invite it somehow.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.640
 I just look kind of dumb and people are like, this guy doesn't know what he's talking about.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.640
 I feel the same way.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.040
 Hypothetically, I want to have a certain kind of conversation and I do get to have that

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.040
 with some people.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.040
 Yeah.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.120
 I think I've learned that it never happens on the internet because the internet is just

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.160
 represents like the average person, and I'm sorry if you're the average person, you're

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.160
 just not very smart.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.280
 I think it's just by definition your average.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.280
 I'm sorry for you to find out in this way, but it is true.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.280
 So I don't think I expect that of most public discussions, like even sometimes I have discussion

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.160
 in public with someone I know really well, because then we get to have that.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.560
 But I don't think I ever get like a really great point made by someone that's totally

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.560
 anonymous.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.160
 And that's why I see the entire other way where I just make people think twice before

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.440
 replying to me, because they know I'm going to punish them.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.680
 Yeah, you've sort of set a precedent that like, you don't put up with those kind of replies.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.160
 I have not set that precedent.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.160
 Yeah.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.120
 I'm just too, I'm too kind in my replies, maybe, I don't know.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.400
 People are not kind to you.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.400
 I know, right?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.280
 That's what I'm saying.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.440
 Just like, come on, you missed the point.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.880
 I need those tweets that you use that are like, if you're applying to me, you probably

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.880
 missed the point.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.960
 Or if you disagree with me.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.960
 Yeah.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.840
 I open source my replies.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.280
 And now everyone can use that and I see people taking them and using that was great.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.280
 And I want more people to contribute back and I'll use theirs too.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.280
 That's awesome.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.280
 I think it's a good idea.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.520
 Speaking of Twitter, I want to talk about something you tweeted about people getting

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.800
 ahead of, we had a breakthrough in AI.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.520
 And now it's time to start figuring out what we're all going to do with our time and this

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.720
 utopia that we're going to live in.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.800
 I love your reaction to that.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.600
 I've definitely heard some of that and I wonder where you heard it.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.400
 I think I've just been seeing, I mean, there's like the range of all the very serious intellectual

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.000
 people talking about how we need to bomb data centers and we need like a satellite policy

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 now.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.800
 Wait, smart intellectual people are saying that.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.040
 Just like the overly intellectual academic people that just spent too much time thinking

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.480
 about stuff and they're just convinced that now we need to establish like some kind of

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.120
 embargo type situation where we don't allow other countries to develop the technology.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.880
 So that's like one extreme of people being, seeing this and being like 10 miles ahead

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.000
 of where I am.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.840
 I'm just like, what's the next step?

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.520
 Like how do I use this in my web app?

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.440
 And then people are talking about all this crazy stuff.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:12.320
 And the other side of it is I hear I see debates about what like a utopia would look like

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.560
 or whether that would be good or like what we would, what we'll be doing and how.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.660
 I don't know, I just feel like everyone's excited to talk about this stuff and I just

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.660
 do not.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.960
 I don't feel like that close to that.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.960
 Yeah.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960
 No, I'm with you.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.960
 I mean, I think like I love to think of a world where you don't have to work.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.160
 I mean, we're like, you get to pursue things you want to pursue and where there's not this

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.240
 huge discrepancy in value, like we're programmers.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.680
 We get compensated pretty well for being programmers.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.800
 Other people have skills that just aren't common said that well, and they maybe put a

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.600
 lot of time into those skills.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.760
 And that's really hard for them.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.560
 I wish we didn't live in that world.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.600
 I wish abundance was such a thing that, you know, we could all just sort of like pursue

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.600
 what makes us happy.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.600
 That'd be amazing.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.760
 I'm sure there's a lot of challenges with that mental health wise and otherwise.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.080
 But I don't know, I love to think that that could be a thing someday.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.360
 I don't know that it's going to be AI or it's going to be fusion energy or whatever.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.000
 I have no idea, but yeah, I don't feel like we're close to like start having that conversation.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Yeah.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.800
 I mean, it's funny because I might feel that way about fusion energy, like if that became

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.160
 a thing that was very practical and worked, I can see how that has a crazy impact on just

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.080
 the cost of everything.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.600
 It's kind of like, you know, we had the Industrial Revolution and that made things that historically,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.400
 if you want something that was pretty good quality, you needed someone to pay someone

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.800
 that could spend like a year of their life making it and then suddenly that became crazy

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.800
 cheap.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.640
 So I can see that with certain technology.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.160
 I just find it weird that we're looking at a thing that like prints text for you and

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.840
 we're like, Oh, that's obviously the next step to that's going to unlock like the solution

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.480
 to every scarcity problem we have.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.480
 It just feels weird to me.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.240
 I don't sort of like see how that directly leads to any of those effects.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.160
 I will say to play the other side of it.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.080
 I see the argument that there's been a big breakthrough and you imagine like all these

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.320
 properties that these LLMs have that were sort of emergent and are catching a lot of

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.040
 people off guard, even people really close to it, that sort of like breakthrough, you

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.600
 can imagine a couple more breakthroughs and we're at some crazy place where I don't know

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.680
 if it's super intelligence, but we have something really, really useful.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.440
 I can I can kind of play that out in my mind and see that like, yeah, maybe we're doing

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.400
 a lot less mundane tasks here in the next decade.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.600
 And just as programmers, like I think things get better and better all the time, I can

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600
 see that.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.220
 I just don't see how it like suddenly solves all the world's problems.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.320
 Like, yeah, I think that's where you just start like making a big leap into we'll see

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.320
 a Reddit.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.320
 I mean, it could.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.320
 Who knows what it could do.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.320
 It's going to be smarter than us.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.320
 Exactly.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.960
 And we've talked about it before, but I wish I could find who said this originally because

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.080
 it it just stuck with me and I just keep repeating over and over and I did I did reply in that

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.560
 in that thread with the same thing where someone explained that what they think is going on

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.960
 is we saw something that felt impossible become possible and now we're very confused and we

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.640
 feel like anything that's impossible should now be possible, even though there's no like

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.640
 tied to it.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.120
 It's like, okay, we had crazy breakthrough in AI that obviously means like global warming

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.720
 is solved is going to be solved or like obviously means like energy is going to be solved.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.000
 You know, even though there's really no hard problem pathway to those.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Yeah.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.960
 So I think we're in a state of crazy optimism, which is cool in some ways, but I don't know,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.720
 but it's just funny because it's just turning into it's not like everyone is getting together

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.240
 hyping each other up on, wow, there's going to be a utopia soon.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.800
 That's actually not the form I'm seeing it take.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.280
 I'm seeing people finding it as a new topic to argue about.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.280
 Yeah.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.680
 Well, the utopia is not actually going to be like that.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.240
 It's going to be like this.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.240
 Right.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.240
 Yeah.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.000
 What kind of policies are we going to need and like what are we going to have to do in

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 that scenario?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 It's just so far ahead of.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 People already debated.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Yeah.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.680
 I feel like we have to talk well, I've said Twitter, we have to talk about the X thing

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.720
 because apparently that's all there is to talk about Elon rebranding to X.com.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.880
 I didn't even know this.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.880
 Did you know this?

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.080
 Just what you just said there?

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.080
 Yeah, I knew that.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.080
 Yeah.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.720
 I mean, I didn't know until two days ago or whatever.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.720
 Well, yeah.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.720
 It was rebranding.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.720
 It was like this weekend was when it.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.200
 Is that been the plan all along?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.960
 Have you read any of Walter Isaacson's books like this?

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.960
 Keep jobs.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.960
 He's my favorite author.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.960
 Are you kidding me?

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.960
 We've talked about this.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.960
 Yeah.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.680
 He's been following Elon Musk for the past two years.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.680
 Oh, really?

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.680
 He's writing.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.800
 He's basically been with Elon for like all these key moments.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.800
 Yeah.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.080
 He's been like, he's like trickles out information every once in a while.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:57.900
 And he did say that even before the acquisition, like months, like almost a year ago, he was

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:03.720
 already talking about rebranding to X.com and this idea of what his vision for that.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.360
 So yeah, I think it's been the plan forever and now there's kind of putting the trigger

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.320
 on it in like a superficial way.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.320
 But yeah.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.720
 So aside from all the short term, like everybody's like, whoa, the logo's down or whatever.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.280
 All the takes that are flying around.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.280
 My mind went to, wow, he's going to like, he's going to completely change.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.280
 It's not going to be Twitter anymore, like that's a big move.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.880
 And it's like, is that a good idea?

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.520
 Like are half the people going to leave because they really were attached to tweeting and Twitter

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.360
 and birds and whatever.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.200
 And it's like, there's like 300 million people on Twitter, like they didn't really make

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.200
 it.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.200
 And that's it.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.720
 I mean, obviously like all of us with our dumb little side projects, like they made it,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.080
 but like they didn't make it make it at the level of meta or whatever.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.080
 Yeah.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.080
 Yeah.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.640
 So like the billion dollar benchmark or billion user benchmark, they're not even close.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.680
 So it's kind of like, maybe you do have to do big things to even have a chance at growing

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680
 to those levels.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.680
 Like maybe you can't just refine the thing.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.680
 I don't know.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.320
 What are your, what are your thoughts on all that?

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.320
 Yeah.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.320
 I mean, I agree.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.120
 I think they've Twitter is like plateaued a long time ago and basically I have done,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.920
 they've like done nothing in the past 10 years during an era where there was so many resources,

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.920
 so much growth.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.440
 Like you can't like, yeah, it's whatever you can't just look at them in isolation.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.280
 You have to look at them by like their competitors and their competitors grew like crazy and

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.280
 they, and they did not.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.480
 So yeah, you have to do something diff quite different.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.400
 I think, I think I just have two feelings around this.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:35.440
 I think one, I'm fine with what it is and what it's been for the past, like ever since

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.920
 I started using it, so I personally am okay if it doesn't change because with change,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.640
 there's just risk that it gets, it gets worse.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.640
 Yeah.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.880
 And so most of my feelings, my emotions around it are like, it's probably just going to get

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.820
 worse and more bloated.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.680
 So that's why I'm not super into this idea.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.000
 But on the other hand, the actual idea is made worth talking about a little bit.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.760
 Again, I don't know if I'm super into that either, but I think the model that people,

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.920
 and people thought that was forever.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:10.440
 I remember when I actually worked on a, at a company in this category for a while.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:16.360
 And even, this was like in 2015 or something, even back then, everyone was looking at Asia

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.920
 and they were like in Asia, there's like the everything app.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.760
 You have WeChat, and that is how you talk to your friends, your doctor.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.760
 That's how you do payments.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.040
 That's how you call a cab.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.560
 That's how you do bank.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:33.080
 Everything is just one, one super app and it's kind of like the OS shifted up one level

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.680
 into like, now this app is just the OS and like, you're kind of installing apps inside

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.320
 the app.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.560
 And I think for a while, everyone's been like, oh yeah, that needs to be recreated or like,

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.560
 why hasn't that happened here?

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.440
 And that's been like a goal or a target.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.760
 So I think that's what Elon is trying to create.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.720
 Oh, I know none of this.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.000
 You must know things, but I don't know.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.080
 I just know that he changed it to x.com and there's an x for a logo now.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.080
 That's literally all I know.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.920
 So that's what I meant by that's like the superficial step and there's like an actual

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.400
 bigger idea behind it.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.400
 And that's a bigger idea.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.680
 Like, there should just be a lot more functionality like you should be, I mean, you can think

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.640
 of almost anything, any other application, like, why do you get jobs through LinkedIn?

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.400
 Like, why is that not happening on Twitter?

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.080
 Like, why do you do payments to the Venmo?

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.240
 Like, why not?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.960
 So there is like something there.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.200
 I think it's extremely, extremely hard to execute on.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:30.040
 I think the success that some of the apps in Asia have had, I think that's just like

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.920
 an artifact of certain timing and certain like scenarios that are specific to that part

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.920
 of the world.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.480
 I don't know if we can recreate it here when we have like crazy amounts of competition

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.360
 with like, you know, if they're going to do an everything app, of course, Mr. Zuckerberg

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.120
 isn't trying to copy it and they're going to be, you know, head there.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.480
 They couldn't and Facebook could have already done this and they kind of are stepping a

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.560
 little bit more in the direction with Instagram, but they haven't gone that far.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.080
 And so if they haven't gone that far and there's probably a reason for it.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.840
 So yeah, that's, that's the idea.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.080
 Again, my feeling around it is like, it seems like very small chance of succeeding.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.800
 Maybe it's what has to happen for them to even exist.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.120
 But I think the most likely case is the app isn't going to kind of get bloated in.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.120
 Yeah.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.960
 And through that lens, like I don't benefit from a billion people using Twitter.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.480
 I like Twitter how it is.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:25.320
 So I guess from our perspective, that it's not necessarily like a big welcome change.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.680
 But I guess they're trying to, yeah, figure out how to make it.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.880
 That's such a good point that like for 10 years when there was more money in the history

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:40.800
 of money floating around, but they just like maintained Twitter and like grew really bad.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.640
 I mean, organizationally, they grew a lot, I guess 7,000 people or whatever, but for

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.640
 what?

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.440
 Maintained Twitter.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.440
 It's interesting.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.800
 That's a good time to check in on threads.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.120
 Do you still use threads?

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.120
 Is threads still a thing?

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.600
 I was, this was really funny because yesterday or this was either yesterday or this morning

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.600
 I opened it.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.280
 Just forget, I haven't looked at it in days.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.280
 I opened it.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.280
 I kid you not.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.120
 I scrolled through 20 posts.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.480
 Every single post was about Twitter.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.680
 Every single one was like, Twitter, that idiot, he's shooting into X dot com.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.680
 X dot com.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.680
 Can you believe it?

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.680
 I'm like.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.680
 That's amazing.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.680
 Yeah.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.360
 So I don't, I think, I think you've probably seen their numbers, right?

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.560
 It's like, I haven't D.A.U. just tanking.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.560
 I've seen nothing.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.960
 I've been completely unplugged from the world.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.520
 So please be my, my, uh, so they, I don't know.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.920
 I don't know where this data is coming from.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.480
 I don't know if they're releasing it publicly or if it's leaks, but the chart of their daily

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.140
 active users is like, the last I saw it last week was down to like 10 million daily actives

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.200
 up down from like, what was it?

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.200
 What did it peak at?

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.680
 50 to 100 million something in that range.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.520
 So, uh, it's definitely passed that initial thing.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.320
 Obviously the people behind this definitely knew this was going to happen.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.360
 I think I can even tell from the way they were wording it.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.720
 They kept staying over retention because I think they knew that there's always an initial

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.920
 excitement.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.880
 I personally feel like if you don't figure out the magic and capture it right at that

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.360
 moment, it's gone forever.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.720
 I don't think I've ever seen a case where anyone has come back from that.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.640
 Like thinking about like clubhouse, think about like just, I mean, blue sky also.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.600
 Uh, so I feel like it's done.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.720
 If once you like, you don't capture at that moment, it's, it's gone, but obviously they're

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.720
 going to keep trying.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.400
 I have all kinds of thoughts here.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.520
 Like what, what is that magic?

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.160
 And then I think like, okay, so they didn't get the Twitter crowd to stick around, but

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:32.040
 like the 700 million people that use Facebook, but don't use Twitter or that use Instagram

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:37.880
 or whatever the billion app, the billion person app you want to, to reference TikTok.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.400
 Like where those 700 million presumably, it's more than that, I guess, because it's not a

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.200
 perfect separation.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.840
 Why couldn't they use threads is text just like, did Twitter strike some magical chord

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.000
 with the text medium that will never be replicated?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.640
 And it's just not a very good medium and it doesn't make sense.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.920
 Do you have any thoughts around all that?

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:03.200
 I think it's just the simplest one, Asian is, uh, it's just the 80% of people are lurkers

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.280
 or even higher percent, like 95, whatever it is.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.280
 Yeah.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.160
 Uh, so you're not really competing for that percentage.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.920
 So that, yeah, you said like those 700 million people or whatever, most of those people, if

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.880
 not all of them might just be great consumers.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.600
 They might not be great producers on these platforms.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:26.080
 So yeah, unless, unless you capture, like, I mean, there were a couple of days where

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.000
 everyone that I followed up and, you know, typically post stuff on Twitter, uh, was on

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 threads and then they all just lost interest and went back to posting their best stuff

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 on, on Twitter.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.800
 And now I think I see some people posting on both, like the same content, but yeah, if

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.560
 they're on Twitter, then the reason other people are on Twitter is for them and they're

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.600
 just going to stay where those people are.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.600
 So interesting.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.920
 I don't think about why I'm on Twitter.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.360
 I've never, I've never thought about it.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.560
 I guess I've been there so long and I mostly just would have been a lurker and I slip into

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.480
 that still, I guess, where I just, I scroll through it, but I can't think of thing like

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.960
 a thing that I'm like, man, I'm glad I saw that on Twitter.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.800
 Who are the people that are valuable producers on Twitter?

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.520
 What are their things you are like happy to consume or is it just like hanging out?

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.080
 Uh, well now it's become, because I think I'm, I'm now more on the producer side.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.840
 Uh, I think when you're in that size, more hanging out with people, you know, um, but

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:27.160
 that said, like I do a lot of my knowledge has really come from Twitter, just from the

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.440
 years of me using it.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:34.040
 Uh, I used to follow, I mean, my, my following habits have changed, but I wasn't following

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.880
 a lot of software people until the last, until I started working at SST.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.880
 Yeah.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.000
 And I've been on Twitter for years before that and I was in like a kind of, kind of completely

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.280
 different bubble, just more like this startup, like business founder bubble.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.280
 Yeah.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.760
 I feel like I learned a lot from there.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.400
 I've also learned stuff that I thought was right and then learned later, learn was wrong.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.600
 But to me, it's just like a good source of information.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:01.440
 I can't remember anyone specific obviously, but I definitely can track specific ideas

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:06.360
 that I understand now have having come from, from Twitter.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.360
 Yeah.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.520
 I guess, yeah, I guess there is good stuff.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.840
 I guess there's things that I don't really consume like blogs or I'm not like consuming

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.840
 other things on the internet.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.640
 So I guess anything I am learning, it's probably starting at Twitter.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.640
 Yeah.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.560
 And anything new that gets announced, like that might be something you want to consider.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.400
 You probably, I, it's either right here from Hacker News or here from Twitter.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.400
 So yeah.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.760
 Uh, I mean, I can just think back to anything like, uh, like when the, when a show first

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.520
 came out, but I think I saw that on heaven on Twitter.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.520
 Yeah.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.520
 Yeah.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520
 I don't read Hacker News either.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:42.400
 Too much of the, the like typical dev content.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.400
 Maybe that's good.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.400
 Maybe it's bad.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.400
 I don't know.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.400
 I don't use Reddit.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.400
 I don't use Reddit right there.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.400
 Okay.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.400
 Cool.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.280
 You have to, there's something you have to consume so that you bring value to people

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.160
 and then you rely on them to consume other stuff and bring it to you.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.160
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.160
 Say it again.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.320
 There's some things you have to consume so you can bring value to other people.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.320
 What do you mean?

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:08.080
 So one of my friends has recently got super into movies and just like just knowing everything

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:13.560
 about, uh, like really good movies, whether they're big or small or random or whatever.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:19.140
 So he consumes a lot of that content and then brings to me like 5% of it, the stuff that

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.140
 I might care about.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.140
 You still it.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.140
 Yeah.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.140
 I rely on him to do that work.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.140
 Okay.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.160
 He lies on me for, you know, engineering stuff.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.160
 Yeah.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.960
 I just think that that's how stuff on Twitter tends to work like people distill stuff.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.960
 Okay.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.680
 What, what can I throw myself into and be valuable to you, Dax?

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.660
 What could I distill for you?

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.640
 I want to give you, I want to give you that value.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.800
 You can't, but the thing, it's not something that I had to tell you.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.960
 It's something that you are more interested in than I am.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.400
 Well, I'm not interested in anything.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.400
 Could you please tell me what I'm going to be interested in?

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.840
 Well, I guess you're just useless that I do sometimes feel like, like, I don't know.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.840
 I don't have interests.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.840
 I don't care.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.840
 Well, you're getting into Jiu-Jitsu now.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.840
 Oh, Jiu-Jitsu.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:03.320
 I'll, okay, I'll throw myself into Jiu-Jitsu and I will distill the 5% for you and you'll

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.200
 be terrible at Jiu-Jitsu because you need 100%.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.200
 Here's a problem.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.200
 That same friend that's into movies is also really into Jiu-Jitsu.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.200
 Oh, no.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.200
 He's probably better at both.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.000
 He's covering both for me.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.200
 See, you really don't need me.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.200
 Okay.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.200
 Good to know.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.200
 Just, I don't know.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.200
 Just find a new hobby.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.200
 So you give new hobbies though.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.760
 I realized the other day that I live in Miami.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.760
 I realized that.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.760
 You do.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.960
 I don't know if you realize that, but you do live in Miami.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.960
 Yeah.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.960
 I was like, oh, I live in Miami.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.240
 That opens up all kinds of things that I just would never even have considered before.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.800
 Grabbing an orange off a tree.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.800
 It's not an orange thing.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.800
 Get in mind.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.800
 Pressing an alligator.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800
 I don't know.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800
 I like mango.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.800
 Mango.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.800
 Yeah.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.800
 I actually haven't seen it.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.800
 I don't think people have it.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.800
 So mango trees are beautiful.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.800
 So everyone has them everywhere.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.800
 Yeah.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.800
 Yeah.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.800
 I don't think people have orange trees like just hanging out around.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.800
 They're just stuck in order.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.880
 Yeah, I guess the time I've spent in Florida, I lived in Florida.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.280
 I don't remember seeing any orange trees.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.280
 Interesting.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.280
 Continue.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.280
 You have a new hobby or something.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.280
 So I'm like, okay, I'm like around water.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.280
 I can get into water sports stuff.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:07.280
 Like that is a thing I can do now, which I, which has been a hugely tedious thing before.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.440
 So I love stuff with boards.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.040
 So like I can see a long board hanging behind me.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.080
 I just love like, I don't, I'm not like a skateboarder.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.680
 Like I don't like a skateboard and do tricks, but I love just like getting a lot of speed

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.840
 and like carving and kind of go like standing on a board and doing that.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.220
 So what are those options in the water?

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.920
 So obviously you can, you can wake surf that requires a boat.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.560
 And I think at some point I will have one because I'm, I can see myself getting really

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.560
 into it.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.560
 You will have a boat.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.560
 Yeah.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.560
 I know everyone says don't get a boat.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.240
 Find a friend that has a boat, which has been my policy so far.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240
 I never heard that.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.240
 Yeah.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.800
 I know it's, they're just like stupid expensive to just not just purchase business to like

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.800
 have.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.400
 But I do think I can see myself doing that because I, like I said, I just love, I would

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.280
 just love, you know, the wakeboard whenever I want.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.280
 Yeah.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:01.720
 So that's not a good option because I can't just like do that on a whim paddleboarding

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.720
 kind of boring.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.360
 I've done that before.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.360
 Yeah.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.760
 It's like, it's like nice to get good workout, but it's not like exhilarating.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.760
 Yeah.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.080
 So that leaves two other options.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.840
 So one is skinboarding, which sounds dumb because it's just like on the shore.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.400
 But I started watching videos.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.640
 It's just like you just have a board and you like run and you jump on it and like slide

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.640
 across the.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.640
 Yeah.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.720
 But I saw people that are like really good at it and they've effectively turned into

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.480
 a surfboard because they like ride it all the way out into the, into the ocean and they

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.480
 like catch the waveback.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.080
 It's like, that's like a great place to start because I go to the beach all the time and

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.080
 set just lying around.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.320
 I can do something a little bit more active.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.320
 Is the last one.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.320
 Can I guess?

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.320
 Yes.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.320
 I know some things about boards.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.320
 Yes.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.320
 What's the last one?

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.320
 Is it surfing?

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:48.240
 No, it's not surfing because my amazing place is surf.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.240
 Oh, okay.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.640
 It's not like the best way is people do it, but it's, it's not super fun.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.640
 It's not like Hawaii.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.640
 Yeah.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.640
 I think people go to Puerto Rico.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.440
 I guess Puerto Rico is a crazy surfing, but at crazy point where you're dying if you're

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.440
 there, potentially.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.440
 Oh, geez.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.440
 Yeah.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.440
 But this was fast surfing.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.440
 No, no, no.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.440
 I don't want to guess it.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.920
 Which is kiteboarding, which I have no idea what that is.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.920
 Gladly.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.280
 It's basically just, it's like surfing.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.280
 You have a board.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.280
 It's short.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.280
 You're not trapped into it.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.880
 There's like little hooks that you kind of slipped your feet into.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.800
 And you, you have a harness and there's like a kite attached to the end of it.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.960
 And I see people doing this all the time.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.600
 It's like super popular here whenever I'm at the beach.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.600
 I see people.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.600
 The kite holds you.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.600
 It's enough force.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.600
 Yeah.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.560
 It's like a, it's like a very long rope, I guess.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.080
 I don't, I don't know any of the times I just started looking into it.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.240
 And you, you can like kind of control the, there's like a, there's like a bar in front

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.240
 of you.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.320
 You are attached to the kite, but there's also a bar and using the bar, you can kind

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.080
 of control the kite and you can do all kinds of cool stuff.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.640
 So it's kind of like surfing, but you don't need to rely on waves because you can rely

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.640
 on the wind.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.640
 Yeah.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.640
 Okay.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.640
 Yeah.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.640
 So I, it's, it's pretty difficult.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.240
 Like it's not something that you can like skim board and just go and do myself.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.760
 But you have to like take lessons and stuff and you actually have to be licensed to like

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.760
 go out in the water.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.320
 But I'm like, I want to, I want to get into this is one, it's super fun.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.640
 If I can get decent at it, like, it just looks so fun.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.200
 There's all these crazy videos of people like, I don't think I'm brave enough to do this

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.200
 kind of thing.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.040
 But you can get a lot of air on it.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.640
 You can basically like fly because like the kite is like pulling you.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.640
 Yeah.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.640
 Yeah.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.640
 So people like jump over islands.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.640
 Like it's, it's insane.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.120
 They just like, obviously small ones, but those like jump over the whole thing.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.120
 I've seen videos of people jumping over yachts.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:35.880
 I've seen people like flying by a yacht and like grabbing a beer, like it's just really

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.880
 insane.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.320
 But for me, I just want to like, you know, even just something a lot simpler than that would

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.560
 be, would be really fun.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.560
 So I'm trying to.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.720
 Is it good exercise?

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.720
 I guess it's probably pretty good.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.360
 Yeah, you have to be in like pretty good shape is just controlling the kite is, is just tough

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.360
 on your arms.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.240
 Like I've, have you done like windsurfing before?

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.080
 That's one where like, uh, wait, wait, no, it's a parasol board.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.480
 Parasongs where you do nothing.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.480
 You just sit.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480
 You're a bi.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.480
 Yeah.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.480
 Yeah.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.480
 Yeah.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.600
 Windsurfing is like, uh, it's like a boat.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.880
 It's like a board with a sale on it.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.280
 We have to hold the sale up.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.280
 Yeah.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.280
 Yeah.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.280
 And that's, I remember doing that.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.280
 That was like really exhausting.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.280
 Yeah.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.280
 Yeah.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.840
 So those things are if you kind of do it every week, eventually you just build up whatever

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.840
 you need.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.840
 Yeah.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.920
 That's so the jiu-jitsu thing, like I do, I lift, like I do like the basic lifts, you

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.840
 know, like press, bench, squat, deadlifts, that kind of stuff, uh, turns out I don't

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:34.920
 do anything that like works my growing muscles at all because jiu-jitsu, that's, it's so painful.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.640
 I just constantly, I'm having to stretch my growing muscles out.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.640
 It's like you're squeezing your legs together a lot and you're, I don't know, just the things

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.720
 you're doing in jiu-jitsu are not things that my body normally does.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.920
 So I'm in that like second week and I'm just, I'm hurting.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.920
 There's some places that are not ready for it.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:50.920
 Yeah.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.200
 I mean, it seems like it works out every possible part of your body.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.200
 Yeah.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.840
 It's pretty like full body exertion.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.960
 It's, it's like we do five minute rolls and I can't believe how exhausting five minutes

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:07.400
 can be like just the amount of sweat, full body exhaustion, just like all your muscles,

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.400
 everything.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.400
 It's really great.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.400
 I love that part of it.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.400
 I mean, that's the only reason I'm doing it.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:17.680
 I was at the gym yesterday and on the TV they had, they're just playing like jiu-jitsu highlights

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.680
 for some reason.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.320
 And I was like, just imagining you doing that.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.120
 I'm like, this is really funny.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.360
 Yeah.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.520
 Just imagine that except I don't, don't have a plan.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.160
 I don't know what I'm doing and I'm just getting rolled around.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.160
 Somebody's on top.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.160
 Yeah.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.920
 Well, it doesn't look, it's one of those things where it's such like, it's so realistic because

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.520
 it's just like two people like rolling on each other.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.120
 So it doesn't like look cool, right?

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.120
 It just looks.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.120
 Yeah.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.120
 Yeah.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.120
 Which is what it is.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.120
 Yeah.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.840
 And I think the less experienced, the more chaotic, I'm watching some of the like upper

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:53.800
 belts in my gym, when they, when they roll together, it's so much more like chess.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.120
 It's so much more methodical.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.000
 And you can see the mind games are playing and how they're hiding different things they're

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.160
 trying to do.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.880
 It's just way more interesting and it's slower, I think.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.160
 It's more methodical.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.400
 Like when I roll with another white belt, we're just like sweating and going at it.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.320
 Like we have no restraint.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.040
 We're just like, it's like if you told two people to wrestle, I mean, that we just basically

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.040
 don't know what we're doing.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.040
 Yeah.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.120
 It's very different though to watch or to actually roll with somebody who has some experience.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.120
 They're a lot better.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.760
 I think to roll if they know what they're doing.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.840
 You think you're getting better?

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.280
 I mean, I'm still just like taking in so much information.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:32.040
 I've been in there as much as I can be, like as much as it's open and what, you know,

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.240
 when they have structured stuff.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.320
 So I'm trying to soak it all in.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.880
 And I think I learned pretty fast, like I'm just generally a pretty fast learner.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.600
 So I'm definitely picking some things up.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.840
 It's starting to like, I can imagine how these people are doing what they're doing.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:51.440
 I still can't do it, but I can kind of imagine how you could have the kind of knowledge to

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.440
 pull some of that stuff off.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.520
 But it really is so mental.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.760
 There's like, I've been pretty good shape.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.720
 I guess at this point, like I feel like I can, I can exert myself for five minutes with

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:04.200
 somebody, but I don't have the mind games and I don't know, I just don't know how to

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.200
 get people to submit.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.560
 Like I don't know any of those submissions.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.920
 So I have no plan.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.600
 I'm just trying to defend myself for five minutes, basically, but yeah, I mean, I'm learning

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.600
 stuff.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.760
 You should try, you try whispering insults in their ear, just get their head and you're

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.760
 terrible at this.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.760
 So it's like a one hour thing and then, like, do you have enough energy for like a whole

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.760
 hour?

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.200
 Oh, so I went in this morning at five thirty, an hour before, because there's a couple

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.240
 of, there's a few guys that go in early and they just, they practice stuff together.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.120
 They roll, they do different things.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.160
 So I'm getting in the extra credit, you know what I mean?

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.680
 And then I'm there for an hour or less.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.680
 And then there's some rolling after that.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.160
 So just like free rolling.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.160
 Yeah.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.840
 No, it's, it's like two, three hours when it, you know, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Monday

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:54.400
 Wednesday, Friday, it's just a couple hours, but yeah, it's a lot of, a lot of exerting,

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.040
 a lot of trying to learn stuff, but it's just going to take time.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:03.080
 Do you, do you believe in the like, I said the 10,000 hours things on Twitter and everybody's

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.200
 like, Malcolm Gladwell, you're an idiot.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.840
 Like do you believe in putting in time and like it takes years of effort to get really

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.840
 good at something?

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.840
 Do you believe that?

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.840
 Or am I missing something?

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.480
 I don't get how that's a controversial statement at all.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.120
 It's like, yeah, you have to put in a lot of time to get better at something.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.880
 Why is that at all controversial?

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.880
 I mean, okay.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.880
 Yes.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.880
 Okay.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.320
 So you agree that it does take, I'm waiting to hear like there's a shortcut and I just

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.320
 missed it.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.320
 Like you can get really good at something.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:35.320
 If you just do the right thing for 100 hours, I haven't heard that right thing yet.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:40.600
 I mean, I don't like it's the 10,000 hours thing is, I guess somewhat literal, but it's

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.840
 more like conceptual, like the idea is like it takes a long time.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.840
 Yeah.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.840
 Years.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.040
 I don't, I don't understand because how can it, if it took any shorter, then there would

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:54.480
 just be a lot more people that were good at a thing and it would just be very accessible

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.920
 to become really good at it.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.920
 Like the whole.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.920
 Yeah.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:03.360
 I mean, good is you're like in the 1% of people, like a very small percentage of people, the

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.760
 only way you get there is by doing it a lot more combined with whatever natural ability

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.360
 that you need.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.360
 It's refreshing to me.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.720
 Like it's an encouraging thing to me that like I could decide I want to be really good

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.960
 at anything.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.440
 And I just know it, you just got to get the reps in if you spend the time, like, and I

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.120
 don't get worried about like, I don't know, did I get the most out of today's jujitsu?

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.840
 Like, I just know it's like a long battle of attrition and it's the thing I want to do

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.320
 for a long time as long as I don't get hurt.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.280
 Like that's, to me, that's the right mindset and you don't sort of set yourself up for

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.080
 disappointment and the highs and lows.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.840
 You just kind of like, you know where you're at and you're not there yet and it's going

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.840
 to be a long time.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.840
 I don't know.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.840
 I don't know why.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.840
 Yeah.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.800
 Some people seem to think that's, because there was like this attachment to 10,000 hours

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.560
 or it was put in some books or there was a study.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.560
 I don't care about any of that stuff.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.660
 I just know, like, in my mind, it's like, I'm going to spend several years really throwing

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.240
 myself into something before I'm really any good at it.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:06.480
 I just don't understand how it could be any other way.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.760
 Is there, yeah, I think it's, I think the thing that I always think about is I'd rather

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:15.440
 be stupid with like a thousand attempts at something than like be really smart with just

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.440
 a couple.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.440
 Yeah.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.440
 Yeah.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.200
 Like you just, I just rather spend a lot of time on it and it doesn't really matter.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.780
 I think the thing that people, the thing that people get stuck with is they try to optimize

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.280
 way too early.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.920
 So I imagine that there's like a spectrum, there's, you first start doing something, you

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920
 suck.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.840
 You're like the worst you possibly could be given your natural ability.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.120
 Then there's a best you possibly could be given whatever natural ability you have.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.600
 And the gap there is massive.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:47.640
 It's so, so massive like you just, you don't need any strategy to get like halfway up that

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.120
 spectrum or even like 80% of the spectrum.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.120
 Yeah.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.240
 So the summarizations, like the, like the speaking out the last bits of whatever is possible

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.240
 for you.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.520
 And I think people spend way too much time researching a lot of that stuff up front,

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.040
 get super in their head about it.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.760
 And then like expect it all to happen quickly and there's give up.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.760
 So it, yeah.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.760
 So that's the thing.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.760
 That's the other pushback I got.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.360
 Besides people just being like 10,000 hours, that's made up like, yeah, I know the numbers

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360
 made up.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:19.120
 But the other thing people said is like, you got to get quality hours, quality 10,000 hours.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.480
 And to me, like if it's not quality, I'm not going to do it for 10,000, like if I'm going

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.480
 to get bored.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.360
 If I'm just on YouTube and I'm not doing the thing, sure, that's not going to like make

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.360
 me better at a thing.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.360
 I'm not doing the thing.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.920
 I'm doing, I'm watching YouTube, like I'm not too worried about how you're spending

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.920
 those 10,000 hours.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.080
 Because if you're actually doing the thing for 10,000 hours, you're just, you're not

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.520
 going to be, I don't know, you're not going to, you're not even going to know in the, in

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.480
 the beginning, like what you should be doing, like you're literally just doing it.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.960
 You don't know what quality is till you, like you learn what quality is after some time.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.320
 I see people working out all the time, people are like, no, this is the best way to work

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.320
 out.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.320
 Like that's the best way to work out.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.400
 And they're trying to get through all these debates before they even start doing anything.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.840
 Like you can literally do anything in the gym, like literally do anything in the gym and

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.840
 do consistently.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.040
 And you're going to be better than the vast majority of people.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.960
 I think that's the most encouraging and like the best thing for my mind, or maybe it doesn't

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.960
 apply to everybody.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.960
 Because it's simple.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.960
 Yeah, it's simple.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.840
 Yeah, I don't have to like min max in my first year of something, I can worry about that

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.840
 later.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.840
 So I agree with you.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.840
 Cool.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.240
 I had one more topic that I wanted to go into.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:31.040
 So this is complete shift going back to talking about tech a little bit.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.140
 I mentioned to see the other day, but I have a theory.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.140
 It's not my theory.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.840
 I think I've heard a few people talking about it.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.480
 And it's about Vercel, our favorite, our favorite topic, our favorite company to talk

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.480
 about.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.480
 It's been a while since we've talked about Vercel.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.480
 Yeah, that's why I feel okay talking about them because we haven't talked about them in

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.480
 a while.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.500
 But the theory is that they're currently fundraising.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:52.440
 And the reason I think this is if you look at some of the stuff they've been doing over

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.800
 the past, I probably would say three months is a little bit indicative of that.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.880
 So Guillermo has been a lot, there's CEO has been a lot more public, like he did a few

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.640
 big interview, I think he did a Shrutekari interview, just not something that has been

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.640
 a normal habit.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.640
 It's like a new habit.

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:10.640
 Yeah.

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.120
 They have been talking a lot about AI.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.000
 They have put AI into certain people's titles.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.200
 They are hosting a bunch of AI meetups.

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.720
 They are posting constantly about some of the AI tooling their building.

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.160
 And there's obviously maybe a logical, like not logical, but like a good, good, good

00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.160
 progress.

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.400
 And from the do is obviously everyone's adding a functionality.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.200
 But to the degree they're like talking about it, it's actually one of the only things I

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.980
 hear them talking about now.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:37.880
 And this definitely is going to help a lot with investor conversation.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:38.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.640
 We are investors are like trying to line up with some trend and the better you line up

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.000
 with that.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.160
 So I think they are probably fundraising right now.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:51.160
 That's my, that's my guess, which is bananas, just at first blush.

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.680
 I mean, I don't know their financial situation, but like, but they raised three hundred plus

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.640
 million dollars and they're fundraising.

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.640
 Yeah.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.960
 But I mean, no matter how much you raise, you, you are roughly planning on like a always

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.520
 18 month, 24 month, like runway.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.520
 Oh, that's true.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.520
 Yeah.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520
 Yeah.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.840
 So I think you raised so much, how do you invest that wisely in 18 months?

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.880
 I know that's the only way.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.880
 Yeah.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.800
 Also from an investment point of view, I think investors also require you to spend the money

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.160
 because otherwise from their point of view, it's not being put to work.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.280
 It's just like moving from one bank out to another.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.280
 Yeah.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.040
 So I imagine they're, I think timing wise also, I think it does, it does line up from their

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.040
 last one.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.040
 Yeah.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.040
 I'm sure they like.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.040
 What's their next raise?

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040
 How much are they raising?

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.040
 At what valuation?

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.040
 I don't know.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.040
 I don't know.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.040
 I know.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.520
 I think if they maintain their existing valuation, that would actually be a pretty big win.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.520
 A win?

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.520
 Yeah.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.520
 Yeah.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.520
 Because there's an evaluate.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.520
 I think it was 2.5 billion or something.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.960
 Well, that's not actually as high as I would have thought.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:55.320
 I think their revenue, whether they announced for what it was, 40 million a year or something

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.320
 like that.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.320
 Was it?

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.320
 That was 100.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.320
 I don't remember what it was.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:04.360
 But even within that range, that's so like a massive markup.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.360
 Oh, sure.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.560
 Just like when they raised, that was like peak tulips season or whatever they call it.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.560
 Of course.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.560
 Yeah.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.560
 I would have thought the number was bigger than that.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.560
 I don't know.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.560
 Yeah.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.560
 Yeah.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.560
 Yeah.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.560
 Yeah.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.560
 I think they, I think at that point, they had like 20 million in revenue.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.560
 So 20 million, 2.5 billion.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.560
 That's pretty nuts.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.560
 Okay.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.060
 So I think their current, based on that interview, I don't remember what the number

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:31.240
 was, but I do remember thinking that if they're at that revenue now and they can get someone

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:37.280
 to pay for the last valuation number, like that, that's a, that's a pretty good outcome.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.700
 That means they can like solidly say they're worth 2.5 billion.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:41.700
 Who led their last round?

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.480
 I don't know anything about their, I don't remember either.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.520
 Uh, I do remember them and Netlify raised like within one month of each other around

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.480
 the same amount at a similar value.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.880
 How's Netlify doing?

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.960
 I know they just had the round of layoffs and they restructured a bit.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.560
 But like how, how, in terms of like, I don't know a lot of people that use Netlify, I hear

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.560
 Versailles constantly, I don't know who's using Netlify people who still call their thing

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.560
 a JAMstack app.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.560
 I guess.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.320
 So I don't know what JAMstack is, I just have no idea what the hell that is.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.760
 You know who uses Netlify?

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.720
 We use Netlify for some reason.

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.760
 We literally built a product that can host any front end and we do not use it.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.760
 How messed up is that?

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.660
 Wait, you use Netlify to host what?

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.660
 Your console?

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:24.660
 No, not the console.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.800
 But finally, the console is not, is like using your own stuff, but we're just like, we

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:33.720
 yeah, but like seed, I think seeds front end is Netlify our docs and our website.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.720
 And it's just a legacy of like, just legacy from before we had any of our tooling.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.720
 But it's so annoying.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.720
 I've never used it though.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.720
 Is it good?

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.720
 Sorry.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.160
 It's just one of those things where like, I don't need it to be good.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.680
 You know when sometimes you don't need something to be, yeah, you, it's just a thing that solves

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.680
 a problem.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.080
 We need to be, you don't need to be any more than that.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.960
 Everyone tries to make their product a lot more than that and then it kind of becomes

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:56.960
 worse somehow.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.240
 That's how I feel. It's like, I push something all of a sudden there's like, all these like

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:05.960
 GitHub integration things popping up and they're always failing because like, it's not set up

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:10.160
 correctly. And then, uh, so that's like ugly and annoying. I don't care about any of that

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.160
 stuff.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.160
 And I go into Netlify.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.160
 Twitter, we just want to stay the same.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.160
 Yeah.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.160
 We just, we all just pause.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.920
 Can we just build something and then leave it forever?

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:21.440
 And if you go to Netlify, then there's, I just find it very confusing and overwhelming

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.240
 because there's like a million tabs, million options for all the different things.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.040
 I'm just like, we're just deploying a static site.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.040
 That's all.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.040
 That's always challenging.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.040
 Jamstack site.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.040
 Even.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.040
 Yeah, exactly.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:35.200
 I think, I think it's a jam site. It's static. Is that what, is that what jam is?

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.720
 I don't, I probably maybe JavaScript and markup. I don't know.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.720
 Oh, is that what jam is?

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.720
 I think so.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.720
 Maybe.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:42.720
 Oh.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:47.160
 That was actually intuition. I maybe have heard it before, but is it everything.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.160
 I was going to say that.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.160
 I was going to say that.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.160
 Like, what is not that was?

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.160
 Okay.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.800
 Uh, I want to ask you about the console, the SST console. How do you guys, how do you

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.800
 guys envision?

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:03.200
 I'm using it now. I'm a user of the SST console. So I know you have at least one user. Wow.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.400
 And I'm using it to never open the CloudWatch tab again, which is great. But where does it

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.400
 go from here?

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.400
 Tell me your road.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:13.720
 So currently what you're using is it's tailing only, right? So you spent, you open it and

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.680
 it tails, which is sometimes useful, but I don't think is like, I think most of the time

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.720
 you don't want tailing, you just want to like, you know, like scroll through your logs backwards.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.720
 So that's what I'm working on. I've been working on the past couple of days, probably going

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:31.320
 to finish it up today. Hopefully we'll see how it goes. But very simple. You open it up.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.800
 Everything sorted by the way you think about it. I have a front end for the loss in front

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:41.320
 and I have like an API route. Here's the logs for it. And just something really basic just

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:46.040
 from now you can page backwards. You can say go to eight hours ago, page backwards. So very

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:50.160
 simple, like nothing super crazy is just the basic. When people think of logs, they just

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:55.520
 want to see a list of messages in this time. So yeah, I don't have to like think about

00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:01.140
 what a log group is and like find the most recent log is just list of descending or ascending

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:07.640
 or whatever. And the other thing is we group it by by invocation, which is obviously helpful

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:12.840
 because that's what's nice about Lambda. Like you your logs can be grouped by by invocation.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:17.640
 So the next thing we go from here is so I'm just I'm really just building for myself.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:22.040
 So it's so easy about this. Yeah, I just keep thinking about what I go to do and what

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:26.360
 is not working or is missing. The next thing I want to see is I just like in that main

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:32.640
 area, we see our resources. I just want to quickly see our accounts that are per like

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:38.320
 per stack or per for when you see all your sub resources. Yeah, exactly. So when you see

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.980
 your various functions, I just want to like see, okay, this had 80 errors in the last eight

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:47.120
 hours. So I can just go click that and then just see a list of invocations I've had errors

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:54.800
 in them and like, I think with those two things combined that handles like 80% of the reason

00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:00.280
 that I go to data goes console or like anything I do in production. It's usually I'm reacting

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.560
 to an error or making sure that there aren't any errors and I'm just looking through them.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:10.360
 Yes, you can get really fancy with like exception reporting and all that stuff. We're kind.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:15.160
 I think we're trying to challenge all that we're like what's like the smallest tool we

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.920
 can give you to solve the problem. Yeah, and until it feels like it's not enough, we're

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.080
 going to add more. So obviously, tailing was like the smallest tool, not enough for that

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.960
 more thing and not enough for that more thing.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:27.720
 Tailing's been very useful for active development. Like, I mean, that's mostly what I'm looking

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:32.280
 for. That's what I use the old console for, I guess to like it had something like that,

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:36.240
 didn't it? Oh, for local. Yeah. For local development. Yeah. Yeah. So last week, we worked

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.400
 a lot on a local experience. I guess that's for it's not for the Azure stuff that's for

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:44.280
 like the API. So, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So being able to say payloads and replaying

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:50.680
 and all that, those are just been feature requests for awhile. Where we're going to go next is

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:57.600
 a user management. So when you connect your AWS accounts, one of those is probably going

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:04.520
 to be your organizational account. Yeah. Or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. So one of the reason

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:09.280
 I go into AWS console is I am adding a user. So we're going to have this thing where you

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.320
 add it when you add a user to the SST console, you can like link them. You can say that, okay,

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:18.960
 this is like linked that automatically creates an SSO user for them. You can download your

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:23.880
 credentials file or your config file. So you don't like explaining people how to set that

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:29.520
 up. Make that whole process of like onboarding a new developer really easy. So I think if

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:34.920
 we have that, I don't think I go to the console for much more. I had an interesting conversation

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:39.360
 with the drizzle people because they're working on it's already out and the continue work

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:47.280
 on a drizzle studio, which is a web based SQL query tool. Is this what we said needed

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.760
 to exist on like a I think our last episode, we talked about this. Yeah, exactly. Like

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:57.640
 a really good SQL tool. Yeah. Yeah. Browser based. Love it. So I obviously love the team

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.640
 and I feel like everything they do. It's just going to become good. Even if it's not like

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.960
 the best today, I think they're always on the right path. So they are so their tool they

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:12.480
 build is not dependent on like you using drizzle. It's just a generic total for an SQL database.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.760
 I think if you use it, there's like more features that get unlocked, but you don't have to. So

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.880
 we're thinking about doing integration where you'll see your RDS resource in our console.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:26.680
 Yeah. You can click query it open up in a new tab that's already authenticated and you can query

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:32.520
 your database. So that's pretty useful for production development, everything. What's really nice

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:38.440
 about that is that's actually a construct that gets deployed. And the reason that needs to happen

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:44.680
 is so you can put the Lambda function in a VPC, which means you don't need a VPN anymore. Oh,

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:52.040
 which is like nice. So you're off into the SST console is like your way of getting into those

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:56.040
 private resources. That's cool. Yeah. So I'm figuring out the exact token exchange right now. But

00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:00.840
 basically we can tell drizzle studio. This person definitely has access to this resource. Yeah.

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:10.520
 And then they can proxy for the Lambda. Would it work if the RDS instance predates your SST app

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:14.920
 and you import it? Yeah, I was thinking about that. So I think I think they're going to build a

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:23.400
 drizzle studio contract and you can spend that up and point to the RDS instance that it needs.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:28.760
 An existing RDS. Yeah, yeah. Perfect. SST is good. If you're listening to this podcast and you make

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.640
 stuff on computers, like software, you should use SST. It's amazing. I'm going to be saying that a

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:39.080
 lot these days because I'm loving it. We're getting ready to ship a very big rewrite and

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:48.840
 have been loving SST. I'm going to refrain from a lot of questions about esoteric things within

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:53.320
 AstroSight construct and et cetera. And I will take them to Discord like a good friend should.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:59.720
 Oh man, speaking of it, we have a nice little thing going. So you're using SST and Astro,

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:07.320
 which is great for SST and for Astro. Astro is using SST and Astro as well. Nice.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:11.080
 So they're building a new product that they're going to release. I don't know, probably soon,

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:15.800
 but they are using SST internally. So it's a nice little community we are going.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.360
 That's really great to know that they're going to have eyes on stuff in SST.

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.440
 So there was something I just ran into where it's a new 2.9 Astro feature that doesn't

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:29.400
 seem to work in SST yet. They're going to have eyes on that. I don't have to think about being

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:34.040
 the Canary and being like, this doesn't... Yeah. Is it the pre-rendering thing?

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.160
 No, it's the redirects. They've got configured redirects now.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.920
 Are the redirects? Yeah. I was thinking about extracting those and compiling them into a

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:46.920
 CloudFront function. I saw that in Discord. You were going to do that? Yeah. Somebody's going to do

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:52.840
 that because I would love to use that feature. Yeah. It's a cool approach. Yeah. I was trying

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:59.640
 to get like a time commitment from you, I guess. You could do that right after the podcast episode

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:05.000
 here or... I mean, if you throw me some gift subs on Twitch, maybe. Okay. I could do that.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.040
 I would totally do that for features. I don't actually do that because then I'm going to be...

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.000
 Oh, that's bad. And then I'm forced to work on a feature which I don't know if I want to.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.480
 Okay, fine. Okay. Well, speaking of, I've not been around much because

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:23.960
 aforementioned rewrite and I need to get back to it. But this is fun. I'm glad we still have a

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:30.360
 podcast. This is the one thing I'm doing outside of slaving away writing code all day long.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:35.560
 We just skipped one recording session last Thursday and it's felt like it's been forever since we

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:40.280
 did. Yeah. Same. Yeah. So we got really used to the routine. Uh-huh. Same.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:44.920
 All right. Yeah, I guess someday we'll want to take a vacation.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:49.240
 Think you might want to be like, "I'm gone for a week." Or I might want to be like, "I'm gone for a week."

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.680
 Oh, there we go. Yeah, we didn't know who told that one time. Remember that? That was fun.

00:46:52.680 --> 00:47:00.040
 All right. I'm going to stop the recording. I mean, I'm going to say goodbye. Goodbye, Dax. All right.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.000
 Yeah.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:17.500
 (gentle music)
