WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
 So pivoting completely differently, different direction.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.600
 Well, actually before you pivot, I'm going to pee.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.600
 You can pee and pivot.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.600
 Yeah, pee and pivot.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.040
 Oh, the other thing that happened this week was, um, bram, bram died.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.160
 Oh, yeah, creator of them.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.520
 Yeah.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.440
 So I didn't do any Wikipedia deep dives and I didn't.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.520
 I wasn't aware of bram.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.640
 Uh, could you tell me like, was it so V already existed?

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.840
 And then he created them.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.760
 What's the story?

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.320
 Who, who was bram?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.720
 I don't, I don't know much about it.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.480
 I just remember his name forever and that he created them.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.560
 And he was like the BDFL for it.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.840
 I'm sorry, what's that?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.440
 Benevolent dictator for life.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.760
 Oh, okay.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.200
 It's, I didn't know there was an actual that you can, you can acquire.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.040
 Oh, it's like an official thing that people say.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.720
 No, it's not an official thing.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.360
 I think there's a bunch of projects that run this way.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.680
 Like Linux has Linus, who's a BDFL.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.480
 Uh, it's a few projects that run this way.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.440
 And it's like a great example of technically the best short term form

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.920
 of leadership is a dictator that's very competent.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.440
 It doesn't work long term because a person that succeeds them is usually their

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.840
 idiot kid, but I love it.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.880
 In this case, I don't think that's how it's going to, it's going to pass.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.320
 But it's going to get very effective.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.240
 A bunch of projects that have lasted like decades have have operated this way.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.440
 I mean, like Linux is such a crazy impactful thing and it runs this way.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.520
 So interesting.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.680
 I mean, I like thought about flow, but I was like, you know what?

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.080
 This was like maybe one of this is like kind of a unique moment for me

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.880
 because I'm probably for a lot of people our age because this is someone that.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.280
 You know, has it had like a crazy impact on my literal everyday life for a very

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.880
 long time?

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.040
 It's like he made the thing that helps me make money that helps me get all

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.400
 the things that I want in my life.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.120
 Uh, and so yeah, it's like, oh, this person died.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.360
 I don't really know anything about them, but like deeply impactful to me, even

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.120
 though I've like really never thought about them or like no much about them

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.800
 or converse with them or anything.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.840
 So I feel a little guilty sharing similar sentiments given that I've been using

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.200
 them for like seven months, but it's been in a very impactful seven months for me.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.080
 Can I say that?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.880
 I mean, I did spend 15 years as a software developer, not using them.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.760
 You tapped into like a whole community and like, you know, you met people.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.120
 I did.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.040
 I've met people.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.840
 Yeah.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.760
 So many close relationships, it's such an interesting community.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.440
 Like when you think about just like editing text files more efficiently, such

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.600
 an interesting thing to have such a like passion around, but it is one of the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.040
 things I'm more into now in terms of my craft than anything.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.240
 Like I'm more excited about learning new VIM things.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.000
 It just gave me something at this stage of my career that I was just kind of bored.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.120
 I mean, with like the normal everyday software development stuff.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.600
 So yeah, no, it has been really a really great year or whatever it's been of, of

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.200
 learning them, getting to know all these people that are super into it, diving

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.280
 into the neo VIM world.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.280
 Uh, yeah, no, it really has.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.880
 I, I kind of like, I just feel bad.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.880
 Like you've been using it for 10 years and I'm like, you can say these very nice

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.120
 kind words about brand.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.320
 And I'm like, uh, similar, but shorter.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.760
 Well, okay.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.040
 You, you, you can rephrase it as despite only having used it for seven months.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.160
 He's managed to make an impact in my life.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.440
 That's a great way.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.080
 Thank you.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.720
 That's just, yes, that's what I meant to say.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.400
 Flipped it, flipped it, turned it upside down and now it's good.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.480
 And now it's good.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.320
 Yeah.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.840
 So I think it was a unique experience.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.360
 And I think this is the first time I'm experiencing something like this, where

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.680
 someone didn't know died, but it like weirdly feels personal.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.360
 And imagine as you get older, like this obviously starts to happen more.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.080
 And there's like artists or musicians or whatever that died.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.680
 I think about like Christopher Nolan, who like whose movies I absolutely love.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.840
 And one day there's going to be like the last Christopher Nolan film and he's

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.920
 going to die at some point.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.280
 It's going to like deeply affect me.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.440
 And I'm like, damn, that is really crazy.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.120
 That is crazy.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.240
 I was just thinking the other day.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.400
 I don't know why I was thinking this, but I thought like, I need to look up what

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.760
 celebrities have died in the last year.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.200
 Cause I bet there's a bunch of people that I'd be like, huh.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.760
 Yeah.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.760
 I just don't like consume any media to know like when that stuff happens.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.960
 And I know there's been times where it's like you learn two, three years later that

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.360
 somebody died and like, they're never going to be in another movie.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.280
 Wow.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.800
 Yeah.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.440
 It is crazy to think that I feel like I'm really shallow and surface level here

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.920
 with your deep connections to humanity.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.080
 Well, I mean, I started the movie thing.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.080
 There's not going to be another movie.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.320
 Okay.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.880
 Yeah.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.840
 So you brought up Hollywood.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.160
 Yeah.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.880
 So that's your fault.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.720
 Yeah.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.400
 You should, you should watch, I don't know.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.040
 You don't watch a lot of movies, but you should watch Oppenheimer.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.040
 It was a fun.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.840
 Yeah, I want to.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.760
 I saw it as two weeks ago.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.320
 I have never had this reaction to any movie ever.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.520
 I finished watching the movie and me and Liz were walking out and I like

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.400
 couldn't talk like it like affected me in such like whoa, a deep way that I needed

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.680
 like 10 minutes to like, I don't know.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.160
 I just, it was just such like in a like three hours of emotion.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.040
 And I was like, really?

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.400
 Yeah.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.120
 Like I never very intrigued.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.680
 I think from my point of view, I describe it as like the status movie I've

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.400
 ever seen.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.560
 Oh, and the reason being is it's about something.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.480
 It's about achieving something really great, like working extremely hard

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.280
 against crazy odds with thousands of people and achieving like complete

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.960
 greatness, but it is like there's no glory and it's all sad.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.200
 So it's so weird to see a movie about achievement.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.040
 Like we've seen that before, like any like bio pick about someone great.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.080
 It's like they struggle and then they win and then it's great after.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.240
 But this was like they struggled.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.560
 They did it and then they struggled more with everything.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.600
 Everything they came after.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.680
 So yeah, yeah.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.160
 Like hit me really, really hard.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.560
 Huh.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.720
 Well, I was not expecting said.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.200
 I don't know.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.520
 I didn't know really much about it.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.840
 I just know it's about me neither.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.480
 Robinheimer, like that's what I know.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.880
 Yeah.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.080
 The acting was amazing.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.200
 Like Chris Reynolds is very, very good at telling story.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.400
 He's just so good at like going so deep and like hitting on like the

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.400
 deepest points in a very digestible way.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.720
 Yeah.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.640
 So like his stuff is very mainstream, but I think it straddles like just

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.120
 because it's mainstream doesn't mean it's like less valuable or dumber or dumb

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.720
 down or anything.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.400
 It's like as deep as yeah, a lot of times mainstream means kind of dumb down.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.160
 Yeah, I mean, like Marvel movies, it's like there's no, there's not depth there, right?

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.240
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.280
 I haven't seen the Marvel movies.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.800
 What am I talking about?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.880
 No, no, you're, you know, you're right.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.440
 It's like I think I think sometimes he gets categorized that because like everyone

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.160
 loves his movie.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.640
 So when I say I'm a big fan of his movie, oh, yeah, of course.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.000
 But like I think he's truly unique in that everyone does love his movies and that

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.440
 doesn't take away from, from anything.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.320
 It's almost got that indie quality of like storytelling and all that.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.320
 Yeah, I got you.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.160
 Yeah, exactly.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.720
 I want to take my eight year old to he's never been the movie theater.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.760
 I want to take him to this first.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.600
 Well, not to often hire probably.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.560
 I don't think it's suitable for an eight year old.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.520
 I don't think you can tell me.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.960
 I don't think the theme of it.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.480
 I think it would just be boring to him and I'm like one of my biggest

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.520
 realizations as I got older was when I was little, I would watch things

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.760
 and they wouldn't hit me.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.280
 They wouldn't affect me as emotionally.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.520
 Like I could watch stuff that's like really sad or like whatever.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.440
 Like it just it was kind of go over my head.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.120
 And now I watch the same stuff and I'm like so deeply affected by it.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.480
 So I think for him, it would just be boring.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.160
 And you'll just be like saying next to him like going through a whole journey.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.880
 I mean, I'm already not sure if he'll enjoy sitting for the length of a movie.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.880
 I don't know if you set that long for anything.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.960
 You should just find a short movie because some movies are short.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.240
 I thought about when Mario was out and everybody was talking about Mario.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.680
 Mario was a good short movie.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.880
 I was actually going to suggest that.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.120
 There's the Ninja Turtles.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.320
 This is a new movie that maybe you would like.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.120
 OK, so I don't know if it's short.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.800
 Is he like Ninja Turtles?

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.960
 No, I never heard of them, but I was really in terms of kids.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.760
 So maybe maybe I was a medic.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:29.000
 Oh, yeah, it was something about mutant turtles.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.880
 It just does it for us.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.160
 I don't.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.840
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.240
 It was.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.280
 I think that was our era.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.160
 That's surprising to me.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.280
 They're still doing new ones.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:41.080
 I wonder is it like is it live action like that one movie where there's like the really creepy shredder?

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.880
 Is it a cartoon?

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.120
 Do you remember those movies?

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.200
 The live action.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:45.760
 Oh, I do.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.240
 Yeah.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.240
 They were weird.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.720
 No, no, I mean, I loved it.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.320
 Yeah, but they were in retrospect.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.520
 I don't remember what its planner looked like about it.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.360
 Was he an actual rat in the one we're talking about?

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.200
 Well, I mean, they're all like wearing these costumes with the mouths that move, right?

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, like they're very clearly like prosthetic.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.000
 Yeah, yeah, so I think that's what it was.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.160
 The new one, I think, I think I know what you're talking about.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.800
 The new one, it looks like.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.120
 So there's been a bunch of.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.880
 Spider-man movies of the new animated ones.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.880
 Yeah.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.800
 And they are like some of the best animation I've ever seen.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.760
 They're like so unique and like so much going on in every scene.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.760
 And I think this new Ninja Turtles wanted like looks similar.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.520
 So I'm wondering if like the same people were kind of.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.080
 So it isn't the animated kind of thing.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.880
 Yeah, I think so.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.480
 I didn't know there were new Spider-man movies.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.440
 There's like this so many Spider-man movies.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.560
 There's so many that there's two parallel streams of like different.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.960
 There's like the live action ones going on.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.640
 Yeah, you know, the Marvel, the traditional Marvel set up.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.040
 Then there's like these animated ones going on just completely in parallel.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.680
 And they're like coming out at the same time.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.920
 That's wild.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.800
 That's why we are once Disney gets a whole of something.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.400
 They just they blow it out.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.120
 Is everyone going to get tired of the Marvel and like Lucas franchises?

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.960
 Like if they just ground like ground those into the.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.600
 Drove those into the ground.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.280
 One of them I think they have.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.000
 I think we're past the peak of the Marvel stuff.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.040
 And I actually think Disney kind of recognizes it.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.680
 Like I know they're like not trying.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.840
 I can tell that they're still doing stuff.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.440
 But it seems like they're kind of like winding it down.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.880
 But I do wonder what the next thing they need to replace it with.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:31.520
 Because they made so much money, like driving so much money for the last 10 years.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.480
 And now you have to like replace that with something that makes as much or more.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.800
 Yeah, I don't know what it is.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.800
 Star Wars, I feel like they once I took it over, I feel like not much good ever.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.880
 Came from there.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.400
 Like some of it was the best stuff was like fine.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.880
 So I feel like that like never really sparked back up again.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.600
 But yeah, I don't know what they do.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.400
 Yeah, what a weird, what a weird history.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.040
 Star Wars as a franchise has like the original three movies.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:05.160
 Just being these like just huge iconic movies and pop culture and then they made those.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:11.480
 They came out so yeah, no, and then like just the crazy fanaticism that that drove.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.920
 And then you got these the next three with like Jar Jar Banks and all that.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.720
 I don't know.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:21.080
 Maybe the maybe the next three weren't all bad, but that first one that that came out was like bizarre.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.200
 You want to hear something messed up?

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.080
 Yes.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.280
 OK, my personal experience it.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.200
 OK, so what you just said is how everyone feels and most people feel.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:35.400
 Yeah, but my personal experience was seeing the Phantom Menace, which is the first

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.720
 movie I was talking about one of my first memories of being in America.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.440
 And like I was like, America's for awesome.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.680
 This wasn't even this was like years after like my family first came here.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.040
 But I remember my parents taking me to the movie theater.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.440
 I had no idea what movie I was going to watch.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.560
 And the first scene quite on gin like lights up is lightsaber and cuts.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.200
 Oh, man.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.760
 Yeah, I'm like, I'm OK, this is like the best thing I've ever seen in my whole life.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.400
 And I'm so glad I'm just say I think it's actually good.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.760
 I do Darth Maul like I'm remembering all of the like marketing leading up to that.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.160
 It was on every like Taco Bell cup like it was a huge, huge deal.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.080
 And and I don't think I was disappointed is it.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.160
 I was a kid.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.440
 I remember hearing in retrospect there was like Jar Jar Banks was so stupid.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.640
 I don't remember being that distracted by Jar Jar Banks.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.400
 I felt like it was an epic Star Wars movie.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.560
 There were lightsabers.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.960
 The Darth Maul character was super cool and menacing and all of that.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.640
 I don't know. Maybe the twists with the queen being the handmade

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.600
 like that whole thing. Yes, yeah, I thought it was good.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.440
 OK, thank you.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.800
 I felt like it was like you weren't allowed to think that movie was good.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.400
 It was good.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.040
 And then the next two were the next two. OK.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.800
 Well, they had like really terrible acting.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.040
 Like some of the worst acting I've seen in my life comes from the

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.280
 second one. Oh, right.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.760
 That one guy, the mane, the Anakin guy with.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.080
 Yeah, he was bad. Yeah.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.000
 Of the meme.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.080
 I forget that we all see that meme like every day.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.840
 Yeah, exactly.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.880
 Yeah, I think that here's my theory.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.520
 So OK, so hands to roll back a little.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.520
 Yeah, wrap up your.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:11.680
 I think that it demonstrates how much like nostalgia is a part of this stuff

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.200
 because we saw it as children.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.040
 So like we liked it because we were kids and we continued to like it.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.600
 Yeah, because of those memories.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:23.160
 I get why someone that saw Star Wars in the 80s and then like watch this 30

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.480
 years later, whatever it was, 25 years later, was like, that sucks.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.640
 Like I totally get that because I feel that way about certain things

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.560
 up coming out now.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.520
 Yeah, that makes sense.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.240
 It's just crazy.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.800
 There's no objectivity to any of this.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.960
 Like all these things affect you.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.960
 But then going back to the acting, I'm convinced that hitting Christian

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.800
 and the guy that played Anakin, I think he got screwed.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.160
 Here's why not only is his acting bad in that movie, everyone's acting

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.520
 is bad in that movie.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.200
 Natalie Portman, who plays opposite to him.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.280
 Yeah, terrible, terrible acting, like just really bad, but she was already

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.080
 kind of famous and had a crew and was able to have a career after.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.960
 And she's been a great actress in other movies to convince something

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.120
 about the director something about the directing there.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.760
 Yeah, George Lucas is this, didn't he?

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.080
 So I think he was into this like and he's even described these

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.400
 movies as like a soap opera.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.840
 I think he's into like the soap opera drama of it.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.760
 And he was trying to get everyone to like do that.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.480
 But it wasn't natural.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.480
 So I think he got screwed and everyone was like, that's the first time we saw you act.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.400
 We think you suck and now your whole career.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.360
 That sucks for that guy.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.760
 Yeah, because did he really do anything after that?

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.800
 I don't know.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.920
 And he doesn't look too great these days.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.960
 So I don't know.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.760
 So maybe it's just that George Lucas was in like 30 years later.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.960
 From the first start, the first hours came.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.320
 There were the 70s, right?

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.840
 Like 70 years or something.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.040
 It was something like 30, almost 30 years later.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.360
 Maybe he just wasn't very good at it 30 years later.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.560
 Think like 30 years from now.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.440
 You think he'll be like a great programmer?

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.360
 I don't know.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.880
 Maybe 77.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.640
 Yeah, I mean, I guess like the techniques changed and like, yeah, I don't know.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.640
 Maybe the first movies weren't even that good.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.120
 Like maybe they weren't.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.880
 Yeah, maybe they weren't.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.400
 It's just like at the time.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.040
 It was like it was like people latched on.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:09.640
 It was unique.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.000
 Yeah, this story was very unique.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.160
 Interesting.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.360
 Yeah, maybe he got too much credit.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.040
 I don't know.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.440
 I don't know.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.280
 I'm glad he became rich, though, because it's sponsored an ecosystem.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.760
 Like all the video games, toys, and it was a big part of my childhood.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.760
 Oh, yeah, so much that IP is everywhere.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.080
 Yeah.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.400
 Yeah, I'm sure the news, the stuff that Disney does, they're just good at stuff.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.720
 I'm sure it's good.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.640
 It can't be bad.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.000
 But if you're like a Star Wars fan, maybe it's not what you're looking for.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.560
 I think there's a floor like Disney will guarantee that it never gets worse.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.160
 Exactly.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.640
 Yeah.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.440
 Like, I don't know.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.680
 I haven't, I'm like into that world and like not much of it has, has drawn me back.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.040
 Yeah.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.160
 No, I watch a lot of TV.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.240
 Is it on Netflix?

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.280
 No, they have their own thing.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.520
 Disney plus.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:49.840
 Yeah.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.520
 Disney plus.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:50.880
 Yeah.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.280
 Disney's an interesting, like an interesting business case study.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.640
 I mean, like the ESPN situation has its whole onion in its own with the layers and

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.600
 layers of how they get out of their situation.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.000
 Yeah, sports rights and all that stuff.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.560
 Yeah.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:11.560
 And apples in that space too, because they have, uh, they have the, um, the soccer

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.880
 rights, which I don't know.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.000
 So I didn't know it was joking, but I can believe this to be real.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.040
 Uh, Messi joining my team in Miami here.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.400
 Yeah.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.040
 It's impacting apples.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.560
 He was like, it's impacting apples earnings reports.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.200
 Wow.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.400
 Cause like soccer viewership is so up from this one person.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.600
 Have you bumped into Messi yet?

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.480
 I mean, like, no, I'm sure I will.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.400
 Like it's just a matter of the public, yeah, it's just a matter of the right.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.160
 You know what that is.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.920
 Yeah, it's just a matter of time.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.120
 It's just like a matter of time.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.120
 Miami's not that big.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:42.560
 Yeah.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:42.840
 Yeah.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.840
 Only a few million people, uh, people are so happy and like, I think they've

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.160
 lost a game yet since he joined.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.160
 They were the worst, the worst ranked team.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.880
 Is he like, is he passed this prime?

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.040
 Even he's got to be getting older, isn't he?

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.360
 Yeah.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.080
 But he, he just like won a world cup.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.320
 Like he's so really good.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.440
 Oh, he's still really good.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:16:59.720
 Yeah.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.240
 Even past, it's like Jordan past his prime is still the most.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:04.680
 Yeah.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.160
 Sorry.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.760
 And he's, uh, he's playing in like the American League, which isn't, you know,

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.960
 the most competitive thing.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:15.760
 So the American League, like MLS is split into two leagues or you're just saying

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.640
 no, I meant just like it's different than playing in Europe.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.160
 Yeah.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.280
 Like we suck.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.920
 It's like, yeah, I mean football.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.600
 I mean, whatever.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:22.960
 Yeah.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.240
 I wish we didn't.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.560
 I wish we were like, I wish that was the sport.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.360
 So we could put it on the thing.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.240
 Like, you know, like, maybe.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.040
 There's always a similar moments like this.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.880
 Like when F one got the Netflix thing that like 100 X that sport in terms of

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.600
 interest, like that we could be the thing that could be a thing.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.680
 I just, I wish our kids would grow up.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:40.920
 Yeah.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.160
 And use the metric system and like soccer metric is good.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:44.600
 Right.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:52.040
 But I had an old teacher in like middle school, uh, Dan Zorn, uh, he was the best.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.840
 And he would say like, how dumb the American standard measurement system

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.200
 or whatever it's called, the Imperial system, how dumb it is.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:04.040
 Cause like you take a kid in elementary and you're like, how many, uh, cubic inches

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.000
 and a gallon and they'll just stare at you.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.520
 Like I have no idea, but you ask any like five year old in Europe, how many cubic

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.480
 centimeters and a liter.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.800
 And they know it's like a thousand or whatever.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.400
 Cause everything is, it's all related volume, you know, distance, surface area,

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.040
 all that stuff.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.040
 It's like all correlated.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.960
 Yeah.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.520
 We have 10.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.320
 Why do we do all these things?

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:22.720
 At all.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.440
 Yeah.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:23.720
 Okay.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.640
 So when you're 12 inches in a foot, sorry, go ahead.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.800
 Here's the one thing I'm going to bring up though.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.520
 Uh, I agree.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.480
 The metric system is better for most things.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.800
 The reason I say most is because I disagree with one thing.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.680
 Oh, can I guess?

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.240
 Yes.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.680
 Uh, miles.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.440
 No versus kilometer.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.120
 No, no, it's temperature idea.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.080
 Okay.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.360
 Tiptor.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:43.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.080
 Okay.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:44.600
 Fair and high.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:44.920
 It's nice.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:51.360
 First, it seems like, oh, uh, the way they do temperature makes sense.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.160
 It's like zero and a hundred or whatever.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:59.040
 But you allocate so much space to temperatures that humans never experienced.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:18:59.640
 It's true.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.920
 It's like, I do, I do have a problem with that.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.120
 Yeah.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.600
 It's like, you never really reach temperatures above a certain number and

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:11.160
 like half the scale is that it's like scientists made the scale and they were

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.240
 like, this is great.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:12.840
 Exactly.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.440
 We're boiling stuff and liquid, whatever.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.000
 Because like in Fahrenheit, you know, there is a, when it's 65 degrees versus

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.280
 75 degrees, that's like a very big difference.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.680
 And we have like 10 numbers in between, in between to like describe that.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.000
 Whereas, you know, it's not the case for temperature.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.080
 And I feel like when I point this out, I don't, it doesn't seem controversial.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.600
 People are like, no, everything American does is bad.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.680
 I mean, I get it.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.240
 Like you make enough mistakes.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.480
 Like I get it.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:46.400
 We've done that 100% on board with distance weights metric, definitely better.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.640
 But I'm fine with temperature.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.120
 Is it possible to like teach our kids in America, those things?

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.880
 Like, I bet at this age, they're sponges.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.040
 They could just pick all that stuff up.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.280
 But if we don't use it in the house, then they're just not going to really latch onto it.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.480
 I just feel like with the globalization and like internet connectedness, I just

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:09.000
 feel more and more like this stepchild, this like idiot brother, because I don't

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 know anything anyone's talking about like, Oh, you like soccer.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.880
 Oh, it's fun to watch soccer.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.440
 Oh, okay.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.040
 I guess I don't know.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.960
 I wish we fit in a little better.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.280
 It's a yeah, it goes both ways.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.680
 It's also incredible that how much culture we export.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.080
 That we've talked about that.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:24.800
 Yeah, it is.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.800
 It is really like they watch our movies and stuff.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.440
 Do people like movies?

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.080
 And I'm sorry.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.240
 That sounded so awful and dumb.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.840
 Definitely not for this death and death sentence.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.680
 It's funny because some of the best movies that have reached like critical acclaim,

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.120
 like even from the Oscars in the past couple of years have been foreign.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.960
 I'm sorry.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.560
 I'm such an American trope.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.720
 Do they have cameras?

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.640
 Do they have electricity out there?

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.200
 I should feel really bad because people give me that.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.320
 People expect out of the Ozarks.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.000
 Like they have TVs in the Ozarks.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.520
 Yeah.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.000
 Yeah.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.680
 Let's take a quick break for a totally normal reason that aren't being.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.600
 So now we're back and we're back.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.080
 OK, anyway, OK, I want to talk about go because people are talking about go again.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.960
 People are talking about go mutterings.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.960
 So I've said for a long time that go would be such a good language if the language

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.640
 wasn't so bad because there's so many things about it that I love.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.160
 I love how it's just compiles with single binary.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.760
 You can compile it, cross-compile it for Linux, Mac, whatever.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:36.080
 Santa library is like pretty, pretty, pretty good to pretty fast.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.040
 The language itself is like such a pain to write.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.360
 It's like the type system was like really immature and didn't have generics.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.560
 At one point is like very little inference and that's what was kind of stopping me

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.320
 from continuing to use it.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.840
 And I use it for like almost four years, I think, maybe more than four years.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.880
 And it's great to hit it over that time.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.640
 But it's it's been a while since then.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.280
 It's been maybe like five years since then.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.960
 And it's developing more.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.160
 It's like develop more.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:08.040
 And there's this new 1.21 release that people are pretty interested and excited

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.960
 about, introduces some inference for generic functions so that you don't have to

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.000
 like constantly pass in like the generic type, things like that.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Yeah.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.800
 I'm impressed because there was a time where the creators were like, even

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.520
 against adding generics, because it adds so much complexity.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:25.960
 It adds so much.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.720
 They're like very anti anything that even feels like it can make the

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.760
 language more complicated.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.800
 Yeah.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.280
 And so that's one that's kind of when I gave up on it.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.920
 I was like, I feel the culture isn't aligned with with what I what I want.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.600
 But it seems like people kept kind of fighting and they pushed it through.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.480
 And now it's getting towards stuff that is kind of complicated.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.240
 But I think generally makes a makes a language better.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:52.680
 And I've been saying for a while for the ST team that we should like at some

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:58.080
 point, we should really focus on the go market and like try to market directly

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.640
 to them and like make that experience.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.800
 Yeah, really good.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.360
 Because it is a fantastic choice for serverless, like writing your

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.680
 functions and go like cold starts are fast and like performance is fast.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:13.280
 Like everything is to get a really good option between something really high

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.120
 level like JavaScript and something like way too low level, like Rust.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:16.560
 Yeah.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.880
 So I'm kind of excited to like see that and come back.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.400
 Cause I kind of gave up on it at some point.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:20.560
 Yeah.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:25.200
 We just had so I just had this company offsite and one night in the hot tub.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.240
 Honestly, that's where it was.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.800
 It occurred to me that yeah, in the hot tub, we had a conversation, me and a handful

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.840
 of engineers on the team about kind of like all the landscape of languages.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.640
 We had this big conversation and I remember my feeling was like, I wouldn't

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:47.040
 consider go and rust as like two choices I'm choosing between because they feel

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:47.720
 very different.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.200
 And then somebody pointed out that go is garbage collected.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:55.320
 If you're trying to move from some language and you're choosing between

00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:00.240
 like our go and rust to choices that you would make something like that.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.560
 Like are they comparable languages?

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.600
 Basically that was the gist of it.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.720
 Are they comparable languages?

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.240
 And I felt like no.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.400
 And I don't, I couldn't tell anybody why.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.760
 Just like, no, they don't feel the same.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.040
 Yeah, no, I think from a technical point of view, you're correct.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.880
 And that like they're very different.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.760
 I think I see why people compare them because they're compiled.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.600
 They're fast.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.360
 They're compiled.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.760
 But I think Russ tries to get people try to put Russ in places where it doesn't

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.920
 belong and places where go belong.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.360
 So they end up being compared.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.360
 And I think in those situations, like you should always just pick go.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.920
 I think Russ says like, if you really consider like the right, the place

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.600
 where it makes sense, it's like pretty narrow.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.240
 It's like a good language, but it's more like that's what I said.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.080
 It's more like a specialty language in my mind.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.040
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.240
 The embedded systems thing makes sense.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.640
 Like the safety is like a big thing, right?

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.080
 Exactly.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.080
 So like even there, like the one time I worked on embedded systems, I actually

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.560
 moved them from sea to go.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.360
 And that was great.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.560
 And I continue to use it today and a bunch of devices.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.920
 They're like three generations down and they're still running on on go from where.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.440
 So even there, it's like it's not as clear cut as well embedded.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.280
 So I should be using Russ.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.800
 It's again, so it depends on what you're doing.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:13.280
 They got so many things right outside of the language of like how to deploy it,

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.280
 how to like compile it, like it's fast enough, all that stuff they did.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.800
 Garber selection is completely fine for most cases.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.880
 So everything about it was just good.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.720
 But when you go and use a language every day, it's like this doesn't feel fun.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.320
 Like I don't feel good using it.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.600
 Yeah, I remember now it was C++.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.280
 That was the question.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.800
 It's like if you're looking for an alternative, like you're trying to move

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.560
 off to C++, like why would you choose go or rust?

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.960
 I think that was sort of the question.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.520
 Yeah.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.760
 I mean, you and I just just like really depends on what you're doing.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.520
 Are you streaming on Twitch?

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.480
 Then you go with Russ.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:53.680
 If you need to tell people you're smarter than them, you go with rust.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.360
 Russ.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:54.840
 Yeah.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.360
 Yeah, there was a lot of excitement around Russ.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.400
 But like almost nothing got shipped because it just doesn't make sense to use

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.480
 for the majority of things that people try to use it for.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.800
 How much did the like the whole foundation thing?

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.480
 Did that actually affect you think adoption of the language?

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.720
 Like, will people choose Russ less because of that?

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.680
 I think if people are really honest with what happens and this is completely fine.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.400
 It's not a criticism.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.440
 This is like, I think you should be honest about this.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.640
 We get bored and we want to try something new.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.000
 We try something new, but we pretend like it's some logical.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.080
 Step of like, I'm analyzing stuff I need to do and this language is correct.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.640
 And that's why I'm excited about it and has all XYZ things.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.520
 Yeah, but you're just bored and you want to want to change things.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.360
 And that's totally OK.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.640
 Like a lot of reasons I've shifted to my language is in my career professionally.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.760
 I've been just because I got bored.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.040
 I got to serve less because I was bored.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:51.400
 And I think there was a phase where people got bored with rust and they kind of got

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.320
 bored with rust and the Russ Foundation thing was happening at the same time.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.960
 So I think that just kind of like fuel fire.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.000
 Yeah, that people move on to something else.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.600
 And you learn every time you're bored and you go try something new.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.720
 So it's totally OK.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.400
 So what what is the best not even like has to be supported in SST or has to have

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.440
 really good support and SST.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.920
 But like if you're building this sort of serverless event driven lots

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.080
 of lame to functions that are your back end, what is the best language in your mind?

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.600
 Like if you're going to choose one that's like S tier and all the rest fall below it.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:29.240
 Unfortunately, it still is typescript because it just depends.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.960
 Like it's it's really between go and typescript.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.520
 And I go between these two go is technically better.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.040
 If you just look at performance and like what actually happens at runtime,

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.800
 yeah, you should probably pick it.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.320
 But from a tooling point of view, everything around it is going to be in typescript.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.960
 You're front end your infrastructure.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.240
 Everything else is going to be in typescript.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.880
 So it's just hard to beat that synergy, but I can definitely see myself at some

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.200
 point writing all of my back end and go again.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:55.560
 Yeah.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.080
 If the language gets better to the point where I'm like, at least enjoying it a little,

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.480
 that'll push me over to to writing it more.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.160
 Some time in the future that SST CLI will be written and go, which is kind of inevitable.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.280
 That's just going to happen.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.440
 If I'm writing more stuff and go, I'm probably just going to want to write my

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.520
 back end and go as well.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.000
 It isn't like the big strong suit of go is the concurrency model.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.720
 And wouldn't that like not be a big advantage in the serverless?

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.160
 Yeah.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:21.520
 Yeah.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.080
 I, OK, so people really are like, go has great concurrency.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.120
 I don't think that's accurate.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.840
 I think it's that go has a concurrency model and other languages don't.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.320
 So by comparison, it has it.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.160
 I don't think it has a great concurrency model.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.720
 I think languages like Elixir have like a fantastic concurrency model.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.000
 Go just has one.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.880
 And it's good that it has one of those languages don't.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.680
 And you can do things that you can't do.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.600
 Otherwise, you're right.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.240
 It doesn't show up as much, but my challenge from the other day, where I was

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.240
 like, I'm in a single Lambda function, but I still need to like make.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:02.040
 And number of requests out implementing that and go would have been more

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:02.720
 performance.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:07.280
 It actually doesn't look much better and go than it does in in JavaScript,

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.480
 just because I'm saying the model isn't really like not good.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.200
 It just exists.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.760
 Yeah, with the benefit that it does like CPU concurrency as well, which

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.960
 that would not do.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.720
 So, but yeah, people like you for that reason.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.400
 When I first got on to go, it was because I was building a web crawler

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.800
 and I was doing it in C sharp and I couldn't get it to like be concurrent enough.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.880
 Yeah, I switched to go, which had like a more explicit concurrency model.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.760
 So I did go for that reason, but I don't like view it as like, oh, this is

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.760
 like a really great thing about the language.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.560
 Yeah.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.080
 You said C sharp, but why does nobody talk about C sharp when like 90%

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.600
 of people writing code or writing C sharp?

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.200
 I feel like it's never talked about.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:46.760
 I don't know.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.160
 Yeah, it's weird.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.920
 I wrote C sharp a long time.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.000
 I know you did as well.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.160
 A lot of people that are like our age, like it started out.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.240
 We we we cut our teeth on C sharp.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.840
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.720
 I mean, I get why I wouldn't choose it in like a serverless context,

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.200
 like modern reasons, just the runtime and all that stuff.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:09.080
 But it's still in use and like a lot of people are shipping C sharp every day.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:14.280
 And I feel like it's talked about zero on Twitter and the other places that I am.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.160
 Yeah, like it's funny because most languages will have some like

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.320
 delegates from the language that like show up in our bubble, right?

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.080
 Like, yeah, even stuff that's like just heavily used by enterprise people.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.920
 Like some of those people leave and start companies and a more on like this

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:35.000
 sort of be online world, like Java, like I hear I see people using it.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.160
 But yeah, like you never hear from C sharp people.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.080
 I don't know why don't know why.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.320
 Just like, I guess if you're in that Microsoft bubble, if you're out there,

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.680
 let us know.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.400
 I know some of you, but the people who I don't know, let us know.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.880
 I don't know how, maybe on Twitter, start talking about C sharp.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.640
 Let's make it a thing.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.800
 Let's just start making C sharp, the big topic.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.680
 Can we do that?

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.240
 Can we push?

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.520
 I think the secret is everyone is actually writing C sharp and they don't realize it.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.480
 Oh, what do you mean?

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.280
 Because they're already in TypeScript, which is basically the same thing.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.560
 Yeah, made by the same old Anders.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:11.640
 If Anders, you know, if Anders dies whenever that is, maybe 20 years from now,

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.520
 I'm not trying to wish any, you know, timeline on Anders.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.120
 But when he does, I'll feel that one.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.280
 That was my whole the start of my career and now with TypeScript.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.960
 Yeah, no, that's been my whole career.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.480
 I've been in some way impacted by his work.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.160
 It is crazy.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:24.960
 Like the whole.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:30.640
 The sharp TypeScript thing, like, I mean, I've said this before, but I literally never most

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.480
 languages, I sit down and like go to learn the language.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.160
 I didn't do that with TypeScript.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.080
 I just like started a right C sharp and I was like, all this.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.680
 Yeah, I have to go learn anything.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.920
 Yeah, it was like repurposed it and made it like crazy mass market appeal.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.960
 Yeah, coming from Microsoft to what a crazy turnaround.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.400
 Microsoft, we've, I think we've talked about that, right?

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:56.760
 They just owned so much of the developer touch points, like they have.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.400
 Yeah, it's, yeah, like it's, it's so funny to me because so many developers

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:06.760
 would be like stupid Microsoft, like just like that's the invoke thing to hate.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:12.200
 But like they use VS code, they use GitHub, they use, I mean, granted, you know, Microsoft

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.320
 bought some of these things like GitHub, but.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.400
 But yeah, at this point, but still it's a Microsoft product.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:17.920
 Yeah.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.120
 Why we, oh, I don't want to go down that path again.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.120
 Never mind.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.080
 Sorry to go back down on the why is GitHub down all the time.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.840
 And I was like, we've heard.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.280
 Well, I was going to say GitHub, you have reminded me, do you see our new GitHub handle?

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.440
 Oh, you got the SST.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.280
 I did see that.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:31.840
 Yeah.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.160
 And that just redirects, right?

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.480
 Like nobody has to change anything.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.560
 Like it just will redirect if you've got like your, your local.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:41.440
 You got your old stuff at all, because we also, we also retain the old one and we got

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.840
 them to cyber redirect as you, as everyone knows, SST is just three people.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:51.240
 And I feel like every person has like a trait that is like a superpower and then

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.480
 like comes together really nicely.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.160
 Yeah.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.280
 Frank's superpower is, and he'll say this himself.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.400
 He says this himself all the time.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.840
 He's like, I'm not smart.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.680
 I just work really hard, which sounds okay.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:06.840
 You've heard that before, but you do not understand what it means how hard he is

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.480
 like the most persistent person ever.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:14.000
 Like he'll like take something to a place and you will have, you would have given up

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.640
 like a hundred times before like you didn't even get this.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.720
 He has been working.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.920
 So first, the NPM package, we got the SSTM package.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.200
 Yeah.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:23.840
 I remember that.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.120
 Yep.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.680
 I remember like kind of trying and I saw him trying and I was like, okay, this is

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.440
 never going to happen.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:35.360
 He like just kept going at it for months and months and months and finally contacted

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.760
 us, the random guy that had it like found like he like contacted his past coworkers.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:45.400
 Like just did all of this like crazy like stuff and just never gave up, even though

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.360
 it didn't move an inch for like a very long time.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.160
 Yeah.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.320
 This GitHub thing, same story, like it's probably been a year.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.800
 I think we've been trying to get it for a year.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.520
 Wow.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.600
 And he just been been trying and trying.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.400
 And you mentioned Chris Munns earlier.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.040
 Yeah.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.760
 And Chris Munns actually was the one that introduced him to the person that helped

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.720
 us like figure this out.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.080
 So shout out right there.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.280
 That's awesome.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.120
 Yeah, it's it is just super persistent.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.880
 So whenever we have a task that's like, this is going to be a slog.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.120
 Yeah, me and Jay are not the type of people.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.720
 It's Frank are going to do that.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.080
 Yeah.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:16.320
 Frank.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.680
 So you guys, you guys are smart.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.880
 I'll work hard together.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:24.360
 Well, you know, I don't know if Frank listens, but if he does, or if you just

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.120
 want to relay the message, my birthday is in just a week or so.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.840
 And I've been trying to get the atom.dev on GitHub.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.200
 I can't get a hold of person.

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.920
 So if he wants to just like spend a year and give me a gift next time, this year,

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.080
 next time, next year, this time, you know, I would appreciate that.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.840
 I mean, thank you, Frank.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.360
 Thank you.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.320
 I don't want to say appreciate it.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.400
 It's like A-D-A-M-D-O-T dev.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.040
 That's what you want.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.960
 Are you kidding me right now?

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.320
 Are you really trying to spell my handle?

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.000
 Cause you don't see it on everything.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 I'm Adam.dev on literally everything.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.680
 I was clarifying it for, I don't know.

00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:57.680
 I don't know why I did that.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.160
 Is it A-D-E-M or is that A-M?

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.320
 No, I know, because in my head, I was like seeing the dot as a dot.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.160
 Like a dot.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.200
 You know, I don't think you can do dot on GitHub, right?

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.200
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.080
 No, I want it spelled out.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:12.960
 Somebody has it.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.200
 And I, for some reason, I thought it was a certain person I found on LinkedIn,

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.480
 but they never applied to me.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.400
 I don't know.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.400
 I didn't put much effort into it and I don't care that much.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.800
 Well, I do care that much because someday I want to be anonymous.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.480
 People are going to know that I'm Adam, but they won't know which Adam.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.880
 They won't know my last.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.680
 It's already too late.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.280
 What do you do? No, it's not. Stop it.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.320
 I'm doing it. Just wait.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.480
 Look behind you.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.520
 It just says Adam. I'm saying they're going to note.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.440
 My name will still be Adam, but they won't remember that you were the same.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.200
 No, no, no, no, no. Stop.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.880
 No, we're going to make this work.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.920
 We're going anonymous.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.040
 You're going to have to like go way harder on this if you want this to happen.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.680
 You need to start with like an anime profile picture and like just OK, maybe I will.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.160
 Yeah, maybe I will.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.040
 Then no one would ever suspect you of all people to do that.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.000
 I mean, they'll still know what my face looks like.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.800
 But then you're not going to be that anonymous.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.600
 I'm not looking.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.200
 Yeah, I'm not looking to be completely anonymous.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:08.080
 Just like it's hard to find out my real name, you know, that kind of anonymous.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.240
 I want people to doubt is Adam even my name.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.240
 But at this point, we can just run your face through facial recognition and it's

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.840
 going to show up killing my dreams.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.600
 I'm just killing all my dreams.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.200
 Your dreams died a while ago.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.960
 And it's well, we'll see about that.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.280
 Well, you want to go complete.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.440
 Like, look, once we make the I'm going to disappear, once we make the jump into the

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.240
 metaverse, then you can look at whatever you want.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:32.000
 And at that point already in the metaverse isn't Twitter and all this stuff.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.480
 Isn't that kind of already the metaverse?

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.640
 OK, now if we were in the metaverse, the fact that it mess up my knee would have no

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.760
 impact on my life because I could just do your thing.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.680
 Like it'll all be virtual reality.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.720
 And like you will be a physical being in that just the next level.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.720
 Yeah, it's the next level where I can look like whatever I want.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.920
 Yeah, how's your has your knee, by the way, it feels basically normal.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.560
 So I'm not basically I'm going to try.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.800
 I'm going to resist temptation to like treat like it's one more place.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.040
 Another week, just in case just rest up.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.040
 Yeah, but it feels fine.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.840
 It's a little stiff, but fine, continue going very hard in jujitsu.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:07.160
 I have I see hot on my left elbow because it hurts a little more after every session.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.440
 I should probably take a break.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.080
 I just can't.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.600
 I'm obsessed, Dax.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.120
 It's my favorite thing in the world.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.080
 Chris is asking if I post the video of my knee.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.520
 No, I did find the video on my phone.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.280
 I will I will post it later.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:18.800
 It's funny.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.480
 It's just me walking.

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:24.560
 I watched it again yesterday and I just walk up and I'm go and I go, I felt something pop.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.480
 It's riveting.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.600
 Can't wait to see this.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.280
 All right, we should probably get some work done.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.360
 This has been a long one today.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.760
 Yeah, I mean, not this episode, but the two episodes we just recorded.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.120
 Is that is that?

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.000
 Should I not say that?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.360
 Is that like too many peaks behind the curtain?

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.800
 People are listening still.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.760
 I love the end of episodes because I feel like at this point, we can say whatever we want.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.600
 It doesn't matter.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.280
 There's like 10 people still listening.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.800
 And they really like us apparently.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 There's something offensive.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.200
 I'm not going to do that.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.840
 I know there's all this stuff that you bottle up and you don't say.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.680
 So you should just say it.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:59.960
 Oh, I have a lot of things bottled up that I will not ever say, but I'm not ever going to say them.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.440
 That's the nature of bottling up.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:07.360
 I don't know if you understand how bottles work, but you put a little bit of stuff stays in there.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:13.400
 OK, all right.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.040
 It's been fun.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.760
 Thanks, thanks.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.800
 Yeah, see you.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:29.000
