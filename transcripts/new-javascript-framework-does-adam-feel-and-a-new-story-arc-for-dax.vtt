WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 I feel like a truck driver, like putting in an extra long haul today, like the union's

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.320
 going to call about our hours, like we got to take a break at some point.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.360
 You get paid for overtime.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.360
 Yeah.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.440
 So this has been a week since they heard the last one and they have no context anymore.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.160
 They're like, what are they even talking about?

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.160
 Just as a reminder.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.080
 I was thinking we just start completely fresh with a new topic.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.080
 Oh, okay.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.080
 Yeah.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.080
 That's a good idea.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.080
 Yeah.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.080
 Let's do that.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:51.800
 I don't think I'm coming back to Twitter.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.600
 And it's not like I'm going to mass it on.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.600
 I'm not those people.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.560
 I just literally haven't cared about Twitter for months now.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.200
 And I don't think it's going to come back.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.240
 I don't think I'm going to like regain that feeling.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.400
 I mean, I used to be like addicted to like checking Twitter multiple times a day.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.040
 And now I go days without looking at it.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.640
 And I don't even think about it.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.840
 Like it does it.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.200
 When I do open Twitter, I school for like 30 seconds and I'm like, I, there's nothing

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.600
 here I care to see.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.480
 And that's no offense to you or anybody else on Twitter.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.880
 But it's just the same stuff that like, I'm not even drawn to like technical discussion

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.960
 anymore or like dev stuff.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.320
 There's just nothing that could be said on Twitter that I'd be like excited to open

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.320
 the app for.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 Yeah.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.360
 I've also am like shifting my relationship with it too.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.520
 And I've talked about it a while ago, but I wish Twitter had a right only mode and like

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.400
 trying to like, because to me, it's still like a very useful thing of trying to exercise

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.080
 like ideas I have and like write them, so I never want to give that part up.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.160
 But I don't really need to be reading.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.160
 Yeah.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.160
 I just don't.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.160
 I just don't want to.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.880
 And in like the hanging out thing, I used to feel like, well, I'm really just here hanging

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.880
 out with everybody.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.640
 But I feel like I do that elsewhere now, like we've got discord, we got slack or whatever.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.760
 I mean, I don't do that much either.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.840
 But there is kind of like lots of other ways to stay connected with people I want to stay

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.840
 connected to.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.840
 And I just, I don't know.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.760
 I don't know if Twitter is it for me.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.760
 Like the memes, nothing really hits the same.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.760
 Just not the same anymore.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.760
 Magic is gone for you.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.160
 It's not the Twitter change.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.160
 I just changed.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.160
 Yeah.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.240
 I mean, it's funny because I feel like I've had this with a few things now and they've

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.760
 all eventually like had a peak.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.440
 So I kind of knew this isn't like an infinite thing is I always feel the same.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.560
 As I'm reflecting, it's like, it was like two years.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.240
 I was on Twitter actively for like two.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.160
 That's like really not very long.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.000
 Like I've had a Twitter account.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 I don't know.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.440
 But like it feels like, wow, I can't believe I'm not really going to be active on Twitter.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.920
 But like it's kind of a blip on the timeline when you think about it.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.920
 That's true.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.920
 It just feels like it was longer.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.920
 I don't know.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.920
 It feels like I was.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.920
 Yeah.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.920
 I mean, I've had an account forever.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.920
 You can't remember anything before.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.920
 Yeah.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.920
 You're right.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.920
 That's everything in life.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.920
 I mean, high school.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.400
 Remember how long it felt like you were in high school?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.680
 And when you think about four years now, like how miniscule that is in your whole life.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.680
 That's true.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.680
 Yeah.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.680
 It's kind of wild.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.000
 I was kind of the thought of my head that it took us 12 years to learn basic math.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.280
 I saw that before, but just like so mind-blowing to me, I'm like 12 years like that's as long

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.800
 as I've been professionally programming.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.840
 I've learned all of everything I know in that time.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.040
 It is kind of crazy.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.000
 I mean, the whole school thing, like just how much time now that I have a child in a

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.740
 school system, not at home, homeschooling, like how much time is spent educating our

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.080
 kids?

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.560
 And then like, ultimately, yeah, when you boil it down, you said math, like, is that the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.560
 main thing?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.180
 Is it basically like just so they can understand some math?

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.080
 Is there anything else we really hope kids learn or read and write for sure?

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.560
 Read and write.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.840
 I mean, yeah, not physically, right?

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.280
 Well, that's what I was going to say.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.640
 My son reads books like a machine.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.520
 He's read all the first because we like limited to the first three Harry Potter's, I think

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.400
 age wise, because we read some guides that were like, don't read the fourth one until

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.040
 they're whatever years old.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.800
 He's read them all at least three times.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.120
 The third one's as scariest.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.480
 The prisoner has come in, is that a black, serious black?

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.480
 Okay.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.480
 Actually, no, hang on.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.640
 As a kid, I liked the third one the best because Voldemort was not involved and I was super

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.640
 afraid of Voldemort as a child.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.840
 But the third one has like, I don't know, I guess it was a serious black one because

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.920
 he ends up being like a good guy and I feel like that makes it less scary.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.920
 I don't spoil the whole alert.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.920
 Oh, sorry, yeah.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.920
 Anyone who doesn't know that.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.920
 For all the nine year olds, listen to us.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.920
 The dementors kiss and stuff is like really twisted, it's like worse than killing someone,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.920
 you know.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.920
 That's interesting.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.920
 Maybe not to a kid.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.920
 Maybe not.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.920
 I don't know.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.920
 He's read them all like at least three times.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.920
 The second one scared me the most.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920
 The second one really scared me.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.920
 I don't.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.920
 Okay.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.920
 I've never read the books.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.920
 I've got to come out.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.920
 I've only watched the movies.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.920
 When you said dementors kiss, I don't even know that.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.440
 The second one is the chamber of secrets where all the kids are, everyone in the school is

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.520
 like getting frozen or petrified or whatever.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520
 Right.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.520
 I mean, from the movies.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.520
 Yeah.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.520
 Right.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.560
 It's like really like it's like extremely like like racial, basically, you know, that killing

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.080
 all the non pure blood people.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.080
 Oh, the muggles.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.080
 Yeah.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.080
 Can I say that?

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.080
 Is that okay to say that?

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.080
 Okay.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.080
 Yeah.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.080
 Yeah.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.080
 I get it.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080
 You read Dax.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.080
 You're very well read.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.080
 It's very impressive.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:41.280
 Like the millions and millions of other people my age, JK Rowling, she knew what she was doing.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.400
 The writing thing though.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.240
 So my son, big reader, reads a lot, cannot stand writing.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.240
 He hates it.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.000
 Like he hates physically writing things out.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.280
 And he's kind of like perfectionist about it.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.440
 And that like in school, he has to like get a little extra help with writing.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.120
 And it's like, for what?

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.640
 What are we doing here?

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.440
 That is not a skill you're going to need in life.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.440
 If you can spell and type, why learn to write?

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.320
 I don't write with my hands ever.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.320
 Yeah.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.320
 I don't either.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.320
 Do you agree with this?

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.560
 I, but a lot of people still do.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.280
 My like Liz writes all the time.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.280
 Okay.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.240
 So there's like some people get joy from physically writing and just like some people are like

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.840
 note takers that like process things that way.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.640
 So you maintain important to learn in school?

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.640
 I don't.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.640
 I don't know.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.840
 I think with some of the classic thing of like, it doesn't seem to make sense, but just throwing

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.160
 everything out, you might like, just miss some value of something.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.160
 So I don't.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.760
 It's a well-roundedness.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.680
 I don't think we need to go and do cursive, like me growing up, like we spend a lot of

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680
 time, like learning.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.680
 We got rid of that.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.680
 Didn't we?

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.680
 Yeah.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.080
 But like, you know, being able to write somewhat with your hands probably useful.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.920
 There's a there's a good amount of time you have to learn some stuff every day at school.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.000
 Everything maybe makes the top, whatever, five, top five, so it's like might as well do it.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.120
 It's not that we're trying to kill time.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.880
 I actually have a new found respect.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.640
 I got to go back to an old episode where I was like, public school's dumb.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.960
 Anybody putting their kid in public school is terrible and blah, blah, blah.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.200
 I said a bunch of harsh things and I shouldn't have said those things.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.360
 Now that I have a kid in school, I have a new found perspective.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.600
 He loves going to school.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.080
 He loves the structure.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.280
 Like the our family loves the schedule like as much as we thought it'd be hard to have

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.840
 like a 30 minute commute to school and like two trips a day to Springfield, like it was

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.360
 just felt like this could be a lot.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.360
 Everybody loves it.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.600
 It's like this whole part of the day and it's like it brings this structure, this schedule

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.600
 to our day that we didn't have.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.240
 So he says school is a nine and 999 thousandths out of 10.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.200
 Like he's been team school ever since we put him in school.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.200
 Yeah.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.520
 You found respect for like, it's okay that he spends a lot of hours out of the home.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.320
 And that he's thriving in that environment.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.440
 But then I think like they don't really need that much time to learn what's probably important

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.600
 that they learn.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.200
 I still feel like there's a lot of fluff in a school schedule and that's okay.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.440
 But like when we pull it down, you know, at the end of his schooling, what do we really

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.440
 care about?

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.200
 I don't care if he memorizes, you know, all the world's wars and like the battles and

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.200
 like this.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.200
 There's stuff that we learned growing up that's like why I just I can Google anything I need

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.200
 to know on that front.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.280
 Like if it's facts and trivia, like I just don't need my kids learning that stuff.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.280
 So what is important?

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.320
 We've had this conversation a lot me in my life like what is important?

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.040
 We care about him learning math.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.040
 That seems important.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.040
 Yeah.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.040
 I don't know.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.400
 It's a it's only a few things.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:52.060
 We want him to be curious, we want him to like maybe this is like the modern stereotypical

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.960
 parent answer.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.400
 We want him to like pursue his own interests and have that kind of like agency in life.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.640
 That's what we hope he gets out of schooling.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.920
 And I think this school is pretty good.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.560
 I think like he's going to get some of that.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.560
 I don't know.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.560
 Do you have thoughts on that?

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.560
 Is there a vacuum cleaner?

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560
 What's going on in your house right now?

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:20.640
 I just wondered we have like an extra bed of his in here and it's crazy how much echo

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:26.240
 reduction it was providing because our cat peed on it and so we threw it out.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.240
 Ooh.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.240
 Yeah.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.240
 Or Angie pooped on it also.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.240
 She was very upset.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.240
 Let's go.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.240
 Okay.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.760
 Some spite right there.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.760
 Yeah.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.540
 So I've talked to Liz about this topic because I'm like, okay, if you like drill down, it's

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.160
 like read, write, and all the way up to like right before you learn calculus.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.000
 I think that's like stuff that's very practical.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Yeah.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.720
 She has other perspective, which is kind of interesting, which is if you step back and

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:59.440
 you think about like you are the United States, you're trying to like establish a culture

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.160
 and like you want your citizens to care about XYZ things.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.100
 I think that's where some of the more like fluffy feeling stuff can fall into like learning

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.520
 history or like reading some of those like I hated a lot of the sign reading that we

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.520
 had.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.040
 I loved reading, but I hated this on reading.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:24.200
 There are certain values and dynamics that it's just good to know that like, okay, all

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.840
 citizens of the US have like at least been exposed to some of these things.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.840
 Yeah.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.480
 I don't know what exactly those things will be, but I think it's easy to not factor like

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.600
 that is a part of school.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.320
 You want to just make sure that people in this country have like been exposed to similar

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.720
 things or understand some of our context.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.720
 Yeah.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.720
 I guess I get that.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.680
 But yeah, I don't know what those things would be, but I would imagine if you're trying

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.000
 to like think about like what makes it great, United States citizen, like you would probably

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.840
 come up with more abstract things to spend time on.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.840
 Yeah.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.840
 Okay.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.360
 So there's a bit of like just preparing you for society to like be a member of this society.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.480
 There's certain contexts and cultural things that you could get out of school that aren't

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.240
 just like, what is the most optimal education?

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.240
 Yeah.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.240
 Yeah.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.240
 Yeah.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.240
 Like it's, I mean, I bring up Avatar a lot, but like there's a lot of stuff in that show

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.240
 that I think is like critical to the tradition.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.240
 Huh?

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.240
 I want to make sure I have the right thing.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.160
 No, no, no, not the TV show.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.160
 Not the movie.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.920
 There's another thing called Avatar.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.480
 Oh, totally different thing.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.480
 Good.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.480
 It's funny.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.480
 When you said Avatar, you talk about a lot.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.480
 You ever talking about it?

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.480
 That doesn't mean you never talked about it.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.480
 I just don't remember.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.480
 So what is Avatar?

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.480
 I thought we talked about that.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.480
 It says you guys name it.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.480
 It's from that show.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.280
 The, or what's it called?

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.280
 Airbender.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.280
 Airbender.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.280
 That's Avatar.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.280
 Yes.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.280
 Avatar the last Airbender.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.280
 Yeah.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.280
 It's a full name.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.280
 Oh, okay.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.280
 I didn't remember that it was Avatar.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.000
 I'm thinking like James Cameron, big blue people.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.920
 That's what when you said Avatar, that's what I thought.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.920
 Okay.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.640
 But in that show, there's like a war going on and you see all these really interesting

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:02.680
 dynamics that can pop up under a situation where the war is going on that teach you about

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.680
 human nature and like the flaws in it, like flawed thinking of complexity behind certain

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.680
 things.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.280
 So I don't necessarily think that the average education of education we had when we learned

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.840
 history that it was like taught in a way where that's what we got out of it.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:23.160
 I think maybe it like boiled down to stupid like facts about the war, but I would imagine

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.280
 the reason you generally would want to learn about stuff like wars is to like understand

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.280
 those things.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.000
 I mean, the thing that I always imagine is, I imagine remember early on in that show there's

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.360
 a situation where there's a town being oppressed by the invading force and the main characters

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.880
 help out one of the oppressed people and it's setting the way they help them out is setting

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.440
 the illegal and the oppressed person turns them in.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:55.560
 Oh, so just understand those dynamics and thinking about like, is that person bad?

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.320
 Because they just like screwed people that help them, but then you realize like under

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:04.400
 these scenarios, like people kind of do these things that, you know, seem bad just because

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.400
 the situation is so crazy.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.400
 Yeah.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.400
 Yeah.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.440
 So kind of understanding things like that, I think is a good education.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.280
 Like I said, I don't necessarily know if schools like do that with history, but I can

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.280
 see how you could.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.280
 Yeah.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.280
 Okay.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.280
 I'll stop dismissing things.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.840
 It's to just like dismiss whole categories of things history, social studies don't need

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.840
 it.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.840
 Get at it.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.840
 Yeah.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.320
 I was just pivot topics.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.400
 I was looking at some of this stuff that happened in the past couple of weeks in tech,

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.560
 at least, and there have been a few things.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.520
 Does a new JavaScript framework are you kidding me?

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.520
 There actually is.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.080
 It's actually built on top of zero.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.080
 I'm sorry.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.080
 Back up.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.080
 It's called one.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.080
 It's called the zero.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.080
 What was zero?

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.080
 And is it void zero related replicas is new thing.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.080
 Oh, replicash.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.080
 Right.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.080
 Okay.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.080
 Yeah.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.080
 Which I've been playing with.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.080
 No.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.080
 No relation to void zero.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.080
 No.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.080
 No relation to void zero.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.080
 Okay.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.080
 V zero or V zero.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.080
 Oh geez.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.080
 That's another one.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.080
 What is that?

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.080
 Is that a Vercel thing?

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.080
 That's the product.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.080
 Yeah.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.080
 I think.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.080
 Yeah.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.080
 Is that like a big bet of theirs?

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.080
 We got to circle back to that.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.080
 Not yet.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.080
 So one is a new JavaScript framework built on top of zero.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.080
 So it's actually good.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.080
 Replicash zero good.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.080
 Yeah.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.080
 This new framework also built by the replicash people or.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.080
 No.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.080
 It's just this is built by Nate.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.480
 So if you know, Tom, a GUI, it's like this CSS library, but the thing with one is he really

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.680
 focused on building a sink.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.080
 Like how far can you push the idea of single code base that works on native and web.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.080
 Okay.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080
 All the way down to start.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.080
 It's hard for me to.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:52.080
 It's hard for me to be excited about these ideas, having spent the last few months.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.080
 Yeah, I know.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.080
 In this world.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.080
 I hate this world.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.080
 So much.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.080
 This is a react native side of it, which I don't think.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.080
 Well, I guess you technically.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.080
 You have a react native wrapped web view.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.080
 Yes.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.080
 But it does look pretty good.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:12.080
 And because it uses zero, you have like, like your data just just.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.200
 Across all your devices, like I can see how for a certain type of product, this is going

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.720
 to give a really good experience.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.720
 Okay.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.840
 So that was like making some ways, but I think the more for me, at least the more interesting

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:28.520
 part of there is the zero part, which yeah, I'm still really excited about playing with

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.560
 it for the past two weeks.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.160
 What's the first thing you're going to like put out there built with it?

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.160
 Oh, radiant.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.160
 Yeah.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.160
 Nice.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.160
 Yeah.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.680
 So we've been working on like switching radiant from replicash to zero.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.680
 Is that our source?

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.880
 I know I've seen the repo, but is it okay?

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.880
 No, it will be soon.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.440
 Once we like make that shift, yeah, and and zero is like officially allowed to be public.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.720
 But it's going to be really cool.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.840
 I think that my long term bet, not bet, but like the long term bet.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.840
 Not mine.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:04.880
 Just like the way I understand the bet is a I can see how zero just becomes like a standard

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.880
 part of architecture.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.600
 It's like you have an application server, you have a database, it's sort of who you had

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.600
 a cache.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.320
 Or maybe the cache gets replaced with zero.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.880
 So people start to think of it on the same level as Redis.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:23.040
 And cloud providers offer like AWS managed zero, like a native version for it.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040
 Okay.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.040
 Yeah.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.040
 Like app sync, but good.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.040
 Sorry.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.040
 Yeah.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.040
 Exactly.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.040
 Like kind of like app sync, but good.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.040
 Yeah.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.240
 So I'm pretty excited.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.240
 And it's looking really good.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.240
 I obviously love that.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:40.520
 I mean, I love the ideas that this brings into like, I love the idea of not having to

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:47.440
 build like individual endpoints for my API and to just have this thing that I can build

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.880
 on top of kind of front end, first local, first, whatever it's called.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.880
 I don't know.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.360
 I love the idea.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.760
 The thing that it's, it's revealing to me.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.840
 It's actually pretty funny.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:10.360
 It makes React nice, like I'm using it with solid and I'm just like, huh, I'll react a

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.360
 little more.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.920
 So I'm understanding historically what has happened.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.680
 React does not have good state management in it.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.680
 What do you tell them?

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.680
 Whenever you compare.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.680
 There's Redux.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.680
 Redux is amazing.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.680
 So I'm just kidding.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.520
 It does everything native and there's like a clusterfuck of, you know, ways to state management.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:34.440
 So whenever you compare, react to solid, you're actually comparing react, compare it to solid

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.160
 plus state management because I'll have some built in, like a really good state management

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.360
 built in.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:47.520
 So the gap was massive, but now you add in zero and zero is like the best state management

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.720
 that's ever existed because it's very queryable, sinks to your server, like sinks to, like

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.080
 totally solved the whole question of state.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:03.360
 So now if you're comparing react plus zero to solid plus zero, the gap starts to feel

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.880
 a lot narrower.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:11.120
 So I'll probably still continue to use solid, but it's like, the front end just becomes

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.320
 so stupid now, like all it's just like, it's really just comes down to styling zero plus

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.240
 any front end framework, all you're spending your time on is a CSS, which sounds like hell,

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.240
 but it just means all this other stuff went away and that's all I know you meant tail

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.240
 in there.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.240
 You said CSS.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.240
 It's okay.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.240
 I thought telling was CSS.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.240
 Yeah, basically.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.360
 It's been interesting that front end becomes really, really stupid.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.800
 It's like a really, really dumb effort now.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.800
 What's something like this?

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:45.640
 So are there actually like things solid doesn't do very well with the local first or the like

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.160
 zero framework approach?

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.200
 Is there something that react has advantages of?

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.240
 I'm struggling to even say a sentence.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.240
 You know what I'm trying to get at?

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.240
 Yeah.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.240
 Yeah.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.240
 I would say technically yes.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.600
 I think the idea of react is it diffs your UI.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:06.160
 The idea with solid is it diffs your data and diffing your UI is inefficient, like all

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.160
 this stuff.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:12.800
 But it does it is simpler in the sense that like you're never going to be diffing too

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:20.720
 much data or like it's kind of to explain, but the react integration with zero was a

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.640
 lot simpler and is a lot more straightforward and it kind of avoids all these problems.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.280
 The solid integration with replicash was zero again, sorry, with zero is going to be a lot

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.840
 more complicated.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:37.160
 It's going to be technically better, but it just doesn't feel as like a natural fit.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.160
 Yeah.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.880
 At the end, they're both going to be a saying like I said, it's all one.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.400
 So it's going to be technically better performance wise.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.000
 But there's a complexity to it that just doesn't exist with react and totally arbitrary.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.840
 I think this like randomly turned out this way.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.400
 But yeah, I mean, either way, I think the point here is I'm finally going to be able

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:58.280
 to look at front end and be like, this is just my brain can be totally off when I'm working

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.720
 on front end, all the like annoying stuff is gone.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.720
 Yeah.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.720
 That sounds really nice.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.020
 You know how hard it is to Google for one JavaScript framework, like, and then I was

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.240
 like, Oh, well, I'll search for zero.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.360
 And then it's like everything's just zero JS like bundle sizes and all this one stack

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.360
 dot dev one stack dot dev.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.360
 Thank you.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.600
 One stack dot dev.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:27.280
 Is there a webpage for zero zero sync zero sync dot dev?

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.280
 Yeah.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.280
 Oh, okay.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.480
 Here's here's a funny, here's a funny question I have for you.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:40.800
 So zero zero dot com is owned by Google, I think zero.com, really?

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800
 Yes.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.600
 And the people working on zero would like that domain name one day.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.600
 Yeah.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.280
 And they were wondering if we could do them a solid.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.560
 They said, no, they want them to play fair market value.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.560
 That's what Google said.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.560
 Yeah.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.000
 What do you think fair market value for zero.com is four letter.com.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.200
 I feel like I feel like that's going to be expensive at least six figures, right?

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.200
 What's your ballpark?

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.200
 Is it?

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.200
 I'm going to say two million.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.040
 So it's not seven figures.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.040
 That's seven figures.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.040
 Yeah.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.040
 I went higher.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.040
 Yeah.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.040
 Okay.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.040
 So that's what I said to.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.040
 I said one to two million.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.040
 Yeah.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.040
 They actually want 500k for it.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.040
 And I'm like, Oh, that's not bad.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.040
 That's not bad for zero.com.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.040
 Like that is.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.040
 That seems like a really good domain.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.040
 Yeah.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.040
 I mean, what's Google here?

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.040
 This is like going back to last episode, you know, all that time ago when we recorded last

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040
 episode.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:34.800
 When we talked about the like, how does JK Rowling care at all if they sell more merch

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.800
 at this point?

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.000
 Like, how does Google, who at Google is like, Oh, we could sell this domain for five hundred

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.840
 thousand dollars, Google trillion dollar, multi trillion dollar maybe.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.840
 I don't know.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.840
 What are they at now?

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.520
 Like, who cares at this point?

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.520
 Why is it?

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.520
 It's like, here's the domain.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.520
 What does it matter?

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.520
 I don't know.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.520
 That's what I thought.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.320
 Because Aaron worked at Google and like, maybe they'll invest in the company at some point.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.560
 It's just getting the domain.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.560
 But yeah.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.560
 Yeah.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.560
 Yeah.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.560
 That's weird.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.560
 It's just hard for you to imagine.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.560
 I work at Google.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.040
 Just big companies.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.040
 Just nerds.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.040
 Show up.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.040
 Just a bunch of dorks.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.040
 Show up.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040
 And they're like counting nerds.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.040
 They're like, we can't just give away property in the house.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.040
 It's just like they have nothing else to focus on besides being like, we technically did

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.120
 this the correct way, you know, yeah, I guess, though.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.120
 That's annoying.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.120
 Yeah.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.080
 I will say the one framework.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.400
 I do love the pool ball as a logo.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.400
 That's creative.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.960
 I don't even notice that.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.960
 Wow.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.960
 That is clever.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.960
 Oh, and it rotates.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.960
 Yeah.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.960
 When you hover over it.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.960
 Yeah.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.960
 I know it.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.040
 I love that it's like a little round mark that they can use as their favicon.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.680
 It's just one of those things that I think about when I make a website is like, what's

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.320
 the favicon going to be?

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:50.440
 They nailed it with the little pool ball and they got the one NPM package like one like

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.440
 the word one.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.160
 Yeah, install one.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.160
 That's impressive.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.160
 Right?

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.360
 NPM packages are a little less impressive because you can just like email and be like,

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.720
 Hey, I want this.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.720
 And if nobody.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.720
 Okay.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.480
 So on Twitter, somebody was like, Oh, I own the zero NPM package.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:16.800
 So I tagged Aaron, like the CEO, the company that makes zero and I was like, Oh, just sell

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.800
 it to him.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.720
 Because like, this would be really cool if they have the zero package.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.900
 And in my head, I'm like, I would maybe give it away for free.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.060
 It's like not a big deal.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.240
 Maybe one or $2,000.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.880
 I think he asked for he wanted after bringing him down.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.880
 He wants 50 K.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:38.840
 Oh, like this is so stupid because no, you're, this is never going to be liquid ever again.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.840
 That's the thing with domain.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.840
 Yeah.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.880
 Like there's like a once in a lifetime moment where someone is willing to pay you for it.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.880
 Uh huh.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.000
 And if you don't make the deal happen, like who else is going to show up later?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.200
 What leverage does he, yeah, hmm.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.200
 That's interesting.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.360
 It's just a freaking NPM package.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.600
 You're not using like, come on.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.600
 Uh huh.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.600
 That's annoying.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.000
 Is it, is it against the like rules to sell an NPM package?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.920
 Uh, I know other, um, other ecosystems are really strict about it because we were trying

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:13.040
 to get the Python SST thing on whatever crap Python thing is and I went and read their

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.040
 stuff.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.040
 Yeah.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.400
 And like they literally don't give you a way to transfer it to someone else.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.240
 You have to like write to them and explain why.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.600
 And there's like a very narrow set of reasons and ours, even ours of someone being like,

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.280
 we're not using this package anymore and this company wants to use a name.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.840
 That's not a valid one.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.840
 Yeah.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.840
 Not a valid one.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.840
 Wow.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.840
 What would be a valid one?

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.240
 Just, it's just like maintain our transfer of the same project.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.560
 You can't like use it for a new project because they're like really obsessed with keeping intact,

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.680
 like the history of the packages and stuff and not, and not breaking things, um, which I

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.080
 get, but I hate name collision stuff.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:55.520
 I just, I hate like, I hate it because it's like the first thing I think of when I think

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.640
 of a new project, which to my credit, haven't thought of a new thing in a long time.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:04.880
 Can we just, can we step back and where's last time I was like, I'm going to build this.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.120
 It's been a while.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.360
 Your spirit is crushed.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.360
 Oh, no.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.360
 Totally broken.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.360
 Is it?

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.920
 I feel like I have kind of like changed in some ways and I'm trying to figure out what

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.920
 it is.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:19.080
 Uh, I'm just like kind of cool with like my job and just like doing one thing.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.600
 Whoa, where did this come from?

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.960
 I just, to me, my, my feeling of it just seemed like you're really busy and I've just been

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.960
 occupying your energy.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:32.760
 Yeah, but like I'm busy with one thing that I've decided to make the one thing I'm busy

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.760
 with.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.400
 It's like, normally I, even when I'm really busy with something, I still have like ideas

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:44.360
 and like the, the drive to build new things, I don't have that right now.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.720
 Maybe that one thing is, is fulfilling you properly.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:54.640
 I mean, yeah, I mean, I'm enjoying just like working on my thing every day.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.160
 And also it's a season of life like with the stuff we've been going through as a family

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.160
 was in school and all that.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.720
 Maybe I just don't have a lot of extra like energy to want to put into something.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.720
 Yeah.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.720
 I don't know.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.960
 I've very rarely in my career just had like one thing I was working on.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.960
 It's always.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.960
 How does it feel?

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.960
 Does it feel good?

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.960
 Yes.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.960
 I always imagine it would feel really good.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.220
 Like it's, but what's weird to me, like it feels good, but it doesn't also like, hasn't

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.640
 really like registered, which is weird to me?

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.600
 Yeah, feels like nothing.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.720
 It's like it, if I didn't notice, but does it really feel good or does it just not feel?

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.760
 Maybe I'm just not feeling right now.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.960
 Did you know you always are feeling something?

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.120
 This is what Casey says.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.120
 I thought like, I'll let you know when I'm feeling something.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.560
 Cause she's like, you don't really share much about your emotions.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.240
 And I'm like, yeah, I don't really have any.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.680
 I'll let you know if I have one.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.680
 She's like, that's not how it works.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.920
 You always have emotions.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.000
 He's just thinking about it or like if I'm just, I'm like thinking about emotion right

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 now.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.280
 In any moment, there's some, you have some emotional state, but maybe your emotion is

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:03.560
 just like contentness or boredom or not worth registering.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.000
 It's not like you always have extreme emotions.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.600
 Do you think this is true?

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.600
 Maybe this isn't a fact.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.600
 Maybe she, maybe she meant it differently.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.600
 I can see that that makes sense like it's not like an on off thing.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.680
 It's like, yeah.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.080
 I thought it was like your default state is like, it's kind of like when they used to

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:24.040
 think in physics that there was the void and then like there's places where there is stuff

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.920
 and there's places where there isn't like the void of space.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.880
 And then they learned like, no, there's no such thing.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.280
 I think I thought it was like the void.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.040
 It's like, the default is you're not feeling anything and then there's little moments

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.800
 of your day where you feel things and that's the thing that was shattered for me.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.800
 Yeah.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.800
 I think I probably agree more with your wife.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.960
 I don't think I ever felt like I don't feel stuff and then I do feel stuff.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.520
 To me, I always just felt like, yeah, it's like always going and sometimes it like spikes

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.920
 or like, you know, it's very encouraging to me because it means at any given time I can

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.560
 work on thinking about what am I feeling right now?

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:03.480
 Like, there is some feeling there to like archeological dig find nice, nice words usage.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:13.480
 Yeah, I don't think I have a lot of like emotional depth or I don't know, variety.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.480
 Maybe you're just stupid.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.480
 Maybe just simple.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.480
 Just a simple.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.560
 Do you ever wonder what it would be like to just be really simple, like really unintelligent?

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.440
 Would life just be so much better?

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.640
 Not that like we're so smart.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.240
 But like, Liz describes me as very simple.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.440
 She describes you as very simple, a very silly boy and very simple.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.200
 Yes, she also describes me that way.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.560
 But like, you're intelligent.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.440
 So simple in the way that like, I don't know, there's probably something profound about

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.440
 yours, you're being simple, but you're not like unintelligent.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.440
 No, yeah.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.440
 I know.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.040
 I guess what you're saying is something different.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.040
 Yeah.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.040
 Yeah.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.840
 Now, I want to know more about what she means by you being simple.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.480
 But do you ever think like it'd be nice to just be really like unaware of all the things

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.480
 I'm aware of?

00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.480
 Actually, no, I don't.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.480
 I actually don't.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.480
 To me, that feels really tragic.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.680
 But you wouldn't know.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.360
 There's a lot of simple people out there.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.360
 They don't know.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.360
 They wouldn't know.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.360
 Yeah.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.360
 So it wouldn't be tragic.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.360
 I do.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.360
 I do know.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.840
 So I see like, you know, I do see this like more of a scale of things.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.840
 Yeah.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:21.480
 And it feels really sad to like, you know, live one life and not understand as much as

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.480
 you can.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.480
 I've got to have a lot less anxiety.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.240
 I feel like a lot of my anxieties are that I know too much, maybe.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.240
 I guess.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.240
 Yeah.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.240
 I don't really have a lot of anxiety.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.800
 So I'm not like paying the price of that, I guess.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.800
 Interesting.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.800
 You're just a simple man.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.800
 What does she mean when she says you're a simple?

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.800
 You're just simple.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.100
 I think it's like I'm like really like even keel like I like just I'm kind of like the

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:48.880
 same every day and I don't really have moods as much or I'm pretty sure for with like things

00:29:48.880 --> 00:30:00.800
 I want in the physical world, like, you know, money, same money, cars, I've got you figured

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800
 out.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.800
 Yeah.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.800
 I'm just easily contented.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:08.160
 I think also easily contented interesting money and cars, apparently.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.160
 Yeah.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.160
 Yeah.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.720
 The dream house and the dream neighborhood with the white Tesla.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.640
 Oh, no, you're a simple man.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.880
 Yeah, one of those really modern cube houses.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.880
 That's basic.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.880
 That's different than simple.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.880
 These are very different words.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.880
 Yeah.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.880
 Yeah.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.880
 But you see how I got them confused a little bit.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.880
 Because you're basic.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.880
 Yeah.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.640
 I am kind of basic.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.640
 It's interesting.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.320
 We're on two ends of a spectrum.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.240
 What else happened this past couple?

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.200
 There was another thing I wanted to bring up, but I forgot.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.840
 I saw I have one thing I want to bring up because I got on Twitter just to have something

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.840
 to talk about.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.560
 I feel like I have nothing to say on this podcast.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:49.520
 If I don't check Twitter real quick, it looks like next year's really going for the look

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:54.040
 how easy is to self host next year's they've got like a whole video series they're doing,

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.040
 I think.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.040
 A 45 minute one.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.040
 Yeah.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.720
 And they're being really nice to us all of a sudden.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.720
 Oh, really?

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.960
 They've just had like a strategy.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.880
 Can you just oh, to be a fly on the wall?

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.640
 You know, they were in a little meeting and they're like, okay, let's try this.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.280
 Let's try being really nice to everybody that's been jerks.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.320
 And also, let's try to do some videos.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.320
 Let's make some content.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.440
 Could you head up making some content on how easy it is to self host next?

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.040
 Maybe we should make it easy to not wonder if they said that in the meeting.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.880
 Like maybe we should actually make it easy to self host and then make video.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.840
 So I actually don't that's actually not what happened.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:32.000
 Some of it, I think is I think the video series is like very, you know, I can see how it connects

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 to each other.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 Yeah.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.840
 But I'm trying to think how much of this I can say because I don't want to get anyone

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.400
 in trouble.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.680
 Someone did finally reach out.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.600
 After all this time interesting, can I, can I guess?

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.600
 I'm not going to guess.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.600
 I know who it was.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.600
 It's not Lee.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.600
 I don't even think it's someone you know.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.600
 Oh, I'm connected.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600
 I know people.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.600
 I have a guess.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.600
 Okay.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.240
 It's the one person I know of herself.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.960
 I'm not going to say, but I doubt it.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.440
 Can you, can you ask me to guess?

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.440
 Yeah.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.440
 Yeah.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.440
 Hang on.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.440
 Let me, let me just mess this.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.440
 Okay.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.440
 Done.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.440
 No, no, no.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.440
 Okay.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.440
 Okay.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.440
 I wonder if anyone could like tell what I typed.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.440
 No, no.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.440
 No relation to us, sir, and anyone.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.440
 Okay.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.440
 Okay.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:21.560
 And they were like, hey, you know, I think he's like, I personally think a lot of the

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.260
 stuff that you guys work on, like makes a lot of sense and like all the stuff is difficult,

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:31.320
 like, we'd love to figure out how we can like remove all the, like a lot of hacks that

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.480
 exist in open next.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.120
 Like, what can we do differently or what can we fix?

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.120
 Yep.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.120
 And I was like, great.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.400
 Made it clear that like our goal is to like reduce the scope of open next to zero.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.960
 So it just doesn't need to exist anymore.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.960
 Yeah.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.680
 Like, even just them talking to us and us, not even versus everything is like a hundred

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.320
 X better than the current state of things.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.320
 Yeah.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.320
 Yeah.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.320
 Yeah.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.320
 Yeah.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.320
 Yeah.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.320
 Yeah.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.320
 Yeah.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.320
 Yeah.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.320
 Yeah.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.320
 Yeah.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.320
 Yeah.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.320
 Yeah.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.320
 Yeah.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.320
 Yeah.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.320
 Yeah.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.320
 Just like clearly there was no actual problem here besides the fact that like you had two options,

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.320
 right?

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.320
 Yeah.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.320
 Thanks for working on this stuff.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.320
 Great.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.320
 Thumbs up.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.320
 And if that's what they did, this would have just been totally fine, which I think what

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.320
 is happening now.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.720
 But I think things are in a head in a pretty good direction now.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.720
 Interesting.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.720
 New story arc.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.720
 Yeah.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:27.040
 About the warm fuzzies between DAX and Versell.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.080
 I started to say SST and Versell, but it's not, it's DAX and Versell because SST never had

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.080
 a problem with Versell.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.000
 So in that video, Lee posted, he does mention SST and open next.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.440
 Oh, nice.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.880
 Like in good terms.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.880
 Yeah.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.880
 And he sent me a message about it.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.880
 It was nice.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.880
 Look at you guys.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.760
 We're going to find something new to talk about.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.520
 If you guys are all just like buddies now, we're not buddies.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:56.320
 Well, I mean, that was too far, but not buddies, you're, you're not good terms, you're really

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.320
 trying to.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.320
 Not on good terms.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.320
 We're neutral.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.320
 Oh, okay.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.320
 You're just trying to roll in the spice neutral.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.320
 Oh, sure.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320
 Okay.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.320
 Always.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.320
 Yeah.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:10.600
 I guess nobody neither side can be too upset about the hostility that has ensued on Twitter

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.240
 because it's good for both sides.

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:17.280
 You guys just like, there's no such thing as bad attention or something.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.280
 No, there is.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.680
 No such thing as bad publicity.

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.680
 No, that's not true.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.920
 No, I think they lost something.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.920
 Oh, okay.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.880
 They lost a war or the battle, but they're, they're, yes.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:30.600
 I think that there was a time when they could literally create any narrative they wanted

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:36.720
 and they would just post it on Twitter and you can see that approach suddenly backfired

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.520
 every single time you try it.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.040
 And I think this is a good correction.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.880
 And now they're now a boring company that just makes a boring product.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:49.080
 And nobody really, it's not this like noise energy suck thing that they, they were for

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.080
 a very long time.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.080
 Yeah.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.040
 So to me, I feel like things are now in a good place.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.040
 Hey, that's good.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.240
 That's what you really hated was the amount of.

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.240
 Yeah.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.240
 It's the only thing I really hated.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.760
 It was sucked out of the room.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.760
 Yeah.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.760
 Nice.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.760
 Okay.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.760
 They required beating them over and over and burning out people.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.280
 So they just stopped posting.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.280
 Yeah.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.880
 But I think it, yeah, it is funny how it's ended up playing out.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.120
 Well, maybe that's why I'm not on Twitter anymore.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.840
 Maybe that was the only thing that was keeping me around is that kind of drama and the fun.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:24.640
 They're still drama that happens, but you know, yeah, it just feel kind of played out.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.640
 Played out.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.240
 You know, I must see you in New York saying, right?

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.240
 Is that this month?

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.240
 No, it's next month.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.240
 I gotta book my airfare.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.240
 I'm sorry.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.240
 No, I will.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.240
 Your flights.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.960
 I'm going to even, even my wife is telling me to book my flight because her mom's going

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.320
 to come into town while I'm gone, but she wants to wait until I book flights.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.840
 So she knows when to come in and I don't even know what dates.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:47.560
 I think Liz told me Liz did such a good job of sending all the details and I have not

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.560
 done my part.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.560
 Everything.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.560
 Literally.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.560
 It decides us.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.560
 Oh, really?

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.560
 I'm not the only one.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.560
 I don't think anyone's booked their flight.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.560
 Oh, nice.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.160
 Next month to be fair, like, I don't know if I've ever booked a flight a month in advance.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.040
 A month in advance is a normal amount of time.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.960
 I think like three weeks is my, like, that's when I generally would be like, okay, if I

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.200
 don't do it now, tickets are going to get expensive.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.200
 Yeah.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:14.000
 Well, the reason we need our own a book is so we can calculate what we have left over.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.600
 So we know how much we can blow on our Airbnb.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.600
 Yeah.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.120
 Where does everybody book flights these days since Google shut down Google flights?

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.840
 Oh, Google flights is not shut down.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.280
 Okay, don't do it really on this podcast.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.280
 Do it.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.280
 Oh, okay.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.280
 I'll do it.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.280
 I just started wondering like.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.280
 What the prices?

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.280
 I remember.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.600
 Yeah, I remember I started to do this and I was like, which airport isn't one of them's

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.360
 not closer to everything we're doing than the others.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.280
 It literally doesn't matter.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.280
 It literally doesn't matter.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.280
 It doesn't matter.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.280
 That's like into New Jersey or New York.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.280
 And both are fine.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.280
 Either airport in New York or Newark in New Jersey is fine.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.280
 Okay.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.280
 Why did they do that?

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.840
 Why did they name a city right next to New York, Newark?

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.040
 Oh, it's even worse than you think.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.920
 It's so much worse than you think.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.920
 Ready?

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.320
 You've heard of New York Penn Station, right?

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.320
 Sure.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.320
 New York Penn Station.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.320
 I think so, maybe.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.320
 Okay.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.160
 It's like a one of the main transitions in New York that go to like New Jersey, Philadelphia,

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.800
 Connecticut, like everywhere, right, New York Penn Station, New York Penn Station got it.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.480
 There is a stop on Newark called Newark Penn Station.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.480
 No.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.480
 Why would they do that?

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.080
 Do you know how often people get out at the wrong station?

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.920
 And they get out right before they get to New York and they're like, just think of the

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.920
 billions in lost productivity from that stupid name choice.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.120
 Every single time, because people used to have to, oh, so we had the other situation.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.800
 When people visited us, they'd have to get out at Newark Penn Station and take the path

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.000
 over because the path drops them off right at my apartment.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 Oh, no.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.920
 So you're telling them to get off at Newark?

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.920
 Get off at Newark.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.920
 Not New York.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.920
 It's going to be confusing.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.920
 Newark.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.920
 Oh, that sucks.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.920
 And it's always a stressful thing.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.920
 Yeah.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.920
 It's so bad.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.920
 It's so dumb.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.920
 Newark.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:57.340
 Also, it's doubly stupid because New York itself is not an original name.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:03.120
 It's York with the word new in front of it, and they're like, what have we just said

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.440
 real fast, Newark?

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.440
 Newark.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.440
 And that's, yeah.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.440
 Oh, I'm worried.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.000
 That reminds me, I want to get involved in local city government.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.120
 Not like I want to run for office or something.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:19.840
 I'm just considering, I'm considering going to a town hall or city hall meeting.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.720
 You got this notice in the mail, OK?

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:29.120
 I own property in a place where there are only nine can own property yet.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.800
 Oh, stop it.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:37.640
 There are large chunks of agricultural land around my neighborhood because it's in the

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.240
 middle of nowhere.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.400
 I like that.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:48.720
 In fact, two of these chunks are my kitchen window view and then the other side of our

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.720
 house.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:54.280
 The view shed, that's what the it's called, preserving the view shed.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.040
 Oh, that's that's the OK.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:02.760
 So this is a trope that like when you're in your upper 30s and you own a home on a lot

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.160
 in a neighborhood, you're like, don't build any more houses.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:10.560
 I like my view because that's how a view shed is a geographic geographical area that's

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.480
 visible from a location in all surrounding points that are in line of sight within that

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.480
 location.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.120
 So we have friends that own 180 acres in Virginia.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:23.160
 And they're very restricted on what they can build because they there's laws around

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.440
 preserving the view shed.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:28.200
 So it's really beautiful from that area.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.440
 So it's a very easy to screw it up.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.440
 Yeah.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.280
 Well, there's two big chunks of like 30 and 40 acre land, their agriculture right now and

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.600
 they're trying to develop on them.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.960
 Well, one of them, they are developing.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.360
 They just started cutting down trees in the view out our kitchen window is completely

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.360
 different.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.360
 It's just like sky now and it was all trees.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.360
 It's so sad.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:51.080
 It's you know, 100 year old oaks, just giant trees, this huge forest and they're just

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.640
 cutting it all down.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.280
 And I'm like, so upset and I'm like, Oh, those trees, they're not going to be there.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.320
 I thought they would be there forever.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.280
 And then it's like, well, I guess I, you know, like live in a neighborhood where they did

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.560
 that just 20 years earlier.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:08.480
 So it's like, I can't be mad that they're going to put more houses in a place where they

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.480
 put houses here.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.480
 You can be mad.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.480
 I can be mad.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.520
 It's because preserving the view shed.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:16.280
 I've just, I've just realized like when you're young, you're like, what the hell are these

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.280
 wrong with all these people?

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:21.440
 These nimbs on my backyard and people that are like stopping progress and then you just

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.440
 witness yourself become.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.440
 Yeah.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.680
 And there's things okay to be a nimby.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.680
 I don't know.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.120
 Like you got to represent your own interests, right?

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.120
 Yeah.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.280
 And we're able to go to this town, this meeting and like vote on whether they can plot this

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.000
 other chunk of land as residential.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.400
 It's this developer that wants to build a whole neighborhood and I want to like use our little

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.840
 private neighborhood road.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.840
 It's not private.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.840
 It's actually a public road.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.520
 But like right now we live in a neighborhood where there's no three traffic, the road that

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.520
 comes in.

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.520
 It's a city street.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.520
 That changes.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.520
 It's going to change.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.080
 The street right now just goes into our neighborhood.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:54.120
 There's no reason anyone else would be on the street, but they want to like plug it in

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.960
 and it'll be like we get traffic from all over the place.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.960
 It's just like stuff.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:58.960
 I don't want to happen.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.700
 So I'm going to maybe go to the meeting and be like, listen, I would like this to not

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.700
 happen.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.700
 No, yeah, you should.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.700
 I don't know what grounds I have to stand on.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.700
 Like just don't do it.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.700
 Please.

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.700
 Cause it'll make me sad.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.700
 Like what, what can I say?

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:13.600
 You should show up there with a, with a bomb vest and be like throw up.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.280
 I thought I was about to get real advice and then you just, you went there.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.040
 Maybe you could come and wear a bomb that'd be a little more realistic.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.040
 I don't know.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.040
 You're, you're brown.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.040
 Oh my God.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.040
 Wow.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.040
 That was so racist.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.720
 I have to not say things like that.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.720
 Okay.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.400
 Chris, I'll let you decide my fate.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.400
 You might cut that out.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.400
 Oh my God.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.400
 Sorry.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.120
 You say you're brown all the time.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.120
 I can say it too.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.120
 Right?

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.120
 No, no, no, it was great.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.120
 Okay.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.120
 I'm happy that you made that joke.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:47.400
 I mean, if it were like 2002, you know, right after 9/11, like, maybe it would have been

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.400
 different.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.400
 Are you making it worse?

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.400
 Is it worse later?

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.400
 Maybe it's worse.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.400
 I don't know.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.400
 No, I, I think just explaining this more is making it worse.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.400
 Okay.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.400
 I should stop.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.400
 I'm going to stop.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.400
 I'm getting a cramp.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.400
 Like a muscle cramp.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.400
 And I wonder if it's like anxiety over getting canceled.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.400
 I can just feel it.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.400
 It's happening.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.400
 It's fine.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.400
 You're not on Twitter.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:13.080
 Like if you don't ignore, if you just ignore it, it's, it's basically not happening.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.720
 You actually, I will get no consequences.

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.960
 I will have no consequences.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.760
 It's the tree in the forest thing.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.600
 Speaking of trees and forest, what do I say?

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.760
 Like if I go to like literally, I want to go to this meeting, I'm an adult.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.240
 I'm trying to learn how to be like an adult, you know what I mean?

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.680
 Like adults who are like, I'm going to the city hall meeting.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.680
 What do you say?

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.480
 What could I actually say that would be like, not just, I think the trees are pretty and

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.680
 I don't want them to go away.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.680
 Okay.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.960
 So this, I have no idea how to play this, but I've been like secondarily involved in some

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:46.480
 of this, not like very, very loosely, when I lived in New York, there was this extremely

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:51.160
 convenient pedestrian footbridge that crossed over the road.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.920
 I could get to it within a minute of my apartment.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.400
 I would cross it and the subways were on the other side.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.920
 So very, very, very convenient.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.920
 Yeah.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.640
 It turns out this was a temporary bridge they put in place.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.560
 It wasn't a permanent one, even though it's been around for years.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:10.420
 The reason it was temporary was it technically didn't adhere to like ADA stuff.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:14.480
 Like ramp, it didn't have an elevator, stuff like that.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:22.600
 So they built this crazy expensive new one that was like a block down, way more inconvenient.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.880
 Way, way, way, way more inconvenient for you, but they committed to doing it for me and

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.880
 they're for everybody.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:32.280
 They like totally changed like the way that you would travel around this neighborhood.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:36.560
 Like the dynamics like totally change, like it's not just it wasn't just a little further

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.560
 away from you.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.160
 You mean like it was more inconvenient for everybody.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.160
 Yeah.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.160
 For everybody.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.160
 I don't know.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.160
 You guys like go through this.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.160
 You have to kind of go through this parking lot.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.760
 It just wasn't like a great situation, but they committed to doing it a while ago.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.120
 They spent a bunch of money on it and they're like, yeah, then we're going to tear down

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:55.080
 the old bridge and we're just like, just leave the old one also.

00:43:55.080 --> 00:44:01.080
 And there's this guy that tried super, super, super hard to make arguments for it.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.840
 And it was funny how far he went.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:09.280
 He literally sat there and counted the people that crossed like for a day on that bridge.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.280
 Yeah.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:15.520
 And he was like, it was like basically 50% of them will go to the new bridge.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.440
 The other 50% are probably trying to go north.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:24.640
 So they'll like go just cross at the intersection on the north side, which is a very busy intersection.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.520
 It doesn't have a footbridge.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.400
 So we're going to see, he's claimed we're going to see an increase in like accidents

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.400
 and potentially deaths.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.400
 Wow.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.400
 Yeah.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.680
 So then he's basically being like, you're killing people.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.680
 Are you okay?

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.760
 If you're cool killing people, then yeah, go ahead and tear down the bridge evil person.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.760
 Yeah.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:45.600
 So he like him with all these like crazy, crazy arguments ultimately lost because just one

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.640
 of those bureaucratic things of like they committed to this plan.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.120
 And if they don't do this, it seems like they wasted millions of dollars on this other thing.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.120
 Yeah.

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.120
 Yeah.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.120
 And that's what it feels like.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.480
 It feels like is anyone in history won something like this?

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.720
 Like, could I actually go in there?

00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.720
 Yeah.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.720
 There has changed.

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.720
 Oh, really?

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.720
 Okay.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.360
 So when we're in New York, I'm going to take you guys around this neighborhood.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.360
 Okay.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:12.360
 It is like the one of the most pleasant places in New York in the world and the one of the

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:17.360
 most pleasant places in New York in the world, and in the world, like one of the nicest

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.360
 in the world.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.360
 Yeah.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:24.400
 And the person behind it, Jane Jacobs, wrote a whole book on her old theory on what makes

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.400
 great neighborhoods.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:31.320
 But that was almost that neighborhood was almost destroyed because they were going to

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.880
 build this crazy highway through it.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:40.080
 And she organized like a ton of just protests and pushed back on it and it worked.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:44.560
 And that neighborhood over the next 50 years actually became, again, turned to this like

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.280
 crazy, nice thing.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.280
 Okay.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.280
 So not only did it work.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.280
 It could happen.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.280
 It could happen.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.280
 Right.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.280
 Yeah.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.280
 And now her book is like everywhere.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:58.840
 I feel like I have as much of an argument, like in my case, yeah, it's really tough.

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.200
 It's literally just the view and there is like a lot of wildlife.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.760
 So all these woods that they're going to get rid of, we used to have deer all over the

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.760
 place.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.040
 And I feel like there's nowhere for them to be now.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.920
 Like they would go between those woods and like the wooded areas between our homes.

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.200
 And I feel like when all that's gone, it's like habitat destruction.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.920
 I just, I know these words from being a kid when it's like, say they're wrecking havoc

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.840
 on, they're like coming into your backyard and they're like kicking your children.

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.840
 Yeah.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.840
 Just lie about it.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:26.840
 Okay.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:27.840
 Yeah.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.840
 And just see if they call me on it.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.840
 You know, play dirty.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.760
 It's kind of the most plausible why the air quality, like kicking children.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.080
 You've been, you've been monitoring the air quality and it's been like drastically reduced

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:42.160
 when these trees were, yeah, yeah, just flash like a little like, like meter of some sort

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:46.080
 that I'm holding like, it's gone up to 26 parts per million.

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.080
 Okay.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:52.960
 And this used to be 24 realistically, I don't think you or I are going to be successful

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.880
 at this because I think the only way to be successful is to like be one of those people

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.260
 with like no shame, but to look at an impressive degree, like that's, if you're fighting like

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:05.800
 government bureaucracies, I feel like it's just, yeah, you're the people that make a scene.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:11.360
 You like end up on YouTube because somebody records it, but you get your way maybe.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.960
 He's got to be really annoying, could be super, super, super annoying.

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:15.960
 Yeah.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:16.960
 I can't do that.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:17.960
 I can't do that conflict.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:24.360
 Like like a really embarrassing billboard on your property that faces, which is where

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.280
 this new development would be, something like pornographic and horrible.

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.280
 Oh, no.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.280
 Okay.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.280
 Yeah, I'm not going to do that.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.280
 I'll try the bomb thing.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.280
 We'll try that.

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.280
 I'm saying, this is what it takes.

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.360
 You're, you're, you're fighting against a developer is going to make millions and millions

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.520
 and millions from this.

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.520
 So well, let's see.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.520
 Sorry.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:44.120
 So at least a couple of millions, they're going to make maybe, yeah, I don't know, like

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.880
 Calus, right? I'm assuming they'll probably make more than anyone selling a domain to

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:54.520
 Google will, but probably not as much as, yeah, I mean, I had the same, I mean, I complain

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.560
 about my neighborhood the same in the same way that.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:02.720
 So if you remember my backyard, uh, on the other side is has been this giant empty lot.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.200
 The whole time I've been here in Miami, it's been a big empty lot.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.320
 And we looked it up the other day.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:14.040
 And when it was sold, it was sold with diagrams of like a giant apartment building.

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.040
 Like huge.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.040
 And I'm like, is that the plan?

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.040
 Oh no.

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.040
 That's a plan.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:23.440
 There's going to be a huge apartment building just overlooking my backyard.

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.440
 Yeah.

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.800
 Just like walking around in my underwear all the time.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.840
 I mean, yeah, you should probably not do that anyway, but yeah, no, I don't care about

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.840
 that.

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.880
 I'm like, I'm going to increase that to like, oh, yeah, make it more annoying for the people

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.880
 that.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.880
 Yeah.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:42.120
 So the only way I stop this is to like play 30, you know, okay, like dump radioactive material

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:48.680
 over the fence and to the side or something, uh, just try the bomb vest thing.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.880
 I'm telling you, I think, okay, so here's another thing I never told you about this.

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:59.720
 I'm going to say it publicly now, which means I probably can never do it because it's incriminating.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.920
 Next door to me is a more reasonably sized apartment building and they have a parking lot

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:07.680
 and the parking lot is like basically neighboring my backyard.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.600
 At some point, they complained that I was too dark in the parking lot and they needed

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.280
 like lights.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:18.000
 But for some reason, the response to this was to go crazy overboard and some gigantic flood

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 lights.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:26.800
 All the time, yeah, and one of them shoots a beam of light, like right into at least

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:33.280
 two big double doors in my bedroom that are glass through there into my bedroom.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.280
 It doesn't really bother me.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:38.280
 Like we have blinds and like, it's not the worst thing, but it would be better if that

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:40.200
 wasn't there.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:44.680
 We're friends with someone that lives in that building because he brings his dog over sometimes

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:49.560
 and he was like, yeah, just wait till it's dark and take a baby gun and shoot out the

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.560
 thing.

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.400
 Oh, you're saying you haven't done it.

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:56.640
 It would be so, yeah, it would be so easy because like there's a gap in my fence where

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.120
 I can just go prone and shoot, shoot it.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.400
 I wish you would and film it.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.720
 It's just one of these things where I'm like, there's no way they're ever going to replace

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.720
 it.

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.160
 Like there's no way they're going to like be like, oh, there's other lights in the parking

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.160
 lot that are fine.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.240
 They don't need this one.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.240
 Interesting.

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.480
 Yeah, it's also just kind of like, sounds fun.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.280
 I mean, like a reason to have a BB gun and to use it.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.280
 This is dad as a BB gun.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.080
 He uses all the time to kill iguanas.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.080
 Really?

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.080
 He shoots them out of their trees.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.080
 Yeah.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.080
 Wow.

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.080
 That sounds kind of fun too.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.080
 Yeah.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.080
 I mean, not killing animals.

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.080
 I'm a vegan.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:34.960
 But like the idea of like the target practice of it, like getting good at hitting small things

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.960
 with a BB gun.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:36.960
 That sounds fun.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.960
 Yeah.

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:38.960
 Yeah.

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:42.520
 It's like a tactical operation where I'm like really stealthy and I like, yeah, you're

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:47.800
 like a ghillie suit and you're laying in your bushes aiming a little BB gun through the

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.800
 fence.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.400
 Or like go on the roof of my house.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.400
 Yeah.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.400
 Yeah.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.400
 Go prone.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.400
 Yeah.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.400
 I want to go paintballing.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.760
 Can we can we like organize a paintballing thing because that just sounds so fun.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.960
 Like first person paintball.

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:04.400
 Can we do like a stream and we film it all in where we have like all we all have cameras.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.400
 Did we talk about this?

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.040
 I feel like we've talked about this.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.040
 No, we're talking about this.

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.040
 That was a great idea.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.040
 Okay.

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.040
 Come to the Ozarks.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:16.640
 We'll do a paintball like a JavaScript paintball war and get all the framework authors.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.640
 But we all have like GoPros and you can see like our gun.

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.880
 So it looks like gold and I like first person video game and we're paintballing each other.

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.880
 Let's do it.

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:25.880
 That's a great idea.

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:26.880
 That would be so fun.

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:32.520
 So in New York, there is a place that we've gone to more than once, which is this who said

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.680
 something, but it is like this crazy warehouse.

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:41.120
 They set up to be like really creepy, like these little tunnels quarters and it's really

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.120
 hard to see.

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.440
 It's dark, not lighting.

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.920
 And it's up.

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.560
 So it's laser tags, not paintball.

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:54.840
 I think I paintball in the area, but it's laser, but the thing here is they hire actors

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.840
 to play zombies.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.840
 Oh my word.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.840
 Yeah.

00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.840
 And so there's different modes.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.680
 It's it can be like you against zombies when you shoot them, like their shit lights up and

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:02.680
 they like fall down.

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.680
 Yeah.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.680
 This is New York.

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.280
 They get into the actors.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.760
 Do they get into it?

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.760
 Like, yeah.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.080
 So we played this version.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.240
 This was for my friends.

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:18.200
 My friend got married and we went here for his like, you know, sounds like a good time.

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:22.840
 I mean, and so the mode we played was it was too, it was like two teams, right?

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.680
 It's like one, you're playing the other team laser tag.

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.680
 Yeah.

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.440
 The third team is the zombies that are attacking everyone.

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.440
 Okay.

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:32.520
 Every round, they were like up the intensity, up it, up it, up it, up it, up it.

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.520
 By the end.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.520
 You're telling them to.

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.920
 They were just grabbing us and just slamming us against the wall and stuff.

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:38.920
 It was so fun.

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:39.920
 It was so good.

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:45.040
 And like you're living a zombie movie, they make these crazy noises and like it's like

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.320
 really, really intense.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.840
 Oh man.

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:53.000
 The thing that's interesting is I remember the first time we went where it was just like

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.960
 us versus zombies, it was really scary for like the first minute.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:58.960
 Yeah.

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:03.760
 And then something in and what's interesting is it's only happened to some people.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.760
 Like I flipped in.

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:05.760
 All these psycho pads.

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.760
 Yeah.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:07.760
 Yeah.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.760
 So they put there was brains where it was not scary at all.

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:13.280
 And it was just so like you were just focused on the mission like the scariest of it just

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.280
 like dissipated.

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.440
 You were just like the adrenaline kicked in and you were just like, you were going to

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:18.440
 kill those zombies.

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.440
 Yeah.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.440
 Yeah.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.440
 It's like a soldier in battle.

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.440
 Yeah.

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.440
 So I felt good about that.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.800
 I was like, okay, if I am a situation that's stressful, like it's going to be scary, but like

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.800
 it'll flip.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.800
 Yeah.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.800
 The adrenaline will kick in.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.800
 Yeah.

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:30.800
 Yeah.

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.800
 Yeah.

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:38.680
 Yeah, they were kind of like behind us the whole time.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:39.680
 Yeah.

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.680
 It's super fun.

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:45.920
 And there was these fun situations where like I walked into a room and I saw, oh, because

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:49.080
 the mode where it's you against the zombies, you're also, it's also an escape room at the

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.080
 same time.

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.080
 We're trying to solve a puzzle.

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.800
 There's like, you have to like discover these clues and find things combining those

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.800
 things.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.800

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.800

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.800
 I saw my friend like looking in a barrel.

00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.440
 I walked over to look in a barrel and now I turn around and I was like trying to see what

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.440
 else was there.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:03.440
 But it wasn't my friend.

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.440
 It was a zombie, pretending to look in a barrel.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.440
 Oh, no.

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.440
 I knew they'd turn around and started grabbing me.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:07.440
 And it was, it was pretty.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.440
