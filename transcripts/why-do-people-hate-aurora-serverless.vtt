WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
 Even around for a long time. Can I tell you why I don't use it? Why I just don't like the name

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.680
 I really just don't like the name. That's it. That's funny

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.560
 You make your own LUTs? Well, what did you do? I just used the the Sony

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.040
 official LUT for my camera. But does that like just work with your lighting and your background

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.120
 and like it it's all fine? Yeah, it's made so you you basically like

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.120
 you take a gray card and you expose to 44% or whatever and it's based off that. It's SLOG 3.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.360
 I right that's basically roughly what I did when I made it myself. Yeah, but you just like

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.320
 did you use like DaVinci or something? Yeah, exactly. And then you saved the LUT. Yeah,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.840
 interesting. I am still shaking from an hour ago getting in the cold plunge hour and a half ago.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.200
 I have never gotten warm today. It's like I've just been cold all day. Is it because it's cold

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.600
 outside? It's below freezing. It's 31 degrees outside. That doesn't help. It was the worst

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.800
 experience I've had in a cold plunge yet. But by that, I mean the best experience because I feel

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.360
 better than ever. I'm just shaking. Yeah, I'm like, I hear it. It's so bad. It's like I started

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.560
 cold like I've been up a long time. We're doing some stuff maintenance production stuff in an

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.560
 open night. And when you're like, do you, if you work early and more, do you ever work? You work

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.080
 pretty early, don't you? Yeah. Do your hands get cold? Like I get everything gets really cold

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.120
 after a few hours. So I used to always have this problem of like my hands were always cold all the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:01.120
 time. Yeah. But then I just move somewhere where I don't get cold. I was like, what's the trick?

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.960
 Oh, move to Miami. Yeah. Well, the other thing is I've never been colder anywhere than indoors in

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.480
 Miami because people love to just crank up the AC to point where it's like indoors here. It gets

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.040
 like crazy cold. So when we were like staying at Liz's parents house while we're figuring out where

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.600
 to live, somehow, no matter where I was, there was an AC blowing like onto me. So yeah, my hands

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.240
 was freeze like working in the office air because I used to be blowing right in my hands. And yeah,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.000
 I don't like it. I appreciate that about Miami and South Florida in general that you guys embrace

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.160
 the air conditioning. There's there's tropical climates where people don't like Hawaii. I'm

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.600
 more like that. I don't know. I feel like the AC is overdone. Oh, really? Oh, man. Yeah. I don't

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.080
 I don't enjoy a hot climate without air conditioning. Yeah. I mean, that's that's most people I think,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.320
 but I think like a like a fan and like a breeze that's like enough for me for the most part, but

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.280
 yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong. I appreciate the AC, especially when I'm like coming back

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.960
 inside after being hot, but yeah, it's just like it's freezing here inside sometimes. I might need

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.680
 to get a heavy. I'm so cold. Go. Go do it. Do it. I think I really have my arms crossed. I feel like

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.400
 you might like go into shock or something. Something. I actually this morning after I got out my

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.880
 my hand had like little bumps on it and they were my veins, but they were like in balls,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.680
 like little BBs. It was weird looking like my blood froze or something. I'm going to get a hoodie.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.520
 Yeah. Go do that. Hey, I have a question. Yeah. Why do people hate a roar serverless V2?

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.080
 Are you sure this cold one is good for you? Because you do not sound good in any way.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.520
 That was just like food that got caught in my throat. I see. As I started to speak.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.720
 Okay, your question. Yeah. So I don't I don't remember why, but I felt like I was supposed to

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.680
 not like a roar serverless. And I looked at it. And for our needs, it made sense. And we switched to

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:06.320
 it. And it's good. I don't be one or V2. V2. Okay. Yeah. So there's like a whole cascading list of

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.800
 reasons. I think one is that when you think of our serverless, like they threw this word

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.560
 serverless in there. It's just like more aggressive auto scaling postgres. Like you can't really do

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.640
 it in a serverless way. So it's not like the same as Dynamo. It's snappy. Like it is snappy with the

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.000
 way it scales up and down with the ACUs. Like it's not like, Oh, you started getting a bunch of

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 traffic in a minute and a half. You'll have another instance deployed. It's like, it's pretty opaque

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.160
 or abstract. Like you just set them in max and it just glides around. So V1 was a lot slower. It would

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.480
 like it would scale up, but then it wouldn't scale down for like an hour. So if you got like a spike

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.120
 for like 20 minutes, you're so paying for the whole hour. So it wasn't like the most responsive

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.560
 thing, especially for people coming from Dynamo where it's like completely opaque. But then the

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.480
 other issue is a stupid V1 V2 split. Like they launched the V1 version of Aurora. And now there's

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.920
 a V2. And in your head, you're like, Oh, that means V2 is what we should all be moving to because

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.040
 that's the next version. They're going to like kill V1. Yeah, that's not how V1 and V2 works

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.080
 at AWS. No, it's it's like completely two different approaches to the same problem. And they just

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.040
 named them V1 and V2. And I would love to use V2 API gateway. Yeah, API gave us another classic

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.240
 example. I would love to use V2, except that it doesn't support data API, which is one of the best

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.440
 things they did with serverless V1. But you don't need to have CB connections to all HTTP based.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.840
 This isn't like super obvious. Why is this good? So one obviously gets rid of the need for like

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.280
 connection pullers, RDS proxy, all that like it's it's very simple. The other case that

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.240
 you have to be under certain conditions running to so you might not have run into this. But

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.440
 when your function is done executing, it gets frozen. It gets frozen. And from its point of

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.840
 view, like no time is passing where your function, like when your lambda function is done executing,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.320
 it's going to get frozen for a while and kept around so it can handle the next invocation pretty

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:18.080
 quickly. But if you have an open TCP connection, that's like frozen. The other thing at the end,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.880
 other end of that connection, the database might look at it and be like, this connection is not

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.640
 being used when terminated. But then when your container gets unfrozen, it thinks it's so connected

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.240
 and you might have like weird like connection reset error. Okay. So I have not run into that,

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.400
 but it's been like a few hours. You're not going you probably aren't going to run into it because

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.520
 your functions are probably always busy. So the next request comes in like immediately after it's done.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.200
 But if you're in this like middle zone, where like you get enough traffic to keep the function

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.440
 warm, but not enough so that like there's so like these like long gaps of being frozen,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.280
 like several minutes, whatever, you're going to get these weird because you can't resume a TCP

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.680
 connection as though nothing has changed because something on the other end can decide to stop

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.760
 in getting. So it's not it's fine in a lot of cases, but like the data API is kind of necessary.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.560
 That's why you see all these other database providers like PlanetScale has their own HTTP

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.440
 base API like neon came out with their own HTTP base one. Yeah, I think there's might be WebSocket

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.640
 base, but yeah, they just support these more stateless ways of communicating. And I want a V2

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.360
 had that API. We're all good. We're all going to move to V2. I'm using RDS proxy in front of it.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.920
 Yeah, but I mean, it's going to have that same problem. Oh, okay. Yeah. You but like I said,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.320
 you might not because your functions might be like super busy. Yeah. But you're going to

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.960
 probably once in a while, see this like connection reset error. It's not the biggest deal, but

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.960
 it just indicative of why the underlying system like doesn't line up well.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.120
 Okay. Well, I'm going to be checking invocation logs because I don't know if we're handling that,

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.680
 like if that happens. Yeah, I mean, the recursors error, and then I don't know what it's serving.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.520
 So it might, okay, the user might just retry or whatever. Yeah. Well, we were going from classic

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:13.440
 RDS Postgres. Yeah. And so it's our first jump into Aurora. Obviously, like Dynamo is great.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.120
 I love building stuff with Dynamo. This was built nine years ago, and we weren't going to

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.680
 port it to Dynamo. But we did move to Aurora, and we decided to do serverless. And so far,

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.480
 it just seems a lot better. I think we're going to save money because our traffic is so like

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.120
 time of day dependent, like the evenings, we get these crazy amounts of traffic and stuff like that.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:43.120
 Yeah, exactly. So I do think like it's going to scale up quite a bit then. And we were having

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.440
 issues. The reason we moved to Aurora is that we were pegging out our current instance size,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.160
 and we just had been previously scaling up. And I just thought like, maybe it's time to make the leap.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.400
 So far so good. Yeah, I mean, it makes sense to me, it almost feels like that should just be the

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:02.640
 default, like is it just as the same as normal Aurora, but can scale up and down fast. Like,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.760
 why wouldn't you want that? Why choose a cluster size? Like, we were not using most of it all the

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.800
 time. And then we were sized such that we could handle that peak at the end of the day, and last

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.080
 for like an hour. And then we're just using, we just have this idle box. That's the case for

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.160
 serverless, isn't it? Yeah, the over provisioning. Yeah, you don't want to be over provisioned.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.480
 Yeah, like, I think my issue really is overall, there isn't like a killer,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:37.200
 serverless Lambda function plus relational database set up on AWS. Yeah, I think like you

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.320
 guys are already in a VPC. So it's not like you started to adopt a VPC for it. So that was a big

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.080
 deal. But yeah, now for the average person, they now need to like put their lambdas in a VPC. And

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:54.000
 there's a lot of stuff like that. So yeah, I would let if the data API came to V2,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.440
 then I would like no problem. No hesitation recommend. Here's like a good

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.400
 Yeah, already I set up right now whenever people ask me like, what should I want to use a relational

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.680
 database? Like, what should I do? I actually usually tell them like consider going outside of AWS.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.920
 Yeah, planet skills. Great. I mean, I love planet skill.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.760
 But if they had a data API, then I can like kind of comfortably say that you're still going to have

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.560
 a pretty, pretty good experience. But yeah, there's no, like, I don't understand why they

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.200
 lost it and why there's no signal on whether they're going to add it back. Like I've seen some

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.680
 discussions and it's always some vague thing like, Oh, yeah, like we're looking into this. But

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:37.200
 maybe maybe pre-invent, maybe reinvent. Who knows? What is up with pre-invent? I haven't heard

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.440
 anything. Is there not been any mumbling? Are they just holding it all for re-invent this year?

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.800
 Maybe there isn't as much. Well, I was gonna say maybe 15 years in or whatever it's been for AWS.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.880
 Maybe there's so little big announcements that they're just like, you know what,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.880
 let's save it all for the conference. That's going to happen eventually, right? They can't

00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:00.880
 continually just have like, overloads of information every year. Yeah, but at least last year, I got

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.080
 a bunch of leaks. I got every one of the leaks this year. I guess I have some leaks. Look at me

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.800
 not sharing them with you. I see. I see. Well, I don't need to tell me the details. Is there

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:20.000
 anything that I would be excited by in your leaks? To be honest, no. I'm not excited about it.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.320
 There's some stuff. I mean, there's some stuff that once I see more than just,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.080
 I haven't joined any of the calls. Like the heroes have these NDA calls where we get

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.720
 briefed by the product teams ahead of re-invent. I haven't joined any of them. I've just read the

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.880
 like announcement for the call and in those little announcements, they'll be like bullet points.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.320
 So I've gotten very little information from that. There are a couple of them that,

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:48.400
 depending on how it all really turns out, it could be interesting. But yeah, nothing like

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:56.160
 major. There's no like land going to one millisecond billing or, you know, that kind of stuff.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.840
 Yeah. Kind of seeing anything like that. Well, okay. I do feel like I've heard

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.160
 murmurings of big changes in lambda. So I'm still kind of hoping for that. Like,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:12.240
 I don't imagine that would be a pre-invent thing. I think that would be the conference thing.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.440
 Yeah. Yeah. We'll see. Yeah. But I haven't heard anything. That said, I don't even know

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.960
 what I want. Like, I don't even know what I'm imagining. Like that there's just the classic

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.640
 things of like search, serverless search. Like, where is that? But besides that, I don't know.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.840
 So is open search. So I'm going to be looking at this pretty soon. Open search serverless is bad.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:37.760
 I just remember all the services that came out as serverless, and they weren't very serverless.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:43.760
 It's a classic thing where if you have to put a label on it, it's not the thing. Yeah, social

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.400
 science. And this is the same case. And anything that has a word serverless in it, it's, it's not

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:55.360
 serverless. Like they don't call it lambda serverless. You know, right? That's true. Or like dynamo

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:03.360
 serverless, rescue serverless. Yeah. Yeah. Open search is, it's the same thing. It's the same

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.680
 thing as that's actually the exact same thing as already a situation. Except the floor is crazy

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:14.320
 high. The floor is like 800 bucks a month or something. Okay. I get it with search. Like search is

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:21.040
 anything that isn't like designed from day one to be serverless is hard to make serverless.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:26.000
 That's why it's hard to make a relational database serverless. You're in plant scale. Like you very

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:34.640
 quickly switch back to having like instant sizes there. Yeah. So and search is like, especially that

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:41.840
 way because it's so heavy and all that. So I get it. But at the same time, Algolia exists,

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:48.320
 type sense exists. I think type sense is actually instance based, but Algolia is not. And Amazon's

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.240
 scale. I feel like they can effectively make anything seem serverless, even if it's hard just

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:58.480
 through like pricing tricks. Yep. So yeah, I don't know. That's the one big thing that's missing.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.400
 So you guys are looking for search stuff. We already use, we use the last search. I think we

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.520
 use like a hosted elastic dot co, like the actual company, but we're going to move it in-house. I'm

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:15.360
 pretty sure to AWS and to open probably is probably yeah, I think so. And we may not do the serverless

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.680
 thing, but I don't know, just there's an option. It seems better than the traditional.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:27.760
 Yeah. I'm remembering the Chris Moon's tweet where he was like, serverless is dead. He was like,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:33.440
 that was like the catchy phrase. But what he said was that- You keep calling Chris Moon's.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.520
 That's like you're never doing that. Are you? Well, I forgot what it was. We haven't said his name

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:45.840
 in so long. It's M-U-N-N-S, which- MUNS is MUNS. That's what I said, isn't it? I feel like I said

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:51.520
 MUNS and you were like, you're going to keep calling him Chris Moon's. We can go to the playback.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:57.200
 Well, no, let's not do that. Let's not do that. I believe you. Let me get my little recording

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:04.400
 device here. It says, oh, yeah. No. What he said was that like every company actually has a VPC,

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.040
 anybody building a serverless, it's like this mishmash of some of it serverless, some of it,

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:15.600
 but they all have VPCs. At the time, I remember scoffing. When I look at my situation, it's like,

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:22.800
 oh, yeah, no, we have this mixmash of all kinds of stuff. Not all of it's purely serverless stuff.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.200
 But you have a VPC because AWS requires you to have a VPC. It's like a circular thing.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.000
 Well, yeah. Everybody has a VPC. Sure.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.680
 We have a default VPC. Did you delete it? Yeah. Oh, for real. That's awesome.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.200
 We have nothing deployed in VPCs.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.560
 Well, I figured you didn't have anything deployed in it, but everyone gets one in their account.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.880
 Yeah, I hate it. It's supposedly deleted and I hated it. You got rid of that thing.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:54.240
 But okay, so you have nothing deployed in VPC. I guess like we started with just like EC2

00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:01.680
 applications and a database nine years ago. And it made sense. Like we just, it's all in a VPC.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:08.000
 Yeah. Once you have a VPC, you're never getting rid of that VPC. Like, I can't imagine that we

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.360
 ever just get rid of everything that's running in our VPC. I guess we could.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.480
 It just comes down to if people had the option to use one and to not use one, everyone's going

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.760
 to pick to not use one. And that's, to me, it's that is simple. So yeah, of course, a lot of people

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.480
 use VPCs and will continue to do so because they have stuff that was forced into a VPC and they're

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:31.920
 not going to be able to move it or change it. But yeah, moving forward, the more stuff that's not

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:38.320
 VPC required, the better. Yeah, I'm trying to think of like what, what we have to have a VPC for.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.760
 I guess like if we were using, well, if the data API existed and we didn't have to connect to

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.920
 our database through a VPC. I don't want a day API doesn't need a VPC. That's a big

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.640
 reason. Yeah. So that that'd be great. If we had that, then we could continue on with Aurora.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:59.520
 And then presumably, well, no, I mean, like our, some of our services are just like long living,

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:08.080
 like, I mean, one's a.net app that runs an ECS. It's going to have to have a VPC, right? You can't

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.520
 run like Fargate services without a VPC. Yeah, Fargate has to be in a VPC. Yeah. So like those

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:19.680
 apps, I guess we don't all of our workloads can't just run as like land. Well, they could. I mean,

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.280
 architecturally, there's no reason they couldn't just like we can't, we're not going to be right.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.240
 You know, switch it. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. I mean, it makes sense for existing applications

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:34.800
 that are like hybrid of the two. Oh, yeah. The other thing is like the reality of why VPCs are

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.800
 required. I don't know why they're not just straightforward about this, because if you look

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:44.080
 at something like, what's their memory? Like a Redis equivalent? A last to cash?

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.800
 A last to cash. Okay. So to deploy a last to cash, it needs to be in a VPC, which is why I never

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:55.200
 use it. Like I like just make a do without like a Redis equivalent. I just put it in Dynamo. And

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.200
 yeah, that's usually good enough. And if I need more, I go to upstairs. The question is, why is it

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:05.600
 not? Like, why does it require a VPC? It's because with services like that, you need to build

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:12.480
 centralized authentication somehow, right? Like, how do you do I am off over Redis protocol? You

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.960
 have to like invent a way to do that or Redis protocol. They don't want to do that, or maybe

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.760
 it's too hard, or maybe it's impossible. So they show it in a VPC and say, okay, your VPC itself

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.720
 does a centralized auth. Yeah, then everything in there can just not have that. So there's only

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.480
 some services they've been able to bring that to, right? They've been able to bring it to Dynamo.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:36.160
 They've been able to bring it to the API. I think they can do it for everything. S3, right?

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.640
 S3, yeah. The ones that were built from scratch.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.520
 Yes. Secrets manager.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.480
 How do you build from scratch at AWS? We'll have it.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:49.120
 Yeah. But same with the open search. It's just like, it needs to work over whatever

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.840
 logic search. I mean, that's just HTTP. So I feel like that one could be done. But

00:18:53.840 --> 00:19:00.880
 the other side is, other companies have done it. Like UpSash gives you like an HTTP-based API for

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:07.600
 Redis. And they manage to move the auth somewhere else. But yeah, VPC was just a nice way to be like,

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.600
 we don't have to worry about it, throw it in there, and centralized auth just works.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.840
 So if I were building a new app, let's say I could build something from scratch today,

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.960
 and it would immediately have lots of users. And I use like API gateway, lambda functions,

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:30.400
 and Dynamo. All of that stuff is just communicating over the internet. But it's over like Amazon's

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.880
 smart enough to know it's all within Amazon data centers. But is there like a billing

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.960
 implication? I should know the answers to this.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.760
 No. So if it's within the same availability zone, it is there is no billing implication.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:49.280
 What availability zone? But if I'm using all these public services, the general rule is if it's

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:54.800
 within an availability zone, it's not going to cost you. So when you use these services

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.680
 abstract away, the constant availability zone, that's handled for you.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.720
 Oh, they put it in the same bill. But he's on like, if I'm calling Dynamo from a lambda function,

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.280
 yeah, they just they it does it from within the same ability zone. So there's no.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.760
 Yeah, exactly. Cross region.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.440
 Bandit just cross region. Yeah, yeah.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.160
 Yeah. So that's like a little, I think a lot of paying a lot when they

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.360
 don't use a managed services, because like they don't think about those things and they have

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:31.040
 traffic going across availability zones by accident. Yeah. So yeah, the public internet thing also

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:39.520
 confused me for a bit. But yeah, it like gets routed correctly or like routed efficiently.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.080
 Yeah, it all stays. It's not like it literally goes out to some outside the data center

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.400
 DNS resolver and like, Oh, oops, come back.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.040
 Yeah, come back.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:52.400
 Okay. So they do smart things. But I guess like, is there any security

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.600
 implication? Like, is there any, is it less secure to build that than to build a bunch of

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.320
 stuff living in a private subnet? I think that I think people get confused with this. So I think,

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.240
 and it shows up a lot when you're like going through compliance when when they hear that you

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.480
 don't have a VPC, they're like, Whoa, like, that's not safe. Whoa. Yeah. But then remember,

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:17.120
 the point of a VPC is to like do central centralized auth, which a VPC does with like

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:24.640
 in like a really crude way. Whereas these more purpose built services, they do centralized

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.600
 auth through IM. And that's no more or no less secure than doing it through a VPC.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:35.040
 Hang on. I want to dig at that a little bit. So when you say the purpose of the VPC is to

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.760
 handle centralized auth, you just mean like, I mean, because the purpose is to create like a

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:46.080
 virtual network that can be private and isolated at the network level, right? Like,

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:52.480
 it's all done in software. It's not any. It's software, but it's like software, uh, network

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:58.160
 components. Like they've literally created like software routers, right? That are,

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:04.800
 they were revolutionary, but like it's not, I don't know. Now I'm just selling it. Uh,

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:11.120
 like it's, it's ultimately like you have a private physical network. You have network isolation,

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:17.680
 whereas, uh, with IM, it's still, it's not like you don't have network isolation, right?

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.840
 Yeah, no, it's implemented a different layer of the protocol. But if you think about what the

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.400
 software router is doing, there's just some rule somewhere saying if you receive a packet

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.840
 meant for this destination from the source, make sure it's allowed to go through.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.240
 If it's not, I guess that's what you're saying. So it's just a rule implemented somewhere. So

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:42.000
 yes, it's like a, a lower level of the TCP IP, whatever that stack is. Whatever the OSI

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.160
 whole thing. Yeah, whatever, whatever. We just mentioned all of that stuff.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:55.920
 Uh, it's funny. Yeah. So it's, it's, it is the same thing. The same rules are implemented just

00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:02.080
 at a different part of the stack. And I would argue in some ways, it's more precise because

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:08.800
 a network rule can't be super precise. It can't say like, uh, this is allowed, but only like,

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:17.040
 read, read commands from Dynamo, but you can't implement that at that low, right? Right. So to me,

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:22.320
 at worst, it's equivalent at worst. It's equivalent. Um, and I think it's better because in practice,

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:27.040
 you're more likely to get, I am right than to get like VPC routing rules, right? Yeah,

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:33.360
 no, that makes sense. Uh, just managing a VPC is so hard. Like it's because there's not like one

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.800
 unified view of it and AWS. It's like, I'm going to click on the subnets page. Now I'm going to go

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.680
 to the route tables page and like everything in isolation means nothing. Like I don't know the

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.360
 idea of my route table. That doesn't help me when I'm trying to find it in a list. Like,

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:53.200
 it's just the whole navigation that's in the VPC console is, is weird. I have a tough time holding

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:58.560
 the concepts in my head because there's like so many places where you secure things. There's like

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.880
 the routing, but there's also security group. And I'm always like, wait, what does security

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:07.200
 do for group? Because it's like one is for the destination ones for the source. Like it's, yeah,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.080
 it is very hard. And I'm glad that I have not to like really think about this in a long time.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.760
 Because back in the day, there's like the first thing you did whenever you started a new project,

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.280
 you went and like, oh, yeah, set up all figured your VPC correctly. Yeah. I mean,

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:28.800
 now it's like a one minor CDK thing, but right. Yeah. It used to be like thinking about IP address

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:35.520
 allocation. Yeah, I know. That's funny. Like, what's your cider mask going to be? Yeah. I never

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.640
 learned that by the way. Yeah. Did you ever learn how they worked? I did because I took all the certs.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:48.000
 So, you know, there's like tools, cider.xyz actually helps conceptualize it. You don't need to learn

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.040
 it at this point. Like you made it. I don't. Yeah. I survived. I somehow configured all my

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.920
 networks all these years without knowing how to do a cider mask. I just know that slash eight means

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:10.720
 a lot. I don't understand why it's not. Well, I'm sure it's a good reason, like an efficiency reason,

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:18.800
 but just give me like a, like a red jacks or like a pattern, like a white card. Yeah. Yeah. That

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:24.080
 start. Yeah. That makes sense. That start, that start, that start. There you go. Yeah. That much

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:30.080
 easier. So I realized I was like making the case for the like old way of thinking and you've convinced

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.200
 me, which is not hard to do, that it really is just all better. Like we didn't need to know all

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:40.560
 that stuff and people who think it's more secure to set up their VPCs and to run these old things

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:49.120
 on Docker containers or EC2 images. Like imagine right now there are people. Lots of them that are

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:56.800
 managing their Docker installations on raw EC2 and running containers in their little EC2 instances

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.840
 inside of some VPC and manually like configuring their load balancers and doing all this stuff.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.240
 And like, that's just a lot of stuff you don't have to do anymore. And people are going to keep

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:11.280
 building that way for another decade. It saddens me. You know who is doing that up until very

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:16.720
 recently, Frank at our company. Oh, really? Okay. Well, there you go. Actually, I don't remember

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:22.960
 exactly to set up, but like for any other tool, I know, if you even were, we're still doing that

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:29.760
 stuff, our like our CI process was running on containers and EC2, I think you just moved it all

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.600
 the way. You weren't even using like one of the managed container services. You were using like,

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:40.160
 like you were installing Docker on EC2, like a custom AMI and you're like building up your EC2

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:48.560
 instances. Yeah. Wow. But here's the thing though. It's at the limits that problems show up,

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:53.120
 which is why we were doing this. So for a CI tool, it actually really matters a lot how fast your

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.600
 container starts up because it's a CI service. Like you're going to start up containers whenever

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.880
 people need to build. Yeah. So ECS for a while was not a good option because ECS took forever to boot

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:09.520
 up, but they have this new thing called some kind of rum index. No, not rum into some kind of index

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:16.000
 thing. You can like do this thing to your Docker image that makes it boot up way faster. So we

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.760
 ended up moving to ECS and it actually shaved like two or $3,000 off of our monthly bill.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:28.160
 Wow. Yeah. And we get almost the same performance and like a lot more flexibility. So yeah, it was

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:33.120
 a good move. But again, like you talked about the other day, like this, there are some exceptions

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.200
 to this stuff. Like a CI service is a great example of an exception. Again, I don't think anyone

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:42.240
 should build a CI service anymore. Like GitHub actions exists. Like everyone just wants to use

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:48.080
 that. Wait, are you building one right now? What would ask for this? We don't really

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:55.040
 warning an existing business into a new UI like a new approach. So historically, there's been a

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.680
 lot of CI services. And at some point, GitHub actions came out and it's like, duh, you want

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.560
 your CI servers right next to your code. Like, obviously, that's a much better setup. And there's

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:10.560
 just a million undifferentiated parts of CI like environment variables, like custom scripts,

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.200
 like setting up steps, like installing a version of Pnpm you want. There's like a just like an

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.120
 infinite list of just stuff that is just not fun about running a CI service. Yep.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.280
 So our thinking now is we probably still will have like an extremely minimal if you just want to

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:33.120
 stand alone, get, connect, deploy, very minimal, not very customizable. But we're also going to make

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:40.480
 it so our CI servers can just be a step inside your actual CI service. So for using GitHub actions,

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:47.520
 you can do like SSC cloud deploy or whatever. And that'll deploy using like a really optimized

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.320
 builder on our end. So that way, we don't have to like rebuild all of CI and all the boring

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.720
 parts for like the one little differentiator that it's just like an adapter for GitHub actions.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.960
 Yeah, it's like a step. It's like a step in GitHub actions.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:04.080
 Yeah, I really, I want the CI stuff built into console. I just want everything you guys do in

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:11.360
 seed in the new modern hot tool, because I mean, I don't mind having both of them open, it's fine.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.800
 But the new one looks nice.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:18.880
 Nice to have it on one place. Yeah, we definitely need CI. It's a funny thing where like, you know,

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.960
 we had seed for a while and we were like, this is like not really a great business.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.880
 And we were like, okay, we probably won't need to be in it anymore.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:32.320
 Then I posted that question where I was like, everyone says Vercel has great, sorry, everyone

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:38.160
 says triangle company has great, great, great DX. And I was like, what are you guys referring

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.760
 to when you say that? Every single response, the only response that I got really was

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:48.240
 the CI, how easy it was to connect with GitHub and get into production.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.640
 So like, oh, every single tool today, like I don't understand how that's like the level

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.120
 bar for developer experience. Like I can connect my GitHub and it just deploys.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.680
 Yeah, you can do that to like 15 different services. That's like pretty table stakes at this point,

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.200
 isn't it? But that's what we learned. We're like, you would say, that's only been knows.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.480
 And that's what I want to know. Like when people are like, oh, I can't give up the

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:14.080
 Vercel developer experience to like run my own stuff, like what is the thing you can't give up?

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:18.640
 I don't understand. I haven't thought about CI and I don't remember five years.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.200
 Yeah. I mean, they might just be comparing it to like the worst version of it.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.040
 Because like imagine, yeah, people use code pipeline.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.360
 Yeah. All right. Imagine just like getting an SSL certificate working.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.520
 So that's another thing. I saw Theo tweeted this the other day about how things he hasn't had to

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.920
 think about since he started using Vercel. I might think about SSL certificate in like 10 years.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.200
 I don't even remember the last time. And I used to configure them manually, but we haven't had

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.840
 to do that for so long. And I don't use Vercel. I do, but yeah, the point is it's easy.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.720
 Like a lot of different people have made all of those things pretty invisible at this point.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.080
 But like in your head, if you're not aware of that, you're probably comparing it to like

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:02.880
 going to some like SSL website and like buying. Yeah, like did you search? I mean, I did the same

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.640
 back in the day. And then like, oh, it's going to expire. Does anybody have the credentials to

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.840
 did you search? Oh, shoot, we're screwed. Yeah. I remember those days. Yeah. That's been a long

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.480
 time ago. And then even then like setting up the, was it open SSL? What was it called? What's the

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.560
 thing we all use now? I think we use now. I've been so detached from this. I don't even know.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:26.080
 I mean, I just use ACM. I just use I'm an AWS. There was a step in between that made SL

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:30.960
 certificates free and widely available. And I'm totally blanking. Yeah, I'm blanking on it too.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:38.400
 I forgot what I want to sell. No, it's a the name of it. It's going to drive you crazy. It's like

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:44.720
 free. No, open. Hang on. Let's just go to a website and it's going to be like what they used.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:49.600
 Let's encrypt. Let's encrypt. There it is. There we go. All right. We used to run like

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:55.280
 Let's Encrypt services in our Kubernetes cluster and that handled it. And that was like much better

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:01.360
 than the previous step, but also it's still kind of sucked. So I can see how if you don't know,

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:07.120
 one, if you don't even know how this stuff works, or if you're like perception of the

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:11.360
 alternative is like one of the options we just talked about. Yeah, when the old ways. Yeah,

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:18.080
 I can see that. But yeah, the get push deploy. That is whether or not it's like truly useful

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:22.240
 or like truly like a killer feature. It is something that's six in people's heads. And I

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:26.800
 guess it's because it's like their first that your first interaction with the service is usually

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.600
 getting a deploy for the first time. So I guess that's why it's six in people's heads.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:35.440
 Yeah. So yeah, we realize, okay, we can't skip CI that we need to need to have that. It is an

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:41.920
 important part. It's table six. I want you to figure out how to use the cloud front blue green

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:48.320
 deployments, because it feels bad to make big changes to our distro when at the levels of traffic

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:55.040
 we have constantly flowing in. I would love to be able to put them in a blue green deployment

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.600
 and cloud front, which is like a feature in cloud front now. And if you've seen this,

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:03.840
 you basically create like a, yeah, it's a feature in cloud front. And like, it's basically it creates

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:08.880
 like a second, like a shadow distribution that you can configure however you want. And you can,

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:14.080
 you can transition traffic to it, like 10%, 15, you can have it all the time. Yeah, yeah,

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.160
 it's, it's pretty great. That's really great. Yeah. I don't know how exactly we'll want to like

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.640
 figure it out. Yeah, figure it out, because I would love to build like AB tests or not AB tests,

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:28.240
 but just like send slivers of traffic to a little, for instance, this, the latest SSC stuff,

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:33.680
 what's now been weeks ago that you guys, it was merged in. It's pretty big sweeping changes to

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:39.680
 the distro, like to the behaviors and everything. And it's scary to just like flip the switch and

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.080
 send that to everybody. Yeah. It'd be nice to be like, here's 10% of the traffic. And it's like a

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.560
 feature that's built in. I don't know how it would work from like a infrastructure's code standpoint,

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:53.920
 like a custom resource that just like, I don't know, you could configure it to like slowly fade it

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.680
 or something. I don't know. That's for you smart people to figure out. Yeah, we are looking at that.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:02.640
 Yeah, it's funny because we've been, yeah, we were talking with a team yesterday and

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:08.640
 I feel like we've had so much clarity now that we just haven't had, because one of you do, when

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:13.360
 you're like starting a company, it's just all lack of clarity. You're like, yeah, here's a thousand

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.040
 things we can do, a thousand directions we can go and a thousand unsolved things. Like, what the

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:23.440
 hell do we focus on? And for a while, we were stuck on this problem of like, what is a default

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:27.360
 project? Like, what is a default SSC product? What does it look like? Like, what are good practices?

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.920
 What's like the framework part of it? Like, how does it work? And it was so hard for us to like

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:37.840
 draw an opinion on this because so many, so many different setups, so many like, everyone had

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:42.400
 different ways they wanted to do things. And it was so hard to like, do one setup that worked for

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:48.240
 everyone. But now that we have this deployment story around these frameworks, like, Ashrow,

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:53.360
 remakes, actually, as whatever, we like realized that it's, that's no longer our problem.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.400
 Like, we just support the framework itself really well. Everything you need to do in production

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.920
 with the framework. Yeah, we don't have to worry about like the design of the framework.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.280
 Someone's already decided that they like this framework and then I use it. We just got to make

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:10.800
 sure it deploys really well. Yeah. And initially, I was like really thinking narrowly of like,

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.840
 Oh, that's just these quote unquote front end frameworks. But now they deploy so well that like,

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.960
 I can actually see myself using all the backend features of it as well. Yeah. And there's all

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:26.080
 these other frameworks that exist outside of this like front end framework zone, like even just

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.440
 express or like, fascify or like, Oh no. Yeah, what's like, nest? People always talk about nest.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.360
 I don't like that. Okay. That's another example. I just I've seen people say it.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:41.440
 Yeah, exactly. Like you mean, it's like we can just focus on figuring out going step by step

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.600
 with to each of those frameworks and figuring out here's the right way to deploy it. And that

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.720
 makes our job so much more narrow and clear. And it also expands our we don't have to convince

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.720
 anyone of anything, like whatever you choose to already use, we can just help you deploy.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.280
 Can I throw more names out there and just see if you've necessarily,

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:02.640
 viscerally react to them as well. Yeah, Redwood JS. Yeah, we talked about Redwood as well.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.120
 Okay, it's good support. So that's a good one. I've been like really used it. So I don't know.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:12.800
 Okay. A donus? A donus? Yeah, I think the problem that donus is it's very geared towards, I don't

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:17.200
 know how well it can be deployed as a serverless thing. You can use our container option. That's

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:22.640
 the thing. That's the big thing, right? People want to keep using their 15 year old frameworks,

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:29.280
 which I get it's mature, but they just accept that their infrastructure is also going to be 15

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:35.120
 years old forever. Yeah, it's never going to be taking advantage. It's all worth it, right? I

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.240
 always ask this question to you. But like, I just start questioning my own conviction when

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:45.760
 everybody's like, what do I care if it's serverless? Well, like, they're it's all worth it, right?

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.240
 All this stuff. I think so. I mean, we're using it at scale and it's great.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.320
 Yeah, I don't know. I don't at this point. I don't. I know it's worth it.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.000
 I just need to stop trying to convince people. I don't need to. Like, that's not my job.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.040
 Yeah. I mean, we literally see every single day, thousands of companies, like real companies

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:09.360
 making money. Yeah. We lit like the SRT team literally sees that every single day. Even then,

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.880
 it's like not enough to not have like a doubt in my head, you know?

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.760
 Yeah. It's just funny. Like, if you get on Twitter, you'd think like AWS is this very obscure

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:23.840
 arcane technology that nobody uses. But I remember at TwitchCon, of all places, TwitchCon,

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:30.000
 sitting around with all these people that you see on Twitter, and they're all talking about AWS.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.600
 Like, they're literally all like, oh, yeah, our SQS Q got backed up and then we had it.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.400
 It's like, I forget that all these people with their jobs at these fan companies,

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.840
 they use AWS. Like everybody uses AWS. It's so dumb.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.560
 Yeah. They have a million customers. That's a lot of customers.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:51.920
 It's a lot of customers. Yeah. Okay. I want to stop trying to convince people of it.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:56.000
 What about like, no, that's the same problem. Never mind. I'm going to go into it. I was going

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.320
 to say Laravel. Laravel deploys in a serverless way. Yeah. Do you guys think about Laravel?

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.760
 Do you guys think about like, or do they just have their own products?

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:10.960
 Okay. So our dream is that there is an SST config in every single project, no matter what it is.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:17.040
 So today, it's reasonable to see an SST config inside an Azure project, inside a next JS project,

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.800
 dreaming project. We want to, the next step is to then like,

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.760
 support like the more back-end frameworks of JavaScript, like HONO Express, Fastify,

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:31.200
 like get it. That's like, obviously very adjacent. And the next step is to say,

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.240
 oh, that Go framework that you're all using, we deploy that too.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:41.520
 Or like this Python framework you're using, we deploy too. Rust framework is exactly.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:48.320
 And then eventually that gets to things like Laravel and all of that. So I think the root idea is

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.800
 managed services are just going to continue to grow and use, even if your framework is very

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:58.640
 capable. And you always need to glue that together somewhere. And I think that SST config file

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:03.440
 could be that place. That just made me realize I haven't ever asked you.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.800
 And maybe I don't know if you don't want to share it, don't share it. But are most of your customers,

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.360
 or most of the SST users, like doing the drop-in thing within an existing project,

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.680
 or are they building their project from start with SST, like the SST monorepo style?

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.120
 I have no idea. Yeah, I guess how would you know?

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:26.080
 Well, yeah. This is like a weird blind spot for us because we don't track our create SST.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:32.480
 Yeah. So it'd only be off like just anecdotally seeing the support stuff and looking at people's

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:37.600
 projects. I think support-wise, we're seeing a lot of drop-in stuff. And I think, realistically,

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:42.960
 that is the future. We need to be as light as possible. Actual companies have actual projects

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:48.480
 already. Yeah, exactly. They need to be able to drop it in. It's not all green field projects.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:56.080
 Yeah. And especially the next version of SST will not be built on CDK. So that just opens up.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.720
 Oh, for real, that's actually happening. Oh, yeah, for sure.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.080
 Like, what does that look like? It's going to be Terraform? No.

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.480
 Or something? Like it? No? What?

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.840
 It's going to be Terraform. Are you doing your own thing? No, not doing your own thing.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.640
 No. What are you? What is it going to be? Do you not want to say right now?

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.200
 Well, I mean, I think there's only one. I've eliminated all the-

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.760
 Wait, you have Pulumi? Yeah.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:20.000
 For real. I don't know anything about the inner- I can. I mean,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.040
 that's the next thing I would have guessed. Okay, so we haven't made any firm decisions yet,

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:29.760
 but if I have to say where I'm leaning, it's definitely that way.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.240
 Yeah. Reason being, we've all heard of Pulumi, but no one's actually tried it.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.200
 I've never used it, right? If you've tried it, we've barely tried it.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.680
 And do you know why this is the case? Here's my theory.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.960
 Not enough dev rails.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.400
 No. Weirdly, that's just a problem. No, sorry, that's never the problem.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.400
 That's the opposite of what I mean.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.920
 Why is nobody tried it? Yeah, go ahead.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:53.120
 Because from the moment you try to use it,

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.240
 it feels like a paid product. Oh, interesting.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.520
 Every step of the way, you go to their set, you go to their docs,

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.760
 you run your first command, the CLI, they ask you to put it in your email and sign up and make a password.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:10.800
 Ah. So I think they have, I mean, they've been around from before CDK.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.000
 Yeah. They've been around for a long time.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.120
 Can I tell you why I don't use it? Why? I just don't like the name.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.840
 I really just don't like the name. That's it. That's funny.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.680
 So it does, can you just tell me enough about the inner workings?

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.640
 It's like Terraform and that they just make direct SDK calls, right?

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:30.400
 It's like, yes, it's like Terraform and that it can coordinate anything.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.320
 But it's like CDK and that it's like a programming language base.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.160
 You define this stuff using a programming language.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:41.760
 Yeah. Does it compile the types or to not compile, but does it turn into cloud formation?

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.880
 No, it doesn't. It doesn't. No. Interesting.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:48.240
 So we bypass the cloud formation, change that hell.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.320
 Yeah, exactly. So with my experience of using CDK,

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.440
 there were a whole set of issues that I bring up all the time.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:01.600
 There was a subset of those issues where I'm like, okay, this sucks.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.040
 But I also see why CDK did it this way.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.440
 Yeah. I was like, okay, I can be reasonable there.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.800
 Then I went and tried Pulumi and I was like, oh, never mind.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.880
 There was a good solution to literally all of these things.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:20.400
 It is such a good product. It is really insane. I mean, I think the level that I appreciate it

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.000
 is because I know some of these inner work that we're like, oh, yeah.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.120
 There were things that I perceived as really hard to solve that they solved elegantly.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.920
 There were things that I wish that someone would do it a certain way.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:36.160
 It turns out they did it that way. It allows for some really crazy things.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:41.600
 And this is a really stupid example, but this example demonstrates why it's like the

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.560
 best infrastructure is code tool. But before you give that example,

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.640
 yeah, we're going to take a break because I have to pee.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.080
 Oh, okay. Come right back.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.120
 Nice. And I just seem like a good cliffhanger.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.120
 That's a very good cliffhanger. Good job.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:21.920
 Okay. I'm very curious. Continue.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.240
 So here's a really stupid example.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:33.440
 Let's say you want to create an S3 bucket and then based off of the generated ARN,

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:39.360
 you want to create a Lambda function for each letter in the ARN function for each letter in the ARN.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:45.600
 Okay. So really obviously contrived, stupid example, but yeah, you could never do this

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:52.720
 in any of the traditional IAC solutions because all of them are built on this idea of you need

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:57.040
 to be able to synthesize a plan ahead of time and the plan is executed.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:02.080
 So in the CK cases, confirmation, but you can't know the plan ahead of time because

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:07.920
 that ARN might be generated by like during the process of, yep, of synthesis of actually deploying.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.320
 So then you've got custom resources and all this hell.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.440
 All this hell, exactly.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:11.440
 Yeah.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.280
 To like make up for the fact that you need to do something based off of what might happen.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:20.240
 But Pulumi's approach is like, we're going to give up the idea of a plan.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.200
 So the downside is so they still have the concept of a plan.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.000
 Can you roll back?

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.360
 Yeah, you can always fix things, but yeah, they sell the concept of a plan.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.800
 But if you're doing something like this, it's not going to be able to tell you exactly what's

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.240
 going to happen. It's going to only be able to tell you like as much as it knows.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.560
 But it effectively creates like this.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.080
 I mean, the technical term is a dag.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.160
 Like there's a graph of actions that need to happen and based off of an action,

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.440
 completing other actions happen.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.560
 And it can execute that whole thing.

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.240
 And at the end, you'll get the right results, but you don't know determinants.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.320
 I don't want to say deterministically, like you don't know.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.720
 Yeah, exact details of what's going to happen.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.240
 So there's all kinds of scenarios.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.120
 This unlocks, like deploy this.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.040
 If that ends up creating this other thing, then build your front end.

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.880
 And then once you've built your front end, analyze and metadata to figure out what routes

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.440
 you need to deploy and update your cloud front behavior.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.640
 You can do these really complex series of actions.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.960
 And it's really beautiful and elegant.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.680
 And it solves so like every single hack that we have, that fundamental problem,

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.240
 if you solve it, it gets rid of.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.320
 So I was really excited when I saw that.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.800
 This is, yeah, it's high praise.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.840
 I mean, like if anybody knows what would make IAC frameworks good, it would be you.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.360
 And I feel like that's like you being impressed by something.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.360
 That's, that's a good.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.360
 What's the word I'm looking for?

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:41.920
 No, hang on.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.080
 That's a good testimonial.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.520
 No signal signal.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:45.920
 Thank you.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.960
 That's the word.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.200
 It's a good signal, but it's funny because they don't need my signal.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.480
 Because who's a CTO of Pulumi?

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:54.960
 Do you know?

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.760
 I have no idea.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.400
 Co-founder of TypeScript.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.760
 So it's not.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:00.240
 What?

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.360
 It's not so, yeah, it's like, how do I not know this?

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.160
 I didn't know this.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.880
 So it's not surprising at all, right?

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.200
 Yeah.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.120
 So are they, are they doing well as a business?

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.320
 Because like you're not surprised.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:14.320
 Okay, so as a business, I think what they're doing makes sense for them,

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.400
 which is they are head-to-head focused on Terraform.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:23.280
 Any place in the world that's deciding on Terraform, they want to get in there

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.040
 and they want to be an alternative to Terraform.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:29.360
 So they are just in that world of DevOps people that like are really into

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.560
 infrastructure as code, people like big companies that like, you know,

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.840
 are making decisions around this thing.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.240
 But they're not in the business of bringing infrastructure to code to people

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.480
 that don't already know about it, right?

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.880
 They're like just trying to, Terraform established a market.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.360
 They're trying to now like fight with them for it.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.000
 That market share.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.320
 Yeah.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:46.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.320
 But the average person that's not already using infrastructure as code,

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.560
 they're never, they're not being marketed to by Pulumi.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.560
 They're, they're like, no, on a ramp for Pulumi.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.480
 You have to like already be an infrastructure as code person.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.720
 So that's where I'm like a little bit interested.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.360
 Cause I'm like, we definitely focus more on that kind of person,

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.280
 where we trick them into using infrastructure as code,

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.880
 because it promises other things.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.880
 But we think we can like take their stuff and hide it a little bit and like,

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.520
 kind of build on top of it and use it as a primitive and get to like a really

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.360
 high quality product.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.840
 So that's like, like right around in my head as a thing.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:23.760
 And I think realistically we'll support that as like part of what SSC is today.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.800
 So you can like have Pulumi stuff side by side, you're using stuff.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:27.280
 Okay.

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.280
 Yeah, and that'll enable us to do so many things.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.960
 Like we love working with other projects.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.880
 I love working with the Astro team and the remix team and all of that.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:39.520
 And this lets us now work with the planet skit with like a planet scale or with

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.320
 clerk or with whatever all these other managers services.

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.920
 We can coordinate that stuff as well.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.080
 So I was going to ask like the migration paths,

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.320
 because it sounded like this would be a huge lift.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:52.080
 If it's like a big rewrite to use Pulumi, but it's going to be like an incremental thing.

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.200
 Like yeah, it could be.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.200
 Like I said, we haven't even decided whether we're going to use Pulumi.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.760
 It's just my initial research has me pretty excited.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.640
 And yeah, so I think we don't know what that'll look like.

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.120
 Realistically, I think the simplest thing we can do is start to let you spin up

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.320
 non-AWS stuff and have all that be powered by Pulumi.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.720
 And then we can kind of take it from there.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.440
 There's lots of that simplified like the import stuff like importing existing resources.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.560
 Like that is so much easier.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:21.760
 So a migration path for our existing resources could could be done.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.200
 Yeah.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.560
 So it's a fantastic tool, just it has less downloads in CDK.

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.160
 Yeah, it's a shame.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.280
 It's like it definitely deserves more attention than it gets.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.960
 CDK definitely markets to people who aren't infrastructure as code people, right?

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.160
 Like they want to be like, this is your first experience with

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.920
 infrastructure as code.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.120
 Don't think stuff on AWS.

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.240
 Yeah, exactly.

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.080
 Yeah.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.000
 So it just, even myself, I had to bias against them for a while,

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.960
 just like for no reason.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.880
 Because it just seems, it just seems, I don't like the name.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.920
 I don't know.

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.000
 But I like the more now that I know it's a good product.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:56.960
 That's cool.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:01.360
 Yeah, I like, I looked at it and something about it felt so like not open source.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.160
 Like Terraform feels so much and ironically, it ended up being not true.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.320
 Terraform feels like such an open source primitive thing.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.280
 Yeah.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.120
 Until they like changed that, but.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:11.920
 Until they weren't.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.160
 Yeah.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.560
 Whereas Pulumi from the beginning, they're like,

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:20.160
 try to get you into there, like use our cloud service to store your state and like

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:20.960
 kind of all that stuff.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.680
 So yeah, it doesn't feel like you're using an open source thing.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.400
 And then later, you're optionally upgrading to their service.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:32.240
 So I think that that's a good positioning thing that I think prevents them from getting

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.280
 much, much bigger.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:33.920
 Interesting.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.720
 Well, I'm very excited to see all that shake out.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.080
 I just, I love SSC.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.560
 So if it gets better and faster and that can incorporate with outside services.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.840
 And it's so fast.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.520
 I can.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.320
 Pulumi is so fast.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:46.320
 Yeah.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:50.000
 I mean, you're getting rid of cloud formation like there you go.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.200
 Like that, I think that example, the bucket example I gave, I think I did.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.000
 I think I was doing.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.360
 Create one bucket and create another bucket for each letter in the ARN.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:49:59.600
 Yeah.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.680
 I think it deployed in like under 10 seconds or something.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.000
 It was something.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.400
 Cause SDK AWS SDK calls are fast for a lot of things.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:06.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.520
 They are.

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:07.600
 Yeah.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:10.400
 It's always amazing when you use like the CLI and you do something and you're like,

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.400
 wait a minute, did you do it?

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.040
 Or is that just like it started the process?

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.480
 And now it's going to take a lot.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:16.800
 Yeah.

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.840
 It's funny because some things in AWS are like,

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.040
 stupid, fast.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.320
 I can't think of an example right now, but like cloud front.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:24.800
 Yeah.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.680
 Disturbation.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.400
 Disturbation.

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:26.640
 Yeah.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.200
 No, that was a joke.

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.800
 The opposite of that.

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:35.200
 But like spending a new SQS Q or tearing one down.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:35.440
 Yeah.

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:36.880
 It's like less than a second or something.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:41.200
 But then other trivial things like updating an API route, an API gateway takes.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.560
 To forever.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.920
 Yeah.

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:44.560
 I did that thing.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.120
 That was fun.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:48.720
 Cause I did the thing where I said something with confidence and it kind of fooled you for a second.

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.520
 That was fun.

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.160
 I want to do that.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:50.320
 Yeah.

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:54.160
 Well, at first, I wasn't sure if you misunderstood me and your math.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.200
 Cloud front is fast.

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:55.440
 Yeah.

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.360
 I thought you were talking about the service being fast.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:57.760
 Yeah.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.560
 But like updating a cloud front is 30 minute validations.

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:00.880
 Yeah.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.520
 So I don't want to get to in the weeds here because people don't care.

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.560
 But I care.

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:08.400
 Cloud formation claims they're slow because they give you all this safety,

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.360
 this level of like, what's the word?

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.280
 A Tomonicity or something?

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:13.840
 I don't know.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.440
 Yeah.

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.840
 They give you this like ability to roll back safely.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:22.160
 You're saying in Pulumi, you don't lose the ability to roll back safely.

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:30.000
 So that claim has already been like, you can already be proved that it's not as intense as it

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.240
 seems because Terraform has been around forever and Terraform is bigger than CDT.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.040
 Yeah, that's true.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.040
 It might even be bigger than CloudFormation.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.360
 And they don't do all that.

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:39.680
 It's fine.

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:39.840
 Yeah.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:40.560
 Everyone's fine.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:40.960
 Okay.

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:45.040
 I think this stuff is more like, let's say you update an IM policy.

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.000
 IM is global.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:51.040
 So CloudFormation under the hood, they might ping every single region

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.560
 and wait for it to have replicated to every single region before they consider it done.

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.200
 Oh, I see.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.320
 So imagine they're pinging every single region.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:01.440
 They're only pinging once every 30 seconds and they're getting rid of it.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.080
 Yeah.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.240
 So this can might end up cascading into something really slow.

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:06.240
 Yeah.

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:10.400
 So yeah, I feel like it just doesn't matter for most people.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:14.800
 I don't know why they optimize for that level of consistency.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.400
 But and they can never change, right?

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.680
 CloudFormation is what it knows.

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.040
 It's never going to change.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:19.200
 Yeah.

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.560
 Suddenly twice as fast.

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:21.440
 Yeah, it's not going to happen.

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:26.400
 Unless they give you a toggle to be like you can deploy in fast mode or safe mode.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:26.720
 Mm.

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.200
 Yeah.

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.040
 And like do something wildly different.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:29.600
 Speed.

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.320
 Yeah.

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.760
 How did we just spend the whole time?

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:35.600
 We've been like talking for an hour about all this AWS stuff.

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.960
 That's not normal for us.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:37.760
 It's not normal.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.120
 But I mean, I guess it used to be.

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:39.200
 It used to be.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:39.760
 Yeah.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.880
 I see.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.240
 Well, talk.

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:42.480
 Okay.

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.440
 It's shifting topics.

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.960
 You're tweeting about there.

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.960
 You're going to try not being a jerk anymore on Twitter.

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:47.440
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:49.760
 Someone replied being like, hey,

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.520
 that's FM Adam hit different.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.720
 And I'm like, that is really funny.

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.640
 Oh, yeah, it was very different.

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:57.600
 I feel like my Twitter.

00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:02.800
 I've always sounded like a jerk in writing versus like,

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.520
 if you meet me in person, like I'm a Midwesterner.

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:09.040
 I'm pretty like low conflict.

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:09.440
 IQ.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.480
 I wasn't going to say IQ.

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.760
 But I'm not like an intimidating person.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.280
 I'm not like, I'm not a jerk.

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.000
 I'm really not.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.560
 But in writing, for some reason,

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:23.760
 I always kind of sound like a jerk.

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.040
 But I feel like over the last year,

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:28.640
 I've definitely turned into more of a jerk on the internet.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.360
 And I blame you.

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:29.840
 I really do.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:34.960
 I started, I started lower casing my tweets just like you.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.280
 I stopped using punctuation.

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.400
 I just looked like a jerk down.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:38.880
 Yeah.

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.720
 So I'm on reply being like, I don't know.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.280
 I thought Adam was nice, but I only have Dax to compare.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.520
 So you're nice by comparison.

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.920
 OK, here's the thing.

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:54.800
 I'm not absorbing us at all, but I got to be honest.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:54:00.640
 Like it is kind of hard to be public and like just constantly

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:04.560
 get the kind of replies that we get like every single day.

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:04.800
 Yeah.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.400
 It definitely has a long term impact to some degree.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:08.960
 It probably does.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.920
 And I feel like I care less about what people think

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:12.880
 than the average person.

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.320
 Yeah, even then it's just annoying.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.360
 But it's just annoying.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:18.880
 It just like annoys me how many people can have the same bad take.

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.480
 Not that they're, I don't know.

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.160
 They could say I have the bad take.

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.920
 But like so one and four.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.520
 It's not even the bad take.

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:30.400
 It's like a lot of times they, the thing that is annoying for me

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.360
 is they read the worst possible interpretation

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.360
 or the stupidest possible interpretation of what I said.

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.560
 And reply to that.

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:42.080
 And I'm just like, that's just as annoying.

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.920
 That's what makes me think that everyone's stupid.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.600
 Like anytime I see that, I'm like, you're an idiot.

00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.680
 But that's your way of perceiving the world.

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:50.000
 Like try to find a dumbest angle of what everyone's saying.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.840
 Like that's yeah, you know, over time that just impacts you to some degree.

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:57.360
 And I feel like I've dealt with it better at different times in my life.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:01.520
 You know, you know who doesn't get these kind of responses though?

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.080
 There's people who just post like JavaScript tips and stuff.

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:04.640
 That's not true.

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.440
 Should we just do that?

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:05.920
 That's not true.

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.760
 Is it because we're making claims?

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.360
 I'm going to stop making claims, I think.

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.880
 I think it just gets in people's, they get like really irritated

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:16.880
 when you make a claim of any kind, like that you know something.

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.600
 If you're like, I know a thing and you should know it too.

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.160
 People just get real pissed real fast.

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.000
 So should we stop doing that?

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:24.880
 You're not going to stop doing that.

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:25.520
 You're good at it.

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.760
 And you actually have good things to say.

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:28.560
 I'm probably going to stop.

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:33.280
 I mean, it's unfortunately, it's just the small minority ruining it for everyone else.

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.440
 Because let's say I post a tweet.

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.600
 Let's say he gets like 300 likes.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.320
 It probably will have like one or two annoying comments.

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.720
 That's one or two annoying people of 300 people that

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.720
 saw the purpose of it.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:45.680
 Oh, that's a good point.

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:48.240
 I didn't think about the actual likes, meaning anything.

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.280
 Yeah, that's a good point.

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:52.560
 So it's just a small group of annoying people.

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.640
 But how can everyone try to be less annoying?

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:55.360
 I mean, me too.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.640
 I need to be less annoying.

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.480
 I didn't, but I brought a tweet just the other day.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.920
 That I wasn't trying to be abrasive or anything.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:02.800
 I was literally, I was just stating what I feel is a fact.

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.400
 And the amount of people that think I was doing it for bait.

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:09.520
 I've never written a tweet to like bait people.

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:10.640
 I don't even know what that means.

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:14.560
 Why would I write a tweet to like make people angry?

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:15.520
 I don't do that.

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:18.640
 I write tweets that express what I think or feel.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:22.640
 And I generally think I'm right as one does.

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:26.720
 That doesn't mean I want you to get angry and reply to it.

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:27.280
 Like what is that?

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.160
 Why would I do that?

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.520
 I don't understand.

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.440
 I think people confuse the idea of something being provocative and making you think with

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.360
 something they kind of classify as bait, especially if they don't like it.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:40.560
 But you cannot agree, but it's still provocative.

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:41.200
 They cannot agree.

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:41.440
 Yeah.

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:46.080
 And I don't mind the debates when they're intelligent and not just like,

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:51.120
 well, you're just a shit fluency or whatever they want to call you.

00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:53.120
 Like you're just trying to farm that X money.

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.040
 Yeah, because we make a lot of money on X.

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.880
 Do we stop that narrative too?

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.760
 That's so funny.

00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.840
 Nobody's making a lot of money on X.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:00.720
 It's just so dumb.

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:05.040
 And less and less every time, every time my payments have gone down.

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:10.080
 Nobody is writing like engagement bait so they can get a check from Twitter.

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.040
 I promise you.

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:14.960
 Well, maybe like the people who have like 20 million followers, maybe they do.

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.880
 But I promise you, nobody here is able to buy their coffee with their X.

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.080
 Whatever.

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:20.560
 I know.

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:21.520
 Yeah, it just doesn't.

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:22.960
 It's nice.

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:27.600
 It's a nice little thing that shows up, but it really hasn't had zero impact on anything that I do.

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:28.080
 Exactly.

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.640
 If anything, if it had an impact, it's like gone.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.000
 I think it had an impact for like two weeks.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.920
 And then people were like, yeah, okay.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:40.720
 My favorite thing is I definitely love in terms of there are some annoying replies that it loves.

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.280
 I will say.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:41.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:42.560
 Yeah.

00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:51.040
 I love when someone explains something to me that is like my main area of expertise.

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.720
 Like if someone explains to me how like infrastructure is code worked,

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:59.520
 like that happens all the time, which I love because I'm just like, this is so good.

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.000
 Yeah.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.040
 Because like it's such an example of someone being so in the wrong and so indisputable.

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:05.440
 Yeah.

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.120
 And whenever I see this, I love that.

00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:07.520
 Okay.

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:07.760
 Yeah.

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.120
 You see what I have with other people too.

00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:09.760
 Yeah.

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:13.440
 When it's when I know how wrong they are, it is kind of fun.

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.080
 Yeah.

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:18.960
 Like the other day, I forgot who someone from the React team posted on Hacker News,

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.920
 like in a comment.

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:23.520
 And someone was like trying to explain how React worked to them.

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:24.880
 Yeah.

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.480
 And I was like, I love, I love when this happened.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.000
 It's like the best thing ever.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.560
 Because like that person, it doesn't matter what the details are.

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.800
 Like when they realize they just know they fucked up.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.680
 So yeah, I love those.

00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:39.440
 There's lots of those like people will screenshot when somebody like tries to

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.440
 explain something to like the creator of a thing.

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:48.400
 I may have read my DMs.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:48.960
 I'm sorry.

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.840
 I just, I started responding to a DM over podcast.

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:52.640
 What does this become?

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.920
 I need to become a, I need to get professional around here.

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.560
 This is a, I'm just getting sloppy.

00:58:58.560 --> 00:58:59.920
 I don't think it's about professionalism.

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:01.760
 I think we're all of our brains are just.

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.760
 They're writing distracted.

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.600
 In our ability to say focus.

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.480
 It's really true.

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.000
 But it's going to get better.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.040
 This podcast is about tomorrow and about how things are.

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:16.240
 We got, we got 30 more episodes until we hit 100.

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.920
 Then we give up.

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.920
 Will it be like my dual lingo streak?

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:21.440
 Did I tell you at 100 day streak?

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:21.920
 I stopped.

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:27.680
 So it's so you, you like just get to a place that is impressive.

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.080
 And then it just turns off over.

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.840
 Yeah, but not even impressive.

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:34.080
 Like people have like 1500 day streets on dual lingo.

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:37.760
 I get to a place that's like the first milestone you could possibly hit.

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.120
 And then I'm like, well, I did that thing.

00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:39.520
 Okay.

00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:42.480
 But here's the thing for most people, I think it's like,

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.880
 because it's not like you stopped three days in.

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.080
 You stopped 100 days.

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:46.640
 Oh sure.

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:49.360
 And it's kind of like for most people, it's like,

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:52.160
 well, if I put in all this work, I'm just going to keep continuing it.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.360
 But then you just, you just abandon.

00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.080
 You just don't care.

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:54.640
 I do.

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.440
 I just abandon.

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:56.560
 But you put in three months.

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:59.040
 You put in the average abandoner, but then you still abandon, you know.

00:59:59.040 --> 00:59:59.200
 Yeah.

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.520
 No, I do, I do things in three months stints.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.160
 It gets three months of my attention.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.880
 And then, but look, the podcast, we've been going for a year.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.760
 So this is not, this is not dying at 100 episodes.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.560
 That's true.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.360
 But what I was trying to say is we've got 30 more episodes to get,

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.800
 you know, good at this stuff.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.400
 Like professional.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.680
 So we have to be good by 100.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.680
 Yeah, we really need to do like some segments or something.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.600
 I had some ideas, we could just use chat GPT to get those ideas, right?

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.000
 I don't know.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.440
 I had some like, I thought of a segment.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:33.680
 What's more likely, like two different, like we have to come with some of these

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.200
 and we do them to each other, like which of these two events,

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:41.040
 and they can be totally off the wall and crazy and neither is going to ever happen

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.920
 or they can be realistic scenarios, but which is more likely to happen.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.720
 That'd be fun.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.280
 That's cool.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.240
 Where'd you get that idea from?

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.680
 Another podcast.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.400
 That's okay.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.840
 That was what I was asking was, is this a validated idea?

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.720
 And it sounds like it is.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.280
 Oh, yeah.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:53.760
 No, it is.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.760
 They've been doing it for years on this podcast.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.200
 It's not related to tech at all.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.720
 But that's a good one.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.920
 Yeah.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:05.680
 Have you tried the speech mode in chat GPT, the app on your phone?

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.320
 Yes.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.600
 It's so good.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.200
 I feel like I'm in the future.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.560
 Like the voice is so good.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.840
 And because like, chat GPT is so good at speaking, it's.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.480
 Yeah.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.280
 I really feel like like it felt magical.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.960
 I know we're getting there.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.280
 The AI stuff is more impressive all the time.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:27.600
 As far as like hype cycles go, this is the first thing that I feel like is actually transformative.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.040
 I mean, like people didn't call the mobile revolution a hype cycle, right?

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:34.160
 Like everybody switched to phones.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.600
 That wasn't a hype cycle, right?

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.520
 It didn't get puffed up too early.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.760
 Is it possible AI is just the next big thing?

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:43.120
 Well, I don't remember the phone thing.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:48.240
 I think the phone thing was funny because like nobody thought it was going to be big.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:51.040
 Like nobody thought it was going to be big and it's going to be bigger and bigger.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.680
 And I guess it was it before all these networks where no one was able to talk about it.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.960
 Yeah, maybe.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.160
 Maybe like it was hard to get a hype cycle going.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:00.640
 Yeah.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.160
 We had to put it in the newspaper.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.520
 Compact Prosarios.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:03.760
 Yeah.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.080
 Like Twitter didn't exist.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:08.800
 Yeah, no.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.480
 Well, there's something else that GPT, OpenAI did the combined GPT format.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.360
 Did you see that?

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.320
 Yeah, I mean using that.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.560
 Yeah, like it's got all of it built in.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:21.280
 You just like, you can just use the one thing.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.480
 Pretty cool.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:27.600
 One of my favorite things I like doing is like jailbreaking chat.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.240
 It's easy.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.480
 Like it's so fun when I like coerce it into doing something it doesn't it doesn't want to.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.360
 Like it's like find different angles to like trick it.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.240
 I've seen lots of these two examples on the internet.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.400
 That's so something you would do.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.240
 I keep trying to like give it pictures of me and Liz

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.360
 and asking it to do like funny things with them and it just refuses.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.720
 But you can always get around it.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.760
 You spend like five minutes.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.560
 You can do it.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.440
 You can always trick it.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.640
 Okay, fine.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.560
 Well, it's never like that.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.080
 It's always like it like realizes that it should be doing it.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.440
 It's always like it's always like, sorry, you can't do this.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.320
 Sorry, can't do this.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.600
 And it's like, oh, okay.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.600
 What once you break through?

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.240
 Yeah, of course.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:04.720
 Of course.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.480
 In that case.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:06.800
 Yeah.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.200
 Very excited to use the voice thing more.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.480
 I'm going to play with that more.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:16.320
 I usually try that prompt where you ask it to help you flesh out a story.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.600
 Don't give you any suggestions.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.360
 Just just help you like work through creating a plot and.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.240
 Oh, I've not heard of this.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.120
 I'll send you the problem.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.040
 So I mean, you go for walks.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.160
 So that's actually what they recommended.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.840
 They said turn on voice mode.

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.760
 Put it in your AirPods and then ask it to help you flesh out a story.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.360
 And you can just talk back and forth with it.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.720
 And then it'll like, you know, you'll do like this whole narrative with it.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:37.600
 And it's pretty fun.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.920
 That sounds entertaining.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.640
 Yeah.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.080
 Your video is off again.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.920
 So like, I can't see your facial expressions with your words.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.360
 Sounds like a problem.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.960
 It probably is a new problem.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.600
 What is a me problem is it's over an hour and I do need to get off here.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:53.920
 Yeah.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.400
 That made me sound like I'm the busy pretentious one.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.240
 I'm not any more busy than you.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.320
 So I think I think you're the approach of saying you need to pee whether or not.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.040
 It's true.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.000
 I think that's a good approach.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:04.320
 Oh, no, I don't.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.200
 That's incredible.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.440
 You're saying I should, yeah, oh, I got to pee again.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:07.840
 Yeah.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.360
 And people will know it's only 15 minutes and they'll like call my doctor.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.240
 I feel like I've seen you pee.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.720
 You need to pee twice within an hour at least.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:15.440
 Definitely happened.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.360
 If there's caffeine involved, like you reinvent.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.320
 Yeah, you would have seen that.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.760
 Okay.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.960
 All right.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:23.360
 All right.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.480
 It's been good.

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:24.800
 Thanks.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.360
 Thanks.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:25.680
 See you.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.800
 See you.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:42.480
