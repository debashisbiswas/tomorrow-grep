00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
 Is there like a criteria where you can only say engineer

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.560
 if you wear a hazmat suit at work or something?

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.880
 - What is the-- - What is the--

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.520
 - I'm just gonna buy you a hazmat suit.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.220
 - Oh, I would love it, please.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.800
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.240
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.440
 - It's one of those deals where credit card got swapped,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.560
 like new card details, and I forgot to fix it.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.480
 - Okay, have you seen that thing now where

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.480
 the details just get updated automatically?

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.000
 - No, what is this?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.400
 - I actually find this annoying.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.200
 So before if you changed your credit card numbers,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.320
 every single place that soared your credit card

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.960
 would just break, and they wouldn't be able

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.680
 to charge you again, and you have to go manually like

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.600
 re-opt into everything, which is annoying.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.960
 - Yeah, I think I've been through that twice,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.600
 I think in the last year, for like the Brex,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.800
 and then make Mercury swap out my card.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.840
 So yeah. - Yeah, and I lose my credit cards

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.640
 like so often, so I'm constantly dealing with this.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.600
 But one benefit was it was always a clean way

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.040
 to like do a reset, and like get rid of subscriptions

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.160
 automatically, and all that stuff.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.960
 But now there's a feature in like the payment protocol

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.240
 world where a credit card issue

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.120
 we can just push new card details.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.960
 - Interesting.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.320
 - And stuff just gets updated everywhere.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.160
 And a lot of times it's stuff that I don't,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.560
 that you have no control over it,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.120
 so people just get your new info

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.800
 and they can keep charging you.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.400
 - That's not cool. - And it's super annoying.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.240
 Yeah, I know.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.760
 - Feels like the payments people are in cahoots

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.120
 with the subscription people.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.880
 - Yeah, I think it's because the like failed charges

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 just have like a cascading set of like costs

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 through the whole system, but they're all really incentivized

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 to like, to make this all very smooth.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.840
 But now you just lost the ability to like yank your stuff

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.480
 from everywhere.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.320
 Kind of annoying.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.160
 - It isn't annoying.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.000
 I don't approve.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.840
 I don't know who's behind it.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.840
 - The world pay.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.080
 - What's world pay?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.480
 - Yeah, it's one of these companies that no one has,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.560
 like you never hear about, but they're like,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.840
 they're like, they process like a lot of the payments

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.160
 in the world and everyone integrates with them.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.320
 Like Stripe integrates with them to offer their services.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.800
 - I'm not a conspiracy theory guy.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.160
 Well, maybe I am, but that just sounds like the kind of thing

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.680
 people would get real conspiracy theory about.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.840
 Like it, with a name like world pay.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.680
 - Oh yeah.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.960
 - It just sounds like dark, I don't know,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.120
 underpinnings of everything.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.960
 - Giant company never, and I think there's only two companies

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.320
 in that category of them and someone else.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.440
 And yeah, it's almost crazy.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.880
 - Like if there's a company underneath Stripe

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.760
 and I've never heard of it, that's kind of wild.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.520
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.920
 We did an integration with them at my previous company.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.160
 And it was pretty crazy.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.680
 They gave us a manual with their protocol.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.240
 And of course, our protocol isn't like,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.760
 here's an HTTP API with like JSON payload.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.400
 It's like some binary format.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.480
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.320
 - Yeah.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.440
 - And we had just, we implemented it in Elixir.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.480
 And it was actually a lot of fun

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.840
 'cause it's a kind of work that, I don't know if,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.160
 you know how sometimes there's work that's tedious,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.800
 but simple and in a way, it can kind of be satisfying

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.160
 'cause you're just like mindlessly doing a task over.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
 - Yes, there's like a very known target.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.960
 Like you know exactly what you're doing

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.800
 and what your target is.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.640
 Yeah, I love that.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.480
 - Yeah, like sometimes you're like cleaning up a code base

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.560
 where you're just like changing everything

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.920
 in the exact same way.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.880
 And sometimes I like spending time doing that,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.240
 but even though it's a waste of time

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.080
 and like probably AI could just do all that stuff instantly

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.960
 for me, but it's almost like meditative.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.120
 - Yeah, Casey and I've talked about this a lot.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.800
 I actually love monotony.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.800
 Like I will take a task that she just gets so bored

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.400
 immediately and can't like stomach doing it.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.320
 And I will nerd out for like two hours doing it.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.000
 Like there was a time we were cleaning,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.080
 we were helping a friend like renovate a house

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.000
 and they had like paint on these windows.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.960
 And I just sit there and scrub that paint off

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.360
 for like hours and I loved every second of it.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.840
 Something about like super mind numbing tedious tasks

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.120
 I get off on, I don't know why.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.760
 - That's, I mean it's great to know someone like you then.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.200
 - Yeah, I feel like I've definitely used it in my career

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.920
 with software, like there's been things where

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.440
 I'll just brute force it, I don't care.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.480
 Like I'll just sit there and do the thing that,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.760
 like is the dumb way, but it takes forever.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.760
 And other people are like, there's gotta be a smarter way.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.740
 Nope, just do the dumb thing over and over and over.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.480
 - Yeah, yeah, that's good to know

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.800
 because you know for our secret project

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.600
 there's going to be some of that.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.680
 Are you looking forward to that part?

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.600
 - I actually am, I had that thought yesterday.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.920
 I was like, man, I hope I get to do the thing

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.160
 that you probably all don't want to do.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.420
 - I, I don't know how this doesn't give any,

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.160
 it's not giving any way, this is totally unrelated.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.640
 But, stat news, we spent like 40,000, I don't remember.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.880
 We spent a bunch of money sending out like 1000 swag boxes

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.840
 and we couldn't find a vendor, this was like eight years ago.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.520
 We couldn't find somebody that would make a good t-shirt,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.280
 a good hoodie, like an ice little card

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.440
 and put it in a nice box and send it to people for us.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.360
 So we ordered, yeah, altogether like a shrink wrap

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.040
 like perfect delivered package.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.000
 So we and stickers too, I think.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.680
 So we order all the individual components

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.600
 and I boxed a thousand swag boxes in my garage

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.720
 and sent them all over the place.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.240
 I did the ship station thing and I was just sending out like,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.160
 I'd have like 35 boxes on my porch every morning

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.040
 for the male guy to come get and it went on forever.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.440
 Eventually I think the last few hundred,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.440
 I had some people, like college people came over

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.840
 and I paid them to just like box them for me

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.960
 'cause I was so burnt out.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.600
 But I had my mom here, like we were all just in a garage

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.000
 pack and swag boxes and I loved every second of it.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.240
 - So Liz is very similar and I feel like

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.320
 'cause she loves like the tangible aspects

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.400
 of like getting work done.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.720
 And obviously, you know, being our age,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.560
 she's basically never had to do that for work.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.400
 Like her work has always been this abstract,

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.480
 digital thinking thing.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.560
 So I think like a great end state for her

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.320
 would actually be like running a physical business.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.320
 And I think that's like really where

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.800
 she like gets a lot of satisfaction from.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.040
 And I get it to like sometimes I see some

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.320
 like a well-run small business.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.440
 And I'm like, oh, there's just something.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.200
 So like you can just see it, you can like see it

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.920
 and feel it and touch it that we don't get to have as much.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.520
 - I'm telling you, after that experience of the swag boxes,

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.640
 I have forever wanted to have some kind of like small

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.120
 internet business where we ship stuff.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.440
 I want Casey to make stuff.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.560
 She's very artistic.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.720
 I've like tried to push her like, let's do anything.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.960
 I just wanted to do shipping parts.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.280
 Let me do the logistics.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.080
 I have so much fun with that for some reason.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.920
 It's so dumb and like there's probably ways to outsource it

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.880
 and not have to think about that stuff, but I loved it.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.720
 Something about it.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.480
 - Yeah, Liz's parents have a construction business

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.800
 and they mostly do kitchens.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.360
 And it's just so crazy.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.840
 'Cause one, their jobs have a start and an end.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.000
 And it's like clear.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.640
 It's like they get a job.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.280
 They do it and they can take a picture of the final thing.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.800
 And there's no question of like, are we done or not?

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.640
 Did it come out good or not?

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.080
 It's just so straightforward.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.080
 Which is very different from everything I've worked on,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.640
 'cause it's like infinite and involving forever.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.760
 And there's no beginning or end.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.680
 - Yeah, projects can end, but software is never done,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.520
 is it?

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.360
 You're just always...

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.840
 Casey and I talked about this yesterday on a walk.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.680
 - Oh really?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.440
 - There's something else I said like, oh, it's never done.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.320
 Like software, it's never done.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.480
 I can't remember what the other thing was, but yeah.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.680
 Yeah, our job is just kind of like, just chipping away.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.080
 It's like, you have to be okay with that for a decade.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.800
 Just like chip away on stuff that may never get to a point

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.200
 where you're happy with it or where it's considered complete.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.960
 - Yeah, and even things like movies

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.160
 that are like a very creative abstract expression,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.040
 those also are very, you're done with the movie.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.320
 It's done in a chip and it's never gonna change again.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.880
 - Yeah, do you ever wonder like the movie industry?

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.920
 So there are people who like producers who know

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.600
 exactly what it takes to like plan, budget.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.720
 And I know they do like, they have big budget overruns

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.760
 and time frame overruns, but like they generally know,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.840
 here's how you put together a team and you make a movie.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.240
 Do you ever wonder like, how much our process

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.360
 and software differs and like, are we just completely

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.320
 terrible at the like setting a budget and timeline

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.560
 and then building it compared to other industries?

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.560
 Like would they just laugh at us if they sat in the room

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.480
 while we did scrum meetings or whatever?

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.160
 Like, do you know what I'm getting at?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.560
 - Yeah, I think about this all the time.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.960
 And I think for whatever reason in the last year or so,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.840
 I've been obsessed with this exact concept.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.360
 'Cause I think me and Liz had some conversation

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.560
 where we were talking about how, you know,

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.560
 sometimes a good director just has a flop

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.660
 and it just feels like,

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.720
 purely the director's failure.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.880
 But then you think about how complex a making a movie is

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.680
 and it's, and then it feels impossible

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.840
 that there's even any good movies at all because like,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.360
 it's so complicated.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.000
 Like one day of filming is coordinating so many people

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.920
 and if one person messes something up,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.680
 it's like a crazy budget overrun, everything cascades,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.520
 one after the other.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.720
 - Or the weather, like they have a day where it's,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.520
 they can't shoot outside because yeah,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.680
 there's just so many factors.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.560
 - And if you're filming this specific location,

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.720
 like you have a fixed amount of time

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.120
 to get everything you need done.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.120
 And then, and then there's a whole like post process

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.760
 and the visual, it's like mind bogglingly complicated.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.520
 And then you realize how is there even,

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.680
 how do like movies even ever get done?

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.160
 It's insane.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.520
 And the other thing that's also kind of crazy is

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.320
 you, if you like look at directors

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.080
 that have like a breakout moment,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.120
 they'll usually go from making a small movie

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.360
 to being given like a hundred million dollar movie.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.840
 And I'm like, this is such a,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.120
 of course they have like a million people around them

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.440
 that have experience that are helping them,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.440
 but it's still really crazy to go from

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.080
 like have that many resources under you,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.640
 like pretty much overnight.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.400
 - Huge responsibility to like get it all right.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.880
 Yeah, if you've ever watched like,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.720
 watched the credits all the way through after a movie,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.280
 just the number of people involved in making one movie.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.680
 And there's tons of good movies.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.360
 Like it's not like a rare thing

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.840
 that there's a great movie that comes out.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.040
 So people are like moving this many people

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.880
 in the same direction and producing amazing works

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.800
 all the time.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.640
 And then you look at software

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.080
 and it kind of feels like we're a bunch of idiots.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.920
 I don't know.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.760
 - Yeah, I know we rarely produce anything good.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.600
 It's pretty rare.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.720
 - Yeah, there's like few really good like software

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.760
 that you can point at and be like that's a benchmark.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.920
 - Yeah.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.920
 - Before we get off the movie thing,

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.600
 I've got this amazing theater now where it's completely done.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.920
 We finally finishing touches.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.240
 It's all it's perfect.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.080
 It's amazing.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.260
 - I love "Ties Your Child" in it, yes.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.100
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.920
 We watched "Tress" a party.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.760
 That was a terrible idea.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.600
 But we watch like every Friday,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.720
 we have a movie night with the family

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.960
 and we're watching just like every Pixar movie or whatever.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.320
 We're going through all the kids movies.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.480
 And then when my wife and I watch something,

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.120
 she only likes stuff that's funny.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.720
 Like there's no good movies that are funny.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.560
 I don't know if you know that,

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.600
 but we're just constantly sitting through terrible comedies.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.840
 When I wake up early on a weekend,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.000
 I want to watch a movie that's actually good.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.760
 Sorry, sorry, Casey.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.400
 I don't want to watch something that's like,

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.880
 you know, like one of the greats or something.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.640
 And I don't know how to find those.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.840
 Is there like a list that I could just systematically work through?

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.760
 I don't want to waste time.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.640
 Like I have only so much time on this earth to watch movies.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.840
 And I want to make sure I'm like,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.000
 and even when Casey and I sit down,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.240
 we'd love to just have a curated list.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.880
 We're not spending 20 minutes looking for a good movie.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.960
 - Just, so I have spent so many, so many hours

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.840
 like working through this exact thing.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.120
 - I'm not even going to tell you what to do.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.280
 Just ask me, just literally just come and ask me

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.280
 like what you're in the mood for.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.040
 - I'm just going to say, what should I watch this weekend?

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.280
 Yeah, maybe go and tell me what I should watch this weekend.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.440
 - And I'll tell you.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.880
 Yeah, okay, so another thing you can--

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.280
 - No, I'm literally asking you right now.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.040
 - Oh, well, but do you have like any kind of like feeling

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.040
 or like, you know?

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.600
 - Yeah, I like, I mean generally,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.680
 I like like critically acclaimed, like epic movies.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.360
 I like kind of like thrillers.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.920
 So I think of movies like Inception, like thinkers

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.760
 where you're just like--

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.440
 - That's good, let's start with Inception.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.800
 Have you seen all of Christopher Nolan's movies?

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.360
 - I don't think so, I have them all.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.280
 I don't think that's, okay, just watch all Christopher,

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.400
 that's a way to filter, just go by the director.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.800
 - Just start with Inception and go like backwards

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.400
 and forwards like around.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.240
 - Okay.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.440
 - There, so Dunkirk, if you want to like a war movie,

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.280
 that's what that's--

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.680
 - I don't watch the war movie in a long time.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.800
 I used to love like same time.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.800
 - Dunkirk is amazing, and on your theater,

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.040
 it has like one of the best sound--

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.880
 - Ooh, okay.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.400
 - For good sound, that's like a fantastic movie.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.040
 I remember seeing it in theaters and like,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.920
 I can still like remember how the sound felt

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.000
 like physically in my body.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.400
 - That's awesome, okay.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.720
 So Dunkirk's my next movie.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.000
 I'll watch it this weekend maybe.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.560
 - I personally really, really like the prestige.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.920
 - Oh, I like the prestige, yeah, I've seen that.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.760
 - Have you seen it?

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.800
 Okay, so it's like, personally, like it's like my,

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.280
 like one of my favorites.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.120
 Just I just like--

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.080
 - I was gonna mix up with the other one.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.000
 - The illusionist.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 - The illusionist, yeah.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.040
 - Both those movies came out

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.320
 and like within a year of each other.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.360
 - Well, that's the same basic movie.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.640
 There's a very similar plot.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.840
 - Have you noticed this happens in Hollywood a lot?

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.360
 Like you'll see like two movies come out around the same time

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.360
 that are like almost about the exact same topic.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.200
 - Yeah, how's that happened?

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.320
 - And I always wonder what's a backstory.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.560
 I've seen this happen so many times

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.680
 that there must be some like,

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.520
 I wonder if it's something like,

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.400
 two studios were bidding on a script and one studio one

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.640
 and the other one was like,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.680
 no, we still need to make that type of movie

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.480
 and they just get like the B version of it, yeah.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.800
 (laughing)

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.640
 - That's awesome.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.280
 Everyone that got turned down and casting,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.800
 they're picking them up like the second best of everything.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.600
 - Yeah, I guess it's like maybe like a financial calculation

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.080
 where, okay, you know what it is?

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.600
 It might be that same weird thing where,

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.080
 have you noticed,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.920
 I mean, this might be a little bit more prevalent in cities

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.040
 where you'll see two like stores that do the same.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.000
 There were two restaurants that serve the exact same type

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.400
 of food all clustered in the same location

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.200
 and you're like, why is this a case?

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.040
 So when I lived in New York for a little bit,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.880
 I lived in Hell's Kitchen.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.720
 - Wait, what?

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.560
 What's Hell's Kitchen?

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.400
 - It's a neighborhood.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.240
 Sorry, it's a neighborhood in New York.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.560
 I guess that sounds crazy to someone.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.400
 - Okay, yeah.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.220
 - That hasn't heard that before.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.060
 Then Hell's Kitchen,

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:00.900
 which is just,

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:01.720
 I'm very don't want to go to New York.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.560
 - You lived in a restaurant?

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.400
 What is it?

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.720
 Is it a reality TV show?

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.880
 With like that one chef that gets mad, sorry.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.080
 - Wait, what is that?

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.920
 That is something like-

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.360
 - There is like a Hell's Kitchen, I think.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.440
 Isn't that like a TV show?

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.280
 Probably a stupid one?

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.600
 - It's something like that, yeah.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.600
 It's other Gordon Ramsay one.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.760
 I forgot what his show was called.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.960
 Anyway, a block away from me,

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.200
 there are literally three Thai restaurants

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.640
 like within like right next to each other.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.800
 And I was like, this makes no sense.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.960
 Like, why would you open up a sec,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.960
 like another competing Thai restaurant next to the first one?

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.480
 But there's this theory,

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.320
 I don't know if we talked about this before,

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.000
 but there's this theory that someone explains

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 where imagine a beach,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.440
 like a rectangular beach.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.280
 - Yeah.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.960
 - And you've probably heard of it before.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.800
 - No.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.640
 - Oh, you have it.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.480
 Okay, imagine a rectangular beach.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.360
 There's two ice cream vendors, okay?

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.200
 They need to place their carts somewhere on the beach.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.040
 Maybe a first day, one goes all the way to the left,

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.880
 one goes all the way to the right.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.720
 - Uh-huh.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.560
 - The guy on the left realizes,

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.280
 okay, if I move 10 feet to the right,

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.360
 I can like be closer to more people.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.840
 And like, if you just play this forward,

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.560
 they both end up right in the middle of the beach

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.560
 next to each other. - Right in the middle.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.720
 - Yeah, 'cause that's like the optimal place

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.320
 for everyone to be.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.840
 So I think this type of, not this literal effect,

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.200
 but that this type of thing shows up,

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.320
 I think in a lot of places where,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.840
 if there's already a movie that's being made of this topic,

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.000
 it's gonna be in the air and like you kind of benefit

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.200
 from having an adjacent movie,

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.880
 even if the same thing counter-intuitively.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.720
 - So I actually have a very related story,

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.800
 or just like the idea of retail site selection.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.360
 One of the first things I worked in my career worked on

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.640
 when I was freelance was this guy from Wharton,

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.120
 who was like just graduated Wharton,

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.240
 and one of his professors, this was like 2009.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.520
 So it was a long time ago.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.600
 His professor was like the statistics professor at Wharton,

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.560
 and he made this, it was like an auction based ML model,

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.000
 and we called it the black box.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.440
 But it was basically like,

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.200
 you put in a bunch of data and it makes predictions, right?

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.960
 Just, I mean, it's early days,

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.520
 ML maybe, I don't know what early days is,

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.720
 maybe it was in the '70s, who knows.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.240
 - Did you work on OpenAI?

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.320
 Is that what you read at the time?

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.840
 - No, that's how I'm going.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.440
 But his, they were taking it and trying to commercialize it

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.400
 with retail site selection.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.080
 So they had this crazy giant database of census data,

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.120
 and it wasn't just like all the census data,

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.840
 it was like forecasted some company,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.760
 like forecasted census data, even in the future.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.720
 And we would take, we actually had a working prototype.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.040
 I don't remember what happened at the end,

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.440
 like why it didn't take off.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.680
 But he had like early customers,

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.560
 they were basically like, it was like crunch fitness,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.320
 was trying to figure out where do we put gyms?

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.440
 Can we take all the data about the population in an area

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.320
 and decide if we're gonna plop a new location down,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.640
 where should that be?

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.200
 And it found some really interesting stuff,

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.400
 like places where there was a high demographic

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.720
 or a high number of firemen were like good locations based on,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.520
 'cause they had like 100 locations all over the US,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.800
 and they could take the data from those,

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.280
 sales data and kind of figure out like what's driving more sales.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.320
 Anyway, I could not talk about that

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.040
 after you just said something about like choosing a look.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.120
 - Yeah, that's exactly the same thing.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.000
 Your example of firemen is funny,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.680
 'cause I think that's actually the opposite

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.080
 because the endless always talk about this.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.920
 - Yeah, we always talk about this,

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.800
 'cause we walk around our neighborhood,

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.200
 we walk by the firehouse a lot,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.080
 and we look in there and both of us like just acknowledge that,

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.560
 if you're a man that, when you look in there,

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.400
 you're just like, that is the life I want.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.680
 It's just a bunch of guys that are all friends.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.520
 - This is working out.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.320
 - And then they're just like working out with music

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.320
 and there's like big giant space that has like no limits.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.160
 And it's just like--

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.480
 - Yeah, that's kind of the life.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.440
 - Like the ideal male fantasy is to be a fireman.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.200
 So they don't need to crunch fitness,

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.280
 they have something infinitely better.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.280
 - No, yeah, they've got the gym,

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.640
 and that's a great point, you know, gym insight.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.120
 Maybe that's why the company didn't take off,

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.400
 we had bad assumptions.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.560
 - Yeah, it's funny, 'cause probably around the same time,

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.120
 so I spent a little bit of time in ad tech,

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.360
 not a little bit, like maybe two or three years in ad tech,

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:59.360
 and this was in the mid 2010, so 2013, 14, 15,

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.120
 something like that.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.160
 - Yeah, I needed someone to blame,

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.280
 so we'll talk about that in a little bit,

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.480
 I'm glad to know it's your fault.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.760
 - Yeah, so this was a crazy era,

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.440
 because this was when data started to explode,

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.680
 like we all had mobile phones,

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.640
 we're all doing a lot more stuff on the internet,

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.400
 and there was like no boundaries on any of this stuff,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.600
 like nobody was thinking about any of this stuff.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.880
 So there was a company that shared,

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.640
 I think they were in the floor above us,

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.920
 and they were working on these beacons,

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.160
 basically, that they would put all over New York City,

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.320
 like in other in stores,

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.940
 and people's phones are constantly searching

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.920
 for Wi-Fi networks,

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.360
 and when they search for a Wi-Fi network,

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.240
 you can pick that up and you can get their MAC address.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.640
 So you can literally track--

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.640
 - Oh my word.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.480
 - Like where people are consistently moving,

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.520
 and it's like an incredibly,

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.920
 it's an incredible data set,

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.800
 'cause you basically understand movements in a city,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.640
 and there's like so much,

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.000
 so many interesting things you can do with that.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.840
 And obviously, they were like,

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.080
 the most interesting thing we can do with this

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.680
 is like something with ads,

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.600
 or something like stupid like that.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.680
 - Yeah.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.960
 - But then I remember like a couple years later,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.160
 when I was like not involved,

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.200
 like I wasn't anywhere near this company,

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.400
 Apple announced that they were gonna randomize a MAC address

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.880
 every time it made a request.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.880
 - Oh.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.440
 - And I think to most people it was just like,

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.480
 what the fuck, like what a random ass feature,

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.800
 but there's just completely killed--

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.800
 - Destroyed that industry?

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.560
 - That entire industry.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.920
 And then like a year or two after that,

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.840
 I was in this, I was part of this angel group,

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.560
 and someone was pitching their startup,

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.040
 and they had this really cool visual,

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.880
 and it was meant to,

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.840
 so they were trying to sell the security system type thing

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.240
 to like big campuses,

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.480
 like big office campuses or universities and things like that.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.680
 So if you need to evacuate people in some kind of situation,

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.080
 you get a live visual of where everyone is,

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.200
 using the same system.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.440
 And I was like,

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.600
 I asked him about the MAC address situation,

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.800
 and he like refused to give a straightforward answer,

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.840
 'cause I knew it just could not work.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.480
 Like I knew the excessive detail why it didn't work.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.400
 And none of the other angel investors were technical,

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.600
 so they just thought I was being annoying.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.920
 And I did not go in on investment,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.640
 and I don't think that company worked out either,

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.960
 but yeah, this MAC address thing's just simple fix,

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.840
 but it blocks all of that.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.880
 - Yeah, Apple's kind of been on the forefront

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.640
 of like screwing the ad agencies for a while, right?

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.800
 They did the other thing

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.360
 where you have to explicitly like opt in to being tracked.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.200
 What was that?

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.720
 - Yeah, that was more recent.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.800
 - Okay, so with all this stuff,

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.680
 there's always like how far should you go

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.800
 with protecting the consumer in this way,

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.160
 and how much of it is actually kind of like

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.480
 just redirecting the money somewhere else?

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.480
 - Yeah, I am, I don't like a lot of that stuff,

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.720
 but that thing that they did where like apps like Instagram

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.280
 couldn't, they had like much lower fidelity tracking

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.040
 after that change, it like broke a lot of small businesses.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.400
 Because that was, that mechanism of being able

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.640
 to hyper target people on Instagram

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.440
 just lowered customer acquisition costs

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.720
 for like so many small businesses selling things.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.000
 And I just remember that year,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.160
 like so many companies were posting like,

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.240
 we're going to go out of business,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.880
 like we have no way to our customers now,

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.480
 like it just kind of broke that space.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:18.480
 So it's like, it's not a net bad thing.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.480
 And ads on Instagram, like I don't use Instagram,

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.400
 but like when I go check it out occasionally,

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.920
 they're so good.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.520
 I'm like these ads are content.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.600
 Like I would just have an app that just showed me

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.880
 the ads and nothing else.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.200
 'Cause they do a good job.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.240
 Casey jokes that like when they talked about

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.720
 that Instagram got busted for like listening to your mic

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.560
 when it wasn't supposed to or something,

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.800
 like she'll pick up her phone and just say like,

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.200
 man, I wish I had a good whatever.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.360
 'Cause she wants the ads to be targeted to her.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.200
 Like she's trying to find things and like the Instagram ads

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.560
 is the best way for her to find the product

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.640
 she's looking for.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.840
 So she was just like, speak around her phone.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.880
 But there is some truth to that.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.000
 Like ads as a consumer aren't all bad.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.160
 Like sometimes it's nice to just be like served,

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.760
 think maybe not if you're impulse buying it,

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.600
 but like you're looking for a thing.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.200
 And sometimes ads help direct you in the right direction

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.520
 towards the thing that you want.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.360
 - Yeah.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.400
 - The ad industry is a hot mess.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.240
 - Right.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.080
 - Like the tech side of it.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:17.920
 - Terrible.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.560
 - As a person involved with a consumer facing website

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.880
 that makes most of our money off ads.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.280
 I cannot get over.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.640
 Like who works at these plate?

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.680
 Well, apparently you work there.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.680
 Who is writing the code that like a thousand network requests

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.880
 immediately, like you drop this little thing

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.760
 an embed like an iframe to put this ad

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.120
 and this ad networks gonna sell whatever slots on this thing.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.280
 I cannot get over the network activity.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.920
 They made a JavaScript running in the browser.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.280
 How much it all just breaks?

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.160
 Like those JavaScript snippets are just crashing constantly

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.520
 and then they're breaking our page.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.600
 I mean, there's just so many things about that picture

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.560
 that I can't figure out, is it a bunch of like 12 year olds?

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.680
 Who works at these ad agencies?

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.600
 And I'm sorry if I just defended you if you work there.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.800
 But like, why?

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.960
 Why do you have to do all that?

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.920
 Why are there so many network requests?

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.880
 Why is there so much JavaScript?

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.560
 - I think that space is really weird because,

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.760
 so the reason I left was at some point,

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.600
 I mean, I was also young,

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.920
 so I should have just been watching industries anyway.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.680
 But more specifically,

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.880
 if you take a step back,

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.080
 there's basically two parties in the whole thing.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.600
 There's someone with ad space

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.320
 and someone with something to show in the ad space.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.600
 And there are like a hundred middlemen

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.800
 in between like doing every little step of that process.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.640
 - Yes.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.600
 - And it's such like a broken, terrible industry

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.080
 because most of those companies suck and shouldn't exist.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.360
 There's just like a weird history

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.160
 that created all this fragmentation.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.720
 And I think that's a lot that's probably gone away

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.560
 because for non-web stuff, like for app stuff,

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.600
 a few companies just kind of entirely won.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.760
 But on the web, yeah, there's still this huge cluster

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.880
 of little companies.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.360
 So you have like terrible stuff like you're describing.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.080
 But in other ways,

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.520
 there's also some of the craziest,

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.280
 highest performance things you'll ever see

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.280
 because those are real-time bidding slots.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.960
 So when an ad slot becomes available,

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.600
 there's like this process to like have

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.760
 a bunch of companies bid for that spot in real time

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.840
 and play something later.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.680
 - And drop it on the page in real time.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.840
 - So like on the back end, there's some like crazy

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.680
 performance work that's done to like make all that possible.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.680
 So when you partner with a company,

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.280
 you have requirements that they need to respond

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.360
 in X amount of latency.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.760
 So then if you have, if you're one of those companies

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.080
 and you have a data provider,

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.640
 the data provider needs to respond faster than that

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.640
 so you can make a decision.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.720
 - Yeah.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.080
 - But I think it's just one of these things where

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.120
 the front-end side of things like

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.480
 just nobody tried or like cared about that side

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.360
 because they just didn't think,

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.600
 they didn't really understand that it mattered as much.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.880
 - Yeah, it's terrible though.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.200
 I'm surprised it hasn't gotten better.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.000
 - Yeah, why don't people on the front-end try?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.400
 Maybe if you're a front-end developer, maybe try more,

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.560
 try harder, try harder, try stuff.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.640
 Maybe just anything else.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.240
 Front-end sucks, sorry.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.080
 - It's like, yeah.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.720
 They put all the work to make everything

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.880
 so performer and efficient and the last step,

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.840
 they just kind of undo all of it.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.880
 - Yeah, all of it, yeah.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.720
 Yeah, I hate it.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.640
 - Yeah, it's by this thought, the other end you were saying

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.560
 talking earlier about how do people

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.360
 in other industries like laugh at ours?

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.960
 And this thought occurred to me the other day

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.240
 where I was like, you know, I've been in software for a while.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.280
 I got into it just on my own

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.080
 without like really needing anything

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.040
 besides like the urge to get into it.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.040
 And I realized I could be doing something

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.360
 very different in the next 10 years.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.200
 Like when I'm done with the phase

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.280
 of what I'm currently working on,

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.120
 I still have like 25 years of career or so left.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.440
 And I'm thinking I might actually do something very different,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.680
 not like very, very different.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.080
 Like I'm not gonna go become a piano player, but.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.920
 - Or have a ranch.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.760
 That's what everybody says.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.120
 We're gonna become a farmer or something.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.920
 - No, yeah, no, no, no.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.600
 I'm definitely still gonna do stuff in tech,

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.160
 but I think I really wanna go into something that's harder.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.200
 'Cause I genuinely believe that software's easy

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.480
 compared to a lot of the stuff.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.400
 And I think it's a great place to learn a lot of good principles

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.680
 that carry over to everything.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.160
 But I'm thinking like the next phase of whatever I do,

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.560
 it might actually be very different from writing software.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.440
 I don't know where it's gonna be,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.200
 but I wanna like try to do something

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.320
 that's more in the physical world,

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.440
 like more difficult.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.920
 - It is interesting.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.800
 Like I've just always had this assumption

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.920
 that I would not do this until I'm 65.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.880
 Like something about, I don't know if it's the industry,

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.760
 if it's software development.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.920
 It's hard for me to look at like our parents' generation

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.600
 and how they had a typical like work 35 years and then retire.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.080
 It's hard to imagine that scenario in my career.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.320
 I don't know what it is about it,

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.320
 but I'm with you, like I've constantly had the feeling

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.120
 that this is a limited run

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.040
 and then there's some next thing in life.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.240
 I don't know what that is.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.080
 - Yeah.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.280
 - But yeah, you see it kind of play out

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.480
 with a lot of software developers.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.920
 Like they become, they kind of climb to like senior

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.240
 or whatever, I don't know, big companies call it,

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.520
 staff engineers, whatever.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.360
 - Yeah.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.520
 - And then they like get into other stuff.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.360
 They're speaking, they're like,

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.520
 the content creation draw is real.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.280
 Like the pipeline of junior developer to senior developer

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.600
 to has a mic anchored to his desk is like a thing.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.360
 And I feel like there's a reason for that.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.360
 I don't know exactly what the mechanism is, but.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.960
 - No, yeah, I'm thinking like,

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.840
 I think what's good is what the skills you have,

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.760
 you can go into in a lot of different directions.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.720
 Like I can see myself like getting into manufacturing

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.040
 and like thinking about, like an understanding

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.200
 like what are the big problems in manufacturing

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.160
 that are not solved.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.920
 You can see how it's like very related to software.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.600
 It's all about automation and stuff like that.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.640
 But yeah, as obvious as it is,

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.120
 so I wasn't thinking like you,

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.080
 I wasn't thinking like, oh, I'm gonna be just doing

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:02.920
 something different.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.880
 I just thought, yeah, I'm gonna be writing software

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.320
 for a very long time, but something unblocked in my head

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.000
 and as simple as it is, I'm like, oh yeah,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.280
 I can learn something new.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.480
 Like, why can't I become as good in manufacturing

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.440
 as I am in software?

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.480
 Like nothing, there's really no difference.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.960
 And yeah, I think that sounds like really appealing to me.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.800
 - I mean, I love learning new things.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.160
 I feel like that's why I fell in love with software development

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.760
 is just all the learning you get to do as part of this career.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.960
 And I feel like I'm always chasing that high

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.240
 of like learning a new thing.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.120
 So I could definitely see that turning into

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.760
 a different profession, even by accident.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.400
 - Did your dad, your dad was a software developer?

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.000
 Did he retire as a software developer?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.280
 Like he did the whole thing?

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.720
 - Sort of, and I guess, but also no.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.000
 And I guess this is, I guess to some degree,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.480
 I've understood this for a while because I've seen him.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.240
 So he was, he started out, he went to school

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.920
 for electrical engineering actually.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.000
 - I wanted to do that, by the way.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.400
 I wanted to be like, I wanted to work at Intel

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.460
 and wear the hazmat suits.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.300
 That was my goal.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.140
 That's all I knew.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.880
 I was like, those guys look so badass.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.440
 I just want to be in that suit, walking around,

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.440
 and whatever they would in town.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.280
 - You know what's crazy?

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.040
 There's a massive shortage of people

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.160
 that know how to do that.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.000
 - Really?

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.680
 - And because chip manufacturing has continued

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.400
 and become super important.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.800
 There's a lot of opportunity in that field.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.640
 But you can go back.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.240
 - That'd be super cool actually to work at Apple

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.480
 and like work on the M chips.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.840
 I mean, I'm trying to like go from

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.240
 writes terrible JavaScript on the front end

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.280
 to knows something about chip architecture in the manufacturing.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.880
 - Yeah, I don't know if I can jump in

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.320
 at this point in my career, but that does sound super fun.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.320
 Like if you could just transport into a different career.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.160
 - Yeah.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.560
 So he was an electrical engineer.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.520
 And I think, I remember him telling me the story

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.880
 and maybe I might butcher it,

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.360
 but he was saying that he was getting a,

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.560
 so he worked for a newspaper in India.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.480
 And he used to work on, you know those like billboards

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.280
 that change like the flip ones where they like

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.440
 the new billboards?

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.160
 So he was like, build those or like work on those.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.800
 And he was trying to lunch.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.440
 And one of his friends just showed up on a motorcycle

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.240
 'cause everyone in India took a motorcycle.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.360
 And he was like get on, there's like some company

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.720
 from America is like hiring software engineers

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.080
 like come let's like get a job.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.000
 It's just like so like random and flip man.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.840
 - Yeah.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.360
 - And my dad did a lot of software

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.760
 as part of like at least firmware programming

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.200
 as part of his electrical engineering degree.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.760
 And he actually liked that stuff a lot more

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.200
 than the rest of it.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.280
 So he just like jumped on and then they went

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.240
 and he got this job writing software.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.000
 And so he became a software engineer.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.200
 And this was this crazy arrow where to write software

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.280
 you had, you can only write the software in DOS

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.320
 and you had this giant manual that like told you

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.320
 how to write it for like Windows.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.600
 You write the software in DOS

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.800
 then you would like reboot into the,

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.720
 into like the whatever version of Windows was

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.720
 and then test your software.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.200
 If it didn't work, you have to like reboot back

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.280
 and then it was a crazy cycle.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.720
 So you're like really read the book

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.440
 to make sure you're getting everything right.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.600
 But he did that for years and progressed all the way

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.280
 into like what modern software looks like.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:10.600
 But around 2007, he joined a hedge fund.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.720
 - Oh, right.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.560
 - Yeah.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.800
 So he was, you know, led a lot of the software work.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.720
 They're all the data engineering work there.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.720
 But became very good and like understood

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.800
 the financial side a lot more and the trading side a lot more.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.640
 - Yeah.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.240
 - And got super into that.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.760
 He's retired, he like retired from that job now

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.160
 and he works for himself now,

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.820
 but not as a software engineer really,

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.920
 he now works as a trader.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.920
 He like trades his own money

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.000
 and he obviously uses software engineering to

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:39.840
 - Yeah.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.680
 - Automate a lot of that.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.520
 But he got good at two things.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.000
 And I think that's critical to have like a very special career.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.200
 Like you need to get good at two things.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.760
 - Two things, interesting.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.280
 - And I like JavaScript and TypeScript to that account

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.320
 or I'm not going to do the other one.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.880
 - Yeah, first get a good at one thing.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.080
 And if you can somehow pull that off

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.480
 then you got to get good at a second thing.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.480
 But once you get to the second thing,

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.640
 I think you're done.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.480
 - Yeah.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.320
 Okay.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.160
 - Just got to get two.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.000
 - Yeah.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.200
 So he did switch, but you know,

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.920
 it's kind of similar what I'm talking about.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.480
 Like there was a pathway to going to the next thing

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.440
 'cause he could use his expertise

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.440
 and the thing he knew to like get work in that field

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.320
 and then become an expert in that field.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.920
 So I think there's pathways to do that.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.080
 And for whatever reason, I wasn't considering it.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.080
 Like in software, just taking our skills

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.040
 and applying them to basically any industry

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.720
 'cause they all have software problems.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.020
 Like you could really like hard pivot

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:34.880
 into something different,

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.360
 but take all your skills with you.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.920
 Like I'm going to run an e-commerce business

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.680
 and I know how to use technology

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.680
 to make that better or whatever.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.520
 - Yeah.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.360
 Yeah.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.720
 And even like Liz's parents business,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.520
 they spend a lot of their energy

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.800
 on things that are solved problems.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:54.160
 But it's not something that they can really adopt

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.880
 or like learn or change or workflows.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.720
 And it just doesn't make sense.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.120
 But if we like took over that business,

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.320
 you know, we'd run it very differently.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.920
 And yeah, stuff like that,

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.360
 again, when it's in the physical world,

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.680
 like it's not, especially with all this like question mark

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.400
 around what is the future of software with AI.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.320
 Building a kitchen.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.240
 That's, I don't see anything

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.800
 that's going to help with that anytime soon.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.200
 - It's going to be a bit before,

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.120
 yeah, before the robots are doing that, yeah.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.440
 - Right.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.080
 So I think that's also got me like thinking

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.400
 a little bit more broadly.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.200
 Yeah, it's weird.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.040
 I feel like my whole life,

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.800
 I've just been very conservative.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.920
 And over time, I've just been open to crazier

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.760
 and crazier paths.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.240
 And I've kind of learned to like do that.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.560
 - Embrace the chaos.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.600
 That reminds me of a tweet that's very related

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.880
 that you tweeted 18 hours ago.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.320
 It says, don't worry.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.520
 AI is not going to take your job coding.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.360
 Do worry.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.280
 It'll probably kill the business you work for first.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.720
 If you didn't predict or think about this,

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.920
 figure out why and fix it.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.240
 It's what will save you.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.360
 See, I hate when you do a cryptic tweet like this,

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.600
 where you have to have like IQ 1000

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.800
 to understand the last line.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.160
 In the last line, something ominous.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.000
 Like it will save you.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.200
 And I'm like, what will save you?

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.320
 I don't know how to save me.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.320
 I got to save you.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.080
 Could you please explain so I can save myself?

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.440
 - I have, I had this observation

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.080
 and I struggled to put it into a tweet

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.480
 that really expressed it.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.120
 So I went with something that like kind of captured it,

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.160
 but it was a little bit more up and ended.

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:24.680
 The observation I had is for years,

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.440
 I've always been annoyed with engineers

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.040
 because they focus just on like the code

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.240
 and they like are so uninterested

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.560
 in everything else around that.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.200
 Like even the next thing over like product or design

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.960
 and like forget about like business or everything else.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.960
 So I've always wanted people to like expand

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.800
 how they see their role,

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.560
 but there's like no, my role is code.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.640
 So of course when AI comes out,

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.640
 if you take that mindset and you see AI,

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.360
 you're just like, oh my God,

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:53.920
 they're gonna like make AI that writes code for me.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.320
 Like that writes a code I'd be writing

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.920
 and like that's where they focus their fears.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.880
 But to me, that's a wrong way to focus on it.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.680
 Cause when I like play some of this AI stuff out,

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:07.120
 I mostly see it eliminating a whole category of businesses

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:11.240
 that we assume makes sense and will continually exist.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.080
 And that I feel,

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.680
 I can see that happening before like it like doesn't matter

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.440
 that it could write the code for you

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.240
 if the code doesn't even have to be written anymore.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.080
 - Yeah.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.880
 - So what I find interesting is engineers are,

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.840
 a lot of engineers are not seeing that dynamic.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.720
 And the fact that they're not seeing that dynamic

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.640
 just overexposes them to this problem

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.720
 because if they thought more broadly

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.120
 and they're able to think about more things

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.600
 besides just the code,

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.280
 they have all these opportunities that they can,

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.600
 they could jump onto that like avoids AI

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.680
 at kind of limiting their opportunities.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.140
 So this is like weird like circular thing

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.200
 and it's like hard to articulate,

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.640
 but yeah, just obsession over code.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.440
 If you're obsessed with code,

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.920
 you just think the end state of AI

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.200
 is that it's going to be writing code

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.220
 as opposed to really it's going to figure out a way

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.520
 to like not have to write most of the code.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.240
 That's kind of how I see you playing out.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.560
 - Is this why you're going to move to something else?

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.240
 Are you afraid of AI changing the landscape of business

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.640
 so much that you'd rather get into something more physical?

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.480
 - Yeah.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.400
 I mean, if I place a forward and of course,

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.120
 playing a prediction game like this is hard.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.920
 I don't know if you saw my longer thread I wrote on,

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.400
 like I gave the example with open table.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.800
 - Oh yeah, yeah, I saw that one.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.640
 - Yeah, so I was trying to like place some of this stuff forward.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.320
 And when I do,

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.800
 I mostly don't see the need for a lot of like,

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.080
 so if you take for granted,

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.160
 okay, AI's going to get better.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.120
 Let's say it gets like, not like crazy better,

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.480
 but like much better.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.560
 - Yeah.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.880
 - I see a whole category of like B2B sat

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.600
 and like SaaS in general, like not really being needed anymore.

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.200
 - The traditional like spreadsheet replacement apps.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.120
 - Yeah, just like all these like things

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.320
 that were basically approximating what AI can do perfectly.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.160
 - Yeah.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.040
 - I see those going away.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.560
 I've already, even before all this,

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.600
 I've already felt kind of pessimistic about the SaaS category

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.600
 'cause I think a lot of it really was just running

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.840
 on top of like traditional like enterprise sales efforts

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.160
 versus like genuinely useful product.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.360
 Plus like, I think like the whole like self hosting thing

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.960
 is also chipping away at like hosted SaaS and all of that.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.360
 So I've already felt negative about SaaS

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.160
 and then now I see AI and I'm like,

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.240
 okay, that like accelerates is even more.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.080
 - Yeah.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:27.880
 - So yeah, I don't know if the SaaS industry

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.960
 is going to be the same as what it was

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.160
 or if it even makes sense for that.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.280
 And if a lot of the jobs and opportunity came from working

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.520
 for those types of companies, yeah, like I don't,

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.360
 I don't like, I don't feel excited about investing more

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.880
 in that SaaS category. - And to be the SaaS category.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.000
 - Yeah, so if I'm at a point where I'm like thinking

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.960
 about investing in something else,

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.720
 yeah, I just realized I could think really broadly.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.120
 Like it doesn't have to really be so narrow of just software.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.360
 - Am I a software engineer?

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.080
 We've said that word a few times now.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.720
 And I know there's some debate about what it is

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.320
 to be an engineer specifically.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.280
 You've watched me code.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.640
 Am I an engineer?

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.480
 'Cause I use that word,

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.120
 I think I use it a lot because it sounds a smartest.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.440
 Like I'm an engineer, just sounds way better

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.120
 than I'm a web developer.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.400
 - Would you say I'm an engineer if you were talking

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.160
 to people that like build buildings?

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:22.360
 Or would you call yourself a developer?

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.160
 - Well, I would say software engineer,

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.480
 'cause it's different.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.600
 (laughing)

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.800
 But is there like a criteria where you can only say engineer

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.680
 if you wear a hazmat suit at work or something?

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.000
 - What is the-- - What is the--

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.640
 - I'm just gonna buy you a hazmat suit.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.320
 - Oh, I would love it, please.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.520
 - Do you view like software developer,

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.200
 software engineer, software, what else?

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.120
 Architect, I don't know.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.880
 There's all kinds of words people use.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.200
 And I guess they are different roles.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.360
 I haven't only worked in startups,

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.000
 I'm so dumb about this stuff.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.440
 Do you think engineers like a prestigious title

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.240
 that you should only use if you like went to school

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.240
 or something, I don't know?

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.640
 - Here's what I feel.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.120
 Like I get why there's a question about this word,

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.600
 but to me, there are certain principles and ideas

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.160
 and like skills, like meta skills that you learn

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.000
 by being an engineer.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.240
 They're important to being an engineer.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.560
 Like the way you sell problems,

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.920
 like understanding things like avoiding,

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.080
 like having good judgment around avoiding complexity,

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.080
 like finding really simple solutions to problems

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.400
 and like what type of solutions are brittle,

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.360
 what types of solutions work well.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.600
 All those meta skills you can definitely learn

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.800
 from just working on software all day.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.800
 So yeah, I get why we call them software engineers.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.800
 I also get why, you know, people that work on things

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:39.760
 that need to be way more precise or like find it weird

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.760
 that we call ourselves software engineers.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.360
 Yeah, if you watch me on Twitch

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.120
 and you're like, you work on satellite software or something,

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.600
 you're like, yeah, you're not an engineer, sir.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.440
 I'm sorry.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.240
 - Yeah, it's also great.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.360
 Like did you, I'm like trying to remember this

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.160
 and I like can't really understand.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.720
 When did like web development become like the entirety

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.360
 of what you thought about?

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.840
 Like if I think of software,

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.280
 the broader software industry,

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.600
 I just think about web development.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.440
 Is that what you're saying?

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.280
 - Yeah.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.520
 - When did that happen for me?

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.040
 - Yeah, it is really all I think about.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.200
 Is it the Twitter, is it like the more you're on Twitter,

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.480
 the more you'll just think about the little nation?

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.320
 - I'm not even talking about Twitter.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.840
 I'm talking about the little work I do

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.640
 and the jobs that I had looked for

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.880
 and like the skills I'd offer.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.360
 Like it's always web development.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.960
 I mean, of course, there's all this backend stuff,

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.800
 but then the day all that stuff was just built

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.360
 to power some web stuff.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.200
 - Yeah.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.040
 - When did that happen?

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.600
 - I think we like accidentally got super narrow

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.960
 and I didn't even realize that was happening.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.960
 - You're saying like you know the other stuff exists,

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.400
 that there are lots of software developers

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.080
 not working on web related stuff,

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.280
 but it just completely like you have to think hard

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.960
 about it to even acknowledge it.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.680
 Like it's kind of gone out of your mind.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.520
 - Yeah, I think partly,

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.080
 but I also think just genuinely as an industry,

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:02.160
 all of software just genuinely became web development.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.480
 Like a large percentage of it has.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.320
 - Yeah.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.120
 Well, is it like that situation

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.720
 where it's the only thing anyone talks about,

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.120
 but there's like the 90% of people still like working

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.080
 on WinForms apps or something in like offices?

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.920
 Is that still a thing or is that gone away?

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.560
 'Cause I literally don't know.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.400
 I don't know if there's people.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.800
 - Well, I'm saying if you look at

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.440
 the biggest companies created in the last 10 years,

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.240
 of course, all of them have native apps

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.560
 and I'm gonna bucket native apps

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.520
 and web apps kind of under the same category

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.800
 'cause they're all like, they're like saying they're the same.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.720
 There's like a backend and it like serves something

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.720
 and the front end consumes it.

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.640
 Like the architecture is roughly the same.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.840
 Like literally as we're talking about this,

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.280
 someone just posts in the chat.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.720
 Why sell it over quick?

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.320
 Just like the randomest question,

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.960
 of course, about web development.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.480
 - Well, maybe you could help me,

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.480
 I'm struggling here, I don't know if you can tell.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.920
 Maybe you could help me by like telling me

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.040
 what are the other categories of software?

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.000
 If there's web software, what else is there?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.200
 - I don't think there's much else.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.160
 Like of course, there's like firmware software.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.640
 Of course, there's stuff that runs on embedded devices.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.720
 And of course, there's stuff that like

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.480
 really operates backend stuff

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.040
 'cause there's no point of having a front end for it.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.960
 - Like the whole banking world is just like a bunch

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.520
 of old code talking to each other.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.800
 - Yeah, again, talking to each other.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.480
 So of course, there's all of that,

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.040
 but like most of us work on stuff

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.960
 where there's like a backend and there's a UI.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.320
 And like, it seems like the whole industry

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:31.840
 has been built around, that's what we ship

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.080
 and that's what's useful and that's what's needed in the world.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.640
 And that might be generally true.

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.800
 That might be what's needed in the world.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.760
 But something, I think the observation I had was

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.440
 it feels weirdly narrow.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.440
 It feels like so simple and narrow.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.520
 Like there's just a backend and a front end and that's it.

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.080
 And like every single software in the company,

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.880
 like that's all they need to ship.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.720
 - Yeah.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.640
 - It feels weird that it's just that.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.040
 - So one clarifying question here

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.360
 to make sure I'm really understanding.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.760
 Do you think that is reality that most of us

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.600
 are working on what stuff?

00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.920
 - I do think it is reality, yes.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:00.760
 - Okay.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.600
 - It's like a perception.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.320
 - Because you look at jobs, if you go look at software jobs,

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.840
 most of them are asking for this type of thing to be built.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.680
 - Web stuff.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.360
 - Every startup is like, we have this bold, innovative idea

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.920
 that can truly change everything,

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.040
 but all it needs is a backend and a front end, you know?

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.080
 - Yeah, I remember tweeting, what did I tweet?

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.560
 Something about cloud computing, eating something, I don't know.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.800
 It was something that was like a bold claim about,

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.960
 like we should all just probably be building on AWS

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:29.800
 or something.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.960
 And there was a guy who's like, what is his name?

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.440
 I forget his name, but he's like the creator

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.320
 of UML documents or something.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.520
 He like, he created something a long time ago.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.120
 - Yeah, Grady Grady Grady or something.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.000
 - He tweeted and he was like, yeah, that's a great view.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.280
 If you think the whole world is just web development,

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.480
 but like what about people writing software for satellites?

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.600
 He literally used that example, the satellite thing.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.600
 And I guess in my mind, I assumed,

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.240
 oh yeah, I just had this very narrow view of the world,

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.760
 but like 90% of software development

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.280
 is actually all this like systems level stuff happening

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.280
 on devices and mainframes and whatever.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.880
 But we just talked mostly about web development

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.960
 because it's the, I don't know,

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.440
 the gateway into software development.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.640
 But that's, you don't think that's true.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.800
 You think it's actually mostly people working

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.640
 on web development.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.520
 - Yeah, I think so because when I just follow the money,

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.360
 that's all I did.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.200
 I just follow the opportunity

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.720
 and followed like what had the biggest numbers.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.760
 And yeah, this back end and front end

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.560
 is the thing that had the biggest numbers

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.480
 and the thing that was the most in demand.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.320
 - Yeah, okay.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.720
 - And it's crazy how, I'm just saying it's,

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.760
 I'm like truly surprised at how most problems

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:36.600
 in the world seem to be solved by that combination of things.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.600
 You would think it's like more varied or more diverse,

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.600
 but yeah, it's not.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.360
 - Do you think AI changes that?

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.800
 - I think so, yeah.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.240
 - You've had tweets that kind of elude to like,

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.880
 maybe not as many front ends in the future

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.720
 that kind of thought.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.400
 - Yeah, I think one of the last things

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.240
 that'll ever be built.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.200
 And I actually think Vercel is working on this

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.680
 'cause I've seen some like teasers from Jared

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.480
 that feels like he's kind of put together this same idea.

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.020
 I think one of the last things that'll ever be built

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.920
 is to surface UIs dynamically

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.600
 in the most useful way possible.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.680
 And UIs that are perfectly accessible,

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.200
 like implement everything correct.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.200
 - Mm-hmm.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.760
 - If you can do that, you just have one app.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.320
 You have one app that can do anything.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.160
 Like an end state.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.400
 - It could interact with all of it.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.240
 - Yeah.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:27.120
 - Right of all this could be that every problem is solved,

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.640
 like I said, right now every problem is solved

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.000
 by a back end and a front end

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.640
 and a bunch of engineers like going stuff together.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.760
 In the future, every problem could just be solved

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.840
 by a database.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.000
 The database that needs to exist

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.520
 'cause you need a physical way to organize data

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.240
 on a physical medium, like a disk and retrieve it efficiently.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.000
 So a database gets to exist

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.440
 and some kind of AI talking to that database

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:49.320
 to like take input from the world,

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.480
 structured, unstructured, whatever it is,

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.360
 store it in a way in a database

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.280
 that can retrieve later in a useful way.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.320
 And then later, like surface it as a UI.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.960
 Every problem can be solved by that combination of things.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.720
 The front end, there's only one front end in the world.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.960
 It's a front end that can surface

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.600
 whatever these various AIs are.

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.160
 - Or just, it's just a front end with a text box

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.400
 that streams in text.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.240
 That's all.

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.520
 We just need to chat with our systems, that's it.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.880
 - Well, they already did it, chat.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.880
 - Chat.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.880
 - Chat.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.720
 - OpenAI.com.

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.040
 No, I hate the idea of like streaming in text

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.560
 and that's like the way we interact with the stuff is just.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.080
 - I think a lot of things that works for,

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.600
 but if you think about like calling a cab

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.280
 and needing to see like calling an Uber

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.960
 and needing to see where your driver is like on the map,

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.160
 like a text version of that is not going to be better.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.520
 - No, right.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.960
 Oh, that's interesting to think of that UI

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.960
 just being dynamically on the fly built up

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.600
 based on some underlying system.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.600
 - Yeah, if it can figure out given what's happening,

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.200
 given what the user wants is asking for

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.600
 and given I know what the data says,

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.320
 I know the right way to surface it.

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.680
 And you don't need people like manually mapping those

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.400
 over and over, often poorly.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.800
 - Yeah, no, that's making sense.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.840
 I like that future.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.080
 I mean, that sounds fun as a consumer.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.280
 It's kind of what, I mean, the V zero thing Vercel did

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:05.280
 is sort of like trying to take like dynamically build up UI.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.120
 And I know that's different.

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.640
 That's more from like a software developer

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:08.640
 authoring a new app.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.480
 - Yeah, right.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.280
 But that's like a stepping stone to this.

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.920
 - Yeah, I do hate every time I build the UI

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.880
 and I'm like, am I seriously going to have to do this

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.160
 with the forum and the whole thing

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.440
 and like repeat the same garbage

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.040
 I've had to make a hundred million times in my career.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:26.080
 If AI could just make accessible UI, that'd be fantastic.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.080
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.560
 And it feels like that is achievable,

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.600
 even with the current quality of AI,

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.360
 it feels like it's a coordination problem of,

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.280
 like piping it together in the right way

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:39.160
 and being like doing that well.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.160
 Yeah, so I wonder if like, that's one possible entity.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.840
 And it's like AI plus database thing

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.040
 is something I've also been thinking about

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.840
 'cause that accounts for most backends

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.160
 as well, you just need to make sure stuff

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.960
 that's happening in the physical world

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.480
 is making it into a database.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.840
 If the AI can translate between those two things,

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.240
 that's most of what engineers' backend job is.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.040
 It's like you have some real world domain,

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.120
 you understand how it works, create a schema for it,

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.320
 make sure that when stuff happens,

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.600
 it gets put into that schema.

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:11.000
 Yeah, so like the ends, I don't know.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.800
 I keep saying end state, but when I say end state,

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.160
 I mean, this is as far as I can like see in the craziest--

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.880
 Yeah, there is no end software.

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.120
 Yeah, as we talked about in the beginning,

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.880
 even with AI, there is no end.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.720
 It'll be interesting, but there's still a lot of work

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.400
 to be done to get there.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.080
 And even when it's there, there are so problems remaining.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.680
 And so the question is like, what will still need to exist

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.200
 and you try to build that today

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.080
 instead of waiting for that future?

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.160
 Just assume that future happens

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.560
 and then try to build what it needs today.

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.240
 Yeah, I'm screwed.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.760
 I'm not predicting anything, I'm not ahead of anything.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.120
 It's all going downhill from here for me.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.800
 My career is on the downward trajectory.

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:51.680
 There's a guy here in Miami, Aaron White,

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.840
 and he's starting a company,

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.520
 and he's super into all this stuff.

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:58.960
 And a lot of what I just brought up was from me talking with him.

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.760
 Yeah. He's looking at everything that's going on,

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.640
 and he's like, okay, I'm gonna make one assumption,

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.440
 which is someone builds a really great thing

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.320
 that can go work on anything.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.960
 Like work on a lot of stuff like as good as a human does.

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.680
 One problem still exists.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.400
 And his answer is so funny.

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.080
 His answer is when there is a company

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.760
 that has been around for a hundred years,

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:24.320
 some consumer goods manufacturing company, whatever it is,

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.480
 the one was a giant big enterprise companies,

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:31.480
 and they're like, oh, we can hire this AI thing to work for us.

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.840
 The problem they're gonna have

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:37.880
 is all of our systems are old and stupid.

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:41.840
 How do we onboard this AI as an employee?

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.400
 We need to give them a laptop.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.000
 We need to give them access to the VPN.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.160
 We need to give them all this stuff so they can do the work.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.080
 So he's building that.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.640
 He's not building AI better.

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.440
 He's trying to create the ultimate onboarding experience

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:58.440
 that if you can onboard AI as an employee,

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.040
 as an employee, what are all the stupid, annoying problems

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:01.880
 you're gonna run into?

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.240
 And that's why he's just running straight towards--

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.480
 Yeah, that's a great idea.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.360
 But he could fail if AI just dies and does not work out.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.840
 But if it does work out, then he's in the exact right zone.

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.360
 I love it now he's gonna have a bunch of competitors

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.440
 from all the people who listened to art.

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.600
 We got a very entrepreneurial listenership, I think.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.000
 Yeah, I don't know if I like this idea, but--

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.840
 People are already asking questions in chat.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.880
 Does he charge per seat or--

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.200
 What exactly is the business model?

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.040
 Let's talk.

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.560
 Well, it is funny that you think about,

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.800
 oh, this stuff is gonna eliminate everything,

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.040
 but then there's all these stupid problems

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:35.320
 that are still remaining that'll be around for decades.

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.600
 That's what Sam Altman said, right,

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.480
 that AI is gonna take jobs.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.000
 But we're gonna create new jobs.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.720
 Yeah, well, I think the thing he said was,

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.480
 it's gonna get created and we're all gonna be like,

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.760
 whoa, and then we're just gonna kind of go back

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.920
 to business as usual, because the world is so slow,

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.960
 it just does not change quickly.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.400
 Yeah, and it's like the watching something grow,

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.560
 like you don't really notice as you grow

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.440
 and change over time 'cause it's slow and gradual.

00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:00.880
 Oh yeah, exactly, it never feels dramatic.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.440
 Like there's still companies that are like slowly moving,

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:05.880
 like shutting down their databases

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.520
 and moving them onto AWS still.

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.040
 And this is impossible for like so long,

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:13.240
 but the companies are so just figuring it out, so.

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.000
 Mm-hmm, the world is slow.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.200
 Can I talk about something that has nothing to do

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.200
 with any of this and it's basically like none of this matters?

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.600
 I don't know where I'm gonna go with this.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.040
 But if this show is anything,

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.920
 it's us talking about what's on our mind.

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.240
 And I would be basically faking this entire episode

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.080
 if I didn't talk about this

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.800
 'cause it's all I've thought about for like four days.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.800
 Oh god.

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.400
 So are you nervous?

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.720
 Yeah.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.880
 I've not really been on Twitter because,

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.120
 I mean, I've been on like every morning for a bit.

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.480
 We had like a mutual friend.

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:46.280
 I don't know if you know, if you know Zach.

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.560
 Oh yeah, I know, I know.

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.360
 So somebody that lost a child,

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:54.120
 their youngest of five,

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:57.200
 they had a house fire, horrible situation.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.560
 And I can't think about anything else this week.

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.560
 I've basically been as little productivity as I could have

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:06.640
 just the thought of his situation

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.960
 and what he's going through.

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.680
 And I don't know,

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:15.680
 it makes me think about like how hard it is in today's age

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.160
 to be connected to so many,

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.440
 I feel like there's so many tragic situations I'm aware of

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.880
 that I wouldn't have been aware of before the internet.

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:24.800
 And that's not like, this isn't like poor me

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.400
 that I had to hear about this situation.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:31.080
 This is like, I don't know how to navigate life

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.400
 when I know about every war that happens

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:37.200
 in every terrible situation in a family

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:40.320
 or there's been people who died in our circle.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.960
 I mean, like in the last year,

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.840
 we've lost some people, dev streamers,

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.240
 like that's very specific.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:49.040
 That's a tiny niche and still like tragedy.

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:52.280
 And we're all interconnected with this globalized society

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.560
 now where you know about all this stuff.

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.160
 And it's impossible to like navigate it out.

00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:02.160
 Not like when the war in like when Russia invaded Ukraine,

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.640
 that situation sucked for a few days.

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:09.480
 I know I remember like just not knowing how to think

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.040
 about that or how to handle that situation,

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.720
 but it was less relatable for me.

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.880
 And this sounds, I don't know, maybe this sounds terrible,

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.400
 but like we've never in America had that situation.

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.480
 I don't know how to relate to that.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.200
 But when somebody loses a child

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.520
 and I can't for four days hardly get anything done

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.960
 because I just can't stop thinking about,

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.080
 it's just like a fear of mine.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.800
 Like to lose a child is like the ultimate fear.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.280
 And then to think about this person

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.240
 who does basically exactly what I do.

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:40.480
 Like they're me just in a different place here in the country.

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.760
 And their little daughter has white hair

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.080
 like my little four year old

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.680
 and looks kind of like my four year old.

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:47.800
 And that's all I can think about.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:52.200
 And now I don't know like, I feel like I wanna do something

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:55.600
 'cause it's like you just feel so bad in that situation.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.720
 And what do you say?

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.120
 And we all kind of like respond and say things,

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.120
 but it's like, I don't know.

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:05.840
 I just feel like mental health is so hard in 2024

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:10.840
 because we just exposed so much more tragedy than,

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:12.400
 is that true?

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.760
 Am I making that up?

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.320
 Or are we just exposed to way more of this

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.080
 than we would have been 50 years ago?

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:18.920
 - Yeah.

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:19.880
 I mean, so I don't have kids,

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.360
 but I'm told by every single person that has one,

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.800
 like once you have kids, you just see your kid every time

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.960
 you see something bad happens and that happened.

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.920
 I totally relate to that 'cause I've had things in my life

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.960
 where it kind of fall at similar pattern.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:37.960
 Like I have a friend who's Palestinian

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.760
 and like whenever he sees all the news,

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:43.800
 he just sees his daughter in like every single thing.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:47.200
 And that seems impossibly difficult and hard.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.600
 Yeah, to me as I don't know,

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:53.240
 it's like this stuff is bad stuff happens.

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.560
 Like horrible stuff happens.

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:58.760
 You can kind of see like you can take something from it.

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:01.320
 Like the way he's handled all of it

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:05.040
 and the way he's made would be like the way he's like,

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.400
 you know, he still has like, you know, four other kids

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:10.520
 and his wife, they're all going through it together.

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:13.240
 So like seeing all that is really, really sad,

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:16.560
 but in some small way, it's like, you know,

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.320
 a little inspirational.

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.160
 - Oh for sure.

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.560
 - Just like witnessing like the strength of someone

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.400
 in a situation like that.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.080
 But yeah, overall, it's just like extremely negative.

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:28.000
 - That is the positive side is sort of the reminder.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.080
 It's the Steve Jobs thing.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.160
 Like once he knew he had cancer

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.120
 and all of the mortality came crashing down for him,

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.520
 he had those famous, there was a famous quote, right?

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:40.120
 Just like, basically his whole mentality was different

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.440
 after that because you're just gonna die.

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:44.880
 And like, why not make the most of the time?

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.120
 This sounds so cliche and so cheesy,

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.880
 but that's all I can think about for four days.

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.120
 - Yeah, but it is what it is.

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.080
 Yeah, that is what that is, yeah.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.920
 Yeah, it's crazy.

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:57.080
 And if you've seen some of the studies they do

00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:00.440
 with hallucinogens and people with terminal illnesses,

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.280
 that's actually where they're trying to get people to.

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:06.040
 'Cause a lot of people obsess over things that--

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.160
 - Just the anxiety of it.

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.920
 - Yeah, and they just kind of waste the time they have left.

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.080
 Like they obsess over like, oh, can I stop this

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.680
 or slow us down or other stuff?

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.920
 And when people get those treatments

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:15.960
 and they end up in a better place,

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:19.600
 the better place tends to be just really genuinely,

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:22.960
 like making the most of the time they have.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.800
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.400
 I'm personally actually very bad at this topic.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.680
 Like whenever this kind of thing comes out,

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.960
 like, let's always make fun of me for it.

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.960
 Like, I just do not like want to think about it.

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:36.960
 Like I'm kind of like similar to you where I can relate

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:40.800
 to what you're saying because my approach to all this

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:41.920
 is somewhat cowardly.

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.920
 It's, I just avoid, I try to turn off the thought--

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:45.760
 - Oh, I do the same thing.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.560
 - Or avoid the thing that makes me think about it

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.400
 or whatever.

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.160
 I know there's maybe a better place I can get to,

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:54.920
 but I just don't have it in me to like work through that.

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.600
 So yeah, I totally get what you're saying.

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.840
 - Yeah, I feel like that's mostly what I've done.

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:00.560
 This one, I did not do a good job

00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.680
 of keeping it out of my head or something.

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:06.040
 I didn't have my defenses up.

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:07.040
 But yeah, that's my approach.

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.600
 I just don't want to think about any of it.

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.160
 And it feels like, I don't know,

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.800
 that's not very supportive or something,

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:17.560
 but like, how can we all support everybody at all times?

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.600
 There's terrible things happening constantly

00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:20.440
 all over the place.

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.080
 It comes back to like,

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.920
 just like, it feels weird to carry on like normal

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.040
 when people are suffering,

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.680
 when there's bad things happening.

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.520
 But it's like, that's always happening.

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.160
 It's literally always happening.

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.400
 And in this age,

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.880
 where we always know what's going on all over the world,

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.800
 how do you operate normally ever?

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.320
 If you're going to, it might as well be every day

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.800
 because you know what I mean?

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.640
 Oh, sorry.

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.800
 (laughing)

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.640
 - I had to, I shouldn't have read something red.

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.480
 - Oh no.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.760
 - Red Paul's message.

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.760
 - It was actually easier to be in Ukraine

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.800
 than it was to read the two something.

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.060
 (laughing)

00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:03.360
 But yeah, it's, I don't know.

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.040
 It's like, and sometimes I get this feeling of like,

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.440
 you like truly understand how like weird

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:13.040
 and like crazy, like being alive is.

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.880
 It's just this weird trippy thing.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.440
 Like none of it really makes sense.

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.240
 And all this stuff is happening randomly

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.840
 and just like very chaotic.

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.440
 And I feel like that's in moments like this,

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.960
 it's kind of the feeling that I have.

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.320
 And I think it's the truth.

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:30.160
 I think in those moments, like the illusion is broken,

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.760
 like your understanding of like the progression

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:34.360
 of like your life and like the things that happen

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.200
 that happen in this order.

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.040
 Like you see stuff like this

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.200
 and it's kind of like completely shatters.

00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.680
 That everything feels surreal

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.240
 and like you're in a dream or something.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.720
 I definitely been feeling that way.

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.040
 I've been getting that feeling like a lot more.

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.520
 - Yeah.

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.000
 - But yeah, I don't know.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.120
 There's no answers here.

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:50.960
 - There's just...

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.800
 - There's no answers, yeah.

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:52.640
 - No, this is kind of a...

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:54.360
 - Which is a really weird and crazy end.

00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.200
 - Yeah.

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:58.640
 - Yeah, I guess I really do need to go.

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.000
 It's just kind of bad timing.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.080
 This recording was sandwiched

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.260
 between two things for me today.

00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.880
 So I guess we're ending on this note.

00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.320
 This is, I'm sorry that I brought it down for the ending

00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.960
 but it's maybe it's a good reminder for somebody.

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:13.640
 You're gonna die, you know?

00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:15.760
 Sorry, that sounds so dark.

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.760
 But like make the best of it, you know?

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:21.200
 Wake up and make Apple or something.

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.320
 I don't know, I got nothing.

00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:25.560
 There's no good way to land this plane.

00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:29.640
 But it's on my mind and I don't know how to take up

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.880
 or deal with this kind of stuff.

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.280
 And it's ever-present.

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:34.880
 It's just gonna constantly be hitting us.

00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:37.280
 - I think the way I think about it is

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.000
 it's almost like insurance.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.640
 You know, like when something bad happens,

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.400
 like it comes out of everyone's thing

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.760
 and pays for the bad thing.

00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:46.040
 I kind of see that in this way.

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.000
 Like this bad thing happened and we're like,

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.040
 obviously one family is paying for it the most.

00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:56.320
 But it also hurts all of us and I think that's good.

00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:58.120
 That's like, that's just the way it works.

00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:58.960
 That's a cost.

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.360
 We're all paying some of it together.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.680
 - There's some amount of support that the collective

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.360
 can provide in sort of helping to uplift

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.840
 in those situations too.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.680
 - Yeah.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.720
 - Yeah, we should put a link in the show notes

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.480
 for the situation and how people can help

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.280
 if anybody wants to help.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.600
 - Yeah.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:21.600
 - Okay, well that was a, sorry, that was a downer on...

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.440
 - Well, it's okay.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.120
 - Otherwise very upbeat and futuristic

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.360
 in whatever episode.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.560
 I gotta go, I'm gonna actually be streaming.

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.680
 I'm gonna turn on the stream

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.120
 and I'm gonna go for a workout

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.360
 and you guys can watch me get a pump on.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.200
 - Nice.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.200
 - There's a transition, nice transition.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.040
 Nailed it.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.880
 - You can be crying during the workout.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.720
 - Yeah, right.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.000
 All right.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:45.840
 - All right.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.680
 - See ya.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:47.520
 - See ya.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.100
 (upbeat music)
