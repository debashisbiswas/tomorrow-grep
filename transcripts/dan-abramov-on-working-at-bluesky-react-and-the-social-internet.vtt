00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 - I don't know if it's meaner than it used to be.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.380
 I think the largest shift like I'm seeing is just,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.160
 I think people who are like entertainers,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.480
 and I'm not saying this, like in a bad way.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.560
 (laughing)

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.400
 - That's what I feel and call them.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.000
 (laughing)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.160
 - With their super fancy cameras, like.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.400
 (laughing)

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.660
 (laughing)

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.240
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:48.240
 - We've never met, Dan, have you met Bax?

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.360
 Have you guys met?

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.200
 - No.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.360
 - Definitely.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.200
 - This is the first time.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.040
 - Yeah, Twitter.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.880
 Does Twitter count?

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.020
 I don't think so.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.120
 How are you, Dan?

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240
 You're in the UK, is that right?

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.080
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.880
 - Yeah, so Dax just got back from Europe

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.160
 and we had to bring a little piece of Europe

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.760
 onto the show today because he missed it so much.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.960
 Is the UK Europe, is that even Europe?

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.040
 - From American point of view, I'd say yes.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.000
 (laughing)

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 - So many things from the American point of view.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.760
 - Do you feel European being in London?

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.160
 - I guess like on the world scale, sure.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.000
 Yeah.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.360
 - Was it more European before Brexit?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.920
 Is that the main reason it's no longer European?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.760
 Is that?

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.880
 - I think so, yeah.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.480
 I mean, just from like technical, legal aspects, I don't know.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.920
 - You were originally from Russia, right?

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.920
 And you just, like, you could pick anywhere you wanted to live

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.720
 and you chose the UK.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.720
 You went from Russia to the UK.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.640
 - Yeah, I mean, it was kind of random

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.320
 because I've never really considered UK as a place to go to.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.720
 'Cause I didn't know anyone who went there.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.760
 So I just didn't consider it as a possibility.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.440
 But then I did get a job offer in the UK.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.960
 And so that's how I ended up here.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.880
 - Ah, gotcha.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.440
 So you took a job in the UK.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.200
 Wait, who was that with?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.120
 - That was Facebook.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.280
 - Oh, in the UK.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.200
 Okay, that makes sense.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.000
 Yeah, I guess they're everywhere, probably.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.400
 - Yeah, I didn't know that either.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.120
 So I was like, wow, that's an option.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.480
 - The Silicon Valley offices, and that's it.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.320
 I don't know.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.880
 - That stuff really blows my mind

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.640
 because I was telling Dan earlier that,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.440
 so CloudFlare has an office in Lisbon where I visited

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.240
 and they were telling, and the guy that I met there

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.560
 was telling me the history of it.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.640
 So they originally had a London office

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.760
 and he was explaining how London was like the New York

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.640
 of Europe, like no matter what you wanted to do,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.920
 like if it was tech, entertainment, finance,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.280
 that was like the place.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.880
 And then after Brexit, they had to consider other places

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.880
 so they moved to Lisbon.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.880
 But then they were talking about how like,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.800
 you know, there's great engineers there

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.040
 they wanted to tap into.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.600
 And me having never really been a part of a company,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.480
 that scale, it's mind blowing to think like,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.680
 you're so desperate for engineering talent

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.320
 that you have to literally like search like globally for it.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.680
 Like you need so many people that you need to like

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.840
 have offices everywhere just tap into like whatever

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.680
 talent is around those areas.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.280
 It's like really crazy as someone that thinks about hiring

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.320
 like one or two people at a time.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.760
 Like yeah, I'll be able to find someone, you know, locally,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.320
 but yeah, these companies, they're completely different.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.000
 - How many engineers work at meta?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.760
 - I actually have no idea.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.000
 - Is it like hundreds?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.120
 Is it thousands?

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.040
 - It's thousands.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.360
 - Yeah, it's somewhere in thousands.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.200
 Yeah.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.560
 - That's insane.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.040
 I've just never worked anywhere where there were even like

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.040
 500 people.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.240
 So I don't have any context.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.680
 I'm not even like engineers, just like people.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.640
 - I think like you don't really like interact

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.320
 with all of them at the same time, right?

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.160
 - Right.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.480
 - That is like that is more of a concern for like people

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.280
 building like to learn, right?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.880
 Like you need to make sure that like

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.120
 continuous integration can work with like commits,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.400
 land in like every minute and so on.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.720
 But other than that, I think it's still, you know,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.360
 like I worked on the pretty small team

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.320
 and like I work with Blue Sky now,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.040
 which is like a super small company.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.760
 But then in terms of like team dynamics,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.120
 it actually kind of feels similar.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.320
 It's just because it's like, well, there's like seven people

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.240
 or so, well, like actively constantly like doing something

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.080
 together.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.880
 So it's actually not that much of a difference in some ways.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.720
 - Yeah.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.560
 Yeah.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.240
 So there is a company that makes Blue Sky.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.200
 It's not just, it's not like just in the Fediverse or whatever.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.520
 Like you guys, I'll just shake hands.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.760
 - I know it's pronounced blue ski.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.600
 Blue ski.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.240
 (laughing)

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.080
 - Yeah.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.000
 There is a company.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 I think it's incorporated in as a like public benefit,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 something, something.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.920
 I don't, I don't, I don't understand the legal stuff.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.520
 - But enough to say, but yeah, it is definitely a company.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.040
 - But it's a normal job at a place that pays you to work there.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.880
 Yeah.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.720
 - Yeah.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.840
 But everyone is remote.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.320
 Like pretty much the entire team is remote.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.160
 - Yeah.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.000
 How big is it Blue Sky team?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.440
 - I think it's like under, like the entire company

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.080
 is like under 20 people.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.920
 I think.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.760
 - Oh wow.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.600
 - That's a big big shift.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.120
 - Maybe we just crossed 20, but I think it's like,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.960
 it was under 20.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.440
 - When you, when you joined Meta, did you have to interview?

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.600
 Like what was a process like when you're like kind of

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.000
 a very specific type of hire?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.040
 - It was like, I went through kind of the normal process,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.520
 although under maybe strange circumstances

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.680
 because I was at a conference and I was given like my first

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.080
 kind of big conference talk.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.000
 And I was talking to Jin Chen.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.200
 And like I talked with her before,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.160
 she's like one of the co-inventors of Flux Architecture.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.000
 And she just mentioned that they have a London office,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.720
 which I had no idea they do because I couldn't actually go

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.960
 to US because I couldn't.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.120
 I didn't have like, you had to have enough education

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.040
 or like enough years of experience to get H1B,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.880
 which I did not.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.000
 - It's like getting a mortgage.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 - Yeah, I didn't really consider that as a possibility.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.600
 And yeah, I just said that they're hiring in UK.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.560
 And so because they had a bunch of speakers

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.320
 from Facebook at that conference,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.200
 they actually arranged kind of like an impromptu

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.920
 interview cycle where I just skipped the second day

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.440
 of the conference and they interviewed me

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.120
 in the hotel basement.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.880
 - That's awesome, that's incredible.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.560
 Yeah, I love when people find little side doors like that.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.600
 - Dan, I don't expect you to remember this.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.600
 But we actually have a little history

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.860
 that goes way back to that timeframe.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.040
 I emailed you and it was like 2014 or 15 or whatever it was

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.040
 right before you joined Med Up

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.680
 'cause I was using Redux at my startup

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.120
 and I emailed you to try to hire you

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.800
 at a company called Stat Muse.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.280
 And you were very polite, you responded.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.920
 You actually responded to me and you were like,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.480
 sorry, I'm actually taking another job.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.520
 - That was when I was still responding to the thing.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.880
 (laughing)

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.720
 I got in right before Facebook and I got in a response.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.760
 But yeah, we have that history.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.720
 I didn't expect you to ever remember that.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.360
 But the company's still around today.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.440
 So you might've chose the wrong company.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.960
 I'm just saying, Stat Muse is still a thing.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.800
 - That's funny.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.520
 So you left, like a year ago, it's been or so?

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.240
 - Yeah, yeah, it's actually been almost exactly a year.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.200
 - Yeah, what was like, what made you want to look

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.280
 for something new?

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.880
 - I think like I wanted to try something new for a while,

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.880
 but it was just like never the right time

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.480
 because there were like a bunch of things

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.520
 that I really wanted to see them kind of complete in.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.520
 And I was also working on the React documentation website.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.160
 I really wanted to like get that over the finish line.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.800
 And that took a couple of years more than I thought.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.360
 But like when all the work seemed done

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.360
 and they also hired a person who I thought was gonna be able

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.280
 to take over a bunch of just like developer

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.040
 kind of relations thing that I was doing

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.640
 without it actually being my job.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.400
 Like we hired a person for that job.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.400
 Then that person got laid off, which was like completely wild.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.960
 And then we complained and I don't know,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.740
 like we managed to rehire that person in our org.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.580
 - Oh really?

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.040
 - So yeah, because like this person

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.560
 wasn't a different org.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.560
 And so yeah, that was just like if you, while weeks,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.120
 but we hired this person and I just felt like,

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.480
 okay, this is the time.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.360
 And I was getting pretty excited about blue sky

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.200
 like in general.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.960
 So it just felt like, okay, now this actually makes sense

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.680
 because I previously thought maybe I wouldn't,

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.320
 like I wasn't actually planning to work in the company at all.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.040
 I was thinking maybe I'd just become like a YouTuber

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.400
 or something or like self-horses or whatever.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.640
 And that might still be like maybe that would have been

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.680
 like a more kind of rational choice.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.080
 But it just kind of clicked like on a bunch of levels.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.680
 So I thought, yeah, this is the thing I have to do now.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.520
 - That makes sense.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.480
 Well, how's blue sky?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.720
 Like I haven't been on, I think I got on blue sky

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.520
 when I got on all the other Twitter alternatives

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.960
 as Twitter was going up in flames.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.200
 But I haven't been since.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.320
 How's it, what's the scene like, what's it like over there?

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.800
 - Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like a mix.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.400
 I don't know, we have, I think like we have a few communities

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.080
 that like really settled.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.080
 And I think like tech community hasn't really settled there.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.080
 So there are like a bunch of people who signed up

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.400
 but then like, you know, the conversation wasn't really flowing

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.560
 and then people left.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.000
 We're working on a bunch of things, you know,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.120
 like just like making the app better.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.720
 We didn't, like one problem is like we're still catching up

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.040
 in terms of baseline features because like the way

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.200
 we build things is kind of like more

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.240
 with this decentralized angle where we wanted to

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:58.160
 do not be tied to one company in terms of the implementation.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.160
 But then from the user experience point of view,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.080
 like we think it's bad if that leaks into the user experience.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.040
 So like when you like, when you look at your feed,

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.720
 it kind of looks like a normal Twitter feed

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.600
 even if it gets pulled from like different data servers

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.600
 or whatever.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.040
 Like if you move like where you host your data,

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.520
 like that doesn't affect, you know, like nobody,

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.960
 you know, like your like counts don't disappear or whatever.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.760
 Like it just looks normal.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.320
 So that, you know, that way of developing kind of,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.320
 you know, it takes a little more time to do some things.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.720
 So we're still catching up just in terms of functionality.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.280
 You know, like some, like we just added DMs

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.640
 like literally a couple of weeks ago.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.840
 Even though DMs are like a centralized service.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.680
 So we're not doing like a end-to-end decentralized thing

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.040
 for now because that's like a huge chunk of work

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.240
 and people just need DM.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.200
 So that, that's been like a huge pain point

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.200
 for the community.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.520
 So we kind of refocused a little bit on like working

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.920
 on the product and, you know, like we added like give support,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.600
 working on videos now, but we're still catching up.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.240
 So it's, I think like, and also just like making the app

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.520
 feel better, feel faster and stuff like this.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.000
 So it's a process.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.640
 But, you know, we're excited to make the app better

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.440
 for, you know, next time you check us out.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.280
 - Yeah, it's Blue Sky the Jack.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.080
 That's the one that Jack is part of.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.240
 Co-founded something.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.400
 - Not really.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.760
 - Or no, I think, is that master?

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.760
 - No, no, no, no.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.880
 So he's like the relationship with him is kind of interesting

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.880
 from, I guess like the PR angle because the way it happened,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.160
 it's actually kind of a funny story because he,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.480
 so he used to run Twitter, right?

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.680
 He was the CEO of Twitter.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.680
 And he funded this exploration of, you know,

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.840
 what would it look like if Twitter was not the sole company

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.480
 and kind of making the rules?

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.520
 But if it was possible to kind of move this, you know,

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.360
 move it out to the protocol and have different companies

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.760
 be able to like host your data and kind of interrupt,

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.480
 well, it would still work with a Twitter client.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.000
 So that was kind of the original vision for the project.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.840
 It was kind of decentralized in Twitter, the company

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.800
 and like making it interoperable.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.800
 And they assembled a bunch of people in a chat room.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.720
 And these people were like people who explored

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.800
 decentralized social media for the past decade,

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.920
 but like very different views on like how it should work.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.280
 And so they didn't really agree on a lot of things.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.480
 And so the product was kind of stolen for a long time,

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.200
 which is, you know, it's pretty hard to find people

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.880
 with a different opinion, get an interview or something.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.280
 - Like Twitter, like the actual experience

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.840
 of being on Twitter, yeah.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.680
 - Exactly.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.880
 And so one of those people, Jay Crayper,

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.880
 she kind of compiled like a review of pros and cons

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.520
 and of different approaches.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.160
 And, you know, what are their kind of technical

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.920
 or like user experience implications and stuff like this.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.040
 And Jack chose her to lead that project.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.480
 And so she was supposed to actually like get higher

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.760
 the Twitter and lead that project at Twitter

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.120
 because that was part of Twitter the company.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.680
 But Jay insisted that that's actually not the right way

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.920
 to do it because the incentives don't match up.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.080
 And there is a risk that Twitter would shut down the project

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.560
 or that like if she works on it within Twitter

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.280
 that actually works against the goals of the project.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.560
 And so she kind of like, it took like a bunch of,

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.080
 like I think she kind of fought with them for like six months.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.160
 And then like they ended up agreeing

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.000
 that it should be like a separate company

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.080
 and like Twitter would get like a board seat

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.800
 and Jack would get a board seat and so on.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.840
 And then Twitter funded originally this project.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.620
 So Twitter just paid some money to the project.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.720
 But then she also kind of set up some like there was a clause

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:07.480
 that if Twitter, you know, that doesn't want to continue

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.840
 working on it, then I think they lose the board seat.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.840
 And so like it's not, you know, if they stop funding it

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.160
 like they also don't really, you know,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.480
 they stop controlling it in a way.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.440
 And so that's effectively like what happened with

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.760
 when Elon Musk took over Twitter,

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.120
 he kind of canceled the project.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.600
 And so the focus shifted from just working

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.880
 on the product for Twitter to, okay,

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.520
 like we have a reference implementation of a client.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.200
 Let's make it into like a real app

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.880
 because like Twitter is not gonna integrate their client

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.720
 with us.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.640
 And so that's kind of how the project started.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.800
 And Jack has like has not been actively involved

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.360
 in the like in the running the actual project.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.960
 I think like the lead engineer Paul

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.160
 has only like talked to Jack once.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.600
 So it's not, it wasn't really like he wasn't really present

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.120
 and then he gradually just like changed his opinion.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.440
 He became like more enthusiastic about like Bitcoin,

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.960
 stuff and some other projects.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.040
 And so his interests kind of shifted.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.840
 And then he left the board, I think like a couple of weeks

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.320
 or maybe like a month ago.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.320
 - Okay.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.800
 - So he's not really present.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.640
 - Got it.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.120
 - I was gonna say that that makes sense.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.400
 And like, yeah, I do want his interest shifting

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.800
 'cause I think in this space,

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.280
 there's basically a spectrum, right?

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.400
 There's the very centralized services that we're used to

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.640
 and then there's the extremely decentralized ones.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.560
 And I'm sure you guys look at things like Farcaster

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.960
 and there's like a few other things in this category, right?

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.600
 It sounds like Blue Sky is trying to figure out

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.440
 what minimum you can do to make it a little bit more

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.000
 decentralized without losing like the typical UX

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.240
 that people expect.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.520
 - I mean, does that sound right?

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.360
 - Yeah.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.240
 - I wouldn't necessarily say minimal.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.840
 I think we do want to essentially, you know,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.600
 make it very plug and play so that it feels more like the web.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.760
 - Or like email, I imagine, like kind of similar.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.600
 - Yeah.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.440
 Email is another analogy.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.760
 But we want to make,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.760
 but I think it's architecture that's closer to the web.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.760
 So it's the idea, like the technical idea is really kind of

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.880
 that, you know, when you like post something

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.560
 or you like something, you're really kind of pushing to your,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.920
 like behind the scenes, you know, you don't see it as a user,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.640
 but like behind the scenes is kind of like you have a repository

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.760
 that's hosted somewhere.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.160
 So like, and we're kind of like GitHub, right?

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.400
 Like we're one of the hosters of these repositories,

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.640
 but in principle, you could run your own.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.920
 You could like, there could be other providers

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.400
 where like opening up to, you know,

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.080
 for other players to kind of join that.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.120
 And then we have our own like indexer.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.880
 So it, like the indexer kind of crawls this repository.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.320
 So you can think of it, like kind of like Google crawls the web.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.240
 And so that indexer is, it's like all the events

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.720
 from this repository flow into this one single funnel

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.200
 and you can subscribe to it.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.320
 So like anyone can subscribe to the fire host

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.400
 of like everything that happens on blue sky.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.520
 It's kind of like, you know, like an event log

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.520
 of everything in the system.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.800
 So you can listen to it through like a web socket

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.480
 or something like this.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.560
 And then we have an, there's something called app view,

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.280
 which is like a materialized application specific view

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.280
 of the network.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.920
 So blue sky is the only app.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.680
 Well, not the only actually like somebody else

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.960
 is making like a blog in platform now.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.120
 But this is like a thing that listens to the events

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.400
 and just like updates like a snapshot of the database

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.600
 so that it's easy to query.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.600
 And that's what the client talks to.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.480
 And so this is why like it's really decentralized

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.400
 in terms of like how you store your data is decentralized

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.360
 we're also decentralized in moderation.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.200
 So we have our own kind of hard coded moderation service

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.400
 that you have to have if you use our client.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.080
 But in Prince, we also offer other people

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.880
 to run their own moderation services.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.640
 So there are like community, you can like, you know,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.880
 have your own like moderation and like people can submit

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.720
 post to you.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.080
 You can tag them with your own like labels and stuff.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.920
 And this can be used for like, you know, both kind of serious

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.040
 things and less serious things.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.320
 And the client is able to like actually show it.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.360
 So for every aspect of like social media,

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.440
 we kind of want to give people ability to like compose it

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.360
 but then present it in a very cohesive way.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.200
 - Yeah, it's cool.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.640
 So if I never want to say anything about React,

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.440
 I can just have a React free feed.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.840
 (laughing)

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.800
 - So like we have a, we have somebody running a,

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.600
 so because these moderation services they, you know,

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.160
 they can be manual, they can be like AI driven.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.800
 Like somebody, you know, you can do whatever.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.360
 Like if you're a developer, one developer is running

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.360
 a labeler that labels all screenshots from Twitter.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.960
 So you can subscribe to that labeler

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.520
 and you can say like, hi, the old screenshots from Twitter.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.360
 And then we'll just know.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.200
 - That's very cool.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.200
 Yeah, that's really funny.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.720
 So with this model, do you feel like,

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.920
 like you were saying earlier, like simple things

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.000
 are a lot more challenging, right?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.920
 Like it takes you a little bit longer to build something

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.280
 that's straightforward in centralized service.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.680
 Do you feel though, like given enough time,

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.040
 the experience is basically the same?

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.200
 Are there certain things that feel like impossible

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.520
 to ever do without centralized system?

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.760
 - So I'm not like an expert on all the like backend stuff.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.800
 So I'm just speaking from my knowledge.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.520
 I think eventually you should be able to do everything

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.400
 that you can with like maybe slightly different trade-offs.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.000
 But we have gaps right now.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.520
 We have like one significant gap we have is that

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:44.520
 we have no great way for non-public information

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.720
 to be kind of integrated.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.560
 So although we do have, you know, like your personal server

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.560
 will like store your like authentication stuff

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.800
 and like private settings and stuff like this,

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.120
 but it doesn't kind of integrate

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.240
 into the whole network in a nice way.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.720
 So it's hard to build features.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.520
 For example, we don't have locked accounts yet.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.400
 So if you post like your posts to public,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.520
 you have like private like preferences, right?

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.520
 But you can't have like access control to like your posts.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.720
 And this is something we want to build,

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.720
 but it's just gonna require like a bunch of thinking

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.480
 of like how does this actually work in a distributed system?

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.000
 And so there are like different options

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.760
 and it's probably gonna be solved like within like a year

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.880
 and a half, but not today.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.880
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.440
 And the other side of it is that typically

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.440
 if someone's founding a social media company,

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.560
 they run it in a very specific way,

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.160
 which is like entirely focused on growth

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.160
 and like getting a barrel coefficient.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.960
 It's like all the things that social media company does.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.240
 You guys are also building like new technology.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.960
 Are you still like focusing on growth right now

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.000
 and trying to make that happen?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.840
 Or like is that kind of a later thing?

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.080
 How are you guys thinking about that?

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.280
 - Yeah, it's kind of, it's interesting.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.200
 Like we've kind of shifted a little bit into that,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.000
 but the thing is like initially, you know,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.320
 the team was very small.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.640
 It's like the entire app.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.920
 So the app is built with Expo and React Native.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.520
 And so it works like on Android, on iOS.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.520
 It's like an actual native app.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.400
 And there's like a web version as well.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.720
 And it was built like a single person

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.840
 over like several months initially.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.760
 - Oh, nice.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.000
 - Now there is a team, but it's like at the time,

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.640
 it was kind of like almost like a research project.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.440
 And then when Elon bought Twitter

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.000
 and like this whole thing happened

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.760
 and a lot of people were interested in like in an alternative.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.920
 And because they had a reference client,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.200
 they, you know, the team started kind of invested into it.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.280
 And so the demand went through the roof

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.960
 and actually like the growth, you know,

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.840
 that was really like unexpected.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.360
 And that's why they had, like they had to set up

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.440
 this like invite code system, not like a, like,

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.760
 maybe many people think it's a growth hack.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.480
 I think it's like the architecture

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.120
 like literally did not scale yet.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.260
 So like all the people, like everything.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.840
 - It's an anti-growth hack.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.680
 - Yeah.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:15.880
 And so like there was a lot of demand.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.000
 I think some of it kind of calmed down

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.520
 and now it's, now it's kind of more like, you know, level.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.000
 Yeah, I think like the biggest,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.080
 the biggest thing we're seeing is just that people

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.800
 who come with their clusters and kind of settle in,

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.040
 like some of them are like having a good time on the app

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.400
 and like retain.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.680
 And then some people like they come.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.440
 And then like, for example, like maybe their friends

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.840
 already have accounts, but like I'm not actually posting.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.520
 And so they kind of fall off as well.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.680
 So we're working on different kind of community-focused things

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.280
 to, you know, you can think of it like in terms of growth,

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.600
 but another, I think another thing is retention, right?

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.800
 It's like, okay, somebody signed up,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.040
 but like how do we actually make the app useful to them?

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.080
 How do we make them want to like stay there?

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.240
 All these like social kind of dynamics of like,

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.640
 well, why do you come there?

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.520
 Like what do you find?

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.920
 So we have a few communities who really kind of sell then

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.920
 and we will invest more into those kinds of things.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.360
 - Like you work on, you mentioned the backend team.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.240
 You work on the front end.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.320
 So like people ask you to like add buttons to things.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.680
 Like Dan Abrahamov is just like making the front end

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.000
 of the blue sky, that's how this works.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 - Yeah, I fixed a bunch of borders.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.760
 Like borders, broken up from break points.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.880
 Today I was fixing an Android animation,

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.400
 stuttering after we upgraded to React Media.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.400
 It's like, Android is interesting.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.320
 - I'm assuming, I'm just guessing,

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.800
 but I'm assuming this is like a lot more product work

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.680
 than it used to do, like how has that transition been?

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.000
 I imagine it's nice, right?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.200
 Like I find myself going from framework work to product work

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.320
 and product work feels like very straightforward

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.320
 compared to like framework stuff in a very satisfying way.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.280
 So I was wondering like what your experience has been like.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.480
 - I think it's a mix really.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.120
 I mean, I'm enjoying it because I, you know,

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.720
 I like this type of product.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.600
 So like I was like a very engaged Twitter user

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.560
 and you know, the goal is to make something

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.800
 that's better than Twitter and kind of retains

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.600
 like the magic of Twitter, but also improves on it.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.720
 I don't think we're like anywhere close yet,

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.040
 but like we're slowly starting to get there.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.800
 So that's exciting.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.080
 In terms of just like product work versus like framework work,

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.360
 I think some of the product work is nice.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.200
 So, you know, it's cool to, yeah,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.840
 just like fix something that was broken,

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.960
 now it works or like polish like an animation or something

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.480
 like this, like that's kind of fun.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.840
 - I don't necessarily like enjoy like creating new screens

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.800
 or things like this.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.320
 Like that's just like stressful to me.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.160
 - Me neither.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.640
 - I'm like how good it designed to be honest.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.880
 So it's, we didn't even have a designer

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.880
 until like a few weeks ago.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.720
 So.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.960
 - I'll be honest, that splash screen.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.680
 That was the give away, the big sky picture.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.760
 I'm like, I don't know.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.040
 - Will you change it a while ago?

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.560
 It's actually beautiful now.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.020
 - It'll be wedding for me when I try it again.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:18.860
 Yeah.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.200
 - No, we had a designer on contract.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.720
 So like we had a designer who helped us with a bunch of stuff,

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.200
 but they were not like super integrated into the process.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.880
 And so we hired the first designer

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.240
 who's like really integrated.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:35.120
 But I think in terms of work, like the parts, you know,

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.600
 there's also just like all kinds of random shit, right?

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.760
 It's like, like today, like we're dealing with like,

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.720
 we released now date yesterday and it's crash and like,

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.240
 it's just instant crash and for some Android users.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.340
 And it's maybe like, you know,

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.400
 I was diving into like a bunch of,

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.800
 there's like 10 levels in the stack, right?

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.760
 There's like React, product code, there's React,

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.080
 there's Expo React native, like actual like native bugs,

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.440
 like Android, weirdness and so on.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.440
 And it's just like, well, like which level is the problem on?

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.320
 And these kinds of things are not super fun.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.560
 Like why does Android not show keyboard

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.280
 unless you like set them out 100 or whatever.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.080
 Like this kind of stuff is like not super fun.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.760
 And also you have to move a lot faster,

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.400
 like with, I feel like with framework work here,

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.840
 usually like you can really think through the fix

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.240
 because like it's more important to get it right.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.760
 Whereas like if everything is on fire,

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.920
 like maybe you just add a hack and like fix the hack later,

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.240
 or like never fix the hack.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.000
 And it's just hard for me to like,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.760
 to kind of adopt to that mentality a little bit

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.360
 'cause I'm used to like trying to fix things properly.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.560
 - Wow, I've never, I've never done framework work at all.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.640
 It's clicking for me now.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.800
 Like I've never had to think like I should fix this the right way.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:53.640
 - I just always, just junk, just throwing junk at stuff all the time.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.440
 - Yeah, well, it's funny 'cause Dan has a post

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.280
 from a really well, like a long time ago.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.560
 I don't know when, and I don't even remember

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.680
 what the post is called or anything,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.080
 but it definitely impacted me a lot.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.960
 I think you were talking about the philosophy

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.800
 of building React and how keeping React internals

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.120
 is not keeping React internal is clean, is not a goal,

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.760
 because the whole point is to absorb the complexity.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.640
 I think product work is kind of similar

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.240
 where yeah, like that hack isn't great,

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.000
 but the goal is to like, you know,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.120
 get stuff working for the user.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.440
 So keeping your internal stuff clean is not necessarily a goal.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.800
 Of course, any pathological case of this is not good.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.000
 Like you still need to find a balance,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 but yeah, that line or that post was a,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.720
 it like really changed how I thought

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.400
 because whenever I worked on product code,

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.600
 I was like, really wanted to make sure it was like

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.080
 maintainable for the long run, which does make sense,

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.440
 but a lot of times you do sacrifice capability

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.200
 or absorbing complexity and things like that.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.960
 So yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.200
 So what does like success for Blue Sky look like,

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.200
 like the near term, like what's the next milestone

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.640
 for you guys to achieve?

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.680
 - Yeah, I think it would like to improve retention

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.720
 because, you know, a bunch of people signed up

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.880
 or like also reactivate existing users.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.120
 So like a bunch of people signed up,

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.360
 checked it out, but like nothing was happening there.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.480
 Part of it is just like we have pretty poor on board in.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.600
 So you don't really find the people you want to find.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.920
 The search was not prioritizing people by,

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.640
 like we now have something like page rank.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.320
 So it's actually, it's actually really good now.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.160
 Like you find, you know, you find the people

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.120
 you probably like expect to find when you start typing.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.240
 We didn't have a good algorithm.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.040
 So, 'cause, you know, like algorithm is a kind of

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.320
 swappable on Blue Sky.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.960
 So there's the one that we maintain is called discover,

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.320
 which actually kind of acts more like a 4U feed,

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.920
 but we're still like, we're doing like a lot of tweaks there.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.960
 So we just added like an A/B testing framework

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.880
 a couple of months ago, so that we're able

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.760
 to actually try things.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.560
 And for example, like we had an experiment

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.480
 where we showed more content from kind of mutuals

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.120
 or like things that are popular or they liked

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.600
 by your mutuals in that feed.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.720
 And so we saw like, oh, that leads to like 4% increase

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.360
 in like post likes or whatever, right?

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.920
 So we're like able to kind of start tuning things

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.120
 so that they're actually, there's like so,

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.360
 so many things that he don't really think about

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.740
 that like go into making like a nice social experience.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.560
 So just, I think like get into a point

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.840
 where somebody can sign up and find the people

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.960
 they want to, they kind of vibe with

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.720
 and just like not run into like constant bugs

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.520
 and, you know, crashes or things like this.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.960
 And just stick around, I think making that outcome

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.480
 more likely is like in the top goal right now.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.960
 - Yeah, which is very hard, like it's very straightforward,

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.120
 but very difficult.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.480
 - Yeah, and one of the ways we're kind of thinking about

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.560
 that is we really want to empower communities.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.880
 I think like Twitter hasn't really focused

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.120
 on communities like it's kind of more like celebrity driven

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.640
 and that, you know, that worked out in that timeframe.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.120
 Like I don't think like we can't like repeat

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.560
 like Twitter's history, but there are things

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.240
 that work about Twitter that, you know,

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.860
 for example, like there is, there's no,

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.760
 Twitter has a product called communities,

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.240
 but it's not really like, you know, the react.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.080
 - It's so bad.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.760
 - Yeah, it doesn't really feel like it captures,

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.760
 you know, the actual communities are outside

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.120
 of the top right there, like in the home.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.240
 - Yeah.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.880
 - So we want to kind of formalize that a little bit

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.360
 and make it easier for people to discover

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.400
 like what's actually happening on the app

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.200
 through like human curation and just like groups of people

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.240
 who are like kind of part of the same scene.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.960
 So this bit, yeah.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.200
 So, you know, making it easier for communities

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.440
 to find each other and have fun with each other.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.960
 That's like the kind of short-term goal.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.440
 And for the long-term goal, I think there's,

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.960
 there's like different goals for the app

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.880
 and the protocol, right?

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.280
 Because the app is kind of almost like a reference app,

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.040
 but actually the underlying technology doesn't care

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.040
 which app you're building.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.560
 So these like repositories that I refer to,

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.720
 you can store anything there and then you can like say,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.360
 like, you know, this record was created

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.200
 and that's going to go into the fire hose.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.840
 And like the fire hose doesn't care

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.800
 what kind of record it is.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.200
 So if you build an app that listens to the fire hose

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.600
 and that posts to these repositories,

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.800
 you can build this like materialized view

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.760
 where you're like, okay, I'm only interested

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.400
 in these types of records.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.280
 So you could build like a blog, you know,

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.120
 somebody's building like a blog engine on top of this,

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.560
 but it's a bit like under documented.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.080
 So it's not super clear how to do this.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.680
 But in principle, you can build these apps where

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.440
 they can kind of read each other's public information, right?

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.240
 So you could integrate information from like different apps

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.400
 that only within the space that they kind of use

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.560
 the same like identity system that's like per time

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.960
 to kind of standardize.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.800
 So I think this success, like success for the protocol

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.240
 in like longterm is just that this is like another way

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.280
 that people can build, you know, apps or like web apps

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.200
 that is like very kind of open and integrated.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.280
 And the key part is that, you know, you can always like,

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.760
 if you're unhappy with the app,

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.520
 like somebody can build an alternative

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.320
 that uses the same data that already exists

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.720
 so that we don't get locked into these platforms.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.400
 Yeah, this has been like an interesting concept for a while

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.280
 because I guess like the first hour of the internet

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.360
 was all about network effects where whoever dominated a network

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.200
 just held that dominance forever.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.440
 And you can see that with Twitter where despite, you know,

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.800
 all the issues with it, like it's still extremely used

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.440
 because purely because of network effect.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.040
 And it's possible that the next generation of internet

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.720
 eliminates network effect as an advantage

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.520
 because it is like a weird monopolizing thing, you know,

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.720
 like once you get it, like, you can never lose it.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.320
 Whereas in your model, you have to compete

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.600
 on the experience, nothing else.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.520
 You can't compete on what we have users locked in

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.160
 or data locked in, you can't leave.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.000
 It's interesting.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.040
 It would be crazy if that's how the internet evolves

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.000
 'cause that just seems better overall.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 Yeah, I think it's like, it's a little bit idealistic

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 in terms of, well, how are we gonna compete with like,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.480
 but then if you think about it, like it's pretty cool

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.440
 that we do have a community, like there's like a really

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.120
 passionate group of people, you know, they're not

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.960
 like necessarily technical, a lot of them are not.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.920
 A lot of them don't care about it,

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.920
 which I think like is actually like a successful

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.920
 decentralization is like, they don't,

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.040
 they don't fucking care about it.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.160
 They're like, what is this protocol thing?

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.400
 Like I don't wanna hear about it.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.400
 Why are you not working on "Dear Amazon" and videos?

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.240
 No, that's a goal.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.560
 Like it's obviously like the people that really care

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.120
 about technical details are always a small vocal group,

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.160
 but you have to make the stuff invisible.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.840
 And if you don't, you're just never gonna be something

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.520
 that is massively adopted.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.840
 Yeah, I just opened up the app again.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.680
 It feels totally different.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.520
 I did too.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.680
 It feels really nice.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.080
 Yeah, yeah, wow, good job.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.600
 I'm reactivated.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.320
 Yeah, you're just gonna have to go on more podcasts.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.960
 One person at a time, you can just--

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.280
 Yeah, we're gonna come in those reactivated number

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.760
 in their metrics.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:17.520
 No, we need to get those Android crashes fixed first

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.920
 'cause that's embarrassing.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.840
 When you run into issues and you discover

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.960
 it's like a reactative issue,

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.320
 are you just like DMing people

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.360
 and they fix it immediately?

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.840
 Is that how this works?

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:31.040
 I just rant and like sometimes people respond,

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.800
 but I feel bad 'cause I think like,

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.080
 I've gotten a lot more like ranty,

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.600
 just like why is no one working on this?

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.520
 Like text inputs don't preserve the position

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.680
 like of the carrot.

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.800
 Like isn't this like, you know,

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.560
 do you think that like a text input should do?

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:54.240
 Like, but you know, like I know the team is very busy.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.760
 There's a lot of improvements they're working on

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.360
 that are actually like long-term bets

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.440
 that we really need.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.040
 So it's like, I think that reactative

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.640
 is moving into a very good direction with new architecture,

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.240
 fixes just like a bunch of architectural flaws

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.880
 that it used to have.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.800
 And we're also kind of digging this approach of,

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.720
 like we get to like iterate super fast.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:22.760
 So we built the UI for DMs, you know,

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.280
 direct messages in like two weeks for, you know,

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.720
 iOS Android web.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.840
 So that's pretty cool.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.440
 And like most of the code is actually reused.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.800
 But then for cases where like you want to fork by platform,

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.320
 you can do that at a component level.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.840
 So you can even like fork like a wrapper component.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.160
 So like on Android, it should like present like this.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.840
 And like iOS, it should present like this,

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.560
 but then the stuff inside is shared.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.920
 So it's like a very powerful way to build.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.000
 And we also hired a few people who know

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 a little bit of native like the, you know,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.240
 when the reactor is just like not cut in it.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.240
 That's like how it works at Facebook as well.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.760
 Like they don't just write everything in JavaScript.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.200
 They write native modules and then you just interface

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.240
 with those native modules from JavaScript.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.000
 So we have like a few things that are like,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.960
 this really needs to be like a native Swift thing,

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.000
 but we wrap it and then we use this React component.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.880
 - I'm actually getting ready to build a big Expo app

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.880
 for Stamped Muse.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.400
 So I actually care about this stuff.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.560
 Like this sounds very fascinating.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.320
 I didn't know you could do the wrapper thing.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.600
 That's incredible.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.000
 - Yeah. People don't realize that.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.400
 It's very interesting.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.120
 Like I think like native developers often think,

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.200
 oh, it's just like web use so they don't even realize

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.760
 that it's native and then like React developers

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.520
 don't often realize you can't use native stuff there.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.120
 So it's really like when it's good,

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.320
 it's like the best of both worlds.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.160
 And when it's bad, it's like the worst of both worlds.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.240
 It's a little bit different.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:53.680
 - Yeah. I just remember like we built the first app

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.240
 for Stamped Muse like eight, nine years ago.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.400
 It was a long time ago.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.440
 And it was just a Swift app.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.000
 It was just for iOS.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.520
 And I can remember the horrors of like the app store

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.360
 and all that.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.000
 And I've heard Expo makes a lot of that better,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.760
 like provisioning profiles and all this stuff.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.600
 - Yeah, it's great.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.000
 Like I'm a huge fan of Expo.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.960
 You know, I don't think we even like paid them any money.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.000
 Like maybe we use some service.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.760
 Like I'm not sure for like building stuff,

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:27.280
 but it's just like the amount of value we get out of it

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.520
 is completely incredible.

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:32.160
 It's papers over so many, you know, native issues

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.600
 and even like React native issues.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.080
 Like it's like if you know a real framework

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:40.080
 on top of React native, it has like its flaws

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:44.400
 but overall it's just amazing how much time it's saving.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.440
 - Yeah, yeah, I use it like even like six or seven years ago.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.200
 And even then I was like, wow, this,

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.800
 just some of like the just the developing experience

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.640
 and like being able to pop stuff open your phone and stuff.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.800
 Yeah, it's so much better than native.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.080
 Are you guys also using, or if you're not already using it,

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.880
 you're gonna use it like React native for web?

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.040
 Is that the direction you're going

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.640
 or is that gonna be totally different?

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.120
 - Yeah, so that's what we're using now

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.680
 because that's what like Expo uses

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.440
 for kind of like as a web target.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.320
 So that's what our website uses.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.320
 It's not amazing.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.480
 It's like I think like it compromises in a bunch of ways

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.120
 that are you can still work by platform, right?

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:26.040
 So like actually like I've worked the list implementation

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.480
 because you know, like React native was doing

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.880
 when the React native web was like kind of mimicking

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.760
 virtualization that React native is doing.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.960
 But actually it's like, it's a bit too complicated.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.560
 It doesn't quite make sense on the web.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.960
 I think like the way scrolling works is not quite what I wanted.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.520
 So just like rewrote that component

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.280
 to just be like a plain list.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.240
 And that's what we use on web.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.640
 And it listens to like window scroll,

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.440
 you know, like it integrates with normal scrolling

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.840
 instead of doing its own thing.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:57.920
 But it's kind of the longer term thinking there's,

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.800
 I think we're very aligned with what like META is doing now.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.040
 So META is exploring kind of the opposite route

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.800
 where it's called React strict DOM,

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.000
 where there's like a subset of DOM tags

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.240
 that are, you know, like on the web,

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.240
 it would just be directly targeting those tags.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.600
 So you would use like Dave and P and whatever

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.360
 and like use whatever props are in the web standard.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.760
 And you have this like API as like intersection observer,

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.640
 resize observer, get bounded, client and threat,

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.280
 like all the stuff that you're used to from the web.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.240
 And then so on the web, there's actually gonna be like no

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.800
 kind of thick compatibility layer

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.640
 because React Native web is a little bit thick.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.560
 But with this approach, it's more like you write

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.080
 kind of targeting the web almost except like a subset.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.760
 But React Native has a shim for this

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.400
 that is like pretty thin and is like nicer

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.720
 than the shim that's on the web.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.880
 And gradually those things get built into React Native itself.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.360
 So it would like the shim would get thinner.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.320
 And so I'm pretty excited about this approach.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.760
 I think this aligns more with like what we want.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.720
 So we'll probably migrate to it eventually.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.560
 - So you have a web app currently?

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.640
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.840
 - And is that server render?

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.760
 Like how does that work with React Native web?

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.980
 - It's like, it's like fucking megabytes of JavaScript.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.400
 I need to add.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.760
 - Dax is all about megabytes of JavaScript.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.600
 I love it, yeah.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.440
 He's into it.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.280
 (laughing)

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.480
 - Yeah, but this is the social media website.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.480
 Like this actually like is where--

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.320
 - Yeah, this makes sense for you.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.480
 - Yeah, people click on links from other places.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.580
 Yeah, you need to like be fast and minimal.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.420
 Makes sense.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.560
 - Yeah, we want to like,

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.200
 I think like there's a lot of like low hanging fruit there.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.400
 But the problem is just like we're not in a great place

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.240
 right now.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.600
 You know, we can run JavaScript on the server.

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.680
 We already do some stuff,

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.840
 which is like SSR is not integrated with Expo.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.040
 The version that we're using like very well.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.160
 And then like in the future,

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.840
 there's like they have like a new router

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.520
 and stuff like this that we don't use yet

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.040
 because we started the project earlier.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.640
 That's like much more kind of server friendly.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.440
 So I think we'll want to move towards like an approach

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.400
 that's closer to like how Next.js does it.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.960
 You know, like with SSR, like server components would be nice.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.680
 I don't know how many years we have to wait for that.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.520
 (laughing)

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:18.040
 But eventually in like in general,

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.040
 I think like another constraint we have is that

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.120
 currently like our client is very much,

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:28.120
 again, like it's like app-ish, right, it's like a thick client.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:32.880
 And that's not ideal for a bunch of reasons for us.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.760
 Like we often want to do some stuff server side

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:40.280
 to kind of pre-process it before sending it to the client.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.800
 But the problem is right now our server

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.840
 is kind of the API server for BlueSky.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.960
 So like other clients, people building other clients

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.040
 also talk to it.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.840
 So it has to be like a version, you know,

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.120
 we have to be careful about like what we add there.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.320
 We can't really like do like a single

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.400
 poor request span in both sides.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.760
 If we had time to invest in it architecturally,

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.800
 I think we would add kind of like a BFF layer,

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.280
 you know, back and forth front end,

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.760
 like extends kind of in front of it.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.360
 And that can, that is really conceptually a part

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.040
 of the client, but it just happens to run on the server.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.360
 And so that would let us like iterate better

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.200
 and like move some things like more fluidly

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.740
 between both sides.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.800
 But for now we're like, yeah, like fucking react query,

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.360
 yeah, but I love it.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.520
 But it's just like we do a bunch of things on the client

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.000
 that really belong on the server

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.920
 and this actually negatively affects the user experience.

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.120
 So we need to like start fixing that.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.840
 - So it's interesting to think about your transition.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.000
 Like if a year ago you left meta

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.320
 and you went to BlueSky and now like you just got done

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.760
 like working on your baby with all this new React stuff.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.360
 And then you go and now you're working on a React Native app

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.640
 and you don't get all the things you just built

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.840
 at your disposal.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.480
 That's kind of painful like.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.560
 I mean, I wasn't like building all of that myself, right?

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.520
 Like mostly I was like, I was explaining

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.480
 and how this stuff works.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.480
 Like fixing some bugs and contributing in some ways.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.320
 Yeah, it's like people.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.640
 - But like into the ideas of it.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.480
 Like those are.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.360
 - Yeah, it feels like going back five years really.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.200
 It's like, oh.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:12.640
 - I mean, I know this stuff is like loosely defined

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.640
 but what is your relationship with React?

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.800
 And I've also always been curious,

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.320
 what does Facebook, like how does Facebook think

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.960
 about React and like staffing their React team

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.800
 and like how it gets funded?

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.000
 And yeah, like how do they think about all that stuff?

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.160
 - Hmm.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.720
 Yeah, I don't know if that changed.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.200
 Like I don't know what's the latest

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.640
 'cause you know what it has been.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.840
 There's a lot of investment into it.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:38.760
 And I think the way the investment gets moderated

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.080
 depends on like who is the person who's like

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.080
 in the org chain, who's like, who's dropping.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.320
 It is the convince the people above.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.760
 So like it's, I think like that approach

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.720
 is like maybe different.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.720
 Also depending like who are the people above.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.840
 So like that doesn't change a couple of times.

00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:00.400
 But I think like, you know, for a long time

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.520
 like React was kind of like a central thing.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.040
 Like that's how ads work.

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.720
 You know, like the ads, all the ads interfaces,

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.680
 all the like, you know, the whole money-making thing.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:14.600
 Of course, like it was used for like consumer side as well

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.920
 but it was used less, it was like like common share

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.600
 that was kind of like the initial place where it was adopted.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.840
 But the, you know, the ads manager,

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.880
 like the thing where you create ad campaigns,

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.680
 like that was like all React,

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.040
 like pretty kind of fast, you know,

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.640
 like it converted to React.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:33.360
 So that was like one of the biggest React apps out there.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.800
 It's a complete mess, of course.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:40.640
 Like it has patterns from 2012 mixed with like every

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.920
 like three years, somebody invests a framework there.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.880
 And so it's like it has like five different frameworks.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.800
 It's, yeah, it's completely wild.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.960
 But that was like a big, you know, like of course,

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.200
 like React team needs to stay funded

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.760
 because that is the primary thing that like all are, you know,

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.520
 - The money maker. - Yeah, yeah.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:04.120
 But then there was this whole transition to

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.040
 just like rebuilding the web experience.

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.640
 So that was like 2017 or so, Facebook.com.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.360
 And that was rebuilt and React.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.080
 And that was at the same time as we were like,

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.200
 well client only isn't going to cut it.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.000
 Like that's not really practical.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.600
 And a lot of people don't want to hear that.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.800
 But it like for like, you know,

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.360
 it faced with that was just like a non-starter.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.360
 Like it was obvious.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.440
 No, like if you rebuild the consumer experience,

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.680
 you have to use the service

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.120
 because like consumer machines just can't do a bunch

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.400
 of stuff the service can do.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.480
 And so, and it just happened that we were kind of invested

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.840
 into this like foundational, like a lot of our approach

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.200
 was really almost like theory driven.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.120
 It was like, well, it doesn't make sense to do this

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.360
 'cause here is a more efficient way to do it.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.360
 So like we might as well build this and it will make sense.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.920
 And then we found all the ways.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.320
 Yeah, it does actually make sense.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.680
 It does actually solve these problems.

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.600
 So we were working on like concurrency

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:03.640
 and just like rendering being interruptible

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.640
 so that, you know, if you start doing something else,

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.600
 you don't wait for the whole cycle to finish.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.920
 Like streaming, just like removing all water fully

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.720
 processes from like the entire thing.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.800
 And also kind of changing it so that the slowest,

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.400
 if there's like one thing that's slow,

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.000
 it doesn't penalize everyone.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.120
 It kind of penalizes the thing that's slow.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.440
 So you can kind of, because like if, you know,

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.160
 with a big company, there's always going to be like

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.360
 parts of the code that's slow.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:35.320
 So you kind of want to limit the kind of the damage from it.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.640
 So that like other engineers can kind of be like,

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.920
 oh, this thing, you know, this thing is in the pop up,

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.040
 but actually this pop up is like lazy.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.080
 So, you know, we're not going to spend CPU cycles there

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:47.680
 unless it's like, but we can like warm it up maybe.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.480
 And like React can do all this kind of coordination

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.120
 because it knows about the user interface

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.680
 and how you structure it.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.760
 And so we've been making all these improvements.

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.480
 And I think, you know, that with the website,

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.280
 like that project has worked out,

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.360
 although it was pretty wild.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.800
 Cause we're like rebuilding the foundation of React

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.760
 at the same time as like the entire website

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.680
 was being rebuilt on top of it.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.920
 So it was like quite like full of fires,

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.680
 but they worked out.

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.840
 And I think, you know, currently like,

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.680
 so she's the native in a bunch of places.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.720
 Like the Facebook app itself has like a thousand screens

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.440
 built with React Native.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.520
 They're not like kind of primary like scrolling experience,

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.080
 but there is, there's just like a super long tail

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.920
 of that stuff.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.680
 And some apps are fully built React Native.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.840
 And I think like, I don't know if it's still the case.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.600
 Like I think one of the kind of longer term,

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.400
 again, like, you know, we need to motivate like why,

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.640
 you know, why find React, right?

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.800
 I think from methods like one of the strategic,

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.680
 like meta doesn't have a kind of a platform, right?

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.960
 Like Google owns Android, Apple owns iOS.

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.880
 So meta doesn't really have like a first class.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:59.360
 Like here's our stack, here's our language, here's this.

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.240
 And React is very much kind of in that way.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.880
 Like I think if they go into, you know,

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:09.160
 their like VR, AR vision, like React is being used there.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.600
 So I think like there is a something like kind of like

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.760
 the long shot, I think is we need to keep investing

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.400
 into this paradigm and we'll make this like paradigm

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.200
 work really well on our, you know,

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.920
 own like hardware or software or like operating system

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:25.840
 or whatever.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.320
 And we'll be able to like have this developer mind share

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.480
 of like people already know how to use this.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.440
 So I think partially it's like that is kind of

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.240
 the longer term story, whereas the shorter term story

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.960
 is just like, well, it's like every,

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.240
 we have a lot of stuff that's built with it.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.880
 So I think that's kind of like how meta

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.440
 maybe the things about it.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.640
 - Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.480
 That's super interesting.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.200
 The platform thing I never thought about before.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.400
 And so now that you're not there.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.240
 - Well, don't hold me on this,

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.720
 but also like I'm not involved now.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.880
 So that's, you know, that's kind of my understanding

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.160
 of like how think about it.

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.000
 - It's a good theory.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.400
 So, I mean, now that you're not there full time.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.520
 So anything you do now related to React

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:04.680
 is just you personally doing that on your time.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.000
 Is that how that works?

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:06.840
 - Yeah.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.240
 And I don't really like, I thought I'd have more time,

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.480
 but honestly, like, yeah, we're just like,

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.200
 we need to fix like, why is the light blocks

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.280
 not showing the whole image on Android?

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.080
 Cause like the status bar height needs to be subtracted

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.720
 from like, cause it's growing issues.

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.080
 Sounds like, sorry, that's been my day.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.840
 (laughing)

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.440
 - It takes like four things in one day.

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.040
 I actually need to cut a patch

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.400
 cause like, yeah, people can start at the app.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.280
 But yeah, I'm not like super involved.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.240
 Like I'd like to maybe like come to meetings,

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.040
 but I think I was also ramping up.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.800
 Like I was just like, learning React Native.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.200
 And it was like how, you know,

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.760
 it was actually hard at first.

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.960
 I think I've mostly learned it now.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:50.480
 And I also moved a little bit into management.

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.560
 So like I'm doing like a mix of like management

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.520
 and I see work.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.720
 So I don't really, yeah, I don't go to like React meetings,

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.120
 but I, so I crashed them a couple of times

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.000
 when I had something that I cared about.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.520
 So I'm hoping maybe like, you know,

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:08.960
 with some time I'll be able to be like a little bit more

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.600
 involved, but I did send,

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.360
 I did send like a couple of pull requests for React 19.

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.200
 So.

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.040
 - Nice.

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:15.880
 Nice.

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.640
 - Can we shift gears into something completely unrelated

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.480
 to all this?

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.320
 - Yes.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.520
 - But I really want to get Dan's opinion.

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.400
 I mean, Dan, you've worked now at two,

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.320
 like major social media companies.

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.480
 You're obviously a very prominent participant

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.600
 in social media.

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.960
 And this is just top of mind for me.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.480
 Cause like the current,

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.480
 I guess the current meta on Twitter right now is like,

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.040
 but like kind of the framework thing

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.680
 where people are going at each other.

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.440
 Do you think the internet is mean or too mean?

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.880
 Like there's this kind of like cohort of people right now

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:51.640
 that are sort of very vocal about stop picking on me.

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:54.360
 And this is like, I've worked very hard on this.

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.240
 But then there's the other side where it's like,

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.960
 it's nice to like sharpen each other.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.520
 And we're like challenging each other and your app is broken

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.000
 and it's okay, my app's broken too.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.360
 Do you have thoughts on all this?

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.760
 Is the internet too mean?

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.600
 - Yeah.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.600
 I mean, I've seen some of it.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:10.880
 I think, I don't know if it's meaner than it used to be.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:16.520
 It seems, I think the largest shift like I'm seeing is just,

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:20.360
 I think people who are kind of like entertainers.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.480
 And I'm not saying this like, it is like a bad way.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.720
 - That's what I feel in the call now.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.200
 (laughing)

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.280
 - With their super fancy cameras like.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.520
 (laughing)

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:37.320
 - I think there's just like a lot more of that

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:40.080
 than it used to be like it's kind of like a bigger niche

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.360
 and like more prominence.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.480
 It's a valuable service in some ways.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.400
 Especially if you have some experience

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.080
 with like building things for production, great.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:50.920
 - Yeah.

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:54.640
 - 'Cause I think we don't hear, you know,

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:58.240
 from those people always a lot.

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.680
 So it's nice when people like share, you know,

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:05.680
 like things that they know in a digestible way.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.800
 I think some of the, I think it's gotten a little bit more

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.320
 dramatic than it used to, you know,

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.960
 with the whole like YouTube videos like,

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.720
 "Oh, I'm gonna make a video about this."

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.680
 And then there's like, it feels like, you know,

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.680
 you can just like, cool, cool, just like, you know.

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:25.680
 Like, it's in some ways it feels a lot.

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.800
 But I'm also like, I think I'm staying out of it more.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.280
 I used to enjoy it more and I think now I'm like,

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.720
 yeah, you know, whatever.

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:37.680
 But in general, I think, I like, I like the internet.

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.920
 It, you know, it has good and bad parts.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:44.280
 But I think it's, it's again kind of going back

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.960
 to this topic of communities.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:47.280
 Like I think different communities

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.120
 are gonna have like different norms.

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:52.840
 It's kind of fluid that like, you know,

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.680
 I like the fluidity of Twitter of like,

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.600
 you can't really say like what exactly is like this community

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:00.960
 because like some person might like start pulling it

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.440
 into like a different direction

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.600
 or there might be like a new branch of it and so on.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:09.160
 And so I think like I'm kind of interested in like building

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:13.720
 tools for people to kind of have this kind of like fluidity

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.240
 but also have discovery.

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:18.680
 And then, you know, if different communities have different norms

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.080
 and have like some ways to kind of enforce those norms

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:25.760
 or at least like just like be chill, like within their space

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.960
 and maybe like somebody else has like a different space,

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.480
 then we can like experiment with it.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.200
 I think that's, that's really valuable.

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.920
 - I think there is a place, I don't know like,

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.800
 I'm not smart enough to say what it should be.

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:40.480
 But if Blue Sky worked on the like the community aspect

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.200
 of like sub communities and having tools for that,

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.800
 I felt like we needed that on Twitter.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.080
 And when Twitter launched the communities thing,

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.640
 it's like something between Discord and Twitter

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.520
 where like Twitter is just like a mess of public everything.

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:56.360
 And we all kind of collide and it turns into just like

00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:59.560
 the drama, I mean, it really just kind of like devolves to drama.

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.400
 But like they built this, the Twitter feature for communities,

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.480
 there's an AWS community that I started

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.880
 and a lot of people in it, not a lot of tools for like

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.720
 managing that community.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.240
 And it just becomes this crazy filter for spam.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:16.120
 I mean, just like they did, they didn't really invest in it.

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.520
 So if Blue Sky could like make that thing

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.200
 that I feel like should exist,

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.600
 exist, that seems like a good, a good path.

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.120
 I just gave you my, my two cents.

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.880
 - Yeah, I mean, we're, we're pretty excited

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.360
 about this direction as well.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:31.320
 There's it, the other thing is just like again,

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.040
 like we're just building the foundation.

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:35.640
 So I think this is one of the things where

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.360
 maybe because it also kind of feels like a Twitter clone

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:39.200
 right now, right?

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.520
 And like in a lot of ways we're like,

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.840
 okay, let's not like reinvent the wheel.

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.080
 Like here is like, let's check how this thing works

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.200
 on Twitter just so we match the baseline

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.200
 of like what people expect and kind of this like

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.440
 accumulated wisdom.

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.760
 But I think yeah, like communities is one thing

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.440
 where we really think, no, like it should be,

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.680
 there's like a different way to do it

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.600
 that is more compelling.

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.720
 So stay tuned, maybe in a couple of months,

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.080
 you'll see something.

00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:06.920
 - We're reacting.

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:07.760
 - We're reacting.

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.600
 - Dead by that time.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:09.600
 (laughs)

00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:12.000
 - This is a thing with building companies or products.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.320
 It's like, it's the way it is but it's so frustrating

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:20.800
 because you have to spend a lot of time doing the baseline

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.160
 before you can do the things you actually wanna do.

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:26.360
 And like the baseline often means like

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.880
 get into a place where your company

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:29.000
 can even exist long term.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.800
 Like you have to do all this upfront work

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:31.920
 and it's not even like the thing

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.920
 that you actually really are excited about.

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:37.920
 So yeah, like this stuff requires just so much patience.

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:41.480
 It's just like, you just imagine all the things you wanna do

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.120
 but like you, it's not things that,

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:45.440
 it's things that you like get to do

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.280
 if you reach like a baseline the little success

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.760
 but it's like the only reason you started doing everything.

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:53.160
 So yeah, that's always been my like big pain

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.280
 with just building companies from zero.

00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.320
 It's waiting for that day.

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.400
 We can flip over to the fun stuff.

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.520
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:03.760
 - Well, this has been fun stuff.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.600
 Go ahead, Jax.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:05.440
 (laughs)

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:08.560
 I'm just gonna say, going back to the drama thing on Twitter,

00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.760
 I found it, it's really interesting

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.560
 to me how people interpret stuff online.

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.680
 I think people have like wide ranges of things.

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:22.560
 Like from my point of view, I have very clearly two tones.

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.760
 I have one tone where I'm just completely messing around

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.760
 'cause I think it's funny.

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.880
 And I have another tone where I'm serious.

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.320
 And to me, it's like very clear.

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.840
 Like when I'm just complaining about Next.js,

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:30.920
 like that's me being funny

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.160
 'cause I like being this funny character

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.360
 that just hates it,

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.040
 rationally, to like a crazy degree.

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.560
 And I find that fun and like a lot of people, you know,

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.400
 reply it.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:43.560
 And I had someone, I had a few people.

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.600
 - I actually think that's kind of mean.

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.040
 (both laughing)

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.400
 - No, I know it's mean, I know it's mean.

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.640
 But, okay, so here's a dichotomy for me, right?

00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:58.080
 I care a lot about Next.js users.

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:02.360
 I spend a lot of time helping them do what they wanna do.

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.320
 So the reality of it is like,

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:07.240
 like I actually spend a lot of time on this stuff

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.400
 and like I care about this community.

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.880
 But, for me to blow off steam,

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.040
 I like pretend like I just,

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.640
 I think it's the worst thing in the world.

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.480
 And if you notice, I never talk about the technical.

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:21.680
 I'm never like, here's a technical problem.

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:22.920
 Next.js, I'm always like,

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:24.560
 if you use Next.js, you're gonna be single forever.

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.200
 You know, it's just stuff that's totally

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.400
 (both laughing)

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.040
 not based in that reality.

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.800
 And for me, that's just, for me, I get that's annoying.

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.280
 I totally get that for some people.

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.800
 That's like the most annoying thing ever.

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:37.160
 But for me, that's just like my outlet.

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:40.640
 Like it's, that's like the way that I like, you know,

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.640
 enjoy myself.

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.920
 - For what it's worth, like I think, you know, like,

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.600
 like this format actually kind of humanizes it, right?

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.920
 Like I think like through the spaces,

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.080
 but like it was like a step in the right direction

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.240
 in the sense where it kind of lets people,

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.080
 you just kind of, when you see the person,

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.920
 I think it feels different.

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.520
 Like we, you know, you can be like a one-dimensional character,

00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.960
 but also there's like a little bit of like,

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.600
 Oh, here's like the 3D version.

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:03.840
 And then it feels a bit different.

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:04.920
 So yeah.

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:07.320
 - No, no, it makes sense because I realize,

00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:09.960
 'cause I'll get messages from people being like,

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:13.840
 kind of telling me like, hey, you shouldn't be like XYZ.

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.600
 And I'm realizing they only get some,

00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:20.360
 like they might see three tweets in mine in a row of like,

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:23.400
 I tweet obsessively, obviously everyone knows this,

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.640
 of like the 10,000 I posted.

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:29.560
 And those three communicate like a very one-dimensional

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.760
 person.

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.640
 And this is like so mind-blowing to me that like,

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.000
 someone might see three tweets in mine that seem really smart.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.920
 And they think like, Oh, Dax, they're really smart person.

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.240
 And someone else might see three tweets

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.280
 where I sound like an idiot and I go, Dax is an idiot.

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.080
 And I do this with other people,

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.760
 like I do this with people all the time.

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:47.400
 So it's just impossible to escape.

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.240
 And even if you're aware of it.

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:53.280
 So yeah, it's just this weird thing we all partake in

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:57.640
 and just leads to always like weird situations, I think.

00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:58.480
 - Yeah.

00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.440
 - And it's totally different when you've actually

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.920
 interacted with somebody, like you've,

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:04.160
 whether it's a video call or you've met at a conference

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.200
 or whatever, you hear their tweets completely differently.

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:10.280
 - Like Ryan Florence is that way for me.

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:14.480
 Before I met Ryan, before I really got his tone,

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.720
 it was just a completely different person.

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.080
 I just, I'm just thought he's an asshole.

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.520
 I mean, honestly, and just recently it's like,

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.440
 I've gotten to know him and now I hear it totally differently,

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:25.280
 but then I get to see people's reaction to him.

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.600
 And I'm like, yeah, I remember that.

00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.880
 - I remember the feeling that way.

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:31.560
 - Yeah, and it's like a global community, right?

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:35.040
 Like everyone has, like local cultures are so deeply a thing.

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:38.320
 Like I have like me and Adam are totally different.

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.880
 Like I am very like Northeastern New York style culture.

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:46.120
 And everyone I grew up with, when I act the way I do,

00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.640
 like it's like a normal thing.

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.000
 But then people from other parts of the world,

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.320
 they're like.

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.160
 - I feel like you're being me.

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.480
 - I'm like crossing lines or I'm doing things.

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:54.360
 - 'Cause in the Midwest, we don't say what we think.

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.400
 We just, we sort of like pretend.

00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.040
 - I wanna talk about a very sweet scenario.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.400
 I wanna bring up the errand situation again.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.840
 So do you know what Aaron Francis?

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.520
 Then he's a, he makes a bunch of content.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.240
 He worked at plant scale extremely, extremely talented.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:13.800
 Like one of the most talented people at like truly explaining.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.560
 - He's one of those entertainers that actually builds sex.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.440
 - Okay, yeah, I just didn't think of this in me.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.360
 - So he's very legit.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.920
 And we had, and then we were friends.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.240
 He got laid off from plant scale.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.000
 And like he was like trying to figure out what he was gonna do.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.440
 And I made a joke.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.360
 I replied to him making a joke of being like,

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.360
 oh, you're probably tired from begging people to hire you.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.280
 And a bunch of people saw that and they were like,

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.520
 whoa, that's so mean.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.640
 Like he just got laid off.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.400
 But in my like weird New York head,

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.920
 the way this works is I'm giving him a compliment

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.000
 because I'm saying I believe in you so much

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.680
 that you're so capable and talented,

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.840
 that I can say this joke about you

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.040
 'cause it's so obviously,

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.800
 you're obviously gonna like things are gonna work out.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.840
 And that's how I like operate with everyone.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.800
 Like when I'm close to people,

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.480
 I like insult them in that way

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.400
 with the underlying thing being a compliment.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.920
 But culturally, that's like a very weird specific thing.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.800
 And so we will relate to that some people don't,

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.000
 but yeah, online, it's like a mix of everything.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.760
 So it's weird. (laughs)

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:15.600
 - It is weird.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.680
 The internet turns out weird.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.720
 But Dan likes the internet.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.240
 I mean, we got that quote.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.480
 I think the internet is good, he said.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.320
 - Sometimes.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.760
 - Sometimes. (laughs)

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.280
 - I asked him that the internet was mean.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.200
 What I really meant was, do you think Dax is mean?

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.700
 And we got an answer. (laughs)

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:34.720
 We've been on Twitch this whole time.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.840
 We didn't acknowledge Twitch at all.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.000
 But Dan, we're on Twitch.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.560
 And there's various things.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:41.680
 - I used it a couple of times.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.040
 It's like every time I try to use it,

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.720
 it makes me watch an ad and I'm like, never again.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.920
 (laughs)

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.000
 - It's more of a place where us entertainers hang out.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.280
 It's not really a place for people

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.000
 who aren't in that world.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.640
 - But who has time to watch it all?

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.640
 I don't understand.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.880
 - Yeah, I don't actually understand the viewing experience.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.200
 I've tried, because I've got a lot of friends

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.080
 that stream on Twitch.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.000
 It's very hard for me to sit and Twitch chat

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.680
 and get anything done.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.680
 It's very exciting. - That's impossible.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.520
 Yeah.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.960
 This is another weird dynamic where,

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.120
 Dan, we were talking about YouTube stuff earlier.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.080
 I don't watch any YouTube at all.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.680
 I don't watch anything technical.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.680
 If I'm trying to get into a new technical topic,

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.160
 I'll just go watch like the top three,

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.880
 most important talks or whatever.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.360
 But besides that, I'm not like,

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.200
 then I'll get daily YouTube habit.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.760
 But this feels like a lot of people do.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.160
 And it's so wild to me because it's so different from how

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.800
 my day-to-day goes, how I learn things.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.240
 But we do produce this stuff.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.640
 We just don't, you know, consume it.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.800
 - I would love to see Dan on the Entertainer Arc

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.800
 to become a YouTuber.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.920
 - Yeah, I wish he became a YouTuber.

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:43.760
 I would love to see your thumbnails.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.120
 - That would be so amazing.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.400
 - Like I really thought about it,

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.880
 but I don't know, I think like,

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.880
 I don't know how partially it's just like--

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.120
 - It's got really good hair.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.120
 Like you would do really well on YouTube.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:53.960
 - That's like 70% of it.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:54.800
 - I really want your hair.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.080
 - Then you have to edit everything, right?

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.920
 Like you have to do this like editing thing.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.120
 - Not necessarily like prime.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.960
 All his YouTube is just like,

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.480
 well, I guess now flip edits.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.320
 I don't know.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.160
 I don't know what I'm talking about.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.680
 People get pretty raw though.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.720
 I think the Gen Z thing is to like be authentic

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.160
 and like don't edit it much

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.760
 and hold your microphone to your face like a little little.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.160
 (laughing)

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.160
 - I think they'd ever do that, yeah.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.800
 (laughing)

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.960
 - You'd do so good, Dan.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.880
 I would watch and I don't watch YouTube,

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.120
 but I would totally watch.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.040
 - I'll consider it.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:28.880
 - Okay.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.560
 If you don't come work at Samuze,

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.480
 the offer still stands.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.320
 - Right.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.840
 (laughing)

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.280
 - If you get tired of building the future of social media.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.120
 - Right.

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.080
 Then you could come work for me at Samuze.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:40.920
 It'd be fun.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.840
 We'd have a good time.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.760
 - I feel like we should get off here.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.200
 I don't know, Dan's got,

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.880
 I see responsibilities he's got.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.120
 It sounds like the port is currently not working.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.880
 So, yeah, it seems like we should let her in shambles

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:51.720
 all over the world.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.520
 - We have, actually like while we were talking,

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.080
 like there's, I'm just reading like our Slack

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.680
 and there's another Android problem.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.000
 - Oh yeah.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.280
 I feel like it's Android's fault.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.880
 I feel like Android's got to be more efficient for you guys

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.440
 to figure out how to eliminate Android market share.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.760
 Like that might actually be a better use of your time.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.520
 (laughing)

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.920
 - Thank you so much for coming on, Dan.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.760
 This is fun.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.880
 It's nice to meet a face to face.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.040
 - Yeah, thank you for asking all these questions.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.440
 Usually people just ask me about like Redux or something.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.920
 So that's, I appreciate it.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.760
 (laughing)

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.400
 - The thing you've built like 10 years ago?

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.800
 (laughing)

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.640
 - Yeah, no, no, no.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.680
 This stuff is super interesting.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.080
 And I think it was cool to see you move to blue sky.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.760
 Obviously, the thing with Twitter,

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:35.600
 what do they do?

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:38.560
 They like shadow band you 'cause you like mentioned blue skies.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.920
 - Yeah, the thing is like, I feel guilty,

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.120
 even like bring it it up 'cause it sounds, you know,

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.160
 like this kind of right-wing grifter nonsense,

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.000
 like I would try to see theory, yeah.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.160
 (laughing)

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.400
 - But you actually were.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.880
 Yeah, I remember, to be honest.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.640
 - Yeah, I mean, I ran an experiment.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:58.600
 Like it did, you know, the same tweet, both accounts.

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.320
 And like, I did a poll, like, which, you know,

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.280
 does it show up for you on following?

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.000
 And for the new account, it was an even split.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.200
 And for the old account, it was just like 95%

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.040
 or something like this.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.960
 - Wow, that's crazy. - That was in following.

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.320
 And then people who said like for you,

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.600
 they, like some of them later said,

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.880
 oh no, it's actually, I just clicked the button or whatever.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:18.720
 - Yeah.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.560
 - So.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.600
 - I have to say, as annoying that it is,

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.520
 it brings me a lot of joy whenever I read

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.240
 Dan Abramov II and you use your name

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.000
 'cause it's so funny, like.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.200
 (laughing)

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.720
 - You have to start over.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.160
 It's a, it's just such a funny thing.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.680
 - Has anyone, has anyone searched

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.960
 the open source Twitter algorithm stuff for Dan?

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.240
 Have we looked just to make sure it's right there

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.160
 in plain spite and just putting tight that they put it

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.160
 in the source code?

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.640
 (laughing)

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.040
 - That is really funny.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.880
 Okay, well, thank you for joining us.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.280
 Those are greats.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.120
 - Yeah, we hear you about this.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.520
 - We also don't have like an outro or a way to end the show.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.360
 So we're just gonna say bye.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.200
 - So we're just gonna say bye.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.040
 - So we're just gonna say bye.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:54.880
 (laughing)

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:55.720
 - Okay, thanks.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.560
 - Thank you, bye bye.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.720
 (laughing)

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.880
 - Yeah, thanks again.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:05:59.720
 - Yeah.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:00.720
 - All right, you can stop the recording.

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:03.300
 (upbeat music)

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.820
 (upbeat music)
