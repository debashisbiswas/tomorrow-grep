WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Look at you with your big headphones

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.520
 Do we want to talk about CSS? Yeah, I was gonna bring it up

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:38.660
 That's like see his raw CSS, and I think he's dumb. Let's start there

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.240
 Can I tell you my my little journey very classy journey that I went on mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, so back in

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.200
 2002

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.700
 15 or 16 I

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.920
 Wrote this library called Legos dot CSS. It wasn't really what it was just a big file

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.340
 And I was something I made public it was just oh just something I used across all my projects. Okay, mm-hmm

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.100
 And it was just an ever yeah, just an ever-growing list of every single utility class that I I use

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.760
 wasn't very like

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.760
 customizable or reusable it was just like

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.280
 my own flavor of stuff and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.740
 From 2016 to around 2019 maybe to right the beginning of 2020 I

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.980
 Built everything that way so that kind of spanned I think across two different major projects with

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.240
 No, much of like sub projects inside of them

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.920
 And I really liked it and it was great and all the reasons why people used to I went today like definitely

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.920
 Experienced that like having everything in line super easy to tweak

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520
 you feel pretty productive

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.800
 then in 2020 I

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.200
 Was like part of my team that I managed was in charge of building a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.040
 design system not just for

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.840
 the company to consume internally but also to publish externally because they had this whole system where

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.480
 Their parties could build UI extensions inside their ui so they were giving them

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:16.200
 Giving them, you know UI components to to build with that so in that process

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.720
 I was just exposed to like the whole wide range of ways you can do

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.800
 styling just because we evaluated like everything and

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.460
 Like you know, there were enough people on the team that particularly liked one thing versus another's like I heard all arguments and kind of understood it

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.240
 and ended up settling I

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.400
 Don't know we ended up sitting on there, but I personally ended up settling on

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.480
 Like the styled component approach

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.680
 the like coupling

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.400
 styling to like your frameworks we have describing components and I found this to be a

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.440
 Really good balance of it still felt pretty productive

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.920
 But then your markup looked really clean and easy to read etc

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.920
 And that's pretty much I've been doing things for the past since then since 2020

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:07.160
 It uh, I never found the exact right library to do this the little library called stock components. I thought I

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.320
 Just didn't like how it was just like random strings

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.480
 Then this library called stitches came out which was I think had some really good ideas and I used that for a while

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.040
 But that was like heavily runtime based I didn't do any kind of CSS extraction

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.340
 So it was just really not performant and eventually got abandoned because it just didn't fit with the future of where react was going

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.360
 And I jumped to another very cool micron and then then I went to something called panda

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.360
 And I just got to the very classic point of being like, okay, it's been like

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.520
 effectively like eight years since I

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.160
 Looked at raw CSS

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.720
 I am getting really tired of the levels of abstraction above it for all the same reasons people always talk about like, you know

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.040
 There's no build tooling stuff being broken more to set up like stuff changing

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.120
 And I just wanted to see okay, what does

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.960
 Raw CSS look like in 2024 and I just found

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.800
 It can do a lot of stuff that made it suck before

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.440
 or like it was missing a lot of stuff that made it suck before that now it's just there natively and

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.040
 There's a whole new way of expressing

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.520
 Stuff that like I think totally changes how at least my perception of CSS was and the second thing is I found like a really cool pattern

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:28.040
 From this library called Winnie UI it's good again. Like a design system, but I've mounted purely as CSS

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:36.040
 That I found to be pretty compelling so the combination of these two things has made me really really like writing raw CSS

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.360
 And especially with Liz working on radiant

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.080
 Having that extra abstraction layer when she like

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.720
 Understands HTML and CSS pretty well. They're just kind of slowing things down a little bit more than that needed

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.880
 So yeah, I've been having a

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.640
 really good time with it and I'm like really pleasantly surprised how

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.440
 How far things have come and you you're like putting your CSS in separate files

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:09.400
 That are like dot CSS files. Yeah, and you're naming. I guess all of your DOM elements or all your

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.460
 HTML tags you're naming them with classes. Yeah, so this is something I already dealt with because the style component approach

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.920
 Forced you to name everything which is an upfront pain, but long-term benefit because you can come back things are very very readable

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:30.840
 But hang on there. There's a few layers here, right? There is so there's like the design system for like the really common components, right?

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.840
 Like button checkbox

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.560
 Stack row and those are built with like

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.360
 Global CSS like there's these data attributes

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.600
 Have you on any element if you do data dash component equals button? It'll look like a button

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.120
 Whether that's an href or an actual button or like some other element

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:56.480
 That's because you've written a bunch of raw CSS that targets that so like build your design system that way, okay

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.600
 Yeah, why not just sorry the first question that comes to mind

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.000
 But why not just like button it's a class name or not? No, not as a class name

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.280
 Why not like write your design system in your CSS is just like targeting certain types of elements?

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.400
 Why I have to do the data?

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.360
 Yeah, because it solves a problem of you pretty much always want a button to look at button

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.880
 But sometimes a button is a link. Yeah, sometimes you have an anchor tag

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.120
 Yeah, look like a button or I got you imagine like all the react components

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.120
 They have all this like really fancy kind of complex ways to solve this problem to use a different kind of underlying

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:37.440
 Yeah, so I don't even need to wrap these in a react solid whatever component I can just use

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.480
 div

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.440
 But yeah, so like I do end up wrapping them

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.760
 I probably will end up wrapping them, but it's just not necessary. It's like a bonus. You can use it at the lowest level

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.840
 Yeah, and then the other pattern here is what I found to be really cool

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:00.200
 Yeah, is I learned a lot more about this has selector. Have you used a bunch? No?

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.480
 Okay, so wait, maybe another class like has checked and stuff like that. Yeah, but you can also check if

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.120
 The current element contains another one. So for example, yeah, right?

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.720
 I'll have an element button data component. Whatever. Hello. It's a bunzel. Hello, and I want an icon to it

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:25.300
 So inside I add another component. Maybe an SVG with data - slot equals icon because it's filling the slot

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:33.600
 Of the icon in the button. Mm-hmm then in the CSS. I can say if button has component has an icon component inside of it

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:42.640
 Yeah, yeah, a lot of that stuff used to do through JavaScript before where you would be like in your component

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:49.220
 You'd be like, okay, if there is an icon prop specified to add this additional class or Mm-hmm like has an icon or like add additional

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:57.000
 Tailwind classes, whatever it is. So now you can express like pretty complex logics just in in pure CSS

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.800
 And that's like really saved a lot of it like I basically don't I can basically add all those conditional logic inside just

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.000
 CSS, which means if I take the style sheet and I drop it an email

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.760
 Like it all all still work. I can now build my emails the same thing

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.360
 Which is true of tailwind - you can call it paste the markup

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.880
 But just implementing my design system at the CSS level and not at the component level

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.560
 Has been pretty nice. So

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.760
 It's so hard to imagine like I'm trying to think what would it take for me to actually

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:36.560
 switch from tailwind to this and it's the two things that everybody brings up that I get so hung up on I

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.600
 Guess the one is not that big a deal like talk back and forth between two different files

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.800
 Or buffers, whatever. That's not a big deal

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.720
 But the naming thing you don't struggle to like we have like three nested divs

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.560
 And it's all just because you have to do stupid like flexbox stuff and you're trying to figure out how to lay it out

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.560
 How do you name like the middle one like what is that thing? Yeah?

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:01.960
 But I think I think the problem here is not having a good set of utilities at the lowest level by the way

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.960
 I still have some utility classes in there

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.160
 Just kind of like how it did back in 2016

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:13.240
 I had just like some random utility classes that I I find like flex grow like I often you know, I'm just to fill that way

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:21.920
 But I have row and stack components and that solves like a lot of

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.440
 The one-off classes that I'd have to make in like a specific screen

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.800
 But you know it doesn't solve all of it like I'm thinking about screen right now

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.960
 I have like

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.520
 Like a root class and I have like a header class

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:40.240
 But then everything inside the header class is just a mix of stack row and buttons and there's a bread comb type layout

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.760
 I don't mind the the naming like I think stack and row like reduce let's say 50 percent of what you'd have to name

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.000
 And yeah, there is a trade-off. There is so just

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.160
 Just thinks the name, but I think you pay the price

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.640
 for not naming things either

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.960
 You have to pay the price up front by having to name them or you pay it later when you go look at a

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.760
 Bunch of nestidation L and you don't you can't really tell which

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.960
 Level something is happening yet. Yeah, I get it. But most people work on zero to one stuff. They don't think about

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.760
 Well, how am I gonna feel when I come back to this in a year, you know, right?

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:22.680
 What's the the runtime implication? It's the same. I guess like tailwind versus raw CSS. Yeah, I mean ultimately tailwind just compiles to raw CSS

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:29.960
 Right. I think my approach is worse and that there's this like I think tailwind is a nice property where there's this

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.680
 What's the word?

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.600
 Logarithmic curve to the amount of CSS produced because eventually

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:42.600
 You know, it'll have generated all the different utility classes you'll ever use for any of your whole app

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.040
 Whereas for me, like I might have two different classes

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:52.440
 Representing two different elements that effectively have the same style so that end result of the amount of CSS that produces higher

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.640
 I do wonder like it's funny because we all talk about this but like

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.800
 If you really think about what I'm saying, I'm saying that I am going to send more duplicate markup

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.120
 But you know what compresses really really well?

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.720
 Duplicate markup. So I do wonder in practice like

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:17.160
 With gzip effectively, it's funny. Gzip is like a generic way to solve the detooping problem

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.360
 Right, like tailwinds a very specific way to solve it for CSS. Yeah, but gzip has a general algorithm to solve

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.040
 It's true that so it's not gonna be as good, but you know, I've never I mean I would have never

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:34.120
 Complained about the amount of data going over the wire with raw CSS versus tailwind. That's not a thing

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.640
 I would think about it's really just the you know, here's the thing

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:43.880
 I think tailwind is the best experience for going from zero to one. Yeah, it's true like just staining something up and

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.600
 I just like going from zero to one

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.160
 So it makes sense that I like tailwind

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.840
 If I can avoid it, I'll just never go back to a project. Like if I can just go really hard on something

00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:00.520
 And then never touch it again. That's kind of my ideal. So I just I guess I'm optimizing for my ideal my ideal case

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:07.480
 Obviously, it doesn't work for like a startup. I've had for 10 years where I constantly have to go back to it. But for other projects

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:14.680
 It's great. Yeah, what I found interesting that tailwind does there's one section that I I think it's like really interesting because it's it's very different

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.520
 than how

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.520
 any other docs ever

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.520
 Talk speak to you. But there's a question of like what about

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:29.960
 Reusing stuff like if I have a button with nine utility classes on it and I want to use it more than one place

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.840
 Like how come tailwind isn't solving this for me? And before they show you how

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:40.440
 They can solve it for you through like features in tailwind. They're like

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.160
 Okay, first make sure that you can't just copy paste it and it's like gonna be too much of a pain

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.800
 Second check out your editor features like you might have a multi cursor feature

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:55.160
 So if you have a bunch of buttons like or like near each other you can do multi cursors edit them all at once

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.760
 um

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.240
 Or you know, maybe your framework has an idea of loops like if you're making a list of items

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.200
 Like you're probably only to find the mark of once and it's like running inside of a loop

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.520
 So it's not actually an issue. So they like really factor in

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.800
 The surrounding environment outside of tailwind whether it's your editor or your framework

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.560
 When saying like you should rely on on those things

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.760
 Um, I think that's true of my approach as well, right? There's a downside

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.360
 Uh, my situation where the markup

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.720
 is separate from the css

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.760
 So if I need to change the markup, I need to go update it everywhere

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.720
 Like if I this icon data slot thing if I decide to rename

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.840
 Data slot icon to data slot something else have to go find every place that it's there and update it

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.480
 But I can make the same argument, right? Like if you're using an editor where bulk operations are easy

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.400
 This is not really a thing you want to like solve for encode

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.560
 Um

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:59.400
 Yeah, I did I do find that line of thinking pretty interesting because I was like I was going over all this with with liz

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.200
 And we're reworking the radiant stuff to be more raw css

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.880
 Um

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.400
 And after I explain all the css part, I then explained

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.280
 Here are a bunch of editor

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.440
 Things you can do to make this less of a pain in the ass. That's all one thing

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.800
 It's not like the code lives on its own and I expect any editor to be a great experience with it

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.760
 We're both using the same editor. So I can say hey like just

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.640
 If you're working on a file like mark the javascript file mark the css file to these

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.480
 Keys and then just you can flip back and forth between them as basically like it's in the same file

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.520
 But you know, you can't do that easily with any editor. So I can see why someone's like this experience really sucks

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.840
 Uh, that made me think of two questions one

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:44.120
 When do it when do we all get radiant? I need to do some personal finance cleanup

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:52.120
 Maybe the beginning of the year. Oh, look at you. That's it's not a state where like we're able to use it. It's just

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.960
 Yeah, it's one of those things where there's some products where you want to get it out as fast as possible because like

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:03.160
 It's very undefined and you know what you're doing. Mm-hmm as other products that are

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.440
 just like

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.320
 So iterative on top of like stuff that's been tried

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.640
 You know, like for years and years and years and with these I think you can spend a lot more time

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.520
 Up front like getting certain things right because there's less. Yeah, that's variability

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.720
 Um, but I'm pretty happy with how it's coming out so far

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.600
 Uh

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:31.160
 Yeah, we're just focusing way more on like making giving you tools to keep your data clean and not at all on

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.200
 Here's how you budget, uh, which we might do one day, but for me the issue is always

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.080
 Like can I get it cleans out of data?

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.200
 Like can I automate everything so that stuff is remapped and like everything is clean and I do that once

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.120
 Um

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:52.680
 And there's just not good tools for that and it's funny because we could just eventually be an API only thing where you like manage all that stuff

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.880
 and then

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.040
 Other budgeting tools like implement specific budgeting ways using that data

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.080
 Or use export into an excel sheet and you do whatever you want

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.320
 Okay, I'm spending a lot more time on the

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.120
 Make sure we get all your data. Make sure it's as accurate as possible

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.880
 Spend like way more time on that than anyone else has yeah, that I would like that. I think I have that problem

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.360
 Uh, second thing I was gonna ask is what what's it like teaching your wife to code?

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.600
 This is a dream. I've had case. He's always resisted, but is it fun?

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:26.520
 Yeah, I mean, I think I can't speak to it generally because there's like I think everything I have to say is very specific to

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.800
 My personality interacting with Liz's personality and how our relationship works, but uh

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.440
 Uh

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:39.080
 I think Liz will admit this herself. She is not the easiest student

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.720
 Um

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.360
 But I'm also this way like I don't like I don't like I've never like learned something from someone

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:52.200
 So I can kind of relate to that never learn wait. I want to get that quote down. You've never learned something from someone

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.040
 That's what we would say. I'm saying I'm not someone that's gonna like

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.160
 Do a course or like

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.080
 You know have a teacher like I just it just doesn't that type of learning doesn't uh

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.960
 Are you tweeting this out right now? Yes

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:13.400
 Sorry, I just had to get that out there

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.680
 Okay, now continue defending your statement and what you actually I don't

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:24.120
 This the whole like mentor mentee relationship has just never been something that's clicked for me

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.520
 Um, so I can relate to that

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.000
 um, but her flavor of it is pretty funny because

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.480
 She like anytime I tell her something and it sounds a little weird or not

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.240
 Like what she expected

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.600
 She just convinced that what I'm saying can't be right and she like she like resists and fights a lot

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.680
 Um, yeah, and to be fair. I'm like pretty extreme about certain things. I'm just like

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:51.000
 Because my way of teaching is to like really go extreme in a way that might not even make sense. Do you understand?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.800
 Like something about that approach. Yeah, so she's she's like that doesn't trust me and half the time like

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.400
 It's like, you know, I'm like good at this, right? Like, you know, I've like

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.120
 I've done this for so many years and like a lot of people think I'm good at this stuff

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.320
 But you don't for some reason how many how many times

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:17.960
 I think you're good. How many times a day do you say to her? Uh, isn't it funny how i'm always right?

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:23.880
 It's not every day. It's usually like I build it up over

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.920
 A series of weeks and then I use it every once in a while. Yeah

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.080
 Wait, you don't think I think you're good at what was it? You don't think I think I'm sorry. I I met

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:37.960
 I was saying that to her. You met for her. I got you. I can find you 100 people that think i'm good at this, but

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:43.080
 For some reason you don't you're like instinctive to not think i'm good at it. That's funny

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.520
 Yeah, and to be fair a lot of the way that I teach is kind of like

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.240
 karate kid stuff where

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.240
 You just do not understand why the hell

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:56.040
 You're doing the thing and when you ask i'm just like shut up, you know

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.280
 So i've been doing

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:06.040
 That's funny. Yeah, but it's been good. I'm glad she's into it and I think she's

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.120
 There's like areas of it that clicked with her more and she's a lot more motivated to do it

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.760
 Like the shift back to css has her really motivated because um

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.560
 She understands that stuff well

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.240
 And just removing levels of abstraction is a it's always helpful when someone is

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.800
 Uh

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:29.880
 Can I make an observation that's unrelated all this? Yeah, that's just an overwhelming feeling and I can't go any longer without saying it

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:35.960
 I think exercise is really important. I feel very depressed and it's probably because for like a week. I haven't moved

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.200
 It's crazy how true that is

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:45.240
 It's really true. Yeah, I hate that it's true, but it's very true. Yeah. Yeah, like when I when I went when I go through periods like that

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.520
 I didn't like the day I start to snap out of it

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:56.600
 I just can't believe how good I feel and how long I went without that that said i'm currently in that kind of

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.840
 slump

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:04.200
 But I but this is the first time I don't feel that way. Oh, well, you're not far enough into the slump. Maybe it's no

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:09.000
 This is actually okay. So here's two things of it. I

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.840
 Don't really feel as bad as I normally do both mentally and physically and when I say physically

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:20.920
 I mean like when I like look at myself, I'm like, I usually do great in certain ways and I've gone through this

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:27.080
 enough times where I've like seen that but I feel like I just haven't and I don't want to like

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.520
 Completely correlate this because like who knows but if this whole like diet I'm doing

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.000
 I feel like it's like somehow related to that because the only thing that's changed takes some beef talent

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 Yeah, like my I like

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.840
 There's like I said, I've gone through phase where I worked out a lot and I stop for a month and I see exactly like okay

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.600
 My traps like decreased by this much like I can just like easily easily see that

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.680
 And did you say your traps? Yeah, for some reason whenever I work out like my traps

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.280
 Like really big really quick and then when I stop they like

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:01.640
 It's awesome. Hey, I mean, I don't know if it's awesome like it's it's like I actually don't like

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.200
 that part being so muscular but

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.800
 For whatever reason maybe the workout I do just a very like shoulder focus. Yeah. Yeah, that's so it's a nice stop

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.000
 I can just see that shrinking and it's like way the way I measure like how out of shape I am

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.360
 Yeah, it's been a very long time and they haven't degraded that much

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:22.520
 Um, I think I'm just consuming like way more protein than I that'll do it. Yeah, I normally do

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.880
 Yeah, I've just uh, I think it's been like three months that it's such a slow fade for me

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.200
 Like I stopped going to open mat. That was my main jiu-jitsu

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:37.960
 Practice and then it's like travel and stuff has just made it where

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.760
 It's yeah between travel and then just random life events

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.920
 It's like I was I was going from two or three personal trainer sessions a week

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.760
 To like two or one and then it was just one and then we like missed a couple weeks

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.840
 And then I got one in and then I missed another week

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.240
 So it was like once in a whole month I had gone

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.800
 And then kasey's been gone this week

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.720
 which has been the

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.720
 Just like the exclamation point on the whole thing because I literally haven't been able to go for walks

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.800
 like I've got the boys so I'm just like

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.880
 I I get no physical activity and

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.440
 It's just resulted in this culmination of like

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.600
 What happened? It's it's like it all snuck up on me and then

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.760
 I just realized how inactive I've been for like two or three months

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.640
 Yeah

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.560
 Like I was hanging on by a thread and then I just cut the thread this week and

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.280
 And it's all caught up in this like mental

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.600
 feeling of

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.640
 Like the coffees just not doing it for me. I'm not getting up every morning and like ready to tackle the world

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:43.560
 And I think it was mostly just the exercise. Okay. I hate it. I hate that that's true. My question is though

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.200
 I've gone through the same exact thing where like i'm on it

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.760
 And then like a few different things happen back to back and just totally knocks me off of

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:58.040
 The thing I was on all your habits. Yeah, but then what I just started doing was reducing

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.520
 the

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.920
 amount of friction it takes from

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:09.720
 To like just go do something because I it's like, okay. I used to go to yeah the equinox near me, which was a

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.560
 Five minute drive. So it's getting the car. No drive. Go do it

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.120
 Um and I come back

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:21.080
 Uh, then I was like, okay, that's even that burden like the moment my life isn't like

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.640
 Chill like I start to like fall off of that. So let me just go to the gym at the end of my street

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.240
 So then now the burn just get walking out of my house and walking down to it

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.520
 Then even that became like, you know

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.560
 A little too brittle then I was like, let me just work out my backyard

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:41.080
 And that like kind of helped none of this I actually solves a real problem, but it just feels like

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.400
 Like the margin for error is higher because I can always do something

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:51.000
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is that work for you or no? Uh, so here's what I would say

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.040
 I've definitely had this thought

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.160
 that

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.200
 You know, it's getting too hard to like sync up with my personal trainer

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.000
 It's 15-minute drive there, which isn't that much

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.800
 But it's like, I mean in the Ozarks, that's not very much. I know in a city. That's like forever

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.960
 But it's not that big of a deal to drive 15 minutes there 15 minutes back

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.080
 It's more that his schedule is very restrictive. So I have to go at like this time of the day

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.120
 That's so hard. Yes. Okay. So that that was the issue

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.560
 That was the exact issue of the gym on my streets because they're across for gym

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.800
 And I just wanted to use them for open gym and they only had like

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.240
 Like three slots in a day for like an hour and a half

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.720
 And then if I missed it, it was just it's very hard to have those kind of like restrictions on a day. Yeah

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.040
 Uh, so I think

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:41.720
 Okay, I'll just start working out at home because we have we have pretty good setup here at the house. Casey works out at home

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.880
 that's like

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.320
 super low friction

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.920
 The problem is

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:51.960
 If I start trying to do like especially string training stuff on my own without a personal trainer, I'm so

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.600
 I'm so unmotivated. I like

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:59.480
 It's easier. I think Casey has a good time because she does like hit workouts and stuff

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.520
 And I think youtube is rich with right those types of workouts

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.280
 There's plenty of them and you can just get on some plan and do a hit workout every day or whatever

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:12.520
 Strength training. Maybe it does exist on youtube. I've never gone down that if I just don't have a plan and I go into the gym

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.600
 It's two problems one

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.920
 I don't have a plan. So I just kind of aimlessly do a bunch of stuff

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.400
 And it just I don't push myself that hard

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.880
 And then two is the not pushing myself. It's the not having

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:29.640
 just like if I did have a workout not having the uh, discipline

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.480
 or

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.840
 Motivation to like really wear myself out. Yeah, like one session with my personal trainer

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.240
 He just kills me and there's stuff I would just never do to myself and like I hate every second of it

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.120
 But I know if I show up at the gym for that hour, he's gonna push me really hard

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.440
 I just can't do that to myself for some reason. Yeah, I really have to have that like accountability

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.880
 I don't know. Yeah, I mean that that's like the fundamental truth like so Liz has been working a personal trainer for the past couple months

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.640
 And yeah, it's like

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.360
 Like she's she's she's been on a pretty good run for the past two years in terms of like working out

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.840
 but in the past couple months just like

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:11.720
 It just works like when you work with a personal trainer like it just works and you just it just works

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.880
 As long as you show up. Yeah, but when I first got into working out

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.000
 Um, because I used to play a lot of sports, but I hated working out

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.760
 Then once I became like an adult and I wasn't playing as much sports. I was like, oh, I have to like

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:29.320
 Try to go. Yeah arbitrarily move my body in certain ways. Yeah, I got into it

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.320
 and we talked about before through um

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:36.840
 That mcguff workout thing I talked about where like it's like as much pain as possible

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.600
 Um, and I watched a bunch of videos with some like bodybuilders that like

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.560
 Just because they because they that's what you're describing is if you were trying to be a

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.400
 Like a bodybuilder mine is a star. Yeah, like the actual working out part

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.560
 uh

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.560
 It's just about like pushing

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.240
 To like your max when pain on your own every single day, right?

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.960
 So almost like entirely like a mental exercise and I really understood it

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:07.160
 Like okay. This is actually not my body physically failing. It's like i'm working out my mind to be like

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.880
 Yeah, I could quit at this rep

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.320
 Like my body can technically do one more. It's more that my mind is quick versus my body

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.160
 um

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.560
 So I didn't entering it that way like I and like the first

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:24.600
 Like six months of me working out was kind of in that mindset so that that kind of helped

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.680
 But the reality is is like even with that if I had a personal trainer, I would just do better

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.320
 That's just a fact

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:37.720
 So I don't know. I'm I'm on the fence. I really enjoy my personal trainer. We have a good report now

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:43.000
 But his times just don't work very well for my schedule and that's always going to be a problem

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.640
 And I feel like

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.120
 If I could find somebody that I could do it like early in the morning or something that would be less friction

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:54.120
 I don't know. I just got to start getting into it again. I got to get back into jiu jitsu

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.120
 That was a nice hobby. Yeah, give me like a reason to want to work out

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.600
 To get more fit to be better. The other pattern i've noticed in myself is

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.640
 Um, so I really like trying training. I love just doing everything at the squat rack

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.880
 Like just doing every possible exercise with the barbell

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.080
 And I'll usually when I get back on it

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.640
 I usually start by doing that because I enjoy it and I like really like doing that every day

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.640
 There's not like any resistance to me

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.840
 Going to do that

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.120
 Now do that for a while and I'll get to like a pretty good place and I'll be like

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:29.800
 Man like strung training is good. But like obviously for my health. I need to do at least some amount of cardio, right?

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.760
 But then I'll be like, okay before I do my strung training

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.040
 Let me just do just 10 minutes on a stairmaster or something and just like

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.360
 I'm like win myself and I'll do that for a bit, but I don't like doing that

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.080
 So eventually

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.560
 I stopped doing everything because

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.600
 I'm just like, uh, if I work out then I have to do the stairmaster and I don't want to do that today

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.680
 You know, so it's kind of like the one thing that kind of ruins the workout

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.280
 Yeah, so I've noticed that I've gone through this path a bunch of times where

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.160
 I'm like, maybe I should just

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.040
 Like obviously something is better than nothing

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:10.120
 But I'm like resulting on landing on nothing. Yeah, I have a hard time with this. Yeah, same problem. And I'm like, maybe I should just

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.160
 Find join some kind of sport and I can just count that as as my cardio

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:20.200
 Which is probably what bj was for you. Yeah, the best part about sports is like

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.480
 You wear yourself out and it's fun and you don't think about it

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:29.640
 Yeah, like so much of working out or just like running or walking even it's just like the whole time

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.640
 I'm just thinking about how I I hate this like this is pointless and I hate it

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.360
 Yeah, whereas like a sport you're into it. You don't think about it

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:42.120
 Uh, yeah jiu-jitsu is that for me. I think it still lacks something like the team sport aspect. Yeah, yeah

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:49.480
 It's different early like yeah early in adulthood. I was doing like the basketball leagues like rec leagues city league

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:54.520
 That was really fun. Do that too because it felt like yeah felt like high school sports again

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.000
 And it felt like you have that

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.840
 Like when the game starts, it's like intense. It's a different kind of feeling than just like a pickup game

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:08.600
 Uh, yeah, I don't know. I I need something. I need something like that too. Yeah, the user mind

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.600
 I think I told you about it before but

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.960
 Uh, I did the same thing. I did like a rec basketball league with my friends in in New York for a bunch of years

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.760
 The first year for some reason the league put us

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.680
 And with a bunch of other teams that uh

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.840
 Just were not at the same skill level is how I can put it

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:35.400
 We went to our first game and I don't think we scored a single point. I think we might have scored like it was that bad

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:43.320
 They and they just wouldn't stop like they they were up on like 50 points and they were just uh full core press and then like dunking

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.320
 Yeah

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:50.060
 And i'm like aren't you tired of this? Like we clean full core. Yeah full core press and rec league

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:54.200
 New York city. Oh man. Yeah, it was ridiculous. Uh, I love it. I'm like

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.400
 That was bad. Then then then they adjusted us and put us in some of them. I get in there. I put you in the

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.960
 appropriate league

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:06.200
 Oh, it's funny

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:13.160
 Uh, love to have some video of that. Oh, we do have a famous dax photo from your basketball days your rec basketball days

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:19.640
 Screaming that's not a rec basketball. Yeah. That's just us. That's just us. That's just us. Yeah, okay, pick up in New York

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.280
 But I think I just so I I did

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.560
 Go to one ultimate pickup ultimate game like a year ago when I first sort of like

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.120
 I forgot I first went to Miami. Mm-hmm. And

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:35.320
 I remember the next day my whole body was like, okay, this is insane

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.200
 Like I can't believe all these places that hurt, but

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.880
 That's not a bad thing. That's a good thing. That's like, okay. This means this type of thing

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.200
 I totally enjoyed doing it played for two hours

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.960
 And pervert workout. I just need to like get back into that

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.960
 And then I never have to be like am I doing enough cardio because I have right I can just do this run training

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.680
 Which I which I enjoy the other thing is I guess

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.640
 I don't know how much I want to count this, but

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.080
 I do technically like

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:08.360
 Wind myself like get out of breath every single day because and as you know in the morning

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.120
 I blow bubbles but in the evening to go get the second type of playtime

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.800
 and

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.800
 All I do is take this ball this like big green soccer ball type thing

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:22.120
 And just try to keep it away from him like either like we played basketball on like dribbling

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.960
 I try to keep it away from him or like

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.960
 Yeah, soccer mode where I do it all with my feet

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.400
 And I've never played soccer before and I've just gotten so good at not so good

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.480
 But just like I picked up on all these like dribbling tricks just from trying to keep it away from him

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:41.080
 And it is yeah hiring. It is so a lot of time because he's so fast and he can like change directions in like a second so

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.720
 It is just like

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:48.120
 Really tiring and I can usually only do it for like 10 minutes or so before I'm like completely

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.640
 Wiped out so my activity I guess doesn't go to zero, but I don't know how much I can count that

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:59.320
 Soccer is amazing like I'm even just dribbling just moving around with the ball is tiring

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.560
 But like the field is so big in college. We we played like a pickup

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:10.280
 Soccer game in college once and like none of us played soccer, but it was like we went to the college soccer field and just like

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:17.400
 Played a random game. It is so huge and like the amount of running you do playing soccer

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.640
 Like I remember playing as a kid, but I never realized and as a kid it's not

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.160
 I'm not going to play as a kid. I just based it somehow. I just miss soccer

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.960
 It just didn't yeah, it was another thing I ever did

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:35.560
 I guess here at least in the midwest every kid plays soccer and then like nobody played like the high schools don't really have soccer

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:39.800
 There's not enough. I don't know interest. Maybe that's changing, but

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:47.560
 Uh, yeah, just like didn't really have any idea how large how large a soccer field was until college and then

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.760
 We all just died one night trying to play soccer

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.160
 I mean if you look at we're in pretty good shape. You look at a lot of like

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:59.480
 The best soccer players. It does feel like a big part of their skill set is conserving energy for the right moments

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:05.880
 Um, that makes sense like they're not sprinting all the time. Like if you watch what's a messy just walking all the time

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.520
 Yeah, that's true. Okay, and all of a sudden he's just like they use they choose their moments. Yeah, yeah

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:15.080
 Uh, and the whole like faking injuries thing. I think that's like a big part of just getting a break really

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:21.560
 That's a like part of the soccer culture. Yeah fake injuries. Yeah interesting. No, we should say football

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:27.640
 I guess for our international audience. Well, I was gonna say I was gonna talk about actual football. Um, oh, yeah

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:30.200
 american football jay is a

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.680
 Really into the nfl?

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:39.560
 Just as a oh, yeah, he is. Yes. Same as a i was gonna say user. But he's as a fan as a fan

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:45.560
 Also, he's called fans interested in the business of it and he was telling me a lot about of the nfl

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.360
 Yeah, I think like he takes a lot of inspiration from the way they think and he was like they

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.120
 view

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:57.640
 Their sport more than everyone else as a product that they're trying to like scale as big as possible

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:03.800
 Which means they're like constantly tweaking the rules and trying to figure how to deliver the most entertaining product

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:10.440
 Possible, which is different from how other sports like not every sport is a naly like this like I think he was mentioning that

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:17.240
 Baseball people feel more like there's a tradition to this and like we need to like stick to the tradition and honor it

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:23.160
 Yeah, whereas nfl has like blown up like crazy in the past. I guess I know five 10 years because

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:27.880
 They just view it is totally different thing. Yeah, it's so interesting

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:32.520
 I'm also an NFL fan and obviously like I keep good tabs on all the leagues

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.640
 Uh, just with my line of work

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.880
 Bay baseball has like made some attempt at least in the last couple years

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:46.760
 They've got like the pitch camp thing or the timer. Yeah, they're just so far behind like nobody wants to watch baseball

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:51.480
 And that's their the inherent problem with baseball. It's like everyone's standing around. It's not very fun to watch

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.400
 Yeah, it's still boring

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.960
 But the NFL has like all kinds of problems to solve because

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:03.960
 One they're yeah, they're always trying to make it a better product and they're trying to like spread it and take over the tv

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.480
 Calendar because they've just got this huge lead in the us on all the other leagues

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:13.960
 Uh, so they're like I think the chiefs play on every game every day of the week but Tuesday this year

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.200
 Like they've now got christmas day games. They had a black friday game this year

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.720
 They're just like very aggressively trying to take over

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:26.120
 The tv calendar for the months that the NFL season's active

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.920
 but they also have to deal with like the fact that

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:35.240
 NFL athletes are insane and every year they just keep pushing the boundaries of like size and speed and strength

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.440
 And they it's like they will kill each other

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:44.840
 If they don't put certain rules in place to just make the game more safe. So that's the other thing they have to deal with is like

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:51.000
 You've got this sport where there's collisions. It's very violent and you've got athletes who are just getting more and more

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:57.800
 menacing uh and then a public that's more and more aware of like the brain injury side of the NFL

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.680
 So that they've had to do all these things to make the game safer

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.840
 Which could work against some of their goals with making it more entertaining

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:11.400
 It's it's an interesting league to follow over the last decade like they've made all these changes that that you've got the old timers

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.120
 Who feel like it's not even football anymore? You can't even hit the quarterback

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:21.080
 But then at the same time like it's a better product than ever and it's more entertaining. There's more points or whatever

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:28.920
 Yeah, I could talk about the NFL a lot. It's it's interesting. Well, he was saying who sent me that like it's be it's been such like this iterative

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.560
 Optimize for you know the things you talked about process that no one even knows the rules anymore

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.280
 But like it doesn't it doesn't really matter at all

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:41.560
 Yeah, yeah, no, they they have like weird defensive things like you can't

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:46.840
 Specific kinds of tackling and people don't even know what like what is a hip drop tackle

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.760
 But like you can't do it and randomly it'll come up in some game because somebody got hurt

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.640
 Yeah, it is interesting that what's

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.920
 Interesting to me is that this year

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:03.880
 So like they've done all these things to try and make it more exciting and more points and like generally favored the offensive side of the ball

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:08.760
 It's like the defensive-minded people in the league caught up in this year

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.080
 There was like this the first half of the season was just like terrible offense and like defenses

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.920
 We're just limiting scoring it kind of unprecedented levels

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.120
 And I think that's gotten a little better the second half of the season

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.400
 But it is interesting like they can do all these things with the rules to try and make it

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:28.360
 More exciting and then like defensive coordinators can just figure out how to make it not exciting again

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.080
 Yeah, I mean I think everything in life works that way

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:37.000
 There's like rules that work then eventually they get optimized out and yeah, I come up with a different really happens

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.600
 Or it's happens in politics. It happens like happens everywhere, but I mean that's what's cool. It's like constantly

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.320
 Evolving and not at all static

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:52.600
 Like an f1 like there was just an era where mercedes just one every single race every single race

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.360
 I've got to get into f1. I've heard people talk about this. Yeah, and it was like so boring

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.760
 and yeah for like one driver, right was really

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.400
 Louis Hamilton, okay, so

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.240
 It's always like oh, he's so great

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.680
 Like he like he literally wins every single like when I got into it

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.160
 Was a round when he started to win a lot and so like this huge period of time

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.880
 It was just like I ignored first place and it was more looking to see what was gonna happen in second or third

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.600
 Yeah, I was like oh, Louis Hamilton so great mercedes so great

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.880
 And it is like a team sport at the end of the day like with a lot of coordination going on

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.360
 then um

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.360
 there was one race where

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:34.520
 There was a team that typically came like in the bottom like maybe a lot they were always friends like last one or two

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:42.600
 I forgot what the reason was I think it's because this driver of that car is like super young and he was technically like sponsored by mercedes in some other way

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:47.160
 They let him go in an f1 car. Sorry and a mercedes car

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.800
 He like he like drove for that team. Yeah

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:56.520
 instantly was just in first place the whole like I'd never seen him do anything at all and then he was just

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:03.720
 like immediately like the best driver on the track and some crazy freak thing happened where like he got a tire puncture

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.280
 And he ended up like losing

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:11.880
 But he was literally about to win this random ass person just put in this car that he hasn't even practiced in that much

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:18.680
 Is now like phenomenal. Yeah, so is more. It's more the car. Yeah, just in the engineering side

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:24.120
 They're just like totally killing and an f1 added a rule about they added just like caps on the

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:29.480
 Like what's called the there's a name for this in sport show when they cap how much a team can spend

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:35.160
 Yeah, what it's called. Oh like a salary cap kind of thing. Yeah, like a luxury tax or whatever luxury tax

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.200
 Yeah, yeah

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.360
 So I forgot what exactly they did and you know it made stuff a lot more competitive

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:46.200
 But uh, yeah, it was funny to see like for years or everyone's like and obviously those Hamilton is still a great driver

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:51.560
 But it just felt like he was the one winning and then just someone else uses his car and they're like

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.360
 Almost as good

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.400
 Yeah

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.040
 The interesting I know I've heard some of the f1 stuff

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:02.760
 Like that the winning it's like as you win as a team wins

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:06.440
 They get an advantage in terms of their budget or something

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:12.120
 So they kind of get ahead on the r and d side because they're allowed to spend more or something

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.160
 I don't know. I've heard that it's it's complicated because

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.040
 the mercedes team

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.040
 is attached to mercedes like

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:25.080
 Multi-billion dollar corporation and like that's where they draw funding from

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.360
 But there are teams on the track that are just like

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.800
 Some random billionaires team and i'm sure they get asked to a lot of capital too

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:36.680
 But obviously not the same level as like this is the marketing arm of mercedes like doing these f1 races

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.480
 Right, um, so I think that created a lot of imbalance

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.040
 Yeah, it's uh, the thing with f1 is

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:47.160
 They also have a similar problem where it can be quite boring and it's really hard to

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:52.200
 Make it better just because there's like you just can't control it. It's just a race at the end of the day

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.040
 Like how much can you change about it?

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.080
 Yeah

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.280
 The moments where it's not boring are some of like the best

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:01.160
 Things in sports

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.600
 Yeah

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:07.640
 But they're far and free between in most races you like go into it excited to see that but then it turns out

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:12.840
 The three fastest people will just stay in positions one two three for the whole two hours

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.000
 Nothing really really happens

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.160
 So a lot of the reason f1 blew up was not because of

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.800
 People watching the races it was because of the netflix series

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.840
 Uh, drab to survive. Yeah, because i'm part of this

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:31.720
 The reality show aspect of it is super super interesting

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.040
 There's like so much drama behind the scenes

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.160
 Um, just a lot of like complexity with like

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:42.040
 The teams being pissed at the drivers their drivers being pissed at the teams and like a lot of this stuff

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:46.840
 The complexity going on like you would just never see if you just watch stuff on the track and it also involves like

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.880
 Traveling the world it's like a very like rich sport, right?

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.480
 It's like there's like

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:56.840
 One of the racers is like a billionaire son and just weird to think that there's like a billionaire like zooming around this track

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.120
 um

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.160
 And like he's like dad bought the team and then like it's just

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.720
 yeah, there's like all is like

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.360
 appealing stuff that's very entertaining but

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:12.280
 Way wider appeal with that stuff than just literally watching the race. Yeah

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:18.280
 Yeah, documentaries are so good because you do you get this peek into worlds that you don't even know exists

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:23.800
 Yeah, I enjoy sports documentaries a lot too. I find it fascinating like the behind the scenes of

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.640
 What just a giant industry that is sports

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:32.520
 Yeah, I watched some of the like there's some NFL stuff that's interesting

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:39.560
 Receiver and quarterback series. Oh speaking of media. I started well. I did listen to the first

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:45.000
 Three-body problem book here. I finished it last night. How'd you like it? I didn't even know I was about to finish it

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.160
 I didn't even know it was almost over. That's the interesting thing. Sometimes you listen to an audible book

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:53.720
 You get really into it and then just suddenly it's like they're doing the credits. What that's the end?

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.800
 Uh

00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:01.160
 It's so good actually. Yeah, really good. I'm I'm on the second book now. I don't know how many books there are but

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:07.800
 I'm gonna try the the series. What are you making laughing because you're you're tweet about the names

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:12.200
 About like not being able to tell us. Oh my god. Okay. I still don't know

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:17.720
 Who half the people are because the names are chinese. You don't recognize them. It's uh, yes

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:24.680
 And it's not very similar. So it's funny you say that because you who are like you commented on how it's difficult because you're like listening through it

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:30.040
 Through audiobook. I read it. Mm-hmm. And I had a situation where I thought there was

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.200
 I didn't realize two characters with the same character just from different time periods

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.040
 I thought they were totally different people. I didn't realize till the end of the book like oh, yeah

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:42.600
 That was the same name as the beginning, you know, I really need to look at like a diagram

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:47.000
 that's like a tree like a family tree of characters from this book because

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.280
 like I know a couple of them

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:56.680
 Distinctly from the others, but the number of characters could be twice as many as I realize

00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:02.040
 It's you know, dashi. That's one of the matters. It's only I remember dashi. Is that the tough cop? Yeah

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:07.880
 I said that he was the only character that said like the tough cop is like literally the one guy

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:13.400
 Because like he has a different voice in the audible book. Oh, yeah, and it's like this very like grungy

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:17.320
 Like I mean, you're reading my tough cop voice. There's not really a main character in that book

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.520
 But that's like the most main character of the characters

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:26.920
 Oh, really? Well, I guess in my memory. I would think yow. I would guess he I would guess yow me or whatever

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.040
 Not yow me. That's a bad one player. I'm so sorry

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:34.360
 It's close to that her name is like yow

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:39.800
 I would have thought she was the main character like the one from the beginning of the death is the spoilers

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:45.560
 But like the one who sends the thing at the beginning. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no not at the beginning

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:49.880
 The one who sends the thing. This is in the middle of the book bounces it off the sun

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:54.840
 I don't want to say what she sent. Yeah. Yeah, I know I would call her the main character

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.400
 I can't that was the beginning of a book. Oh, really?

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:03.320
 Interesting. Okay, I felt like that was squarely in the middle the beginnings all blurred to me to be honest

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.360
 It was like story about her dad yow's dad

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:11.720
 I don't remember his name and what she witnessed again. I don't want to give spoilers. Yeah, it's a great book

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:17.480
 You should read the book. So watch the series whatever the reason I said there's not really a main character is because the book

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:22.840
 And you can probably see you can probably already tell the story is set up to span like hundreds of years

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.880
 So it's just gonna transition through different people

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:33.160
 Um, the second book is by far the best one. It is oh really good. I've never heard it. They talk about

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.560
 I remember like literally to the last page

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.440
 But the best moment is understanding

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:44.680
 Like basically the the excellent the thing you're trying to understand the whole book is literally explaining the last page of the book

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:48.120
 So like up to the point of you guys and you're just like really into it and the

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.720
 Accimation is so satisfying now. I'm super pumped and in the third book

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:56.280
 What's funny about the third book is so he said he sets up the story right the thing you've read so far

00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:01.160
 Halfway into the third book that story concludes effectively

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:05.400
 That but it's still half a book left and he just goes nuts

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:11.160
 It's just like the craziest impossible to understand physics shit like you've ever seen

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:13.960
 after it just becomes so like

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:18.360
 Beyond the realm of anything understandable. Uh, it's still really good and interesting, but

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:22.760
 Yeah, it's just like really wild. Is there just three books? Is that there's three books? Okay?

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.520
 So

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:28.520
 I'm realizing like it's this is the dumbest observation ever

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:33.400
 And I feel like it's hard to even say this out loud without sounding super dumb

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.080
 But like it's finally clicking to me that like science fiction

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:43.720
 Is like science and it's super interesting like they make up science, but then there's probably also

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:51.080
 Science no, so you so this book three body problem is in a specific sub genre of science fiction

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:54.840
 And there's like a whole spectrum of this so there's a sub genre of science fiction called hard sci-fi

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.600
 and hard sci-fi is a lot more what you're describing where it's like

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:04.920
 Actual science that is all really probably most of it's very like correct and they're extrapolating

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:11.080
 Stories and ideas out of that and this I would say is on like if you're trying to get into hard sci-fi

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:18.040
 This is like the easiest entry point into that. I personally think anything past this level of hard sci-fi is like pretty niche

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.000
 but

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 I into this book is unique in that

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.240
 um

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:30.440
 He did something in that category, but it was so like widely accessible and enjoyable. So he's very good at this and then um, yeah

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:36.680
 Okay, the other sci-fi author that's like probably the best of our generation is uh, the guy that wrote michael crayton. What?

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.720
 I don't know

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.560
 I made Jurassic park

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.080
 Yeah

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:48.120
 He made other stuff come on don't don't don't like belittle his career

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:52.120
 I mean, I love Jurassic park. I love dinosaurs. So I'm not belittling. There's there's a bunch of them. No, I know

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.520
 Keep going

00:48:54.520 --> 00:49:00.040
 Man, what's a bank as in the guy that wrote the short story that became the movie arrival. I'm familiar with the movie

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:05.160
 I didn't know there was a short story. Okay. Uh, it was also asian. Um, but he's american

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.200
 gathered that uh

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.680
 his writing is like

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.680
 Insane like he like as a writer

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:19.560
 There's this one short story me and liz listened to when we were driving from near to Miami

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:25.720
 It's called uh things called exhalation. Mm-hmm and the and she describes it in this way. I think it's totally accurate

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.520
 She's like there wasn't a single

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.840
 Extra word

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.120
 In the whole story. It's like so so so so beautifully written

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:41.320
 like just as like uh forget the science part just as like a story as an expression of ideas that makes you feel something

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:45.240
 And on top of that it is one of the most fantastic

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.960
 explanations of the idea of entropy

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:54.360
 That has ever been like thought of. Oh, so this person can like deeply understand science scientific concepts

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.560
 and also turn it into like

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:03.720
 Some of the best works of arts ever made and just like yeah, so mind-blowingly like so mind-blowing talented

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.840
 You have to be so talented to be able to do those two things and uh

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:10.680
 And the same thing with three body problem, right like one moment

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:15.240
 He's like creating like plot devices out of like physics that involve like planets

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:21.400
 The next moment he's like doing computer engineering. He's like, you know the whole thing where they like do that calculation

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:26.120
 Uh-huh like he understands how computers work understands like that

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:30.120
 You know a computer can be made from anything and understands that idea and turns out into like a plot device. So

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.480
 uh, it's really wild these people are just like

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.080
 Not human to me. Yeah. Yeah, so okay

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:42.280
 So I like hard sci-fi because I think the project held mary book which I've talked about before on the podcast

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.360
 It's kind of more in that direction too. It fits in that direction

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.080
 Yeah, because it feels like you're learning stuff even

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:54.680
 The hard thing for me is listening to these authors like Andy Weir. He also did the martian martian. Yeah, i'm also listening

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:58.920
 Yeah, also listening to that one. I guess i'm getting into hard sci-fi hard sci-fi

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.280
 uh

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.800
 The the hard thing for me is not knowing what's true

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:09.320
 And what is made up because I assume some of the stuff they're talking about they can't really know

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:13.880
 Like it's beyond the levels of science that we as humans have uncovered

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:19.800
 I think everything in the book is plausible. Like it's it's that like plausible. There's nothing about it

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.400
 That's just like oh that's wrong

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:27.800
 Um, it might be like really hard to pull off or really unlikely but our current understanding of the math and physics like allow for that

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.680
 So let me give you yeah, let me give you an example and i'm sorry

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.320
 If this is spoilers just go ahead and stop listening if you don't want

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:38.360
 I don't think it's spoilers, but i'm gonna give you an actual example where my brain is like

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:44.120
 I don't know what to think about this the proton stuff, but like so fun different dimensions

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:49.480
 Yeah, the sofon uh the different dimensions holding like into the tiny

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.440
 Yeah

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:55.640
 That stuff is all that like based in real science because that blew my my what

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.920
 Like there are 11 dimensions. No, sorry. It's not that we know for sure. There are

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:05.240
 11 dimensions, but we have okay sort of models of physics that require

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:11.160
 There to be you know x or dimensions. I think the 11 dimensions think okay shrink theory, but I don't remember exactly

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:15.960
 So like do you know how many you're gonna say something confidently either way?

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.640
 So I love this conversation because I can just I can just ask you questions and you'll give me something

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:25.320
 Uh, like art. Do you know what level we're on like how many dimensions do we actually know about okay?

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.400
 So I mean that something we are

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:34.840
 We are living in okay. It's a little hard to explain and we are three-dimensional creatures living in a four-dimensional space

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:38.600
 That makes sense because of time yeah, because we can traverse the fourth dimension

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:45.960
 We can traverse physical three dimensions and you can't traverse the fourth dimension if you are a oh interesting fourth dimensional being

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:49.240
 In a fifth dimensional space you can you could traverse time exactly

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:55.400
 By the way, this is kind of a spoiler for the book like he did. He is really far. It's not really a spoiler

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.400
 But I'm saying he goes really far into this

00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:03.640
 Dimensionality idea. It's actually really brilliant. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, so maybe that gets more into it in the second book

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:07.080
 Because I don't think we we just kind of like briefly touched on it in the first book

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:11.720
 Okay, I'm very excited for the second book now. I'll be honest the start a little slow for me

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:14.360
 There's so many moments in these books

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:20.040
 Well, I guess not so much like I listened to project home area. I don't feel like there were moments in that book

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:23.720
 Maybe he's just smarter this author and I'm dumber

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:28.120
 With the stuff he's saying there's just like stretches where I just get so lost

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:32.760
 And I just feel like I kind of like tune out because I I'm just not able to follow

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:36.360
 There's the beginning of this second book. There's this whole like ant thing

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:41.400
 And to be honest, I didn't understand a single bit of it. I think it's so be so good though

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:45.160
 I have to go back and listen again and actually figure it out

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:48.040
 Uh, and maybe Liz is also on that point is out

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:53.480
 That whole ant thing has nothing to do with anything. It's just him showing off

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.600
 It just felt like this

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.920
 Yeah, it just felt like this whole thing this whole puzzle

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.760
 It was like a little side quest

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:02.760
 And I have to go back and listen to it again to like know what the numbers are and like figure it all out

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.160
 No, it's not it's it has nothing to do with the plot

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.080
 It's just he just had this thought this interesting observation

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:12.600
 And he found a good way to express it but has nothing to do with the rest of the book

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:18.440
 I mean yet. I got the sense that it's like this is optional. This is the thing I don't need to actually understand

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:24.840
 Like it's interesting that like the ant is like near this conversation and like that's what a cool perspective

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:30.680
 But like I know I didn't get it and like the numbers of things the ant was following on the ground

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.520
 Like I just know I missed it

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.400
 And I can't decide if I want to go back and listen to the whole thing over again

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.840
 No, you don't have to there's moments like that in these books where I just feel like

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:45.000
 I didn't need to understand that to know the plot of the book. Yeah, it was just like a cool side quest, but like

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:50.520
 Not knowing when I should try to understand versus just like ignore it. I think with all

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:54.760
 Creative works. There's some stuff that's for the audience and there's some stuff. That's what the author

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:59.800
 And oh interesting, you know, sometimes the author will indulge and as they should

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.720
 Um, yeah

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.160
 Yeah, but anyway the second I don't know if you got did you get to hold like wall facer

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:09.560
 Program, no, okay. No, I'm very

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:16.520
 Basically a second book. There's this program they start and it's like so interesting the way they like

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.760
 approach it

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:22.680
 With a lot of these honesty. Oh, go ahead. As I said, with a lot of these books

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.720
 Uh, I always find that

00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:29.320
 Some books like the plot is so good that you just want to know what happened

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.720
 So you're just like trying to blow through it as fast as possible

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:36.040
 And I did feel that way a lot with the with this series. So I probably ended up skimming over

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:41.080
 stuff. So what's interesting to me is

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:47.640
 So I listened to these books at like one and something 1.7 or whatever 1.8 speed

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.960
 there's like

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:53.800
 Different seasons because I started this book probably like two months ago

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:59.640
 And I only listened to a little bit and then I like missed a couple weeks and then I listened to a little bit. It's like

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.840
 It's hard for me to tell you

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:07.400
 How far into the book certain parts of it are because of the different

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.280
 Listening patterns like over the last week. I've listened to tonne

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.360
 I listened to most of it in the last week

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:17.000
 But like if you go back to the beginning of the book, it was two months ago and it was in little spurts

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:23.640
 So what my observation here may be completely off like I I just have a hard time with knowing

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:28.600
 You know the chronology of the book, but it felt like I listened to half the book

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:34.600
 And was like this is stupid. I maybe it was the not understanding which characters were wet

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.840
 It just felt so slow

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:39.720
 And then there was some point like three-fourths of the way into the book where it was like

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.560
 This is the greatest thing I've ever listened to in my life

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:46.120
 And I'm so hooked like I have to hear every next word and I'm like super into it

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:50.280
 But it felt honestly like that was like one chapter of the entire book

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:52.760
 That was like the payoff and it made it so worth it

00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.960
 But like the rest of it was super boring to me. Does that make sense?

00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:00.040
 Yeah, I have the same issue with so I was getting so I've read a lot of

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:05.400
 And so of all the books I've read most of them have been fiction of the fiction books

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.280
 I've read most of them have been sci-fi but I've read like all the great

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.680
 I've had books that always come up

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:11.880
 Um, but I was like, okay

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.560
 Let me like try to get into some fantasy stuff and I did read one fantasy book that was really good

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:19.560
 Like I like couldn't put it down the whole thing was fantasy being like Lord of the Rings

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:24.600
 Yeah, but like you know like more I mean like Harry Potter certainly fantasy. It's like yeah. Yeah

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.880
 You know, there's like modern equivalents to that

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:32.760
 Um, and I was really into it. So when I asked on twitter like hey, can you guys recommend me some other stuff?

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:36.760
 And a lot of people in our circle love this author Brandon Sanderson. He comes up a lot

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.760
 um like a lot of people read him

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.760
 and

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:43.000
 So I tried uh one of his books

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.680
 and

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.080
 it was really difficult because

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:51.160
 Similarly like the middle of the book it gets crazy slow

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:55.080
 But the payoff at the ending is so incredible

00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.960
 That just made all of it totally worth it

00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:01.880
 Yes, this guy's great. I love it. Let me get into the second book

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:05.560
 Even harder like I didn't make it past the middle like

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.480
 just like

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:12.360
 So much of like just nothing happening and I know that's gonna get really good at the end

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.040
 And so his name is Brendan Sanderson

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:17.000
 and I think people have identified this about his books and they call it like a

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.960
 Sander lunch or something you get like an avalanche of uh

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:22.600
 Stuff in like 10 pages at the end

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.600
 Um

00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:30.440
 But yeah, I don't know I think it takes like I would never have stuck it out through this first three body problem book

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.280
 If I hadn't heard glowing reviews

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:36.760
 It's like you just need that social proof where somebody is like this series is amazing

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:42.760
 And that was like the the thing that kept me going it's like i'm gonna get through this book because I heard people say they like it

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.360
 but it felt like

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.680
 literally hours of foreplay just like

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.800
 Listening to this giant book

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:56.760
 And feeling like there's so many characters and it's so much just like vagueness and not really wanting to reveal the thing

00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.400
 That they're eventually gonna reveal and when they reveal it

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:04.280
 It's all gonna be worth it, but it just felt like so much effort to get through that first half

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:12.520
 But then yeah, you just feel like oh, I'm so glad I I stuck it out. This is getting so good. Maybe like, you know, you need that

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:18.520
 The way to like be happy. Yeah, be good and obviously all of our attention spans are pretty bad these days. So

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.040
 I didn't feel that way with three body problem. I like really didn't feel like

00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.160
 like I definitely felt like I really wanted to

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:30.440
 Know the thing like in the second book there's like a thing he does in the whole book

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:34.360
 You're just like waiting for the outcome of the thing or having him explain why he did it

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.760
 And the payoff is great

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:41.160
 But I found like the the process of that to be to be okay

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.600
 But I said I can relate to that with uh with other books man, not me

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:51.720
 I may just be a simpler simpler human from the Ozarks. Have you read other sci-fi?

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:57.480
 I think I mean, I think I I have given you my whole history with sci-fi. So Andy Weir

00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:01.240
 Uh, so the Martian and I still have to be project hell married

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:07.080
 That's like the one major thing that I haven't read. Yeah, everyone says it's amazing because the the movie. Yeah, you know

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.720
 movie with

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.720
 Ryan Gosling

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.880
 I just watched Blade Runner by the way, which one both of them

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.680
 I what did you think so I read

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:23.960
 I Googled it extensively like do I need to watch the first one because I have such limited movie watching time

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:30.040
 And I needed to know like do I need to spend two hours watching this 1982 movie? Oh my god. It's so old

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:34.200
 I don't think I personally don't think you need to so I I hard disagree

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.640
 Because I went through the pain. Maybe it's just like I'm trying to justify the time

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:42.680
 I spent I've spent two mornings watching that first stupid Harrison Ford. Maybe it was so dumb

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:48.360
 Uh, not so dumb. It was just like it's made in the 80s and it was like so yeah, I know it's hard to

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:56.840
 I understand it properly. Yeah when it's watching it now. So 40 years ago. It's insane. It's insane. It's really insane. So I watched that

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:04.200
 Because I read that it did supplement the second movie. I feel like without that knowledge that would have taken a lot out of

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.200
 The plot, but maybe no what are you talking about in the second movie?

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:12.680
 Maybe it's hard for me to watch the second movie with fresh eyes and imagine like if I don't know all the things I know

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:16.520
 Did it explain it all enough without having watched the first one?

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:21.080
 No, in a way, it's even better if you haven't watched the first one because you get to experience like

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:25.720
 Well, okay one that the actual twist in the second one is so good

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:31.080
 Uh, yeah, no that was that was really good. Yeah, I love the part where I enjoyed the second movie a lot

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:36.840
 Did you did you like the part where the main character thought he was so special? Yeah, and then it turned out he wasn't special

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:43.320
 Yeah, you kind of just I mean that's spoiler's a little bit, but it's okay. You've never seen it by now. Yeah, I guess that's a more recent like

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:48.680
 People would have watched that. I think you could learn a lot from oh, you're saying I think I'm special

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.440
 That was so good

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.240
 You're not wrong

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.520
 But then also like you don't need to know anything about Harrison Ford for that movie

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:04.760
 I mean who he who he fell in love with. I'm sorry. That's like a huge part of the second movie's plot

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.640
 But that's just that that's just another twist

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.840
 For you

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:16.520
 I watched the second one. I didn't watch it first

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.200
 I'd seen the first one but like not properly and I really remembered anything from it

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:24.600
 So I basically watched the second one that watched the first one and I thought it was really good movie

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.480
 And I enjoyed it. I feel like

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:33.560
 It's probably hard for me to like separate what I knew already and what they explained in the second movie

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.880
 But I felt like my time was well spent

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.120
 I'm glad I watched the first one first because I knew

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:44.280
 Like I know Harrison Ford's character and where he came from and who he fell in love with and all that story

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.280
 I felt like that was a nice context

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:52.280
 But I guess they probably did a good job of making sure you don't have to see it because they can't assume people saw a movie 40 years ago

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.640
 You know what I you know

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:59.240
 I always pause into my head from that movie. Just that whole like baseline thing when he's like interlinked interlinked. Oh my god

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.320
 That's so bizarre. Yeah

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.840
 Yeah, what is something about that just like stuck to my brain and I always think about it

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.240
 What does it feel like to hold your child interlinked?

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.440
 That's some robot shit right there for sure

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:17.480
 That's a good movie. It was I enjoyed it. Yeah, I'm getting into sci-fi turns out

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.600
 I just like never considered what genres or what and like what I actually like

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.760
 I always thought I just like dramas. That was like the broad. It's like I don't like comedy

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.800
 I like drama and that was like the two categories and movies for me

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:36.040
 There's a lot more depth to it. Yeah, so I would actually argue that sci-fi is the greatest genre

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.840
 I don't think it's objective because I think it

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.680
 the best works in it and maybe it's true of every genre but

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.160
 Like I said earlier like being able to just

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:54.280
 Contain all the other parts of great work. Yeah, and also do this heart the scientific

01:03:54.280 --> 01:04:00.280
 Yeah, where you extrapolate and like derive a story from like weird things that could happen like that is

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.080
 Just so so so impressive. So I would ever recommend reading touching you want to get more into it

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:09.560
 It feels like it would take and I would recommend reading Michael Crichton because that's the name I knew

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:16.040
 I feel like he's made a lot of stuff. I actually read one of his books that I don't know if it ever became a movie

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.120
 It was like swarm or it was the idea of

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:22.680
 Swarms. What was that Michael? What's the one where they travel through time?

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:29.880
 I feel like that you just named like a million movies. Oh, no, there's one. There's no one timeline

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.480
 Uh

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:37.480
 Swarm was it the book called swarm. Oh pray. So I read pray. I don't think it became a movie

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.920
 Did it come a movie?

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:43.800
 Interesting book. Yeah, he's he's very much a sci-fi right like he comes up with stuff that sounds

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:49.000
 But his stuff is maybe less hard sci-fi like the Jurassic Park thing. It's like it sounds like it could happen

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.240
 It's like this the thing with his stuff is I don't it's not in this category of describing

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.240
 It doesn't contain

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.080
 Like a crazy level of deep

01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:01.720
 Deepness to it, right? There's like sorry talking high side

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:06.840
 Keep going. That's okay. It's like a good enjoy. It's books are good and enjoyable, but they're very straightforward

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.080
 Yeah, it's not like a big mind vendor

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:15.000
 Yeah, it's not like incorporating like philosophy doesn't like make you think about right right into like what matters in life and and all

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.640
 That's a market appeal, but not for us intellectuals. We like the deeper stuff

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:25.800
 I totally got all the stuff and three body problems. I totally understand at all. It's so good

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:30.680
 All right, I gotta get off here. My uh my five year old he's ready to play

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:34.600
 If you want to run an audiobook listen to Ted Chang's

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:39.080
 Okay, I'll send you a few because you can listen to him in like a couple hours each one of the characters

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:44.040
 All named yao and yang and yin and yu and now you're American. Okay, American

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:50.440
 That sounds so racist, but it's just like I'm from the Ozarks and those names do not distinguish themselves enough

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:55.160
 It's just like how they would say we all look the same and they probably think all our names sounds like is this racist?

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:59.240
 Just cut it out of the traces. It's just a reality. Okay. It's just a reality, right?

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.560
 I feel like yeah, that's just reality

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:07.080
 It's hard for me to tell those names apart because I don't live in that culture and I don't hear those sounds all the time

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:12.600
 So I also wonder how much the translation because like because Frank read the book in Chinese

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.080
 Oh nice. You know it's Chinese

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:22.360
 And I bet it was like a quite a different experience very different. There's stuff you can't express the same. Oh sure when you translate it

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.200
 So

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.320
 All right. Yeah. Thank you. All right. Goodbye. Yeah

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.560
 You
