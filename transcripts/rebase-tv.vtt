00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 - So Adam, tell me about Rebase.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.760
 - Rebase, DAX, if you hadn't heard,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.440
 is a live game show for developers

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.840
 where you can win real cash prizes.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.720
 You've obviously heard about it

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.880
 because you made it with me.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.880
 (laughing)

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.460
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.920
 - This is fun 'cause we've been doing this podcast

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.480
 and now we're making something together

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.240
 and it's kind of like, it's fun to play with new tech

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.720
 and to build stuff always,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.280
 but then doing it with a friend

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.720
 and doing it about something that you enjoy,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.200
 like, I don't know, high quality production

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.800
 and software development.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.840
 It's kind of like a mismatch of like a lot of interests.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.480
 So it's gonna be like HQ trivia,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.440
 but for developers, that's the idea.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.480
 - Yeah, I think I've also been reflecting on how

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.280
 it's like a great intersection of things.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.160
 We get to, we both build with a similar stack,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.840
 so that lines up really well.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.600
 There are front end components to this

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.440
 so we get to build front end stuff.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.360
 All the media stuff, you know, to produce a game show

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.600
 is not just a bunch of questions,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.120
 it's like the intro titles and the transitions

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.720
 and animations, you know, there's a lot of really cool stuff

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.600
 we can do to make it feel really legit,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.000
 which I think we definitely wanna do.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.240
 And it's just fun.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.000
 It's like the goal of it is to make something

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.920
 that people have fun playing and just fun and enjoyable.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.280
 It's something that we can all kind of share together

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.360
 and do at the same time once a week, whatever it is.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.240
 Yeah, it never really worked on something like that.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.440
 - It feels like it could exist in the current dev community,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.920
 at least like in the small circles we exist in Twitter.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.560
 I think kind of a live event

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.520
 that happens on some predictable schedule.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.800
 - Yeah, it's exciting to me.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.920
 We've got some good feedback.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.320
 We just launched the website.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.080
 So we're kind of like getting people to sign up,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.160
 stay informed.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.240
 That took like a week.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.360
 That was harder than we thought.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.160
 Would you say that was harder than you thought it would be?

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.840
 So just make a landing page.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.320
 - Yeah, you know, I've been made a landing page

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.520
 in a long time and then the back of my head, it's always like,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.680
 oh yeah, do you know, just just like a landing page.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.720
 But the thing with everything we're doing is we wanted,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.920
 we wanted to feel really high quality

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.560
 and that starts with the landing page.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.480
 So I think that just made it a lot more challenging

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.520
 than it initially seemed.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.280
 - Yeah, but I think like we're getting to take advantage

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.520
 of all kinds of this AWS stuff that we enjoy.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.360
 There's services that make this a lot easier.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.880
 It was more than a landing page.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.960
 So we did like the whole social card thing

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.240
 where you can share your card and it's generated per user.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.320
 - Maybe you just described like everything

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.400
 that we set up and how it works.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.640
 - So we're using SST, shout out to SST.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.760
 It's very good, capital G.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.920
 We're using SST, we're using Astro for the landing page

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.880
 and basically, I mean, you land on the landing page,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.480
 you can sign up with one of a couple of,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.040
 it's like Google or GitHub and we use SST off for that.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.760
 You click on it and you're taken to a page

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.200
 that has your personalized ticket to the rebase premiere.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.040
 And we generate that just with like a lambda function

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.700
 that uses puppeteer and takes a screenshot of a page.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.600
 I think that's a pretty like well-worn path.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.640
 At this point, we've like, there's plenty of prior art

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.160
 to pull from when you're building something like that,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.720
 but like putting it behind an Astro site construct

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.120
 and SSC to use that CDN and all that.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.320
 We had some stuff to figure out

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.520
 just how we wanted to do it.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.640
 And that's it, I guess.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.480
 Is that it?

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.560
 And then you share the URL, there's some referral stuff.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.880
 - Yeah, you can share your custom link.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.240
 That needs to render like a proper like OG image.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.920
 So it looks nice on Twitter.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.760
 Again, but that's the same puppeteer thing you talked about.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.440
 And then yeah, we track referral.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.760
 So that part was kind of funny because,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.960
 so we're using Dynamo for user storage.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.640
 And this normally isn't that big of a deal,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.440
 like you just create a user or whatever.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.880
 But the ticket had incrementing the place.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.760
 So the first one that signed up is number one,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.760
 next one's number two, et cetera.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.640
 And incrementing numbers are one of those things

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.880
 that just you'd never use normally

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.640
 'cause they just don't scale well.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.640
 So then they usually don't have any advantages.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.720
 So I haven't had to do that in years and years and years.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.280
 And last time I did that was probably in a SQL database.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.600
 So if I do that in Dynamo, it's kind of funny.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.800
 It sounds so simple, but it's surprisingly,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.240
 you need to know, you need to really understand

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.920
 how Dynamo works to do it right.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.960
 - Well, 'cause like in a SQL database,

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.200
 it's literally just like an auto ID thing, right?

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.240
 Like there's just like a type of column

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.880
 that just auto increments and you never think about it again.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.880
 - I think people might not be aware of this,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.720
 but to make that work, you didn't make it

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.480
 so whenever there's an insert, something is locking

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.040
 to make sure you're not incrementing twice by accident.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.480
 You're not issuing the same number twice by accident.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.760
 So even in a SQL database, you generally should not use those

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.480
 because like why take that overhead if you don't need it.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.480
 And then Dynamo usually doesn't let you do stuff like that

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.320
 because they don't let you do anything

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.640
 that's not performant.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.200
 So yeah, we have to do like a funny like,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.560
 it's called an optimistic block thing where

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.400
 it's like a funny, it's like weirdly complicated

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.240
 to implement it correctly.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.240
 And I realized a couple of days ago, Adam,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.560
 that I didn't actually implement it correctly.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.680
 I forgot to do the initial read with how they have

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.000
 that you concurrence you think you can set it.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.480
 - Yes, or consistency rather.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.680
 So I gotta go fix that.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.320
 But there haven't been any actual issues yet

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.720
 because it's not like we have 1,000 people signing.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.560
 - Yeah, right.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.400
 - At least not yet.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.800
 - No, we couldn't have because turns out

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.120
 land invocation limits start out at 10 in new accounts.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.480
 We've had so many issues with our new AWS account.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.040
 There's some feedback for AWS.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.880
 It's been painful.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.640
 - Yeah, I know that this is all new, right?

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.560
 So just to kind of describe what was happening,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.840
 we signed up for a new AWS account to set this all up.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.120
 The limits on new AWS accounts are crazy.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.080
 Like we couldn't do anything.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.760
 We couldn't launch a cloud front distribution.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.800
 And then when we deploy, we're in a production

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.040
 and it turns out we could only have 10 lambdas

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.960
 running concurrently at once and we're hitting limits there.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.400
 This might be feedback from all the bad PR they get

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.960
 whenever people have like surprise bills,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.480
 but it's just funny that two of us are running into this

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.320
 and we're like the most AWS people out there.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.920
 - No, I think somebody said in like the hero Slack

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.000
 that it's actually a fraud detection thing

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.320
 and it might not be every account.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.480
 But I think the Lambda concurrency,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.720
 the function invocation concurrency thing,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.200
 I think that's actually every new account now.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.360
 I don't think you just default to the thousand.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.360
 - Oh, interesting.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.200
 - Like it used to be.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200
 I could be wrong.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.480
 But yeah, there's still resources we can't create

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.240
 because we have this sort of like fraud thing tripped

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.320
 and they're trying to work through it.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.640
 - Yeah.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.480
 Well, there was also the, we had some like weird stuff

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.960
 trying to figure out how to make the Share Card.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.640
 So the Share Card needs to render like in Twitter

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.680
 with the OG image of this dynamic,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.560
 like image generation API we stood up.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.360
 But also we wanted like everyone to land on the landing page

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.480
 and we wanted to just like serve a cached page

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.880
 from the CDN.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.560
 I remember there was some like weird stuff there

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.080
 where we couldn't figure out the best way.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.800
 So we ended up just like, there's like a dummy page per user

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.440
 that's like an SSR page and it just has like head elements

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.760
 and it just got all the tags.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.440
 So it's got the OG, all the metadata stuff.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.720
 But then it also uses the like HTTP redirect thing

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.640
 as a header tag to just send you back to the landing page.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.480
 I don't know.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.320
 Is any of that stuff interesting?

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.160
 Does any make care about this?

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.980
 I don't know.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.800
 (laughing)

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.840
 - Yeah, I mean, I think that just of is as well,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.560
 this was all surprisingly complicated.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.400
 And in that case, we needed to find a way to trick

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.680
 the web crawler and to just start looking at that page

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.480
 but have the user browser go to a different page

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.800
 when they went there and we figured out

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.360
 that HTTP refresh header, like a bot wouldn't follow that

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.640
 but your browser would.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.480
 And is this something I feel like a lot of people

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.440
 building lots of products, kind of neat?

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.440
 So yeah, we should like write it up or something

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.280
 at some point.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.120
 - Do you have a blog?

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.440
 - I mean, we all have blogs and never writes it right.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.600
 - Just when you said that, like we should write that up.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.200
 Like, I don't even know where I would put it.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.120
 If I wrote something up.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.720
 - I just put it on Twitter and it turns out that I didn't know.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.000
 - Try the Twitter thread.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.400
 - Yeah, Twitter's killed my blog.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.560
 So landing pages are hard in 2023.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.800
 Who knew?

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.200
 I didn't expect that, I guess.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.680
 It shouldn't AI be just writing our landing pages by now?

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.760
 Like, what's going on?

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.840
 - Well, we said we wanted a good landing page.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.120
 - We wanted it to be good.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.280
 So by making things good, it takes time.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.000
 You know what, I actually have a take here

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.760
 and this isn't meant to be offensive

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.280
 to anybody in this community

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.480
 but the whole indie hacking movement

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.920
 and I think that communities maybe dwindled a little bit

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.480
 in the last six months.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.720
 So maybe I'm not saying anything super revelatory

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.960
 but I feel like the whole ending hacking movement,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.680
 like this idea of like throwing something together fast.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.320
 MVP, like just get something up there.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.160
 It doesn't matter what it is.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.480
 That's always rubbed me wrong

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.880
 because I care so much about quality.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.160
 And I know like if you spend a lot of time

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.480
 like polishing a thing and nobody uses it, who cares?

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.320
 I get the trade off here

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.480
 but I also just like would rather put good stuff out there.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.560
 And I feel like at this point in 2023,

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.040
 there's really no excuse for building something

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.160
 that's not high quality.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.320
 Like with all the tools that are out there,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.320
 just like learning the right things to put together,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.440
 like it doesn't take that much effort.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.120
 It just takes a week to build a language

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.200
 instead of six hours or whatever people want to crank them out.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.040
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.320
 It's kind of like, and I've felt it's my whole career.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.880
 I think there's always added effort

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.080
 to make something better

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.920
 or do something a little bit more right.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.640
 I never feel that effort was ever that much.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.640
 It's never like you get this out in a day

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.040
 or you get out in six months.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.120
 It's like a day versus a week,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.000
 which isn't like a terrible difference.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.280
 - Yeah, and if you care about quality,

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.400
 I don't know, what is that?

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.520
 What is, is that like, do users not care about quality?

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.200
 Is that why indie hacking, is indie hacking successful?

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.960
 Has there been like three of them, like Peter levels,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.280
 Danny Postman, who else?

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.360
 There's been like three successful indie hackers.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.440
 - I think the trick with that is those,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.920
 the people that have been successful in that category

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.240
 are insanely, insanely gifted and talented

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.080
 in the marketing department.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.360
 So for them, they just need to launch a bunch of ideas

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.280
 as fast as possible

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.880
 'cause they just shove that into their marketing machine

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.200
 and it spits out success.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.160
 So if you're gonna not spend a lot of time

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.840
 on what you're building,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.200
 that means you should be spending a bunch of time

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.320
 like becoming like an expert marketer,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.000
 like creating crazy reach, all that stuff.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.280
 I think then you can be successful, like then that all makes sense.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.080
 But for us, I think the quality is our marketing, right?

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.840
 We're hoping people use this

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.520
 'cause they're gonna try it and they're gonna be like,

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.680
 "This is way too much effort for something like this."

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.520
 Like we're just like a shitty little quiz app,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.200
 but this is like, you know, much more legit.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.560
 - It's an experience.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.920
 - Yeah, and that is our marketing.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.040
 So that's why we're putting the effort there.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.280
 At least that's how it makes sense to me.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.960
 - No, it makes sense to me.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.280
 It's just striking me like in the middle of this conversation

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.280
 that rebase is a side project.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.080
 And I'm literally like just going through

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.560
 this mid-life crisis where I'm like,

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.520
 I hate side projects.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.000
 I never want another side project.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.360
 But it's not because of rebases

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.400
 because like I've just built so many things over the years.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.400
 And then they just like set there and nag at me.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.560
 You said something to me in Discord the other day

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.680
 that helped me.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.680
 It was like just like to drop things

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.520
 and to not let them nag at you.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.040
 But I've got like domains expiring and like projects

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.880
 that had big ideas and big, I don't know,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.880
 like hopeful ambitions for.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.880
 And then they just kind of like set there for a year

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.200
 and you just feel real bad.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.040
 I don't know.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.120
 Do you have any thoughts on all that?

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.960
 - I mean, I have the exact same thing with a few things.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.880
 They just become these monuments too,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.800
 to your failures in your past,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.840
 excitement that you no longer have anymore.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.240
 And that's innately sad.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.200
 So, I know, yeah, it feels bad.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.880
 It feels like you're not going anywhere.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.760
 - So is there a coping?

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.560
 So like you laid out the bad part.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.760
 Is there a good part?

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.440
 - We actually talk about this at SST a lot.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.400
 We talk about it as like motivation driven development.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.560
 I think there's two ways to perceive this.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.040
 Sometimes people perceive motivation as,

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.240
 oh, you're just distracted

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.920
 and you're like getting excited about the next thing

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.160
 and never finishing something,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.480
 which can definitely be a thing.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.400
 And I think that gets about a lot.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.640
 But I also think there's a bunch of intuition

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.960
 and what you're excited about.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.000
 So I try to focus now more on,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.560
 okay, what's the next thing I want to do?

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.480
 Not from like a rational point of view,

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.960
 but what am I excited like, what do I feel like doing next?

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.480
 I feel like my brain is computing a bunch of things

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.320
 and spitting that up.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.560
 And the reason I'm excited about it

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.280
 is because it also is a thing that makes the most sense.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.080
 So yeah, like I said, there is like a pathology

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.840
 to like just starting stuff and never finishing.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.240
 But the other side of it is also also good.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.840
 And you should listen to that as well, so.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.680
 - Yeah.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.520
 - Just working on what you're excited about.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.000
 - Okay, so I feel good about that.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.400
 'Cause there are always those mornings

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.360
 where it's like, I could work on three different things.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.600
 I really want to work on this one.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.240
 I probably should work on this,

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.120
 but you're saying maybe there's a reason,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.440
 like our instincts serve us here.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.480
 - Yeah, like some days you just got to eat your vegetables,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.400
 but I love vegetables.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.200
 I eat my vegetables every day next.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.600
 - That's true.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.680
 - My wife says I should.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.560
 - Eat the vegetables you don't like, there you go.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.080
 I'm sure there's some vegetables you don't like.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.560
 - I don't know, I've been thinking about this a lot

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.440
 just the last like week, just the idea of like,

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.840
 like I don't know what other professions are like.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.880
 This is all I've ever done.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.840
 Like I dropped out of college

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.440
 and this is what I've done ever since.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.280
 But I have to imagine like it's a pretty unique career we have

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.160
 where you can have this amazing, fulfilling job that you love

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.200
 and you still just constantly have side projects.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.160
 Maybe it's not every developer.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.560
 Maybe it's like only the most ambitious have this problem

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.600
 and we all just live on Twitter.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.360
 But it feels like everybody has a side project at all times.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.960
 And like we get paid like doctors

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.240
 and we don't even have to go to school.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.600
 I should just be happy doing the one thing all the time.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.200
 Just like write down, sit down, write my code,

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.680
 be a happy, employed developer.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.200
 But I've literally my entire career for 15 years.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.400
 I've always had something else I'm doing on the side

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.960
 and I can't just do one thing.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.960
 - Yeah, I mean, but what else,

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.480
 what would you be doing otherwise?

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.560
 Like there's like, like you spend time with your family

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.600
 like you have like a pre-balanced life and-

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.800
 - Well, let's kind of be honest, like really honest.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.320
 I would just focus more on my day jobs.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.240
 I would like to spend the first time

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.040
 on my cheating my day jobs by having side projects.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.360
 - Is that literally true though?

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.120
 Cause I feel like it's not really a time thing.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:57.960
 It's an energy thing.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.680
 So given a project,

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.480
 even if I have, you know, 18 hours a day to work on it,

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.600
 I probably only have like four hours of energy

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.600
 to work on that one thing.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.160
 That's just how I am, I don't know.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.160
 Like would you actually-

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.080
 - No, that's a great point.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.400
 I'd probably just be on like, I don't know, on Twitter

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.880
 in the time that I wasn't working on a side project.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.960
 - So it's tricky.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.800
 I think it's never, for me,

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.760
 it's never been a time thing.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.080
 There's like more than enough hours in a day.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.400
 If you're on a consistent schedule,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.960
 it's just like sometimes I don't want to work

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.800
 on something for too long.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.000
 - Okay, so I feel better then.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.640
 I feel better about my life.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.160
 I hope everyone else feels better.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.000
 Listen to this.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.200
 - Yeah, you're normal.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.040
 That's what you want to hear.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.560
 You just want to hear that you're normal.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.880
 I know that like this is a problem out there

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.320
 because everybody has the same, like everybody buys

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.680
 all the domains and they all like complain about the thing

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.360
 that they haven't been working on that they should

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.840
 or like the side projects that are withering.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.680
 So I know it's out there.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.120
 I feel better after this conversation.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.120
 I don't know that I'm fully healed,

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.400
 but I can see a path towards just like accepting

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.240
 the inevitability.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.960
 Like I am going to be interested in things at times

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.240
 and just run with that, let it play out.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.160
 I guess the problem is when you invest a lot of time

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.280
 or money or both into a side project,

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.840
 it makes it more guilt laden.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.040
 The more you neglect it.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.480
 - Yeah, I know, but like it's, the alternative is

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.280
 you never really get excited about anything work-wise

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.040
 and you just kind of have this flat, stable experience,

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.880
 which is okay, but, and there's nothing better

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.080
 than feeling really excited about something

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.120
 and like waking up and jumping, jumping onto it right away.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.880
 So I wouldn't give that up even if it,

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.760
 even like never those things ever pan out.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.040
 - Yeah, so that's another thing.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.360
 That's been most of my career.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.560
 And I wanna say this with an asterisk and then circle back.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.920
 But like most of my career, it's like Christmas morning.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.120
 I can't wait to wake up.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.280
 Sometimes I have a hard time sleeping

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.640
 just because I'm so excited about the thing I'm working on,

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.880
 can't wait to wake up and work on that thing.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.640
 And I just saw somebody tweet and I don't even remember who it was

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.400
 and I probably wouldn't say if I did.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.000
 But like just that they weren't that excited about programming,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.240
 there's just a job and like they don't know how they should feel

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.960
 about that because they see all these developers

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.920
 that are really into what they do.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.080
 Is that unique to software development?

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.920
 Or is that just every career has people

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.520
 who really are passionate about that thing?

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.600
 And that's why they do it versus people who like,

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.440
 "It's a good job."

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.040
 I get paid well.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.200
 I do it, you know?

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.520
 - Yeah.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.920
 Yeah, I mean, I don't really know.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.840
 I think what's unique is we aren't a creative feel

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.560
 that you can like create stuff.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.800
 And usually creative feels like that aren't lucrative

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.840
 unless you're incredibly successful.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.960
 So I think we have this awkward combination of,

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.200
 yeah, there's people that are effectively kind of like artists

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.000
 that are pursuing their passion.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 But there's also people doing the exact same thing

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.720
 because it sets them up well to like do all the other stuff

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.720
 in their life.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.640
 So yeah, you don't really have like a painter side by side

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.920
 with another painter that's just doing it for like, you know?

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.600
 No, that makes sense.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.440
 - For the money.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.720
 So I think, yeah, I think I saw that tweet as well.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.640
 And it's tough.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.840
 I think I'm really, I feel grateful that this is my hobby

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.120
 and I would be doing this even if it was not very lucrative.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.880
 I find a way to put time into it.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:12.040
 I'm just grateful that, you know, it is, it is a way to,

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.680
 pretty easy way to make a living.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.280
 - And I never want people, like I never wanna say that

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.920
 and people feel like shameful that they don't feel that way.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.720
 But at the same time, I wanna say it all the time

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.480
 because I'm just so excited about this stuff.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.640
 And I know other people are too and it's nice to see that.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.240
 It's infectious to like share in the excitement of a thing

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.720
 that's your hobby and that's your work and your whatever.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.080
 So it's this weird balance of like,

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.240
 I never wanna say stuff like that,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.920
 like how much I love coding and make people feel bad

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.320
 because they're a programmer but they don't really love it.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.400
 But at the same time, I wanna put that out in the world.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.240
 I don't know.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.560
 I'm sorry, just in advance.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.760
 I mean, there's a lot to put that on record.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.240
 - I think what's helpful for me in terms of perspective

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:56.240
 is like my wife's friends, like she had some people over

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:02.000
 this weekend and they were like asking me about what I do.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.480
 And I was just imagining that I'm going to my YouTube

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.880
 or like my Twitch and watching it

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.760
 and being like, this is the most boring thing in the world.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.600
 So, yeah, so. - Yeah, you're excited

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.440
 to wake up from this. - I can't get

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.120
 this in perspective around, yeah, exactly.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.520
 It is really weird that I'm really into the stuff

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.680
 that is really boring to most people.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.160
 So yeah, if you find it boring

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.480
 or it's not super excited about it,

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.720
 like it just kind of is boring.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.920
 - Okay, so this podcast episode has gone from like,

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.600
 hey, we're making a side project to like side projects

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.640
 to like software development as a job.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.680
 I had another thought that I just wanna ask you,

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.920
 it's kind of in that theme.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.880
 And that is like outsiders.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.480
 Where does software developer land now

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.440
 in the broader society landscape?

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.080
 Like how do outsiders, I don't know any more

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.400
 'cause I don't interact with people.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.120
 How do people outside of tech view software development?

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.640
 Because it was like, you go back like 2005.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.720
 That's when I graduated high school.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.800
 And like Zuckerberg makes Facebook

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.440
 and it's like nerd, like software developers are like,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.160
 they're super nerds.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.560
 Then in fact, there was probably a period

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.480
 over the last 15 years during my career

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.040
 where it's like software developers are cool.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.680
 Like this is a cool job.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.360
 And I wonder like, has that changed?

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.280
 Am I out of touch?

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.320
 Do people think we're nerds again?

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.840
 - Yeah, I struggle with this as well

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.280
 because in my head, it's like this weird, not very professional

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.120
 thing to do.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.000
 We're just kind of like doing random stuff

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.440
 and it doesn't really look like a real job.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.840
 And that's like my bubble ones out.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.040
 Everyone I know is kind of like that.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.960
 But then I meet people that are also software engineers

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.080
 but look like lawyers or like doctors.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.480
 Or I'm like, oh, this is just a normal profession

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.720
 that's become very professionalized.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.640
 And like, you know, there's like I'll meet like very like

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.960
 clean cut, well-educated, like couples that both,

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.240
 you know, work at Apple and Google

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.640
 and they have like a very successful life

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.160
 where I think 10 years ago, you look at them

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.720
 and be like, oh yeah, they're like two doctors, you know?

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.880
 So I guess people might perceive it in that way.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.240
 It's just funny 'cause like in our circle,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.520
 we have like people like Theo and Prime and Trash

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:23.320
 are like these are not like, like these are not like you know,

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.720
 like they're kind of doctors.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.040
 - I mean, Prime is kind of a doctor.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.160
 - Ourself is good at it, yeah.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.400
 - It's funny when you said that I just think about every time

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.040
 I say something to my wife, like, oh, Trash just said this thing

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.200
 and she's like, Trash, you call him Trash.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.600
 I'm like, no, his name is Trash.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.880
 - I love this world.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.320
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.280
 - But you speak to like another point

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.840
 which is just that like software developer

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.840
 is such a broad term.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.960
 And it kind of goes to the problem of like telling people

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.880
 on the outside what it is you do.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.120
 But like, it's a huge spectrum of things

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.080
 from the indie hacking crowd

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.080
 to the people who look like doctors

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.040
 and then all of us on Twitter and whatever we are.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.080
 Like, it's a good point.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.360
 It's not all one thing.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.520
 - Yeah, it's a, I mean, there's really millions.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.500
 There's millions of us.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.340
 There's so many.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.180
 - It's like 30 million, isn't it?

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.200
 I think in the world--

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.120
 - I wanna say it was like 30 million

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.980
 in the world software developer, I could be wrong.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.960
 Maybe those web developer, I don't know.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.320
 - I remember 30 million, stands out to me.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.160
 We'll go.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.600
 - So we gotta get 30 million sign-ups when we base.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.280
 - We gotta start a total addressable market.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.760
 (laughing)

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.240
 That's funny.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.080
 - Damn.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.920
 - So you should check out Rebase.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.840
 I guess we didn't say that.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.560
 We really gotta get better about like promoting things

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.920
 that we're doing.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.640
 You should use Rebase, or you can't use it.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.320
 You should sign up and come to the first show.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.600
 It's gonna be amazing.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.840
 - I mean, you should use get Rebase.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.680
 That was a whole thing.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.320
 - I'm glad we didn't name it merge.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.840
 That would have been lame.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.760
 Rebase is so much better.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.760
 - Rebase.tv.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.800
 - Yeah, Rebase.tv, it's gonna be, I don't know,

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.560
 however long it takes us to build the mobile app

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.320
 and all the backend stuff that we need for it.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.600
 Then we're gonna do the first show

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.720
 and you'll have chance at real cash prizes.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.720
 Just like HQ trivia.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.680
 It's amazing how many people don't remember what HQ trivia is.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.880
 I've been trying to explain this to people.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.320
 I'm like, it's just like HQ trivia, but for devs.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.840
 What is HQ trivia?

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.560
 I thought it was like this huge phenomenon, but.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.960
 - Yeah, everyone I knew was on it,

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.680
 but I guess people forgot or it didn't hit everywhere.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.440
 They had such a blame out.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.640
 It was so big and it just vanished.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.520
 - Yeah, that hopefully not a bad omen.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.240
 (laughing)

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.480
 - Hey, but like we were saying earlier,

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.640
 like, you know, even if it dies,

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.640
 like at least it was fun.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.480
 - It was fun.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.320
 - It's already been fun.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.560
 - It's already been worth it for me.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.840
 I guess we'll see you in blood, sweat, and tears.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.840
 I still feel the same.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.280
 Or if it goes on the Mount Rushmore

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.040
 of side projects that I (laughing)

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.160
 Okay, cool.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.080
 This has been fun.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:43.920
 - Yep.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.500
 (upbeat music)
