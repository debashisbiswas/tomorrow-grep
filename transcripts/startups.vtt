00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
 - What was the question again?

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.100
 You wanted to know just how it got into startup?

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.680
 (upbeat music)

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:29.420
 - So someone pointed out something a little interesting

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.000
 in our Discord that both me and you have

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.520
 a good amount of experience going down the startup path.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.040
 And I think both of us kind of take it for granted

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.240
 'cause we've just been in that world for so long.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.280
 And they ask, can we do an episode on what it's like

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.240
 and why we did it and our experiences with it.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.220
 So yeah, I think we can start with you

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.200
 sharing a little bit about what your experiences was like.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.040
 - Yeah, sure.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.880
 No, I was just gonna say,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.800
 I can't believe we'd ever thought to do this episode.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.320
 Like it never was on my radar at all.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.600
 - Yeah, so obvious.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.880
 - So I guess I started Stamped News

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.440
 with a long time friend back in 2014.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.960
 I had kind of like first five, six years of my career,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.960
 done freelance stuff, had a little like software agency

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.960
 and saved up some money and then kind of quit my job

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.380
 with my co-founder and started Stamped News.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.960
 I had always wanted to do something higher risk.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.560
 Like I knew I had a really good job, paid really well,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.360
 but it was still like just a hyping job.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.080
 And ultimately like a lot of it was my friendship

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.960
 with my co-founder Eli, we'd grown up together.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.240
 And we always kind of had said like,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.240
 eventually we're gonna do something together.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.040
 We both were at a point in our career

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.720
 where we could kind of take a break

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.240
 and just quit our jobs and try it.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.400
 That was a lot of it for me.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.620
 It was just like wanna do something with this person

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.280
 and wanna do something higher risk, higher leverage,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.920
 not just kind of hours in, hours out,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.840
 which is what my career had been to that point.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.880
 That was the main reason.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.280
 Yeah, getting into it.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.640
 Did anyone tell you it was a bad idea

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.000
 or did you think it was a bad idea?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.280
 It's so hard to remember now.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.120
 I mean, it's been eight years, nine years ago.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.120
 I don't remember, I know my wife was really supportive.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.720
 Like we had saved quite a bit.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.120
 So we were in a pretty good position.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.280
 We had just built a house and just had a baby.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.600
 So in that sense, it was kind of like awful timing,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.320
 but it all worked out in the end.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.040
 I guess it could have gone really badly.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.400
 We did go a really long time.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.560
 So I'd say six months in, my wife was like,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.080
 "Was this a good idea, are we sure?"

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.600
 'Cause we thought we'd raised pretty quick.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 And I think it was a year before we actually raised,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.440
 which we don't even know.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.160
 I don't even know honestly how we sort of like

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.000
 weathered that storm.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.200
 We didn't think we had that much saved.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.520
 Like we didn't have a whole year runway,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.240
 but somehow we kept the lights on, I guess.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.080
 I mean, I know how.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.560
 I'd liquidated all my retirement accounts.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.600
 That's what it was.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.440
 I forgot.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.440
 That's what it was.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.360
 Yeah, what about you?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.920
 Yeah, I think for me, I think similarly,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.760
 I always knew I wanted to do that.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.600
 It was very clear.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.480
 I had measures before.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.840
 My dad is also a software engineer,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.280
 which I think I take for granted a lot,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.440
 but it gave me a lot of perspective.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.440
 He pretty much spent his whole career.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.000
 Again, a very successful career,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.280
 worked his way pretty high up,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.360
 had an extremely high paying job.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.520
 But like you said, at the end of the day,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.520
 it's just high paying job.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.160
 And I kind of witnessed how he hit

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.440
 a ceiling where he just couldn't break through,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.160
 both on the compensation side,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.760
 like there's a ceiling on how much money you can make.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.000
 But also on the freedom side,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.160
 at the end of the day, he still had to

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.240
 make sure some other person was happy

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.360
 so he can get his high paying salary.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.800
 And his day to day, he liked his job,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.560
 but there were a lot of parts of it that

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.000
 he didn't like and just dealt with

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.400
 and didn't really have any power

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.800
 really to make that any different.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.640
 Yeah.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.760
 Similarly, I started out as a consultant,

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.320
 like you, I like worked freelance, independent.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.480
 And it was very clear that, okay,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.000
 if I'm gonna work 60 hours a week,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.560
 I'm just gonna get 60 hours of pay.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.440
 And of course, that rate went up over time,

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.280
 but it's pretty like linear.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.560
 Like it just goes up into linear amount.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.560
 And at some point, you kind of cap out.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.920
 I wasn't building anything that compounded over time.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.160
 I wasn't really able to take advantage of my skill set.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.880
 And the other thing with a high paying job is

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.360
 if you are very, very, very good at what you do

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.080
 at a company,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.480
 you probably might make like 20 or 30% more

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.920
 than someone who is not very good at what they do

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.760
 at the company.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.640
 A company is never gonna pay you

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.720
 like five times more than they pay someone else.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.920
 So at a certain point,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.480
 you just have to go down your own route, I think,

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.640
 if you really wanna capitalize on that.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.200
 No company is gonna really meet your value

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.560
 if you think you have, you know, really high value.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.280
 The only real way to capture that is

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.320
 by building something you own.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.720
 So I think yeah, it was clear for me.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.560
 And I think at a young age, I did start a company

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.760
 with a friend similar to you, like a childhood friend

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.000
 that I knew really well.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.160
 I mean, that's really key if you start a company.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.200
 I know it's worked out with people

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.880
 where they've met random co-founders, but in general,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.160
 it is one of the most intimate relationships

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.000
 you're ever gonna have in your life.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 And yeah, you need to do it with someone

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.320
 that you have some background with.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.440
 So you're not going into it, like,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.000
 learning all this stuff about this person.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Like you already know their quirks

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.480
 and you already know how your relationship

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.800
 with each other is gonna work out.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.480
 That company got aqua-hired.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.120
 And then pretty much my whole career since then,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.800
 I've been either very early stage employee,

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.840
 like either the first real employee or, you know,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.880
 in a founder role.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.000
 And yeah, I've loved every second of it.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.840
 It's something that is extremely hard.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.760
 But like I said, my primary goal is to have freedom

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.760
 with my life and making it exactly how I want it to be.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.520
 And you can't really do that when someone else

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.760
 is telling you, okay, you have to be here at this time

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.800
 to make this money.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.280
 Yeah, so that underlying motivation,

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.040
 no matter whether it's going good or bad,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.800
 I know that I just didn't give up on any of it

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.680
 'cause that was the most important thing.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.840
 - Yeah, so that I would say like going from consulting

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.840
 or freelance to startup life,

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.520
 it was like on the one hand doing it

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.760
 for kind of financial reasons,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.200
 like hoping to have a bigger outcome in the long run.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.840
 It was a near-term shock though.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.400
 I mean, like a lot of changes of lifestyle immediately.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.200
 So just like making a lot less as an entrepreneur, I guess.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.440
 But that freedom that you said, like that was

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.880
 the noticeable thing is like you thought you're free

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.120
 when you're freelance before that,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.360
 like you're kind of like you're dating all of your clients.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.600
 You're not really like married anybody.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.960
 So you feel like you're kind of roaming around.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.480
 But at the end of the day,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.200
 like people are expecting things of you every single day.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.200
 And once you start a startup, you realize like,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.280
 it's a blessing and a curse.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.480
 But like nobody's expecting anything of you.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.600
 Like I was pretty well shielded from our investors.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.960
 My co-founder kind of managing those relationships.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.880
 And it's really like, I had five years there

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.040
 where you kind of have to decide what's worth doing every day,

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.400
 which is super fun and liberating,

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.760
 but also that part can be stressful

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.200
 because you kind of doubt like,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.400
 am I doing the right thing?

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.320
 Are we going the right way?

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.240
 Like all that stuff.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.040
 - I mean, the classic thing is I think every founder

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.880
 resonates with this.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.880
 There's days where you wake up and you're like,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.320
 wow, we are amazing.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.680
 We are doing every single thing, right?

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.840
 And literally the week after that, you wake up

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.420
 and you'll feel like this is a huge mistake.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.720
 You're doing every single thing wrong.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.560
 - Yeah.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.920
 - So it's a crazy roller coaster.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.480
 And I heard you say this the other day,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.720
 which me and Liz have talked a lot about

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.840
 where you said your co-founder Eli is like,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.560
 skill is that he just refuses to let Satmuse die.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.400
 - Yeah.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.440
 - And that at the end of the day is the only thing

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.560
 that really is like just not giving up for enough time.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.840
 You're going to have something that works out.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.600
 I think Paul Graham has a whole essay about this

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.040
 where he just like, if you refuse to die, you'll get rich.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.000
 That's like startups are very complicated.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.280
 Lots of things you have to figure out.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.720
 But then in the day, if you stick with it long enough,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.520
 there's just so many moments where you can give up and quit.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.000
 If you just refuse to do that for long enough,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.600
 that's just going to work out and it just can't.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.200
 So if you optimize for your motivation,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.920
 that's kind of the thing that matters than the day.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.760
 - Yeah, okay.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.760
 I've got a quick anecdote about my co-founder.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.760
 So we started Satmuse, which is like a sports statistic site.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.520
 And we started with the MBA.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.600
 We were both big basketball fans.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.920
 We were actually both co-captains of our high school basketball team.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.680
 So I'm really tall.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.600
 I mean, I'm not really tall.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.080
 I'm like six, three, six, four, but I have like long legs.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.480
 I'm a pretty good runner, but I'm like a short distance runner.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.080
 Like I'm such a sprinter, which show maps to my like work style.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.320
 I could run really, like when we did our conditioning drills in basketball,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.560
 I could run like a set of 10, like we run the court 10 times.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.440
 I could run them like in 49 seconds, which is really fast.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.200
 But we had this thing every year, our coach did, it was like this thing

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.080
 we dreaded all year that was called 10 set day, where we had to do 10 sets of 10.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.160
 So it's just like long endurance thing.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.920
 And I could not make it through 10 set day.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.200
 I never did my whole four years of high school.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.520
 Like I just gave up halfway through or whatever.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.240
 And Eli was like dragging freshmen to the, like he's just like, that is his thing.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.640
 It's like he will not quit anything.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.080
 So it's so mapped to Satmuse.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.920
 Like five years in, we sort of like hit a point where our relationship,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.120
 into your point, like you got to really know the person.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.400
 There's just so many hard things when it comes to startup stuff.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.320
 I can't imagine doing it with somebody that I didn't really know or that I had,

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.720
 like if you have reasons to bail because you don't really have a good relationship,

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.240
 you're going to bail, I would think.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:32.440
 And Eli being kind of this long time friendship of mine and just his personality

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.560
 really made it possible to be there five years.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.720
 But ultimately, like I haven't been there for the last three years.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.880
 And Eli's still been going.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.360
 I think that is such a huge, huge part of it.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.640
 Yeah, yeah, it's, it just does blow down to that endurance thing.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.160
 And you know, I've been doing this for a very, very long time.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.280
 Like my whole career pretty much have been around this world.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.760
 And that this concept didn't really click for me until I would say this year,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.120
 where now that me and Liz are working on something together,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.920
 it's, it's just so clear that that's the challenge that's just constantly

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.320
 in the back of your head.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.320
 Yep.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.600
 But yeah, if you can, if you can conquer that, it is, that's really all you need to do.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.880
 You have some form of success eventually.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.480
 I think people say this all the time, they're like, companies don't run our money.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.560
 It's at the founders run energy.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.120
 There's like always a way to keep going if, if you can do it.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.000
 Can we talk about how we have these like freaky similar stories at our startups?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Yeah.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.640
 Well, yeah, I guess like I just said, I haven't been at Sami's for three years.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:34.320
 So like five years in Eli fired me, which was like a whole shock.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.380
 I was depressed for months.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.200
 I mean, I knew like we couldn't keep going the way that we were going.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.640
 We both were just at each other so bad after five years.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.600
 And like there was just a lot of personal, each of us kind of resented each other and

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.280
 lost a lot of respect for each other over various things.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.840
 We were just pretty like toxic and we had to have like somebody on a call with us.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.600
 We just couldn't get anything done.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.960
 So it needed to happen, but it was still a shock.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:05.400
 And then ultimately like gone for three years during that period, had new investors come

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.840
 in and buy a lot of my stake in the company.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:14.520
 So then I don't know how we discovered we have like this exact same story, but we were

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.920
 talking a reinvent and the same thing basically happened to you, right?

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.920
 Timing and everything.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.920
 Yeah.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.920
 Yeah.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.920
 Probably the exact same time.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.920
 I think I was like maybe like six months after all this happened to you like I was like

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:31.120
 it's like a six month offset, so a similar story I early stage company was going incredibly

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120
 well.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.040
 And then at some point me and the founder just started to run to a whole bunch of issues.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:41.240
 In my case, it was the founder was pretty inexperienced and he was just hiring a bunch

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.320
 of people that had no business to be the startup and just kind of we went from being like the

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.680
 best company I ever worked at to like the worst company I ever worked at in a span of

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.080
 six months or so.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.920
 And then like a whole bunch of stuff like he like wasn't transparent about all these deals

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.880
 he did with the investors, like I ended up diluting everyone and ways that did not make

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.600
 any sense.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.720
 So it just got to a point where we were just like it was really bad.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.240
 I think I was like basically refusing to work at some point because they like completely

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.000
 messed up all my compensation stuff.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.880
 And eventually he fired me, which again, similar situation like I should have been fired and

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.280
 I was just kind of waiting for it to happen and it happened and like it was actually crazy.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.680
 I then went back to consulting and I was like, why am I getting so much work done?

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.440
 Like I'm spending like two hours a day and I'm getting like way more work done.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.520
 It turned out just the energy toll of being in a place that was just constant agitation

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.760
 and constant fighting that just takes up your entire daily, you're probably just sitting

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.440
 there thinking about these are having these arguments in your head, like every single

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.440
 day.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.440
 Yeah.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.440
 And that takes up a big amount of your time.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.240
 But then similarly to you somehow and this company should be dead and again, going back

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.720
 to less, keeping stuff alive forever, this company 100% should be dead.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.280
 It's still alive today.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.480
 At some point, somehow new investors came in to this disaster of a company and I was

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.640
 like, Hey, hey, buy my equity out and they did and I guarantee you to this day, I will

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.840
 be the only person that ever makes money off of the startup.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.200
 It's just been like an investor after an investor coming in and losing their money.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:14.760
 So yeah, because they bought us out and yeah, so fired by the CEO, both of us at a company

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.960
 where we spent, you know, a lot of time putting in all of our effort.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.960
 Yeah.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.760
 But then we got, we got something out of it.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.880
 I'm actually back at Satmys now and I don't think I'll be the only person to make money.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.760
 I'm, I'm back on Satmys.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.920
 I'm on the rocket ship.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.920
 We're going to the moon.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.360
 And that's how you always feel when you're a startup, except when you don't, like you

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.040
 said, it's every other week.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.040
 It's such a rollercoaster.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.720
 Like it really is.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.240
 There were so many times we were close to acquisition and you're just on this mountain.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.040
 But it's those moments when you're close to acquisition for us.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.920
 We were, there's a few times that things were going so well.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.480
 That's why we were close to acquisition.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.200
 You're kind of almost too optimistic and like you get all like stingy.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.400
 Like, I don't want to take just any deal.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.720
 And then it falls through and you go into like a trough of depression and you take whatever

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.240
 anybody would give you, but nobody wants to because it's, it's just how it works.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.240
 Yeah.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.120
 It's kind of exactly what happened to us too, was we were doing really well.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.760
 And then I just kind of took my hands off of, okay, I'm just going to focus on engineering

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.640
 stuff and I mistakenly like let some parts of the company go.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.200
 And that's when like, you know, all like the terrible deals with the investors happened.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.480
 Just again, because of an experience from the CEO, yeah.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.880
 I think at this point he owns must, he must own like 3% of the company and he's not even

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.880
 CEO anymore.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.080
 So I'm like, it's just not worth your time anymore.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.360
 You know, it's like, yeah, it's a bad situation.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.280
 I mean, I also did get something out of it.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.080
 I met Liz, my wife at the company.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.520
 So in a way, best possible exit.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.520
 Yeah.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.520
 But you can have.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.520
 Yeah.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.520
 So it's your stake.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.520
 Found a wife.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.520
 Yeah.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.920
 So it worked out pretty well.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.880
 So we had a bunch of questions and we, I think we kind of posed this that we were doing this

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.880
 episode.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.880
 This is unique for us.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.880
 Yeah.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.880
 Yeah.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.160
 So we had a few questions that people in Twitch had asked so we can, we can go over

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.160
 them.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.880
 So I'm going to try to do this in order that is somewhat cohesive.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.600
 So people asked at what stage in your career does a start startup become logical to pursue?

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.160
 Any thoughts on that?

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.920
 I mean, for me, it was after we had some money saved.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.520
 I mean, maybe you do it right out of call.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.520
 I don't know.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.520
 Are there pros and cons?

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.520
 I could have missed something.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:20.640
 How I would have done it though, when I was, we were newlywed, had I not been married yet?

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.640
 Maybe right out of school, I could have done something like this, but I think with any one

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.740
 person, kind of like depending on you in any way, it would make it really hard, I think.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.720
 So I was all about making money right after school.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.480
 Here's the thing I, you definitely should not do.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.080
 I think a lot of people think about it this way.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:41.160
 They're like, I need to have XYZ experience before I go do this, like you're like preparing

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.160
 for the thing.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.960
 But the best way to prepare is just actually do the thing, like there's no, like, of course

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.920
 you're going to learn skills in any place you work, but I think people have this like

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.320
 life plan where they're like, I'm going to go work at a big company.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.480
 Then I'm going to work at a small company, then I'm going to go.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.880
 It's just like life doesn't work that way, just if you want to do the thing, just go

00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.880
 do it.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.880
 Yeah.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.440
 I think the major constraint, I think what you just said speaks of this is a, it does

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.200
 take a lot of focus and effort.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.680
 So you have to figure out what is like the baseline of your life that you can support

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.640
 while you're entirely focused on this thing.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.640
 So if you have a bunch of savings that like guarantees, you can sustain probably a pretty

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.360
 high level quality life while you're focused on this thing.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.320
 If you are someone super young that has no responsibilities and can live with their parents,

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.040
 like that's another way to do this, right?

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.840
 Like you have your baseline of life is like, you know, is covered and you can just kind

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.320
 of focus on this thing.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.840
 So yeah, for me, it's less of an experiencing and more of a, can you actually focus on this

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.120
 thing in your life right now?

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.720
 And there's different ways to achieve that.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.960
 Yeah, you don't want to be stressed about just basic needs and stuff like that, trying

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.080
 to get something off the ground.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.760
 It's too much to think about.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.280
 And I think things have changed a lot when I was first starting, when I was first starting,

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:57.360
 I think it was pretty, uh, not normal for founders to take any kind of significant salary.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.040
 It was like kind of seen as like red flag.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.040
 Yeah.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.360
 It's changed a lot now because investors realize like they're just kind of productive.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.960
 Like the end of the day, like they're going to take a salary that accounts for like 5%

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.320
 of the runway or 10% of the runway.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.080
 It's like really nothing just to give them the ability to fully focus on it.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:17.800
 I've even seen certain investors be like, uh, send me a list of every single thing that

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.800
 you need to do.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.800
 That's not related to your company.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.920
 Uh, we'll make sure that it's taken care of by someone else.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.240
 So everything from like your personal taxes to cleaning your house to like whatever, like

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.200
 that they understand there's like a value in letting, letting people really focus.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.880
 I think we were kind of in that early, that stage you're talking about where it was like,

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.400
 don't take a big salary culture, uh, but we had really good investors.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.880
 Once we actually did raise our A, it was much of strategic and stuff and then the VCs were

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.880
 really kind.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.840
 Uh, so they were all about like making sure we weren't distracted with personal stuff.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.320
 I felt like we got paid pretty well the whole time that STEM is, but I didn't think that

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.320
 was typical.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.320
 Yeah.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.320
 Yeah.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.320
 Yeah.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.560
 I think before it was like bleed for five years and then, uh, yeah, then maybe you'll

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.560
 have some kind of exit.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.200
 What was the next question is location and port and for the success of your startup?

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.200
 I mean, that's nothing.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.800
 You have a really good perspective on this.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.800
 Yeah.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.440
 I mean, I have always lived in the Ozarks, which is not a tech hub.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:18.040
 It turns out, contrary to popular belief actually, uh, there's not really a tech scene here,

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.800
 but my co-founder lives in San Francisco.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.240
 So I feel like stamuz doesn't have its story.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.440
 If Eli's not out in San Francisco, because he did do a ton of fundraising out there,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:33.040
 like met personally with a lot of people that became close allies of the company.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:38.960
 Uh, I do think there's something to that, that sort of startup, uh, ecosystem in cities

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:44.720
 where they have such a thing, just like the logistics of the travel, like, uh, there is

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.640
 just a huge continue to people who still want to meet you in person and especially the older

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.880
 people that have all the money.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.880
 Uh, I don't know.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.840
 I think that's changed since the pandemic and I hope so for people that want to start

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.720
 a company from wherever they're at, uh, I was able to live in the Ozarks and co-found

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.880
 it remotely with my, my co-founder, but we had a pretty good relationship.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.880
 Yeah.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.880
 I don't know.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.880
 Is that what you were thinking?

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.880
 I was going to say.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.880
 Yeah.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.880
 Yeah.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.880
 Yeah.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.880
 I think similar, I think my perspective is similar.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.880
 It's definitely possible.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.880
 So you shouldn't let your locations stop you.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.520
 Um, literally there's examples of people starting companies in every situation.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.640
 So at this point, we know it's all possible, uh, but yeah, like, like Adam said, there

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.240
 are just like tailwinds that you have when you are in a certain location.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.720
 Um, you kind of like get embedded a little bit more in, in the network, things like that.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720
 Yeah.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.360
 And all possible to do remotely plus traveling when you need to.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.360
 Yeah.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.160
 I mean, like when we were in New York, it was nice to just be able to go meet investors

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.040
 for coffee, whatever, whoever it was, our customers.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.040
 Now we're in Miami.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.560
 Like we have customers in New York and less has to fly there to like, you know, do launches

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.480
 and stuff, uh, which, you know, it's a little bit more overhead, but again, so possible.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.480
 And it's not like Miami's Miami has its own, own scene here as I was talking about earlier.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.480
 Yeah.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.960
 It does help, but you don't need it.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.960
 Yeah.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.680
 And I'm sure it's even more possible now in the last few years with, I'm sure there's

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.200
 a lot more of venture capitalists that are willing to not shake your hand and give you

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.640
 checks since they've had to start doing the zoom stuff.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.640
 Yeah.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.640
 Yeah.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.640
 Exactly.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.640
 There's another question.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.840
 I think I have a lot of thoughts on this one, but, uh, for engineers considering a startup,

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.800
 which comes with a significant amount of equity, can you explain equity dilution, how it impacts

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.800
 engineers?

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.400
 So you're talking about like as an employee or as a founder coming in as a founding engineer,

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.160
 do you think the question?

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.280
 How do you know dilution applies to everyone?

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.280
 Yeah.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.280
 No, it does.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.280
 I guess, uh, my answer might have been different because I just don't think I just don't think

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.320
 it's a good idea to work for a startup.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.880
 I think start a startup, but that's a whole other question I think.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.960
 I guess as a founding engineer, how does dilution affect you?

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:49.040
 I mean, like you'll start out depending on how many co-founders with a big chunk in my

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.480
 case, you know, we each started with 50%.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.280
 And then when I left five years ago before I sold most of my steak, I think that was

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.280
 down to 20%.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.880
 We had raised something like $20 million.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:04.360
 It's just a, it's inevitable that your equity stake goes down as the company gets bigger,

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.240
 but they always say like, what do they say?

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.520
 It's better to have a little bit of a big thing.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.520
 1% of a billion.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.520
 Yeah.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.520
 Yeah.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.520
 Whatever.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:20.360
 Um, so yeah, like Adam, I think a lot of people join employees, join startups and think their

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.840
 equity is going to be worth a bunch.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.840
 It like almost never is a life changing amount and like by definition, it can't be.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.840
 You have a shot.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.960
 If you can be literally the first hire, maybe, I think anything after that, like if you're

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.920
 not literally the third person, there's two founders and maybe you're the third person

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.120
 is kind of like my situation SST.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.320
 Anything after that is not going to be life changing.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.520
 So you're doing this thing not for a life changing outcome at that point.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.520
 And I think people don't really understand that.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.040
 Um, just with the way the numbers work, you don't, you're not going to, you're not going

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:52.320
 to start off with enough to like make an amount that's going to like to a, I'm sure you can

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.720
 make some money, but it's not going to live in your life for the most part.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720
 Yeah.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.520
 And the dilution is like kind of crazy.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:05.760
 So if things ever at all don't go well, which is very likely at a startup, uh, you probably

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.480
 are going to be wiped out to near zero.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.320
 Um, like if the company has to get down around with a lot of companies are going through

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.240
 right now, because they were overvalued during, during the pandemic, a lot of them are taking

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.240
 down rounds.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.040
 When you take a down round, what that means is your previous equity was worked too much.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.680
 So we're going to correct that effectively.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.640
 And the people they corrected from are the people of common socks with people, the founders

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.080
 employees, like the non investors, uh, when that happens, it basically goes to zero.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.640
 So you need to start off with enough where even when those things happen, like you're

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.840
 still going to end up with enough.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.480
 I just tell people not to consider equity at all when they're working in a startup.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:46.480
 I still think working at a startup is a good idea, but mostly because, uh, you are someone

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.120
 earlier on in your career and it's your only way to get a ridiculous amount of responsibility

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.240
 that you're going to be insulated from at a bigger company.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.200
 So it's like, if you're going to work there, it's for personal growth.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.200
 Yeah.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.600
 Not for any like financial outcome.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.400
 It can set you up incredibly well to do your next thing, but that little thing probably

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.640
 isn't going to, is not going to work out.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.640
 Yeah.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.360
 I think my perspective on it is so like, uh, it's jaded the right word.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:14.880
 It's so, uh, skewed because as a founder, I know we dangle the equity carrots to like

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.880
 employees to hopefully motivate them.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.880
 Like we want them to be aligned.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:24.080
 That's founder's for like, we want you to work really, really hard, uh, because you want

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:29.240
 to see this potential outcome, but like I know how rare that is.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:34.520
 And even just like when employees leave or when bad things happen and you have to fire

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.560
 employees, like, or lay them off, uh, that they have to buy those options.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:44.040
 Like all those things, I know just like the chances of any employee you hire seeing a big

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.520
 payout from that equity, they're slim.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.520
 Yeah.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.520
 Yeah.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.920
 The buying the options thing is also another crazy thing because it's like, you basically

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.280
 when you leave, you have to like make a decision, like do I think this is going to be worth

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.520
 anything or should I just give up on it?

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.880
 And that's like, it's always super annoying.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.880
 It's tricky.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.880
 Yeah.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.040
 A little hack to avoid dilution as much is start a company with your spouse.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:08.280
 Because then on day one, most founders start with 50% equity, but on day one, we started

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.680
 off with a hundred percent of equity in our household, which means every single point

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:17.760
 where we get diluted, we get diluted like a lot less than the most amazing actually.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.760
 Most people.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.760
 Hang on.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.760
 I gotta go talk to Casey.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.760
 I gotta call her.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:22.760
 Good idea.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.720
 It also lets you give way more equity to employees.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.800
 So we can roughly give out double because we have a lot more that we're working with.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.560
 So yeah, it's like a funny little thing we didn't realize till later.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.560
 That's incredible.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.560
 Yeah.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.120
 So for step one, find a spouse, step two.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.320
 Make sure you two work together and we'll ruin your relationship.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.880
 Step three, then sorry, honey.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.880
 Easy hack.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.880
 Okay.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:50.120
 Then some questions, I guess, on the product side, or actually now let's stick to more

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:55.080
 on the business side for now, did you have to cold call in person, advertise businesses

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.600
 or was your approach focused exclusively online?

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.120
 I don't think it applies to stamis.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:05.160
 We're just like a website for consumers, which we don't have like a sales arm.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.160
 We don't make money.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160
 Basically.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.160
 Yeah.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.160
 I'm scared.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.560
 I think more generally though, when you do start a company, you are going to be doing

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.720
 some form of approaching random people, whether it's, you know, maybe you're trying to raise

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.720
 money.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.240
 Maybe you are trying to do a partnership with some other company.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.440
 So there probably is, there is a lot of that.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.040
 If you haven't done that, if you're just an engineer and you've never done that type

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.360
 of thing before, it is something you have to get comfortable doing.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.360
 It is a huge asset when you build a network.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.600
 I'm telling you, it is so much easier than you expect.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.560
 The moment you like plant the flag and say, I'm going to build this thing, people show

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.920
 up in your life, people like show up in your emails, like it definitely is possible.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.800
 I know it feels impossible when you're starting out with nothing, but literally every single

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.200
 founder you see with a good network and investors, they start off with nothing and they weren't

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.000
 really like special or anything.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.520
 But plus one, this is a, how to cope with your startup money running out and employees

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.400
 not getting as much freebies?

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.400
 Wait, what?

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.200
 What does that mean?

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.920
 Employees not getting as much freebies?

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.120
 Like your company's cutting back.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.680
 I mean, this just goes back to why being an employee to a startup is tough.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.800
 Like, you don't get that cushion that other companies have, but you know, big companies

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.200
 are doing layoffs now too.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.200
 Yeah.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.720
 I think the tradeoff is that at a small company, if you are very good, you have a chance to

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:28.080
 retain your job because you are good even during rough times at a big company.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.880
 It kind of doesn't matter if you're not, they just need to cut like some of our people

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.720
 and you're just, you're just, you're just out.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.480
 Yeah, we didn't, I mean, it's that means we never, I guess we never changed our like

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.880
 new hire budget.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:46.160
 So like we had like a $5,000 equipment slash whatever you need to be comfortable budget

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.000
 where you could buy a desk or a chair or whatever.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.680
 And then generally like expenses were pretty loose and we trusted people, but I think you

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.680
 don't hire that many people.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.520
 So you're not too worried about like in an early stage startup.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.280
 We didn't, I mean, total ended up hiring 30, 35 people, something like that.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.520
 Yeah, I think, I think a lot of companies, a lot of startups operate like big companies

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.560
 and they're not and they'll hire a lot of people and another thing to like cut back and

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.560
 rethink things.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.840
 That's always painful because taking away stuff was hard.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:20.080
 And the way we think about it at SST is for where we want to go, like our ambitious, most

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:25.040
 ambitious goals, we probably over the whole lifetime of our company to get there will

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.840
 probably only use a higher 10 people total.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.880
 So when you kind of think of it that way, like I only need to find 10 like really amazing

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.080
 people.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.800
 You kind of don't sweat like the little details around like how much exactly are they making

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.960
 or like, what are they getting?

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.720
 It's, we know if there's someone's good, like it's just going to be worth it because we

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.120
 only need to find 10 of them.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.520
 How do you know your product is ready for development, like from a technical level?

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:54.400
 I know like the indie hacker, right answer, like if you think it's ready, just it's not

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.600
 or you're too late.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.120
 No, say the real answer.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.400
 Okay, real answer.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:04.640
 So what we did was we had a deadline tied to the real world.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.640
 We were launching a product for NBA fans and we were starting in July and in October the

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:15.440
 season starts and we really wanted to launch it with the peak excitement around the season

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.440
 starting.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.360
 So that, that was like a three month or whatever forcing function where we're going to ship

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.800
 whatever we have in those three months.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.280
 Our product is a little unique in the sense that, I mean, it's just an input.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.280
 It's like Google.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.880
 It's like a search box and then it's just how good are the results.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.160
 So it was pretty easy for us to just say like, it's good enough.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.920
 I don't know with more complicated.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.680
 Maybe you want to speak with Boomi like from like a customer driven development standpoint

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.680
 or something.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.800
 Yeah, I think what Adam was losing earlier with the whole indie hacker thing where it's

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.480
 like, just ship garbage is fine.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:51.960
 So the mentality, which okay, I get it just comes down and like, does that click with

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.960
 you?

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.960
 Right?

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.960
 So for me, no, it doesn't because a big part of my advantage is that when people use my

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.520
 product, they're going to feel like, Oh, this like feels like they're not going to be able

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.880
 to put their finger on this feels better than most stuff that I use.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.880
 And that's a big selling point for anything that I try to build.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.160
 I mean, there's a flip side, right?

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.120
 I can like spend way too much time getting there and building something that nobody actually

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.120
 wants.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:18.520
 So the key is don't forget that your idea for your company is probably going to change

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.200
 a lot when you have people using it and they tell you about their problems and ideas.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.600
 Like feedback is insane.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.120
 Like I'll go from not caring about a concept to like obsessing over solving it because

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.800
 I just heard that somebody had like, I like witnessed someone with a specific problem.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.760
 So it's good to have stuff out there because it makes everything a lot easier when you're

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.400
 working without having any users, you're just making up stuff and you're trying to have

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.400
 a vision.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.320
 When you have users, they just tell you exactly what to do.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.760
 So it is nice to have stuff out there.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.600
 That said, like, I'm just, I think we've gone too far with that advice and now people

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.480
 are just like showing off how shitty their stuff is when they launch and I'm like it.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.480
 That's not the goal.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:58.640
 Is that the world we want to live in like, yeah, how do I convince my co-founders time

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.640
 to abandon?

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.000
 Have you had conversations like that?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.240
 Yeah, actually before I was fired, I mean, I was, I don't know if I should say this.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.240
 I don't know.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.240
 Honestly.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.840
 Ooh, this is our hundred listeners are going to get a little scoop here.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.600
 Like I don't, I just don't know if like investors could come after me or something like fiduciary

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.600
 duty or something.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.600
 I don't know.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.600
 Should I not say it, Dax?

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.600
 What am I about to say?

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600
 I don't know what you're going to say.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.600
 Okay.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:30.240
 Well, I was very on the record with Eli that we just got to, we got to get out.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:35.640
 We got to like, not abandon it, but every time we had an opportunity to sell, I was very

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.640
 hard.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.600
 I'm like, let's just sell this thing because we just didn't have like a plan to make money.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:45.040
 And we didn't know exactly everyone, like our investors, Disney, Google, these people,

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.620
 like their strategics, they don't, they're just like, grow it big, make it big.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.620
 Don't worry about money.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.160
 But like we had to eventually worry about money.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.320
 And I just felt like our best path is to get acquired by when these companies.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:01.640
 So I was very like adamant, in fact, I sent an email or I sent a message to Eli one time

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.320
 in the last months before I left, that was like, we just, we got to tell, I'm not going

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.680
 to say who, but we got to tell this person, we're ready to do a deal.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.240
 Like it was this acquisition talks that kind of gone on.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.220
 And it was like me basically saying, let's just tell them we're in business, whatever.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.280
 He got very upset that like you don't do that.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.280
 You don't.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.400
 It's just fiduciary duty, something, something.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.400
 I don't know.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.400
 I probably broke some rules.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.400
 Some startup rules.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.400
 I'm sorry, I've repented for my startup sins.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.400
 I don't know.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.760
 That was a, that was me just like, it's 10 set day.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.760
 I'm done.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.960
 I can't do this anymore.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.120
 My wife was so done.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.440
 Casey was just so tired of like waiting for it to get better because we had cut back salaries.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.400
 We had like done a lot of things in the last year because fundraising was tough.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.920
 So we were just kind of personally pretty done with it.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.920
 Yeah.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.920
 I think it's a, it's hard.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.280
 I mean, it's, we started by talking about like, you know, not giving up and that is a

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.840
 big part of it.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.800
 But yeah, there are situations like that.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.800
 I mean, I did similar situation where I try to convince the founder to, again, similar.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.120
 I wasn't saying like abandoned it.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.000
 I was saying, just look for any kind of exit and we can start on our next thing.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 Yeah.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.440
 Because in that situation, it was cause like he accepted this ridiculous deal that wasn't

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.520
 that left him with like no ownership.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.120
 And I was like, it doesn't matter if this company like is incredible.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.600
 You have no ownership or control.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.040
 The whole point of doing all of this is now gone.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.040
 Just it's okay.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.040
 Like it's your first startup.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.280
 It was probably going to fail anyway.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.280
 Like just write it off and let's move on.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.640
 We can do something else, but I couldn't get through to him.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.240
 He kind of saw it as like, no, this is like the vision.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.240
 Like I need to stick with it.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.880
 I need to stay with it.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:42.480
 And I have, he's still working on it and I've lived like five different lives since then.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.920
 And it's like, I can't believe he's still like doing the same thing.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.760
 Also it's a little bit of like, this is a, this is a petty, but I'm going to say it when

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.240
 I got fired.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.720
 So pretty much the whole time I was there, it was just me for a year.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.800
 Then we hired like one, we hired Allen, we hired one person, then we hired another person,

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:06.240
 basically three, three engineers for, you know, three years or so.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:11.800
 And we built the product and then they fired me and before they fired me, I like all engineers

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.800
 left as well.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.680
 And like I think Allen joined a company advise and another one joined one of the companies

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.280
 I was consulting at.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.080
 So all the whole engineering team was gone.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.100
 They replaced us with a bunch of other engineers.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:26.400
 And I believe at some point it was like eight or nine engineers, right?

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.700
 And it's been three or four years since then and they were going to like rewrite the whole

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.700
 thing.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:35.320
 I can still go to the site and I can see it is still running the same, the exact same

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.720
 product, the exact same application that we left.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.520
 Like it's now we've been gone for more time than we were there and they have not been able

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.520
 to rebuild this thing.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:51.320
 And that brings me so much happiness, like you thought, you thought I was like not important

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.200
 is you can just let me go and it was going to be fine.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.920
 Well, you're still running the same thing or so doing the same thing, all the same bugs

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.920
 are still there.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.920
 Like I can see them.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.920
 I love it.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.760
 And it's been years and I don't I have no, at this point, I have no idea what what they

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:04.760
 were doing.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.400
 Like, I don't know how it's like not even a little replaced at this point, so that makes

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.400
 me feel great.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.400
 Makes me feel great.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.400
 I go check.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.400
 Every once in a while.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.400
 And it was good.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.400
 All right, let me see if there's I think we got through all the questions.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.400
 Let me see.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.400
 Oh, do we really?

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.480
 Yeah, I think that was it unless I missed something, but I guess we've gone on a little

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.480
 longer than normal.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.480
 That's okay.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.480
 Do you have any other thoughts?

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.480
 I don't think so.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.480
 It's just fun, though.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.480
 Yeah, it was fun.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.000
 I think just to summarize, if you're interested in all doing it, don't wait too long.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.680
 Like, you are ready today, as long as you can dedicate some time to it.

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.360
 Find someone you really trust and can work with.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.800
 I mean, like Adam said, it could potentially like torpedo your relationship, but it hasn't

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.920
 happened to me yet, so can also work out and we're in many other and good terms again.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:55.680
 So like, our story is one of it torpedoed a lifelong friendship.

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.680
 And then it's back.

00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.280
 Like, we're good now.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.280
 Yeah.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:04.200
 One thing I did think back just hearing you tell that last story is like, on the one

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.600
 hand, in the same podcast, you've said that, like, the key is to stick it out and to live

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.600
 long enough.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.600
 Things will work out.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.760
 But then, on the other hand, this founder that you worked with, a CEO, stuck it out,

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.000
 but maybe just like, needs to read the situation better.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.080
 Like, he is keeping it alive long enough.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.080
 Yeah.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.560
 But like, what are his incentives to do so?

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.720
 Like, what is the payoff if he only owns 3% of the company or whatever?

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.680
 So you've got to live long enough that the company makes it, but if the company makes

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.160
 it and you don't really benefit that much, what was it all?

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.160
 Was it worse?

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.160
 A decade of your life?

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.160
 Like, that's the question.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.160
 Yeah.

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.160
 Yeah, exactly.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.440
 It still all has to make sense.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.440
 It shouldn't have.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.920
 The outcome shouldn't be like, oh, if I just worked at some boring company for 10 years,

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.720
 I would have been in a better place.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.560
 As soon as that becomes true, like, the whole thing doesn't make sense.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.560
 Good stuff.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.040
 This is like a double episode.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.040
 I think.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.040
 I can't really read the timer from here.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.040
 Is that long?

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.040
 I mean, is it been 39?

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.040
 Is that what that says?

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.040
 39, yeah.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.040
 I guess.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.040
 I think it's close to double.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.040
 Let's do the actual math.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.560
 The listeners needs an Amshkin.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.560
 All right.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.560
 All right.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.560
 Thanks.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.560
 See ya.
