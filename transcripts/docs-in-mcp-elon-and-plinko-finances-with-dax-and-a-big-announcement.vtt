WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
 - Maybe Chris could like cut out the middle part

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.920
 where I was like, maybe we'll just be done after 30,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.760
 you know, call it.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.340
 (upbeat music)

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.060
 - Okay, now, hey, we weren't recording yet.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.000
 - Oh, hey, Riverside has a new process now.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.560
 It like opens another tab.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.400
 - I guess.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.240
 - In the background?

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.880
 - Yeah, I feel like that guy is like,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.480
 I like the old Facebook.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.040
 I just, every time it changes, like when you click record

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.880
 now there's like four little options you have to choose

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.600
 from and it's on my teleprompter, so it's so tiny

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.680
 and I can't read any of them.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.120
 I'm like, I don't know, I just want to record.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.680
 Like I used to, I just want to hit the button.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.040
 - Yeah, now it opens up like a background tab

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.120
 for you to, for it to upload.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.960
 That's what it's for me.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.840
 - Oh, mine's not doing that.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.180
 Maybe let's just guess.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.020
 - Yeah.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.080
 - So you don't close the tab and then like as the host,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.540
 I know to upload my, anyway, we're getting, yeah.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.120
 (laughing)

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.960
 - How are you?

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.520
 - I am good just preparing for all this stuff next week.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.200
 I think it's almost there, but it's gonna be busy.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.160
 - Like, are you mostly preparing for React Miami things?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.920
 Like, party?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 - Yeah, the party, some of the,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.560
 just like the tech we need next week,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.960
 some of the just logistics of all the different things

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.920
 that we're filming next week, so.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.760
 I guess we can talk about it here, like, it's fine.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.360
 But so we're filming this documentary on Monday.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.000
 It's gonna be a mockumentary and I know those people

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.800
 just like some thoughts.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.640
 I think we're gonna like improvise most of it, but.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.200
 - As one does, the terminal dot shop.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.800
 (laughing)

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.120
 - I'm just like, I don't know how much we can call

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.960
 with the head at a time.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.800
 It's just gonna be better when we call it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.900
 with stuff in person.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.740
 - Yeah.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.360
 - So, yeah, but I'm excited.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.840
 - Well, I'm doing everything I can to prepare

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.240
 for next week as well in the form of wellness shots

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.840
 and immunity boosts.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.920
 I did a sauna session this morning.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.320
 I'm just trying not to get sick.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.280
 - Do you feel sick at all?

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.840
 - No, not yet.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.000
 Well, I can't figure it out.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.880
 Like, do I just have COVID immunity?

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.680
 'Cause my oldest tested positive for COVID.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.840
 That's what led to his pneumonia.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.320
 - Did you test yourself?

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.040
 - No, I don't have any symptoms.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.680
 I feel fine.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.600
 I did sleep in bed with my five-year-old last night,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.040
 who's the worst right now, of us all.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.360
 My 10-year-old's recovering.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.440
 But the five-year-old is in the thick of it.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.640
 It was like last night was the worst night.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.040
 He's just coughing all over me all night.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.640
 Like just in my face, just,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.520
 and I just got terrible sleep

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.800
 'cause he's coughing all night.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.120
 And I just thought like, yeah, I'm definitely getting it now.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.440
 And I feel fine so far.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.960
 - You didn't come in and affect all of us?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.200
 - Yeah, I'm gonna get there.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.440
 As soon as I land in Miami, I'm gonna start coughing.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.520
 - Oh, man.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.040
 (laughing)

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.720
 - We'll put you in a different hotel.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.560
 - Yeah, quarantine me.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.280
 No, there's, I mean, there's a very good chance

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.120
 I'm not coming.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.880
 If either I or Casey starts showing symptoms

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.080
 the next 48 hours, which is, I don't know,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.200
 feels like a less likely scenario

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.720
 that we both come out unscathed.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.200
 - But anyway.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.760
 People are already arriving.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.600
 - What?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.200
 - Yeah, I think, so Kramer is getting here today.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.800
 And I'm gonna see if we want to hang out

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.280
 and get dinner or something.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.680
 Ken was complaining to me about his flight this morning.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.240
 So I guess he's gonna be here today also.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.760
 - Nice.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.040
 - Yeah, it's like a whole week.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.600
 - Got a whole, yeah.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.440
 - Geez, everybody's converging on Daxville.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.680
 (laughing)

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.480
 - It is crazy 'cause I remember when I moved here,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.000
 I was just like, man, it'd be cool

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.320
 like people would ever come here.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.440
 And then like, it just like manifested, you know?

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.960
 - People keep, yeah.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.600
 - I am proud of that 'cause three years ago,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.920
 nobody was coming here two years ago a little bit more.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.000
 And then the last year has been like really crazy.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.040
 - Michelle's done a great job with React Miami.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.120
 It's a good conference.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.560
 I've not been to a lot of conferences,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.720
 but she does a good job.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.320
 - Yeah, I also love how much people are like,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.720
 get excited to come here.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.600
 And everyone like, you know, thinks about their outfits

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.480
 and like, it's like a whole thing that everyone like plays into.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.320
 - Yeah, that's what I do.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.680
 I think about my outfits.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.440
 (laughing)

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.560
 I pack my Todd Shelton jeans and...

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.720
 (laughing)

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.600
 - Well, everyone else, everyone else gets really out of it.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.720
 - I'm gonna show up, one of these times,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.040
 I'm gonna show up in Miami.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.880
 - Where?

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.800
 - We're in what you wear, like an outfit, like a silk onesie.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.400
 And you're gonna be like, whoa, Adam has culture or something.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.240
 - I don't think I've ever seen you wearing color.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.600
 - Yeah, mostly neutrals, huh, black and white.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.960
 - Yeah.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.800
 - Interesting.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.120
 - It's the same, but I have like some stuff

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.640
 that's in the extreme opposite to, you know, bounce it out.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.480
 - Hmm.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.320
 - I don't have any of that.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.320
 Yeah, I don't have anything color.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.000
 Wow, I can't think of, I have like,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.800
 they're all earthy tones, like maroons.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.840
 - Mostly earth tones, yeah, just the tans, the dark greens.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.840
 I love the dark green.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.680
 I do a dark green.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.520
 - Dark green.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.360
 Okay, okay.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.200
 - Yeah.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.880
 But I get it, but you know.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.640
 - We got stuff to talk about.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.480
 - That's true.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.120
 - First thing I wanna talk about, this was not on my mind

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.200
 until right before you jumped on when I was looking at Twitter,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.800
 we've unexpectedly built so many tools

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.040
 as a side effect of building apps.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.480
 We're about to go one level deeper.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.560
 Is this something you could talk about on the podcast?

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.680
 - It's a mix of a few things.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.760
 So the stuff that you're working on,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.600
 the open code stuff, that's gonna be cool

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.160
 'cause it'll be like the first, again, for our audience.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.960
 - Talked about it last episode.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.800
 - Well, we talked about it last time.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.040
 Okay, we did talk about it last time.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.760
 Yeah, so just a open source cloud code, Adam,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.680
 and we have another guy.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.520
 How do you suppress it?

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.200
 - Well, Kootie Tim is making it.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.480
 Yeah, Kootie Tim is making it.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.040
 I am just giving advice and saying,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.880
 "Here's what I would like."

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.160
 'Cause I'm just a big cloud code user.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
 So I just, I feel like I'm Indians, big opinions.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.920
 - Yeah, so that's gonna be under the open brand.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.920
 I'm talking to a company today about building our own model.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.120
 - Right.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.720
 - And I just wanna get really up to speed

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.760
 on what the state of the art and continuous training is

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.440
 because it's such a problem in open source.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.680
 So we have a vague goal of building a model

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.840
 that's not just for SST, but creating a nice pipeline

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.960
 so that all of these open source tools

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.120
 can easily continuously train on it.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.460
 As time goes on, React Router V7,

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.120
 it's just not in like LMs do not return

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.000
 React Router V7 stuff, Tailon V4 not included,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.280
 STV3 not included.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.280
 So a single model that is good at those things

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.960
 is probably useful.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.320
 I don't know if it's gonna be the model

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.840
 that everybody is using primarily for coding, maybe not,

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.560
 but something that people can embed in docs,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.440
 something that people can use as like a bot

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.120
 in their Discord.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.540
 So I wanna like try to go down that path

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.240
 and to see like what's there.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.520
 The thing that I think we're maybe all taking for granted is,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.520
 I don't know if I already said this last time,

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.000
 I'm gonna say it again, these AI companies are massive.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.640
 There's so many of them, they have billions

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.120
 and billions of dollars.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.720
 So it feels like they're just gonna solve every problem,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.680
 but the surface area is so large for what AI can do

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.240
 that despite all of that, despite all the competition,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.600
 we just say for granted that like these little hints

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.520
 that they're not gonna solve.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.240
 And if you like dig into it, like let's take Tailwind V4,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.320
 right?

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.640
 How in the world is a generic LM training process

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.640
 gonna like properly differentiate between V3 and V4

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.000
 and like node or like prioritize V4?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.920
 Are they gonna label their datasets to that extreme

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.960
 where they're like, I just don't think they're gonna go

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.720
 into that level of detail, I don't think they can,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.440
 I don't think it makes any sense for them to.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.720
 And I've talked to a few different open source people,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.480
 they all recognize this problem.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.800
 I don't think anyone cares about it as much as we do

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.560
 'cause we're like a little more growth focused

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.000
 than other people.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.360
 So they're not gonna like solve it directly.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.520
 The figure if we solve for sales we might as well

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.680
 try to solve it for everyone.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.680
 Buns another one, you know,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.760
 Buns always adding new APIs and then, you know,

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.200
 don't know about them, so.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.320
 - Okay, I can't, I've been buying my time.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.720
 You should do the model thing, for sure.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.600
 Like you should, but there's, I feel like

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.360
 this is the most obvious thing I've ever felt convicted about

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.520
 that no one seems to agree with and I'm just gonna,

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.800
 I'm gonna build it.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.640
 - What is it?

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.800
 - I'm going to build an MCP docs server.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.040
 - No, we're gonna do that.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.360
 - We're gonna add that?

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.160
 - Well, I mean, yeah, we're gonna add,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.640
 we're gonna give an MCP thing for our docs.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.480
 We're definitely gonna do that.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.320
 We've tried some stuff.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.320
 - Not just for your docs.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.200
 This is just, it's the, what's the definitely typed thing?

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.200
 It's just a community project that just,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.040
 - Oh, I see.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.680
 - The MCP server is pass in a framework and a version,

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.480
 get back, and maybe even a search term,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.640
 get back relevant, markdown or something.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.800
 Like that is the MCP server and it needs to exist.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.160
 And yeah, it's a lot of tedium,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.040
 but like we do that all the time.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.720
 We do tedium, definitely typed tedium.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.520
 - Okay, so yes, that's definitely there

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.000
 and that maybe is a solution to this,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 but it so requires a lot of setup.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.080
 - Well, we're gonna build it straight into open code.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.760
 So if you just use open code, you're fine.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.600
 - That's true. - We'll just,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.760
 it'll be configured directly and--

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.040
 - That is true, that would make it a lot easier.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.280
 - Distribution problem is awesome.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.280
 - And then as long as open code beats cursor,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.120
 then this can--

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.640
 - Yeah, well, I mean, it can be,

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.280
 so the cursor thing, they make it really easy

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.240
 to add MCP servers, right?

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.320
 - Yeah, I know, I know.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.600
 - So if you're serious and you're running into these issues,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.080
 then, I don't know, click the button.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.040
 - Yeah, so we are gonna support those.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.400
 I don't know how good it's gonna perform though,

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.240
 'cause like I tried stuff.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240
 - I think it's gonna perform great.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.560
 Sorry, it just seems like a perfect,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.200
 everyone, when I brought this up on Twitter,

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.920
 everyone's like, well, there's already like web fetch.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.280
 It's not gonna figure out how to fetch the right docs

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.000
 for the right version of your framework,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.160
 but like you're using a thing

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.400
 and it's in package JSON, we have a version.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.240
 - Yeah.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.800
 - There is no reason we can't build a tailwind at SST

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.800
 but whatever, all inside one MCP server,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.600
 like a repository of Markdown that we just keep updated.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.440
 You know what I'm saying?

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.920
 Like why is that not gonna work?

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.800
 - It makes sense, but then like, okay,

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.360
 so what we found works really well is,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.080
 so for us SST components,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.240
 giving the docs for works, well,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.080
 giving you the whole source code of the component

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.560
 works really well.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.520
 Yeah, like how do you make all that easy for us to do

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.600
 for a right and the other thing is,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.480
 this stuff blows up the context like crazy.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.160
 That's the other issue, like.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.960
 - Yeah, I mean, it would be a search term.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.520
 I feel like it would need to be like,

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.400
 I wanna get a section of the docs.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.640
 I don't need all of the SST V3 docs.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.840
 I need the section that deals with secrets

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.560
 'cause I need to add a secret and I don't know how.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.480
 - Yeah, like I said, I just in the performance,

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.360
 like it's low hanging fruit, so we should definitely do it.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.800
 I just don't think the performance is gonna hit the bar

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.280
 where I'm like, oh, I feel good about people

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.680
 'cause our primary thing, the primary piece of pain

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.880
 that we're feeling is building or learning SST

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.520
 or building someone SST from an LM first approach

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.680
 is not a good experience right now.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.600
 - Yeah.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.440
 - The thing you're talking about will improve that.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.680
 I don't know if it's gonna cross the bar where I'm like,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.440
 okay, this no longer feels like it's a bad experience.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.160
 But yeah, I mean, it's so obvious

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.040
 in low hanging fruit that it should just be done.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.000
 - I think it's a few things.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.840
 And I'm not trying to discourage the custom model.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.200
 I think fine tuning, I've seen stuff recently,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.840
 like the major versions of these latest models

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.160
 have not met expectation, I guess.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.800
 People are saying they're getting better results.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.800
 These are like research papers.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.640
 I didn't read them.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.180
 I just saw what people said about them.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.160
 They're like fine tuning is this like crosses the gap,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.000
 makes things really good.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.560
 So I think there's plenty, I think lots of companies,

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.800
 including SST should be fine tuning models

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.640
 to see who can make the best programming model

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.840
 or the best like I'm a web developer in 2025 model.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.600
 It's like more specific even.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.240
 I think that's good.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.880
 I think to me, it would be harder to convince me

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.400
 to swap out cloud three seven,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.800
 than to swap or to add an MCP server, I guess.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.680
 Like I get that they're both kind of tricky problems.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.240
 - Yeah, but the MCP server could just call the model.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.080
 - Oh, I see.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.080
 - Yeah, that was one other.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.080
 - I feel like a docs MCP server combined with LSP,

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.240
 diagnostics embedded in, like I'm just speaking open code here.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.560
 - Combined with source graph.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.160
 - The source graph tool was crazy,

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.040
 'cause I didn't know that was in there.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.240
 Yeah, just to recap what it was.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.320
 So open code, just like cloud code.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.440
 But so in my head, I was like,

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.880
 oh, it has all the same tools as cloud code,

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.200
 but it has some more tools in cloud code.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.440
 One of them is a way to search source graph.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.040
 And I was asking it to implement something using a library,

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.920
 my own library, which I forgot how to use.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.280
 Relatable.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.680
 - Yeah.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.840
 And then it just did a query using source graph

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.960
 to find any public code using it.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.400
 And it found an example of what I wanted to do

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.000
 and then use that to implement it.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.120
 And I'm like, that's genius.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.520
 That's really smart.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.560
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.120
 I just, I feel like these are solvable problems.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.320
 Like models, I just assume models are just a brain.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.920
 And they, the knowledge cutoff thing

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.120
 is not a thing that registers with me anymore.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.720
 It's like, that's what fetching and using MCP servers is for,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.320
 for getting like contextual,

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.160
 very contextual information and putting it into the context.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.360
 I also don't care about costs.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.360
 So maybe that's my problem.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.200
 Like, I'm like, yeah, dump all the docs in it.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.280
 If it gets the right answer and it saves back and forth,

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.120
 then that's worth it.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.240
 But I'm just assuming also model costs

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.280
 are going to go to zero.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.640
 Like that's just a longterm trend is commodity.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.480
 I don't know.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.400
 - The cost, yeah, the cost as a factor,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.840
 the speed is a factor.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.840
 But I think, because I've tried

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.480
 and the output's really bad, like even with that stuff.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.320
 - What are you talking about?

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.160
 What output?

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.360
 - 'Cause I've tried mainly testing this.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.240
 Like, okay, what if I gave it access to docs?

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.520
 What if I did X, Y, D things?

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.920
 And it definitely improves the performance,

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.600
 but it still just makes up stuff

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.880
 that's like, doesn't even look like SST at all.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.000
 V2 or V3, like just like made up.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.840
 Okay, like structures, the whole app is like one JSON object.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.680
 Like it just.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.240
 - And this is with just like the knowledge cutoff

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.640
 of three seven or something.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.640
 - Yeah, like it can definitely write V2, STV2 code well,

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.880
 but then when I tell it, hey, we're doing V3 here

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.280
 to the docs, it like really starts panicking.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.560
 It just starts to make some crazy stuff up.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.400
 So.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.240
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.080
 - The docs thing is, like I said, it's obvious we should do it.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.920
 I just don't know if we'll cross that bar.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.120
 And it might, maybe with like enough tricks, but.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.040
 - The LSP diagnostics is also a form of docs, right?

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.400
 'Cause that's pulling, like when you get a type error

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.120
 or even just the hints and stuff,

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.360
 don't those have like whatever docs you wrote

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.560
 above the function or whatever?

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.400
 Like.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.920
 - That would be cool if that's in the LSP.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.400
 I don't know if the LSP diagnostics contain the JSTock.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.240
 - Maybe not.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.080
 - Information.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:26.920
 It definitely contains a type in from,

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.200
 or that is a type error, which is usually good enough.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.040
 - Yeah.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.040
 - Yeah.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.840
 This whole context thing is, is what sucks,

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.360
 which is why I'm looking at this continuous training thing.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.040
 It's not just, it's not just fine tuning.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.480
 I'm trying to understand this stuff better.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.280
 There's like a whole host of techniques.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.880
 Yeah, I don't think people are going to switch out

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.160
 their primary coding model.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.800
 That's why I would want to deliver this as another AI

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.800
 that your primary AI can talk to and send the prompt.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.640
 - Yep.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.160
 - And now it's like more specialized.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.000
 - Okay.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.480
 So you're, I mean, we're kind of talking

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.360
 about the same sort of thing.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.080
 The thing you're talking about would kind of be like

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.920
 an MCP server.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.760
 I don't know if you would.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.000
 - Yeah, it would be an MCP server.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.880
 And it's, and there would be like a collective effort

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.120
 to have data that's input into whatever this process is.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.000
 And I can just be straight up a way to search.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.600
 - It's just a smart version of what I was saying.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.760
 I was saying like dump, mark down into the context.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.800
 You're saying like, no, be intelligent and have a model

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.760
 that actually gives you the correct answer.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.600
 - Yeah.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.360
 I mean, it could do, like I said, with enough tricks,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.200
 one of these approaches might end up being good enough.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.840
 But yeah, the root problem is like getting the data together.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.040
 That's really where the tedious stuff is.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.360
 Oh, and we have another open project

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.560
 we're trying to kick off.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.720
 - I feel like you've hinted at a few and are you gonna reveal?

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.480
 Can we reveal them to the podcast listeners?

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.600
 So I posted about one yesterday

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.880
 'cause we're looking for someone to take it on

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.960
 and I got a bunch of responses.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.800
 - That's the one I saw.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.480
 - Yeah, so we are probably gonna move off of Astro

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.600
 for all of our docs and everything.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.240
 Here's what we like about Astro.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.560
 We like that it's JSX, it's components.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.040
 You can output everything statically.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.480
 What we don't like is the data show file.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.560
 We don't use 90% of Astro features.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.680
 It's quite heavy for how little we use it.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.920
 And I was talking to Jay yesterday

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.280
 who's been through every iteration of this

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.000
 for the past 15 years 'cause he built our SST book.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.720
 Like he built that using Jekyll

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.440
 and he just been through all these different iterations

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.320
 so he has a really clear sense of what the scope

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.720
 of this thing is.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.800
 And his point of view was that

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.120
 Jekyll is effectively the perfect product.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.920
 And his point was if you go to their site,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.000
 you'll see it looks like that site from 2015

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.080
 because hasn't really needed to have been updated since then.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.320
 It's actually pretty nostalgic.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.120
 It reminds you of the beginning of 2.0.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.680
 - Yeah, transfer your plain text

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.920
 into static websites and blogs, okay?

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.760
 - Yeah, so he's like, if we just build that,

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.200
 make it based off of buns so it's really fast

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.440
 'cause Jekyll was like it got pretty slow.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.120
 Make it like very low dependency, built off of buns,

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.000
 JSX based, MDX based.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.600
 And then just take the exact scope of Jekyll,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.480
 which is not very large, it's a very small scope,

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.840
 very well defined.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.480
 And just do like a modern JavaScript-based refresh

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.400
 off of it using buns.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.640
 I don't know, open site, I don't know.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.360
 So we're gonna probably move our docs.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.200
 - Oh, open site.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.040
 Let's go inside.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.560
 - We'll move our docs to that.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.840
 I also have been thinking about publishing

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.960
 so on my longer threads on my own site as well.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.760
 So I've probably, I've kind of looking for something

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.600
 like this.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.600
 - You can dog food it and get some good feedback.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.400
 - Yeah, and then a part of this would be

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.400
 to output the four LMs, whatever this pipeline is also,

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.240
 spit something out that's structured in a way that,

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.200
 you know, whatever this thing is, can ingest,

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.720
 can be ingested into, yeah.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.920
 - Such an interesting time that we live in.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.760
 - Yeah.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.600
 - It's really, it's fun.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.720
 I enjoy this like, transitionary period.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.400
 It's this weird, like, you know,

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.240
 we need to all be building towards this,

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.520
 like this world where we control a legion

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.960
 of little junior devs, and then maybe they're senior devs

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.400
 and then maybe they're better than us.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.560
 But it's also this feeling of like,

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.040
 you don't know if at some point things do get so good

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.600
 that it's just like, none of it matters.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.040
 You know what I mean?

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.080
 Is that just like not gonna happen?

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.160
 Is that a sci-fi reality that like,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.240
 software dev just vanishes because AI is so good

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.160
 that there's just AI, there's not software.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.080
 You just talk to the AI and it does everything.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.480
 - I felt this way from the beginning.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.160
 I feel like every day that goes by,

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.640
 it seems like that's less and less the case,

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.120
 but I also know that that's often also a trap.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.920
 So yeah, I don't really know how I really think about things.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.520
 I've been pretty underwhelmed with

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.960
 all the different model releases.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.000
 - Yeah, same.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.400
 To be honest, the last couple of rounds,

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.040
 it's like, it feels like three, five to three, seven

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.960
 was such a minor bump and granted.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.760
 It's just, they didn't call it 4.0 for a reason, I guess.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.440
 Like it wasn't supposed to be a major jump, maybe.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.440
 I'm very keen to see the clod for GPT-5 generation.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.080
 Like what do things look like?

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.840
 It's like one more data point of,

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.320
 are we leveling off here and then we've reached peak

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.760
 with current tech?

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.480
 - I think it's a funny thing because we know the,

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.520
 'cause it's all mathematical,

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.760
 but they're gonna increase the amount of, the model's gonna be bigger.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.680
 The next big generation is just gonna be bigger

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.800
 and therefore it's going to be,

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.320
 like the inputs are like mathematically larger.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.360
 His question is, is the output gonna be

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.360
 exponentially better or is it gonna be like,

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.840
 start tapering off?

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.440
 I wonder if it's gonna turn back

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.320
 to the most boring problem that's existed forever,

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.680
 which is just, it's just all about your data.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.680
 At this point, these models have sucked all the data

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.360
 that's like generally available.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.480
 And if they plateau of being like,

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.880
 yeah, we've tried every single trick,

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.560
 yeah, we can make them a little bit better,

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.520
 incrementally better, just off of just like,

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.640
 how we're training and doing all these little tricks.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.240
 But there's like a ceiling here.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.200
 Then I think it becomes the era of like,

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.560
 custom trained models that are--

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.000
 - Yeah, vertical specific.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.880
 - Yeah, and like, yeah, hyper-trained on like,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.960
 certain data that's not generally available.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.320
 Like for us, you know, again,

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.380
 the going back to the examples helmet earlier,

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.080
 open air is not gonna label being like,

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.320
 these are V2 examples.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.160
 Never use them.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.840
 These are V3 things, like always prefer,

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.560
 you know, there's not gonna do that.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.160
 And that's what it comes down to.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.680
 Then, you know, it's a boring old problem

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.400
 of like, who has the most unique data

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.680
 and who has the most data?

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.360
 And yeah, that kind of goes back to that old race.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.200
 - Yeah, it's interesting.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.920
 I don't know that since we've talked,

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.160
 or no, I guess when we talked last time,

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.360
 we just didn't talk about it.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.560
 Like, but we didn't talk about Lama 4 at all, did we?

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.360
 - We didn't talk about Lama 4--

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.520
 - Or DGB3, for that matter.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.080
 Our two should be coming out soon.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.800
 - Lama 4 sounded like just like benchmark hacking

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.640
 from what I saw people saying.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.600
 - That's what I mean, yeah, that's what I saw.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.520
 - I tried it myself and I was like, this is,

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.360
 I was excited 'cause I'm like,

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.600
 oh, oh, the knowledge cut off is August, 2024.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.840
 Like, SCV 3 was like kind of out then.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.480
 - So interesting, you think about knowledge cut off.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.720
 I just haven't thought about knowledge cut off in so long.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.000
 - It just, it's our like number one pain point.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.720
 Like, someone new hears about ST,

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.200
 they go there at Lama 5 to use it,

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.320
 they get the worst experience ever.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.240
 So it's just like killing us.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.600
 - Yeah, it's the oldest CB2 stuff.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.720
 I get that.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.360
 I guess it doesn't affect me because like,

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.240
 as a builder of things with us as CB3,

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.680
 I guess I don't really ever try to have it

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.760
 right the info stuff.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.600
 I just--

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.440
 - No, 'cause it's so minimal.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.280
 - It's so minimal.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.120
 Like, that stuff just,

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.200
 it's like, I want it to write the stupid giant component

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.600
 that I don't want to write from scratch,

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.840
 like for a front end.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.720
 That's what I want the LMs to do for me.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.040
 So, but I get, if you're new--

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.600
 - If you're new, that's a problem, yeah.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.840
 - Like, it would be really cool to start with a blank directory

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.880
 and just create a modern repo in the vein

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.640
 of what your kind of pattern is.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.960
 I mean, just the whole SSD monorepo,

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.440
 the way you do things.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.040
 I don't know if that's a pipe dream.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:08.880
 I would love that.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.760
 - The thing that I keep testing it with is,

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.280
 hey, can you add a cron job that does something?

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.120
 - Yeah.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.200
 - I list it out.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.520
 And I expect it to go create the cron job on the SSD side

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.520
 and also go implement the application code

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.520
 for actually running it.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.360
 - Yeah, right.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.200
 - And that's like my benchmark.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.760
 Whatever gets us there,

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.160
 then I'll start to feel good about,

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.720
 okay, this, we're like passing the bar on what we need.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.720
 - Yeah.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.960
 - Well, yeah, I haven't been able to get there yet.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.880
 - Well, now I want to test,

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.000
 I want to throw together a little docs MCP server.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.840
 - You should do it.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.440
 - I'm just going to try it with SSD.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.640
 It'll just be all faked.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.360
 But just to see, like, if you drop SSD stuff,

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.280
 mark down in context,

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.720
 that doesn't even have to build an MCP server.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.920
 You just need to drop some mark down from your docs

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.480
 to your MDX files, just drop them straight in,

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.320
 see what it does.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.800
 - Yeah, I think Frank's going to look at this next week.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.640
 It's funny.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.640
 So last year, the J comes down for React Miami.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.080
 So it's Frank by himself in Canada.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.360
 He's like a weak where none of us are interacting with him.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.200
 - Bothering him.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.040
 - Yeah.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.800
 - Last year he shipped like all of container stuff for SSD,

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.000
 which was like really big for us.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.240
 And that wasn't totally random.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.840
 It's because we were shipping that SSH site

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.520
 and we were doing like a bunch of container stuff.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.720
 So I was giving him stuff we needed.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.560
 - Yeah.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.400
 - But it was like a really productive week.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.240
 Those are a very good release

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.960
 and containers are obviously huge for us now.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.800
 - What's he going to ship?

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.120
 - This week, we've been like,

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.520
 okay, what are you going to do this year, Frank?

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.520
 Like what's your big thing?

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.760
 But he's going to look into this like getting our docs

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.720
 in, you know, and format and all that.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.560
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.120
 This feels like it's a solvable problem is my gut.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.960
 I don't know what the solution will be.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.240
 Maybe it's the model thing, maybe it's something else.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.800
 But I do think this is the thing we can get over, right?

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.560
 Like where we can always use the right,

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.840
 like where we can teach DLMs about versions of software.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.080
 As the season extreme example,

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.600
 because you guys changed so much from two to three,

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.000
 like just such a different example of code.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.800
 Like the code examples are just so starkly different.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.360
 So I feel you guys probably feel that pain more than most.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.200
 - Yeah.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.960
 But the other issue is like it just sets you down

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.800
 the wrong path, even for a minor change,

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.360
 like if you're using tailwind,

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.920
 it's going to set you down the V3 path

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.080
 with like different conventions.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.720
 They have the JavaScript file, you know,

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.280
 that kind of changed how they think about things.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.360
 So you kind of accidentally end up doing the old stuff

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.720
 without realizing.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.720
 So yeah, I think that it's as weird paradox

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.880
 where everyone loves these coding models.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.040
 They're so useful and they're so good.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.240
 Every day that goes by, they get a little worse

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.040
 'cause they're a little bit more out of date.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.000
 So they need to solve the problem.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.480
 Otherwise, the model becomes not useful.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.160
 At the same time, I don't like,

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.240
 I can't actually see them solving it.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.280
 - Yeah.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.800
 Yeah, I guess I never thought about like,

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.320
 I guess when they're writing React code,

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.200
 it's from all the samples in their,

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.880
 in like that they were trained on.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.160
 - I just, I guess I think of like software development

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.080
 relying on fetching stuff into context.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.440
 But maybe that's happening less than I realized.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.240
 Like when I use cloud, cloud code,

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.400
 maybe there's less fetching than I realized.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.840
 - But like I said, it's just a context thing.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.920
 Like it makes everything really slow and more expensive.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.480
 So as I go past market solution, it just isn't,

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.160
 isn't it a great one?

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.400
 - No, you're talking me into it.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.160
 We're talking me into the thing you're doing.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.320
 - Yeah, and here's the other thing though.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.960
 Another pattern I've just seen over and over is,

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.760
 we'll always go one step lower.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.920
 And then we'll realize, not enough.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.480
 Okay, we gotta go one step lower.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.000
 Okay, we gotta go one step lower.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.600
 And we're always like, why don't we just go down

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.400
 all the way to the bottom from the beginning?

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.880
 So that's kind of how I feel like with this AI thing.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.760
 I'm like, yeah, there's all these like little things

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.120
 we could do.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.320
 But I'm just gonna go try to do the most extreme thing

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.760
 of having our model and then like built up this time

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.720
 instead of like, anything that I see itself,

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.200
 it's like, we shouldn't have built on CDK.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.040
 - Right.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.080
 - We got stuck with that for too long.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.200
 We went one level lower down to Pulumi.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.520
 I'm sure at some point, we're gonna like have to go,

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.920
 go lower again.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.560
 Yeah, I'm just trying to like just go to,

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.640
 trying to like see if there's a bottom

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.560
 and go straight there.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.480
 - Yeah, just avoid all the dance of like,

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.640
 Plinko in your way down.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.160
 Do you remember Plinko?

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.000
 Wait, is that right?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.960
 - Is that thing that you like drop a thing at the top?

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.840
 - Yeah, price is right.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.520
 - Okay.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.360
 - Like kind of bounces off the pegs.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.080
 - I've seen that like arcades or something

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.400
 and like you can like win something,

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.840
 but it's called Plinko and like where did you come across this

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.680
 in your life?

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.160
 - Is the price is right?

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.480
 That it was like one of the things was Plinko.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.200
 - It was like a segment on prices, right?

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.480
 Well, did you share for watch prices, right?

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.200
 Do you have the basic idea?

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.520
 - I think, I vaguely, maybe I've seen one episode.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.640
 They like, guess the price and if you're too high,

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.000
 it's you're out or what.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.760
 - Yeah, so whoever wins the little round

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.920
 where they have to guess the price,

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.320
 somebody goes up on stage.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.800
 And they do like a little game.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.880
 There's like all these mini games,

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.200
 not just Plinko, there's lots of games.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.800
 Plinko was one of the games that they did.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.640
 - I see.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.000
 - That's all.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.880
 - How come you experienced this and I didn't?

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.720
 Is this like an age thing?

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.560
 - I watched a lot of prices, right?

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.880
 Why did I, why do you watch it?

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.200
 I think my grandma loved it.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.440
 I think every time I went to my grandma's,

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.280
 I watched prices, right?

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.120
 Like a lot.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.480
 I can't remember why I watched it so much,

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.600
 but I definitely, I know a lot of prices.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.520
 I'm like teached with family feud.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.360
 - Yeah.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.200
 - So the price is right.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.040
 - I see what price is right thing.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.520
 - Or like SaaS products or something.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.320
 And I'll be, I'll be Bob Barker.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.520
 - Gets your bill.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.560
 - Yeah, your AWS bill, there you go.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.080
 Like cloud bill, line items.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.160
 - I pitched post talk on doing something.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.000
 - What's her name?

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 - I hate that name, sorry.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 - Yeah.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:48.840
 - I love you post talk.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.660
 I mean, do something terrible.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.000
 (laughing)

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.360
 - That's immediate, that's my job.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.080
 It's my job to lose sponsors.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.160
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.000
 Not my job.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.120
 I don't like the name, sorry.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:28:59.960
 Continue post talk.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.960
 Is this such a weird, I don't know,

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.040
 my blog shouldn't be any company.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.240
 - I feel like we could do something funny.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.080
 (laughing)

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.040
 That was like 80% of my reason of reaching out.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.440
 I'm like, there's definitely something funny here we can do.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.440
 - Mm-hmm.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.280
 - Yeah.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.120
 So we'll see.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.160
 Still looking for that, it's sponsored for a rocket.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.160
 - Oh yeah.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.360
 Well, let's go straight to the bottom of it.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.760
 Let's just do the SSC thing.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.600
 Let's go straight to the bottom of it.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.880
 - Let's build around spaceship.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.040
 - No, let's just get hooked up with a,

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:23.880
 what's that company called?

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.240
 Starlink, no.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.080
 - SpaceX.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:26.920
 - Rocket, SpaceX.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.120
 - For some people screaming on the other end of the,

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.520
 podcast right now.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.880
 How could you not know?

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.560
 What's going on Mars?

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.400
 Sorry.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.080
 - I don't think I wanna be near Elon right now, so.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.160
 - Yeah, what's the deal?

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.240
 Tell me more.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.080
 What do you mean?

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:45.920
 - No, I just, I don't know.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.960
 - Is this, well, okay, well, when you said that,

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.160
 it made me think of something I saw,

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.920
 or I think Casey showed me,

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.480
 where he's like had his kid with him all the time

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.040
 and people think it's 'cause he thinks he's gonna get

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:56.880
 assassinated or something.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.880
 - To me, I did not see anyone say that,

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.440
 and I independently had that same feeling.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.560
 - You had that thought, okay, it's like a big conspiracy,

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.720
 or not 'cause conspiracy, just a big like theory around.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.520
 - It feels, like it just looks that way,

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.920
 like visually it looks that way 'cause it looks so forced.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.840
 - I would not, yeah, if I had that much money,

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.920
 I mean, I just, I can't get in the head of somebody

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.400
 who has that much money, like, I don't know, whatever.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.600
 I'm not telling him what he should do,

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.280
 but I just can't imagine I would be doing the things he's doing.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.160
 Does that make sense?

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.360
 Like, I would not put myself at risk in any way.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.760
 I'd do all the other big billionaires

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.920
 just kind of disappear, right?

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.920
 Like, what does Larry Ellison do?

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.760
 I don't know.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.800
 He's just like living on his island in Hawaii, right?

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.640
 - He was at the White House talking about AI,

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.200
 like, the day after President got elected,

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.480
 or got into the office.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.560
 - I would just, I would not be a high profile person

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.800
 if I had enough money to just buy an island

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.040
 and live there for the rest of my life, I don't know.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.160
 - Yeah, I know some billionaires stay low-key,

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.600
 but this is one of those things where I'm like,

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.960
 if you feel a certain way, if you're like,

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.240
 oh man, all the billionaires doing that,

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.080
 I don't get that, like, I would never do that.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.880
 I think it's somehow related to,

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.840
 then if you don't, if you're not like that,

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.840
 you just wouldn't become a billionaire.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.720
 - You wouldn't become a billionaire, yeah, exactly.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.960
 - People are always like, oh, I don't get why,

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.600
 like, they're still working when they have so much money.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.960
 At the moment, I have fucking money.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.800
 I would just not do anything.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.160
 I'm like, yeah, that's why you're never gonna get it.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.000
 - That's why you're not gonna have it.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.720
 - You just don't have, just it's a reminder.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.080
 - Just so important, it is a non-billionaire, basically.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.280
 - And I found out that Adam does not have a billion dollars.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.240
 - Yeah, and won't ever have what it takes.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.800
 - Well, that one, I think, that one is,

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.200
 the thing you're saying is that was a little more reasonable

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.780
 'cause there are all the billionaires that say, look,

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:33.620
 - Yeah, because like all the other billionaires,

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.640
 I think they kind of like do the thing I would expect.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.680
 - It's a crazy person.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.200
 So that's like, no point of opinion for information.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.040
 - Yeah.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.440
 - What's the deal with the tariffs?

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.280
 Do we have tariffs?

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.840
 There's no tariffs, they pause the tariffs.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.280
 - They pause, yeah, and then the market shot up 11%.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.760
 It wasn't saying I'd never seen anything like it.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.560
 - Was the whole thing just a prank?

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.400
 - Is there any indication that they're causing?

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.920
 - Oh, just some massive gambit that we can't understand.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.760
 It's that they're thinking 11 steps ahead

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.480
 and we're never gonna follow it.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.200
 Every single move they make is a win

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.560
 and on our wish direction it goes.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.160
 - Plan four d-chest.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.480
 (laughs)

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.740
 - Underwater five d-chest now.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.520
 - I guess China, though,

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.720
 they didn't think the joke was funny

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.320
 and they're still raising it.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.200
 - I saw something really funny today.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.920
 - What does it do to us when they raise their tariffs on us?

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.740
 I don't understand that.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.680
 - What's it do to us when China says,

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.600
 we're gonna tariff your stuff that comes in?

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.680
 Do we sell stuff to China?

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.520
 - Yeah, we do.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.160
 I think on the tens of billions, I think.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.240
 - Mm-hmm.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.080
 - Okay.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:30.920
 So what were you gonna say?

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.840
 - I saw something funny today,

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.400
 'cause you know, U.S. and China are beefing

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.920
 about this tariff thing and it's like,

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.280
 it's so funny 'cause it's indirect

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.200
 'cause they're never like,

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.720
 we're not like getting on the phone with China

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.980
 being like, "Hey, fuck you."

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:48.200
 It's more like China announces to the world

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.280
 that they've increased his tariffs on the U.S.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.440
 And the U.S. announces to the world that we're,

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.120
 you know, it's so passive aggressive.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.920
 And today, there was like the epitome of that.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.180
 I don't know how accurate this is,

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.640
 but someone, I saw something being like,

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.640
 White House tells China to request a meeting

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.640
 with Donald Trump, which is like, so passive,

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.000
 they're not like, "Hey, can we have a meeting?"

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.560
 They're like, "You need to ask us for a meeting."

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.200
 We're not requesting, it's not a meeting request.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.060
 It's not a meeting request.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.240
 I think it's a meeting request 'cause that would be weak.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.260
 You need to come to us to ask us for a meeting,

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.400
 like, by the hands.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.240
 It's just like--

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.060
 - That's really annoying.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.160
 - This is so lame.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.120
 - Yeah, I don't know, the whole thing,

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.120
 it feels like it was all over the timeline.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.520
 And then I feel like things just kind of cooled off.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.240
 People are people just exhausted.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.400
 - Well, there's a tariff clause.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.720
 And here's a thing, I was saying this for a while ago,

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.520
 I was like, in America, what the money rules everything.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.040
 And we've had a bunch of problems with that.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.560
 - You've been consistent, you've always said that.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.520
 - And I'm like, we're seeing that tested,

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.920
 like, the benefit of that is like,

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.240
 things can only get too chaotic.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.080
 They usually step in and what happened,

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.200
 Jamie Diamond goes and gives an interview,

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.720
 talks about how bad this is,

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.680
 how talks about we need to, you know,

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.560
 this needs to be, like, corrected, stopped.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.160
 Later that day, 90 day pause.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.800
 Trump even cites Jamie Diamond.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.800
 That's how-- - Oh, wow.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.560
 - Like, the man that would never give anyone credit

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.520
 for anything, even mentioned,

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.000
 Jamie said we needed to, you know, pull it.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.320
 I'm sure it wasn't just that, obviously Jamie's citing,

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.320
 like, real things that are happening in the market,

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.160
 but yeah, at the end of the day, you know,

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.400
 money stepped in and-- - Cooler heads up

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.360
 what happened. - So 90 days

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.680
 and then the stock market.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.240
 So we're gonna boom for 90 days and then it's gonna crash.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.080
 - No, we're not gonna boom.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.320
 Right now it's crazy confusion.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.680
 You can, like, if you look at that chart,

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.600
 you just feel the confusion that everyone's feeling

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.240
 'cause it's just like, it's flat.

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.880
 - Oh, the VIX is way up.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.040
 - Yeah, VIX is way up, yeah.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.760
 It's, uh-- - Mm-hmm.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.840
 - So-- - I know things, like, VIX.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.360
 - Fear index, I don't know, it's about the fear index.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.520
 - I do, I have a fear index in the pit of the stomach.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.120
 I'm a lot anxiety. - I've read the formula

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.960
 for the VIX, like, a hundred times over the years.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.040
 - Oh, is it an index? - I just do not understand it.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.840
 I just don't, I cannot get an intuitive sense

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.920
 of how why it works. - It's pretty accurately,

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.800
 like, predicted stuff, right?

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.400
 - I don't get, I don't fully get,

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.360
 'cause it's like a volatility index, and I don't know.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.560
 Just mathematically, my head just doesn't--

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.560
 - His name? - Doesn't compute it.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.040
 Like, how do you build a financial instrument

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.160
 around volatility as opposed to just it going up and down?

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.000
 - Oh, can you trade it?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.280
 You can actually, like, it's like a thing

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.600
 you can trade, is the VIX?

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.880
 - Yeah, there's a VIX ETF called--

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.800
 - Oh.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.640
 - I forgot what it was called.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.400
 I used to trade, I used to trade the triple leverage one,

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.360
 which made, uh-- - (laughs)

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.800
 - It was so fun. - Oh, my God.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.560
 - So you're just looking for chaos,

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.080
 you're just trading and hoping for--

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.760
 - Yeah, it's like, it's like, something would happen,

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.560
 the market would go down two percent,

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.880
 and then your portfolio would be down 50%.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.200
 (laughs)

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.960
 - Three times leverage, that's intense.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.400
 - Yeah, it was awesome. - You do a lot of trades,

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.440
 it seems like you're big into the trading stuff.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.440
 You're always, like, posting your options stuff.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.880
 - I've been on and off over the years,

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.960
 I'd, like, cold it for, like, a couple of years,

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.640
 I just wasn't thinking about that at all,

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.520
 and I picked it back up, like, a year ago.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.680
 - Mm-hmm.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.320
 - And it's just fun, I never lose,

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.360
 'cause I always make money. - Never lose?

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.720
 Well, that's how it is. - Well, that's how it is.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.760
 - I mean, I always make money.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.600
 - If it's that easy, then maybe everyone should do it.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I want you to do it,

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.520
 I want you to gamble in this office.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.920
 - Just be really smart, know what's gonna happen.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.920
 - Don't be smart, just get lucky.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.720
 I've just been on, like, a really good lucky streak.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.760
 The, uh, that, that portfolio,

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.960
 I put money into originally in 2019.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.080
 - 2019. - And it's now up, like,

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:41.160
 1200% over five, six years. - Wow.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.000
 - And I'm like, man. - That's incredible.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.480
 You're, like, a hedge fund.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.440
 - If I was ballsy enough to put all my money in it,

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.240
 ooh, we just wouldn't even be talking right now.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.280
 Which is why I'm never gonna be a billionaire.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.600
 There we go. - Yeah.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.960
 (laughing)

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.720
 - That's a really good track record.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.360
 I feel like you should, uh,

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.440
 you should just make a course about trading or something.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.280
 - I don't know. - I don't believe

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.720
 asking me, like, people are like,

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.480
 "Hey, can you, like, I'm gonna try and get the office trading?"

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.160
 Like, "Can you, can we, like, hang out?"

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.720
 And, like, "Can you tell me about it?"

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.440
 I'm just like, "I don't know anything."

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.800
 I literally do not know anything.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.520
 I know the basics of how it works.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.640
 I have some, like, habits I've developed over the years,

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.880
 but I just feel like I just keep getting lucky.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.240
 Like, I don't know.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.880
 It feels like 100% gambling to me.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.120
 - Definitely happens.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.240
 Somebody gets hot at the-- - Yeah.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.960
 - In the casino, the roulette table.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.920
 I'm saying things I don't know anything about.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.280
 I've never played roulette in my life.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.320
 Is that a table or is that the thing that spins?

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.360
 - The thing that spins, we tried it in Vegas,

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.080
 uh, when we were there, like, for re-invent.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.360
 And this was like, "I've never gained before.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.440
 Let's try this."

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.520
 And she's like, "Wait, we just lost all of her money

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.440
 in, like, 10 seconds.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.800
 This was not fun."

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.160
 And I was like, "Yeah, this was not fun."

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.720
 But then we won it all back at the slot.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.160
 Like, I did the slot machine once,

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.160
 and then we won it all over the back.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.000
 - And you won it all over the back?

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.320
 - And then we left.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.880
 - Is the, uh, is the roulette thing,

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.000
 is it just red and black?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:53.840
 You're just making-- - No, you can,

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.320
 you can place on specific numbers.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.760
 You can do, like-- - Oh, there's numbers, too.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.600
 - Oh, it's even.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.440
 You can do all kinds of-- - Oh, yeah.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:05.800
 - And if you, in Vegas, you can, whatever you wanna bet on,

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.800
 they're gonna find a way for you to bet on it.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.640
 - It's funny.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.480
 - Not a better bet.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.320
 - You bet that the table's gonna explode,

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.320
 and you're gonna probably bet on anything.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.120
 - Bet that the tariffs are gonna be paused.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.320
 - Oh, there's actually that, right?

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.840
 Like, there's those, what's that called?

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.200
 - A prediction markets.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.040
 - The prediction markets?

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.640
 There's like a specific thing people always post.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.720
 - Yeah, I've heard them as a chart.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.240
 - Yeah. - People always post it.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.080
 Yeah, I think people always post it,

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.360
 post screenshots of it.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:33.440
 Right when, right before the event happens,

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.720
 and it always looks like, oh, it's so accurate.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.800
 But I don't think they're actually very accurate.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.800
 I have to look more into this,

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.240
 but there is a wisdom of a crowd thing,

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.720
 and that's like a real thing, but--

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.400
 - Oh, yeah, like if you have 100 people,

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.400
 and they guess how many gumballs are in a jar,

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.000
 like you take the average of all the guesses,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.440
 and it's actually close.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.480
 - Yeah, and that's roughly what a prediction market

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.400
 is trying to recreate, but I've seen it, like,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.040
 totally swing from one extreme to another.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.640
 - Yeah, I guess you've gotta have the volume.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.120
 You've gotta have, like, enough people.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.920
 - I mean, even with those prediction markets

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.960
 have decent volume, but yeah, I don't know.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.440
 Whoever thought that concept, though, genius,

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.960
 like you basically created a betting platform for anything,

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.680
 and you're just gonna make commission off of that forever.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.080
 - Oh, yeah, that's--

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:13.920
 - Jealous.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.840
 - Good business.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.080
 So it's like a good one. - Jealous of that.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.880
 - Why don't we do one of those?

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.960
 I just constantly am, like, seeing some story

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.840
 about somebody making a zillion dollars.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.920
 What's the dumbest stuff?

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.120
 Just, like, the stupidest ideas, and they just work.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.120
 Why is it?

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.920
 It seems like some people just have that,

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.560
 and, like, I just never make money,

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.760
 the things I do just struggle to make money.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.600
 I guess we're making money.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.440
 I mean, we make money.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.920
 It's just, like, I feel like I've worked too hard

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.800
 for the output, you know what I mean?

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.440
 - I know what you mean, but there's also just, like,

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.600
 who you are and how it feels to your soul.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.120
 Like, I could just, I guess, couldn't do that.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.480
 - Like, what you actually wanna work on

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.880
 and put out in the world?

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.160
 - Yeah, things have to line up.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.040
 They don't line up for me when, you know,

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.640
 if I was working at it.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.120
 As much as I joke about that production market thing,

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.840
 like, yeah, I don't think I would really deal

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.160
 with it or something like that.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.880
 - Yeah, I get too much enjoyment

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.600
 out of just making something that I think is good.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.360
 Like, it doesn't have to have any other, like,

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.120
 it didn't have money involved, no one saw it.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.440
 If I just think it was good,

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.840
 and I made something that was good,

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.160
 I get too much satisfaction out of that.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.560
 I think that leads too many places

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.040
 of, like, head down on something that's not worthwhile.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:26.920
 - Does that make sense?

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.040
 - I think I feel that way too.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.800
 And I think historically, I remember saying this years ago,

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.000
 I was like, you know what?

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 If I could spend all my time making stuff for myself,

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.600
 I would be pretty happy.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.680
 That's changed now,

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.480
 where a lot more of my satisfaction is feeling like,

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.120
 I made something really good for myself,

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.320
 and for a lot of people,

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.680
 like now that's like a much bigger factor in my motivation.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.600
 But it's still the same thing.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.880
 Like, I'm still just making stuff for myself.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.480
 I'm just making sure I do all the other stuff to make it

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.160
 so that, like, a lot of people could potentially enjoy it as well.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.840
 - You've got a lot of those going.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.440
 So how many open projects are there gonna be now?

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.880
 And what is tool beam?

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.800
 What's tool beam?

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.480
 - That was a temporary GitHub situation,

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.120
 where we're moving everything under SST.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.640
 By the way, did you see the npm deleted

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.200
 all access keys yesterday?

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.320
 - What?

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.440
 - I didn't see if they fixed it.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.960
 npm deleted every single access key.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.800
 - What?

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.720
 - Everyone CI, everyone's stuff.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:33.560
 - It's all back now, but it was down yesterday.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.600
 - So they un-deleted 'em?

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.440
 - Which is all gone.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.400
 - Wait, what is going on with this stainless?

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.560
 - So they, like, if you tried to deploy yesterday, it failed,

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.040
 but they restored the same keys.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.120
 So no changes had to be made.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.280
 - This was like some kind of data loss,

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.080
 'cause if you went to that page, it was just an empty list,

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.880
 and it's something weird, like showing one of zero of three.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.760
 It was like some weird thing like that.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.280
 - Aw, oh man, now there's, now I'm having issues

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.640
 with another unrelated project trying to see,

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.600
 I'm trying to confirm your reporting,

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.040
 and now I'm troubled.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.480
 Anyway, what else is going on?

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.920
 - I don't know, I feel like something else is going on.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.440
 I feel really busy, but it doesn't feel like

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.280
 I'm actually going on.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.800
 - Well, there's a lot of stuff going on.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.520
 Like, we're very busy, but that doesn't mean

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.680
 there's a lot going on worth talking about.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.040
 (laughing)

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.880
 - Yeah, that's kind of where it is.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.840
 That's everything on my end, you know.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.960
 Got the open site, got the model,

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.520
 where you're working on open code.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.120
 - Yep, open code's gonna be great, so I'm so pumped.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:34.240
 - Yeah, I switched to using it as my primary thing.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.640
 - Yeah, me too, until I hit like a roadblock

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.360
 and then I report, and then I've bounced back to Cloud Code

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.640
 a couple times just to remember how they do things

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.760
 and what I like about it and what I don't.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.800
 Did you see my thing today?

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.560
 Someone released something called Open Coder,

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.040
 which is the exact name project with a similar name.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.400
 - Yes. - But I was annoying.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.880
 - That is annoying.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.000
 It's gonna cost some confusion if that gets traction.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.840
 - I'll crush it.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.800
 - I'm sure Open Code will get traction.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.640
 - I'll crush it.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.520
 - I'll throw it in the author.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.360
 - I'll pull it herself.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.200
 - I'll leave your reaction.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.400
 - You need to rename this right now.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.800
 - That's what they did with Open Next, right?

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.120
 That's so funny.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.920
 - I was gonna say, just go back to that.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.240
 - I will say, part of me is like,

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.560
 I did have an initial reaction to me,

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.840
 so I messaged him telling him like,

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.000
 "Hey, we're working on this thing, we name yours."

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.800
 And then I remembered what a bad idea that was,

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.480
 how much that backfired on Purcell,

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.920
 where I just motivated me to like never rename it.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.080
 You'll just involve him.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:39.040
 - The Open Code thing, I think just some of the stuff,

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.760
 if we launch with all the stuff

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.040
 that is kind of like slated,

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.520
 I just can't, I can't imagine Cloud Code

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.840
 is not gonna copy half of it.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.360
 They can't do the other models thing,

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.480
 but some of these are just really good ideas,

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.560
 like they just should have them.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.000
 - Do you think there's more than one person

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.880
 working on Cloud Code?

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.680
 I feel there's like two people working on it.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.440
 - Yeah, maybe not very many.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.920
 - My feeling is it's like a handful of people,

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.160
 maybe two people working on it.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.960
 - Yeah, the PM lady follows me.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.400
 She tweets lots of progress.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.000
 Like they're always adding new stuff.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.360
 - Yeah. - Forgot her name.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.960
 - I don't, like head to head,

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.080
 I feel like whoever's working on it

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:21.040
 isn't going as fast as you guys are.

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.280
 So let's say like resource it differently.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.720
 - I'm not going fast.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.200
 Cody Tim is a beast.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.360
 I don't know if you know this, but he is.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.200
 - I can tell.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.040
 - He's fast.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.280
 - Yeah, especially with now powered with its own tool.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.720
 He's like using the tool to build itself, you know?

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.080
 - I know, yeah, and I figure they're like,

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.800
 I think the anthropic folks, they know programming.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.200
 And going back to the whole like niche models thing,

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.200
 it definitely feels like that's the path for Claude

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.960
 is to be the programming model, right?

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.440
 Like they're already kind of like falling into that niche.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:55.400
 - Oh, speaking of this thing I found out yesterday,

00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:00.400
 I don't know what the hell AWS bedrock is doing at all.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.200
 'Cause initially I was like, okay, they partner with Claude.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.640
 And if you want to use Claude Sonic,

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.600
 whatever, you do it through AWS bedrock.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.400
 Impossible to get rate limit increases,

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.100
 like you just don't hear about them.

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.960
 And then yesterday I found out, oh, it turns out,

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.320
 they're not exclusive to AWS.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.800
 You can use Claude through Google Cloud.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.960
 - Oh yeah, you told me about this.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.800
 I didn't even realize vertex was like a thing.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.560
 - Yeah, so that's your bedrock equivalent, Google vertex.

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.840
 Not only can you use it through vertex,

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:32.640
 the rate limits that they gave to me are higher than what?

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.480
 - Really?

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.120
 - Not just bedrock, they're higher than what Claude gave to me.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.160
 I'm like, what is going on in this market?

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.720
 Like this is not making any sense at all.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.600
 Like why is Claude losing customers through Google?

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.640
 - Yeah, where can I see, where can I see how many?

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.800
 Well, not losing customers, right?

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.320
 They're still like, it's like Google's just reselling it.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.520
 - Once you get to the mindset of like,

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.840
 oh, we're still winning 'cause, you know,

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.880
 we're partners, you just eventually get squeezed

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:57.720
 on other side.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.320
 - Yeah, people are using Google now

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.880
 and they can swap out their model really easily.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.720
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.360
 The moment you become a little bit commoditized, it's done.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.920
 - Mm-hmm, where can I see what models they support

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.080
 in vertex?

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.600
 - 200 plus, we have a model garden.

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.880
 - Oh, I just want that like, model garden?

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.720
 - What?

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:15.560
 - Why?

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.720
 - Oh, Google.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.080
 - Oh, it's not just Google, like,

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.320
 this is like a whole cloud thing.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.360
 - Oh, really?

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.000
 - I feel like they're just getting a friend

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:23.840
 and kind of how they name things.

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.000
 Sometimes they're really technical.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.160
 They're like, there's a name at the thing, like,

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.680
 Google sequel, you know, something's stuck really direct.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.840
 A lot of times they're like, model garden,

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.600
 what was that crazy one?

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.720
 AWS had a really crazy one.

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.560
 It was like the worst name I'd ever heard.

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.120
 - Uh, was it their feature flag?

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.440
 - Uh, worst named AWS service.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.280
 - Hmm.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.680
 - It was like, there's the one with the beaver for a logo.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.520
 That was pretty funny.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.840
 - What's the name of the service?

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.840
 - Lumberjack or something.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.480
 They had like a service called Lumberjack, I think.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.040
 - Is that their gaming thing?

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:56.960
 - Maybe.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:57.800
 - What is it?

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.640
 - What's Amazon Sumerian?

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.480
 What the hell is that?

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.200
 - Sumerian, that was like, it was like an AR

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.960
 or like 3D model thing.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:04.800
 - Yeah.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.880
 - Is Lumberjack a service?

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.920
 Lumberyard, sorry.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.440
 Lumberyard, yeah, there's a beaver.

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.440
 Right there with the saw.

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.040
 - Lumberyard feels okay to me.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.600
 Okay, you're building something.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.240
 You got, you're like cutting wood up.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.520
 Like I get the feel of that.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.520
 - It's been deprecated.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.000
 So apparently it didn't catch up.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.080
 (both laughing)

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.720
 - Something with 3D again.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.840
 - Anyway, so model garden.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.680
 Oh, elastic beanstarch, but that's another one.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.720
 - So elastic beanstarch, that's not what is that.

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.120
 - It's like they have that

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.560
 and then they have relational database service

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.240
 because it's literally like you can never imagine.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.920
 - We should do it to your list sometimes.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:49.240
 Sometimes of like tech names or could just be AWS

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.860
 but beanstarch, that's pretty funny actually.

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.320
 - Yeah, where's all this headed?

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.120
 I'm just seeing like tweets from Windsurf.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.160
 It's like cursor is not the only thing.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.960
 There's like so many of that model

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.360
 where they're like, I'm going to be built into an IDE.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.520
 Why would that be better?

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.920
 I just don't understand.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.400
 I don't want it built into an IDE.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.160
 There's so much shit in VS code

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.800
 that I don't know what it does or care.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.360
 Like, I don't understand the idea

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.440
 of bolting your AI assistant onto an IDE.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.440
 It just seems so much objectively better

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.800
 to be independent of people's eye.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.720
 - But they have the most usage.

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:25.560
 So you're kind of wrong, right?

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.400
 No way.

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.160
 - Oh, like cursors, you got the most.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.520
 Yeah, that's a good point, yeah.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:33.840
 - They do, I think people use, most people use VS code.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.280
 So it kind of makes sense.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.440
 The thing with them is I don't,

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.920
 they're trying to build a venture scale business.

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.280
 They've raised crazy amounts of money

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.880
 at a crazy valuation.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.080
 You are now entering the,

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.240
 I'm going to compete against Microsoft game.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.680
 Nobody wins that game.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.520
 - Yeah, right.

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.800
 - Definitely not as your first time company, so.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.000
 - Well, they've already started adding

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.160
 cursor like features, right?

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.200
 To VS code.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.760
 - Yeah, and they're not doing a good job.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.000
 Like Microsoft's not doing a good job.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.680
 - Yeah, so from GitHub, it's not great.

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.760
 Like it doesn't feel good.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.040
 But this is the thing that always happens

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.720
 where you're just like, wow.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:08.320
 I can't believe Microsoft let that thing come up.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.760
 Microsoft lost.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.040
 Microsoft thing sucks.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.120
 And you like stop looking at it.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.440
 And then you look back five years later.

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.760
 And then it's like, oh, wait,

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.400
 Microsoft just ended up winning all that.

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.040
 So it's like they move so slow

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.760
 and their stuff stays bad for so long.

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:21.880
 - But they win in the end.

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.960
 - But in the grand scheme of things, you know,

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.640
 to like our plans are measured in centuries, you know,

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.680
 that type of thing.

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:30.480
 - That's something, this isn't a talking point

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.440
 I want to hit on real quick.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.600
 'Cause I did have an experience with Casey,

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:37.680
 where I just like the vibe coding phenomenon,

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.880
 I wanted to like sit her down

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.720
 and see like she had expressed interest

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.000
 in like trying to play with these app builder things.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:44.840
 - Yeah.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.000
 - And it's like we installed cursor on our MacBook

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.680
 and it only, it only then occurred to me

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.040
 that like cursor's not made for people

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.600
 who don't know things about programming.

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.800
 It's not for people with no context.

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.480
 Because like immediately we couldn't do anything.

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.200
 She doesn't have node installed.

00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.560
 Like I'm trying to explain.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.440
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.760
 Well, if you want to build a mobile app,

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:02.840
 we should probably use expo and she's like,

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:03.680
 what is expo?

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.560
 What are you talking about?

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.400
 - Yeah.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.240
 - Like, oh well we can just re-regnap.

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.160
 Let's just re-regnap this.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.040
 (laughing)

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.520
 It was like, oh, you don't even have node installed.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.800
 We can't do this on your MacBook.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.640
 So it's just like endless,

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.480
 so you have to have a certain amount of context

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.840
 but then cursor's coming in and be like,

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.000
 but not that much context.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.200
 You don't not, you don't have to know how to program.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.760
 You should have to know everything about programming.

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.840
 - Right, yeah.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:26.920
 - What is the, I don't understand like,

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.560
 it's four existing developers.

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.480
 - It's definitely four developers.

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:35.400
 It's cursor is betting that developers continue to exist

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.760
 and there's a lot of them,

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.600
 maybe even more than they were before.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.160
 And this is how they most people build stuff.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.280
 Then you have like the whole other category of product,

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.560
 V0, Bolt, Lovable.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.320
 There's more now, Firebase, Studio.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.440
 - Okay, so those are for non-developers.

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:51.520
 I just mixed them all together.

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.880
 - And convex chef.

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.920
 - Yeah, those are, those are for,

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.160
 your wife would probably be able to do stuff there

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.000
 without knowing much.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.960
 - Okay, so it's not cursor's fault

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:05.560
 that the vibe coding thing became this big phenomenon

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:09.400
 where people are just like accepting everything the LLM does.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.240
 They're not really programming.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.840
 They're just like telling it what to do,

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.360
 but they are programmers.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.800
 - They know what's going on to some degree.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.480
 - That confuses, yeah, that muddies the waters a little bit

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.400
 for me, like in terms of who is using this tool,

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.720
 like, but I guess that makes sense.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.720
 It's existing programmers who just want trying to brain off

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:25.720
 and try and build something.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.880
 So I don't know, like I said,

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.680
 it just looks like they're gonna win

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.320
 'cause Microsoft keeps sucking.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:38.240
 But fundamentally, like, why would a fork do better

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:44.600
 than the trillion dollar company, you know?

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.920
 It's just like, yeah, like we're better,

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.200
 we're better at product, we're better at building,

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:54.200
 we can move faster, but like, at this level of competition,

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.440
 going for VC scale company, I don't know.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:00.240
 Like I just don't, I don't see it.

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.080
 - Yeah.

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.520
 - And a clear thing is obviously you have to go

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.680
 to your own model that's specialized.

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.300
 But even there-- - Do they?

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.600
 - Huh? - Do they?

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.280
 I don't even know.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.480
 - Yeah, I mean, the cursor should solve this problem

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.520
 that I'm talking about also.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.200
 - Yeah, like, do they currently have their own model

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.520
 or is there-- - They just use one.

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.640
 Yeah, you can see it from their job postings.

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.240
 - Yeah, but you know, Microsoft also is doing that.

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.120
 And they have more data 'cause they're all GitHub, you know?

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.480
 And it's just like-- - Yeah, that's a tough one

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.000
 to compete against.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.520
 The Microsoft who owns VS Code and GitHub.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.720
 - And they've been building Visual Studio forever

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.720
 and Visual Studio is actually really good

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:34.680
 for, you know, a heavy IDE.

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:35.520
 - Yeah.

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.360
 - Anything of the whole JetBrains category of thing?

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:40.160
 I don't know, just like, what, how are you,

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.120
 like trying to like navigate through all this

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.080
 and be the winner?

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:46.000
 - Like, when we talk about them being a fork,

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.280
 do they like keep upstream changes merged in to their fork

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:52.480
 and they're just like layering their stuff

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.480
 on top of the console?

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.080
 Is this like a constant rebase?

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:57.080
 'Cause that sounds like a nightmare.

00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:57.920
 - I think so, yeah.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.480
 I mean, we kind of did that with CDK.

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.920
 It was like, and kind of relate to it a little bit.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.760
 It wasn't fun.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:05.460
 And you like very quickly want to like have your own thing.

00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:06.940
 - Yeah.

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:09.240
 - Which I think they might do at some point.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.520
 I think that that can make sense.

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.200
 And, okay, so then another part of this whole space is Zed.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.320
 And I feel like Zed has set up really well,

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.720
 but they're not being aggressive enough.

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.080
 And I like, I feel this is my thing

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.560
 with so many companies where I'm like,

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.240
 you have everything except the aggression, like...

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.840
 - 'Cause they built the thing from the ground up.

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.780
 - Yep, it's much better experience than VS Code.

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:30.620
 - Yeah.

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:31.460
 - Yeah, like just compete with,

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:32.960
 they could've just competed with sort of a VS Code.

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.360
 That was like, you had a shot at that.

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.800
 But now there's like a new angle.

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.960
 - Yeah, whole new product.

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.640
 - How are you just letting cursor just dominate

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.600
 the conversation?

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.520
 Like you can't, you need to do whatever you can

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:49.160
 to like, shit on cursor, make it seem not cool to use,

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:51.840
 like make it be like, you're an idiot if you use this.

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.640
 Like there's need to be way more aggressive versus,

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.920
 to me it feels a little bit passive, it feels like,

00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:01.400
 hey, like we have AI in our app now, isn't that cool?

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.280
 But it's not, it's like a very competitive space.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.360
 - I'm just checking the Zed website,

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.600
 trying to get a vibe of like, how obvious is it

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.400
 that this is a cursor competitor?

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.480
 'Cause it is, it's like the, it's like,

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.760
 they were building a competitive VS Code

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:19.040
 and then like a way more unique competitor

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:23.960
 to VS Code came in and like redefined the whole category.

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:24.800
 - Yes.

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.960
 - Like AI enabled this, like the product changed fundamentally.

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.520
 But they have this, like as opposed to a VS Code fork,

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:34.320
 they have this advantage of like, they have the whole thing.

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.440
 They don't have to worry about this fork situation.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.280
 - Yeah.

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:39.880
 And if you look at it from terms of product quality,

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:44.360
 Zed is better, Zed is better on the editor itself.

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.200
 - Yeah.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.160
 - It's as good, if not better, at the AI stuff.

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.560
 The tab complete.

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.520
 - Oh really, they're already like,

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:53.360
 competing on that.

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.720
 You're saying it's just a marketing thing.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.160
 It's not that they need to pivot their product.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.400
 - Purely, they're like, it's like an aggression thing.

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.760
 Like they just let a cursor dominate too much.

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:01.800
 And it's not too late.

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:04.720
 It's not too late to, you know, still compete.

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:05.600
 Like windsurf is there.

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:09.520
 They're also kind of like, like windsurf is being aggressive.

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:13.640
 I feel like they're like really trying to get in there.

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:16.760
 And I want to see Zed win because it's a better product.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.680
 - Yeah.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.960
 - A world where everyone is using Zed by default

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.800
 is much better than a world where everyone's using

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.280
 a VS Code fork or a VS Code itself, you know?

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.680
 - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.200
 - So yeah, a lot of these things.

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.040
 I feel this way about a lot of companies.

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:29.800
 - Maybe you need to just, you consult.

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:33.200
 You need to consult on their marketing efforts.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:36.080
 Hit us up Zed, hit backs up.

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.320
 You can help.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.760
 He's very good at being aggressive.

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.440
 (both laughing)

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.280
 And he's an East Coaster.

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.120
 So he's an asshole.

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:42.960
 It's perfect.

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:43.800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:44.640
 Any more East Coasters on your team?

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.480
 - Yeah.

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.720
 - It's not just, it's not just Zed.

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.080
 I feel like me, Jay and Frank talk about this a lot.

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.360
 And I was posting about this other day where,

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.720
 you know, occasionally we have companies approach us

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.520
 that are like, that want us to join them.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.960
 And it's often interesting because the companies

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.760
 that have a lot of resources that are set up really well

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.800
 in a way that we're not.

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:09.800
 But the feeling we always get is they don't really wanna win.

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:16.120
 It feels like they're coasting along improving,

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:19.520
 but not at a magnitude more than you'd expect them to

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.640
 given what everything they have going for them.

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.680
 And it just feels like, yeah, we could join,

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:28.000
 but I just don't, I'm like, that's the thing

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:28.840
 that's missing for me.

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.440
 I feel like people aren't like really playing a win,

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.840
 like playing a beat number one, you know?

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:37.340
 - Yeah, everything just feels like slow, incremental,

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:40.760
 like passive growth.

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.760
 - Yeah, some people are just like that.

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.840
 You get that sense being around people who lead things

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.520
 in a very different way.

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.480
 Like a very, there's someone in mind,

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.840
 I'm just not, I'm not gonna go any further

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.320
 'cause I don't wanna, that's just not fair.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:56.600
 But I've like seen people who are the head of a thing

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.200
 and they just have a very like relaxed attitude

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:02.640
 about their things place in the world, if that makes sense.

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.440
 - God, everyone has that kind of like,

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:07.280
 it needs to be the best.

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.680
 We need to go to the bottom, as Dak says,

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:11.920
 and take it to the top.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.840
 - Like, I just love the sports metaphor

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:17.800
 'cause I feel like there's so much to be learned

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.080
 'cause inside looking at sports.

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.080
 What are you describing makes zero sense in sports?

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.760
 - Oh yeah, no chance.

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.760
 Every GM would be fired if they were like,

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.760
 you know, it's okay to be in the middle, who cares?

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:31.560
 - Yeah, and like, even like the worst player in the NBA

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.480
 still has what I'm talking about.

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:37.320
 - Yeah, oh yeah, they have to just to be in the NBA.

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:41.400
 I mean, they have to have that crazy desire and push.

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:44.080
 - So I'm just like, why, why when it comes to business

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:47.000
 and especially tech, like tech just feels so like passive,

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.520
 it's like, you know, we're doing okay.

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.280
 - Yeah, well, now I have so many questions

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.680
 about marketing theory.

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:57.000
 Like, what is it about Zedd?

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.200
 Surely they have people at Zedd,

00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.400
 they're trying to get the word out.

00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.480
 Why do I never see anything about Zedd?

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.200
 They're just not in the right places.

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:05.240
 - I mean, I haven't thought about it too hard,

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:10.960
 but the thing is you have to give people a compelling reason

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.040
 to stop everything they're doing and switch.

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.720
 And the only thing they should be thinking about is

00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:19.320
 what can we say or do or like what event can we do?

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.880
 What like marketing gimmick can we do?

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.440
 That makes everyone go, when I get home today,

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:27.600
 I'm gonna try, try it out.

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:28.760
 'Cause it's a good product, right?

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.640
 So you imagine it'll stick with some amount of people

00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:32.600
 when they try it.

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.440
 - Yep.

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:36.680
 - It's that simple, very hard, but that's simple.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:37.520
 It's all they need to do.

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.400
 - Simple and hard, I hate those things.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.640
 - I know, that one goes.

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:42.880
 - It's like a catch 22.

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:43.720
 - Yeah.

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.680
 But anyway, this whole editor space chaos,

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.400
 it's just funny 'cause like, I'm happy with Neil then.

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.560
 - I know, I love it.

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:53.800
 - I'm not gonna switch, especially with this remote,

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:56.240
 my whole remote setup, like now I'm stuck with Neil then,

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.480
 'cause it's not as fun doing that with anything else.

00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.320
 Should we end it here?

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.160
 We're an hour.

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.600
 I feel like I could jump into that whole conversation

00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.440
 'cause I didn't.

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.400
 - It's a slow, weird episode.

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.240
 I'm sorry for the audience.

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.920
 It wasn't as good as the normal ones.

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:09.040
 - Maybe Chris could like cut out the middle part

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.160
 where I was like, maybe we'll just be down after 30,

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.000
 you know, call it.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.560
 We just both have a lot going on.

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.600
 I got an entire family that's sick upstairs

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.760
 and we've got next week is crazy.

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.400
 - I'm making my family right now.

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:24.240
 - You're making, you announced this on Twitter,

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.200
 kind of, is a reply in announcements.

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:27.640
 Sometimes I write stuff in replies

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.200
 that I would never put like as a top level tweet.

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.040
 But you're okay.

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.080
 - A lot of people saw it.

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:35.200
 Like it was a lot of people saw the message.

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:37.400
 - Well, okay, so for people that didn't see it,

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:41.160
 I was talking about how Chad GPT Deep Research is so useful.

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.280
 I just like tell it something I wanna know all about

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.720
 and it just, you know, gives me back everything I need to know.

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.720
 Like writes a report, which is amazing.

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.160
 So I was like, oh, can you give me an example?

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:54.160
 And I'm just like, I don't wanna make up an example

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.040
 'cause I have the perfect example.

00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.480
 And I'm just like, I'm just gonna say it.

00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.000
 'Cause I was doing stroller research

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.800
 'cause we're having a baby.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.400
 - Congratulations. - I just do this.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.060
 - I'm the half of the audience.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.800
 (laughing)

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.840
 - So I posted that thinking like,

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.280
 no one's gonna see this anyway.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.840
 And then everyone starts liking it.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.680
 - Yeah, everyone's like,

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.200
 this is the weirdest way to announce this I've ever seen.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.040
 (laughing)

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.720
 I'm like, okay, I guess everyone knows now.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.180
 - Yeah, sometimes replies feel like a private little place,

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.360
 but I think they show up on timelines just the same.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.200
 - They do.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.960
 - I'm just wondering what you replied to it.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.680
 (laughing)

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:27.800
 Amplify, when did she do?

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.840
 I feel like I should know this.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:29.680
 It's kinda thing.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.760
 - 24th, which is the same day we got married,

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.600
 which is the same day we started dating.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.440
 (groaning)

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.000
 - More importantly, four days after my birthday.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.240
 How exciting.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.360
 I just told the world my birthday,

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.840
 am I gonna get like, totally docked or whatever?

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.520
 - My child is gonna steal attention away from your birthday.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.400
 - Yeah, what if your child is born on August 20th?

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.960
 That'd be so cool.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:50.800
 We had the same birthday.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.720
 - I hope not 'cause that means we have to take care

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.000
 for four more days and we would have otherwise.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.480
 That's what I was saying the other day, like, you know,

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.280
 babies that come out of four months old,

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.400
 I think it's a good business.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.240
 - Wait, what?

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.080
 Babies should come out of four months old.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.880
 - Don't make a business where you have a baby,

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.360
 but somehow it comes out and it's like four months old already.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.640
 - Oh, it's already four months old.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.120
 You skip all the, yeah.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:17.200
 No, believe it or not, I look back on the first few months,

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.040
 fondly.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.040
 - I know that.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.960
 - It's hard and you just develop so many,

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.640
 it's just so like stress, low sleep

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.040
 that it all gets imprinted on your brain.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.360
 So you have all these memories that are,

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.480
 most memories are fond, I don't know.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.320
 Maybe that's just me.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.480
 - No, I know, I know, I know.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.320
 I get that.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.840
 But I just think even, I think that'll just happen anyway,

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.880
 even with my genius business idea

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.640
 of babies that come out of four months.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.360
 (laughing)

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.200
 - So far, mom, I've reached.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.480
 - 'Cause I'm pretty sure that a human baby is like,

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.600
 technically like, they're not, like ideally,

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.520
 they're not born as early as they are.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.000
 - Yeah, like they have to come out 'cause they're head.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.640
 - They're head, yeah, like all that stuff.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.840
 So it's like a, so we like compensate for that

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.200
 by being able to take care of them.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.040
 - Yeah, underdeveloped.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.240
 - They're basically like not born yet, you know,

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.000
 and then they come out.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.480
 - I mean, they're pretty worthless until,

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.720
 I mean, I've got a five year old

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.080
 that can't do anything for themselves.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.600
 (laughing)

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.560
 Humans are unique, like they take a lot of attention

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.400
 and care.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.400
 - Training, yeah.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.520
 - It's kind of crazy.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.760
 But welcome, welcome to the wide world of parenting.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.760
 I can't wait for you to relate with parents, actually,

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.880
 instead of just pretending.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.440
 - I can't wait, I can't wait to annoy everyone.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.800
 I'm so excited to be like--

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.960
 - Oh yeah, you look like I was so right, I knew.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:36.360
 - All you guys being like, parenting is so hard,

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.160
 and like, you have to make all these sacrifices,

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.960
 and you can't just have everything you want.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.880
 I'm gonna, I can't wait 'til I have a child,

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.080
 just so I can tell everyone, you guys just suck.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.880
 Easy, being a parent is easy.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.880
 - The whole world is rooting against you right now.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.040
 Now we're gonna have no empathy when it gets hard.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.640
 - At this point, I'm just gonna lie.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.000
 I'm just gonna lie, no matter what happens.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:02:59.840
 I'm just gonna be like--

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.680
 - You gotta hold up the shtick at this point, yeah.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.480
 - Yeah, like, you guys just suck.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.600
 - Yeah, we might.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.040
 - If parents told me parenting was hard,

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.440
 but it turns out you all just suck,

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440
 I can't wait to post that.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.280
 - You can't wait to tweet it.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.440
 You're gonna go ahead and tweet it.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.600
 You just can't all back.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.760
 (laughing)

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.520
 The thing is, and this is gonna suck

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.800
 for all of us that want vidication,

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.080
 you could have an easy baby.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.800
 Like some of them are easy.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.600
 I've got two-- - I was a very easy baby.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.720
 - Yeah, so if you do,

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.160
 you're just gonna think we're all bad at this,

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.520
 and I hate that.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.840
 (laughing)

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.400
 It makes me wanna throw up my mouth.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.880
 I really hope you have a normal to hard baby,

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:38.200
 so you can experience the true reality of baby rearing.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.440
 - Based off of the sense you have of the world and me,

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.280
 can you see me with a difficult baby?

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.360
 - I don't know how to answer that.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.120
 I'm predicting, can I see how you can be--

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.840
 - Like do you see that, that's how the universe

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.760
 would play things out.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.200
 It would give me a difficult baby-- - Oh, sure.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.520
 - Or it would give me an easy baby to piss everyone off.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.400
 - What seems more like-- - Damn it!

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.120
 A liar, and I don't like it.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.140
 I don't like it one bit.

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.080
 (laughing)

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.240
 I wanna be so mad.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.200
 I'm gonna be like trying to influence your baby

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.200
 at a very early age to be more difficult.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.800
 (laughing)

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.800
 - My baby's gonna come out of four months old.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.640
 - Yeah, okay.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.120
 (laughing)

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.400
 My youngest was two weeks late,

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.280
 so he has a little more than that luck.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.240
 - Wow, three weeks late.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.240
 - You saved two weeks.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.720
 - Yeah, well, I guess.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.400
 Is that how, I don't think that's how it works.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.240
 - Yeah, it is.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.000
 It's like, okay, look at it this way.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.280
 If they come out one month early,

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.800
 when they're two months old--

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.200
 - Yeah, well, this was three weeks early.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.040
 So yeah. - They're kinda just

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.280
 still like one month old, you know?

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.520
 - Okay, yeah, it kinda makes sense.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.360
 - So the reverse?

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.200
 - I hate that that makes sense.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.600
 - It's kinda the case too.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.120
 - Yeah, okay.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.920
 Well, congratulations to you both.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.720
 And good luck, Godspeed.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.040
 - It's a girl, by the way.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.680
 - Oh, it's a girl, I didn't know this.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.120
 I didn't wanna ask in case I didn't know.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:49.960
 - No, you didn't know.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.000
 Remember you offered up your children?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:51.880
 - Damn it.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:52.720
 I did know it.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.520
 See, I'm so proud of remembering all things, like, human.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.600
 (laughing)

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:00.200
 Oh, I hate this about me.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.040
 I didn't know that.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.120
 - You offered up your children for marriage.

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.960
 - I'm gonna tell Casey, I did do that, yeah.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.280
 I'm gonna tell Casey how I forgot that it was a girl,

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.640
 and she's gonna be like, of course she did.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.360
 - I bet she remembers it's a girl.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.160
 - She probably does, oh, for sure.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.120
 The number of times I've forgotten somebody was pregnant,

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.760
 that I'm, like, related to, like, a sister-in-law

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.000
 or something, and then, like, end up in the room together,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.840
 and it's like, I totally forgot she was pregnant.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:22.880
 (laughing)

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.480
 - Like, I'm so bad about, like, people's kids

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.320
 and relationships and understanding

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.360
 or remembering any of it.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.400
 There's probably something there.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.400
 - Well, it's worse if you thought she was pregnant

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.840
 and she wasn't, so.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.680
 - Oh, yeah, sure.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.440
 - Oh, the mistake's to make that one.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.520
 - This is the other way, yeah.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.720
 - All right, we got too much to do, we gotta go.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.240
 - Okay, bye-bye.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.080
 - See ya.

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.660
 (upbeat music)
