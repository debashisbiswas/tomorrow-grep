00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
 I don't know, I think podcasts are dumb.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.940
 - What'd you say?

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.500
 - I said I think podcasts are dumb.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.840
 (laughing)

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.420
 (upbeat music)

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:29.320
 - Hello.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.980
 - How you doing?

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.820
 - I'm good.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.980
 Sorry, I was actually late because I was on the phone

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.340
 with Kootie Tim, who actually is an early SST user.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.260
 I don't know if you remember interacting

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.900
 with Kootie Tim in Discord.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.120
 - Yeah, yeah, he actually helped fix

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.740
 some very serious performance issues in V2,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.960
 and we work together a lot.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.420
 And I saw that he was working on like a two E,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.020
 that's like a card code cutter.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.020
 - He is, that's what I was talking to him about.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.940
 - Nice.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.780
 - It's awesome.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.180
 It's written and go and bubble tea,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.020
 and I'm gonna work on it.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.680
 - Yeah, I had a feeling it was written and go and bubble tea.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.220
 I was, wait, okay, tell me more.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.060
 Tell me more about,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.900
 'cause I didn't look into it besides a screenshot,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.260
 so tell me more about what it is.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.220
 - Well, it's a cloud code replacement.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 It works with other models.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.060
 And well, what do you wanna know?

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.220
 Like, it's early.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.580
 - Is he taking a different approach to it?

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.940
 Like, is there anything that's a--

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.300
 - Well, yeah, so he's a big cloud code user,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.420
 and it's clear talking through,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.220
 we just had 20-minute call where it's like,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.700
 we have the same frustrations.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.580
 I mean, one, just like knowing that you're stuck.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.580
 Honestly, cloud code just kinda feels like a dead end to me,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.260
 because I just can't imagine

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.180
 I'm never gonna wanna play with other models

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.340
 in this lifecycle of frontier models leapfrogging each other.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.980
 Like, I'm always gonna feel like I'm behind,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.380
 or I could be experiencing something better.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.820
 I don't know, maybe that's just FOMO, I know.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.140
 - I would say there's a good argument in favor of that,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.340
 because of the infrastructure behind these things.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.540
 In terms of deploying these models,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.140
 yeah, the big companies move slow,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.580
 but we're seeing how when they do finally move,

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.940
 the stuff is really cheap.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.780
 - Yeah.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.220
 - Like, all the new Google stuff is just so much cheaper,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.700
 so purely from a cost perspective,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.380
 like, yeah, I doubt that cloud code

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.740
 is ever gonna be the most economical.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.460
 - Right, yeah, so I guess that's my starting assumption,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.860
 is cloud code is not my long-term solution,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.500
 I'm gonna want something open source

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.500
 that I can use with whatever model.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.180
 Some of the annoying things, like, he fixed,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.300
 I don't know if you've noticed in cloud code

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.160
 how much you're using it,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.980
 but how often the tool fails to rewrite files,

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.900
 because it says like, the text is the same or something?

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.140
 - Yeah, yeah, it's like, we found multiple matches,

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.060
 or like, the text is the same, yeah, exactly.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.740
 - The text is the same, yeah, he fixed that bug,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.940
 which is like, super annoying to me.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.740
 I'm doing such a terrible job 'cause I'm feeling on the spot.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.620
 I just talked to him and I'm so hyped,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.500
 because there's other things, there's other things.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.620
 - Okay, wait for it. (laughs)

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.820
 He's implemented a very lightweight VIM experience,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.540
 but I wanna like embed Neil VIM in there.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.980
 - Okay, so that, when I saw that, he said VIM like,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.940
 and I was like, man, I wish it was just VIM,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.860
 and then I realized, oh, but then that would require

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.540
 the multi-plexing stuff, which I guess is a pain in the ass.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.180
 - Yeah, it is, and I'm gonna, I don't know,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.700
 I'm gonna dig around and see what's possible.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.980
 - I know, I think something simple

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.220
 would be to flip into full screen.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.820
 - Yeah, we're editing text.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.060
 - And like, just have that, yeah, like the multi-plexing stuff

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.420
 shows up when you need to embed a process inside.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.060
 - Inside of a boundary, like that, yeah.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.620
 - But you know how it has like that alt-screen concept?

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.060
 I don't know if you've come across that.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.020
 - Alt-screen. - Or again on a screen.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.860
 - What does?

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.060
 - Yeah, so terminal is technically you have two screens.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.780
 They have like your main screen and an alt-screen.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.620
 - Really?

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.500
 - Yeah, and you've seen like, kind of when,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.860
 I'm trying to think of an app that we all use

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.180
 that uses this feature, I can't think of the thing

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.060
 off the bat, but basically it's like,

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.740
 it's like having two monitors effectively

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.940
 and you can flip to the alt-screen

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.860
 and it has something else running there.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.940
 So you could have the input running there

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.100
 and then you just flip back and forth.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.660
 So I don't know if that, I don't know if the DX of that

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.220
 or the UX of that will feel good,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.420
 but it would be simple to implement.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.580
 - Yeah, okay.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.420
 Well, something like that sounds nice.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.340
 I just, there's some possibilities of them like experience

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.060
 'cause I immediately try and do like any normal motion

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.340
 that I'm used to and it's like,

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.700
 no, that's not supported, so.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.340
 - Yeah, I've been using the other thing,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.820
 a non-code, a non-code.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:29.660
 - It works?

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.500
 Does it work for you?

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.340
 - Yeah, it does.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.700
 - I couldn't get it to like actually ever make a change.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.700
 - I was using it with Gemini.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.140
 - Really?

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.620
 Well, I wanna hear about Gemini.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.460
 We gotta get ahead of that.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.020
 - I haven't used it enough to have an opinion.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.220
 I need to use it more, but I think I'll just try,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.380
 so this thing that he's working on it,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.260
 I'm assuming it's like model agnostic

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.580
 and you can plug whatever in.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.620
 So I definitely wanna try it.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.900
 As fast as these companies can move,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.860
 he's like cloud, for example, anthropic, for example,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.980
 my gut just tells me a random approach

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.100
 from some random person is gonna end up being better.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.820
 I don't know why I just feel like

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.620
 there's just always headwinds at these larger organizations.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.540
 Plus the open source part I think will help a lot.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.620
 - Well, the open source part for me,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.420
 it's like I know Kootie Tim, I like Kootie Tim,

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.220
 I can work on this too and it can be what I want it to be.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.700
 Maybe that's not best for like broad ambition

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.880
 and Kootie Tim can say F off, no thank you.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.420
 But like it's the promise, like the idea of like,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.900
 oh, there's so many things I wish as a cloud code user

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.420
 that cloud code could do or didn't do.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.260
 He said, so in terms of things he's doing

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.500
 that cloud code doesn't do and maybe they'll add this,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.180
 but he added LSP support.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.380
 So it somehow, it drops the LSP information into context.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.700
 He said it makes a huge difference

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.000
 and he's a big cloud code user.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.180
 - That's actually, you should open with that.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.020
 That's like a huge thing.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.100
 - I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry, Kootie Tim, I'm so dumb.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.780
 - That's the name of the project again?

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.140
 - Term AI.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.380
 - I'll send you the, we'll put the GitHub in the show notes.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.620
 - By the way, the way you're pronouncing his name,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.820
 is that the right way to pronounce it?

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.900
 Are you just giving me the right way?

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.180
 - That is the right way, I worked with Kootie Tim.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.700
 I don't know if you, did I tell you I worked with Kootie Tim?

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.260
 I was like under a Kootie Tim.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.700
 - I didn't know that.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.420
 - Yeah, so the company after I left start,

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.860
 or stat news in like 2019, whatever.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.620
 Okay, after I was fired, whatever I was fired.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.380
 I don't know why, I should just always say it that way.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.260
 After I left, literally.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.900
 Anyway, after I was fired at stat news, my startup,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.020
 I joined a company called Brightcore,

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.000
 which is where Kootie Tim worked at the time.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.980
 And it was like an insurance software company.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.940
 I was there for like a year.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.980
 I joined there randomly because one of my former

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.580
 stat news employees, was like a director of engineering

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.860
 at this startup.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.060
 Much bigger company than stat news is like,

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.540
 I don't know, 200 people.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.380
 - Yeah.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.900
 - Like 100 Dean of Engineers, something like that.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.420
 It was a good experience for me just to like see

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.980
 how actual software companies run,

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.700
 'cause I'd only ever worked for myself prior, and since.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.620
 So I have a little one year of experience,

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.580
 like working in a, it was like a safe organization.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.500
 Like the ultimate and scrum memes.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.340
 - Yeah.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.180
 - Yeah, it was fun as Python too.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.780
 It was just like all the things I hate, but.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.620
 - That's funny.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.380
 - But I like the people a lot, including Kootie Tim.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.100
 Anyway, I feel like I had caffeine or something.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.540
 I didn't, I'm just am just like, what a small world.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.820
 - Yeah, right?

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.460
 Like he's a Neil Vim user.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.100
 He uses bubble tea and writes go and uses SST

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.780
 and knows you, like Kootie Tim is basically me.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.900
 I should just have him come on the show and fill in for me.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.340
 You're like stuck writing go and bubble tea, even more now.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.180
 - Oh yeah.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.140
 I guess I do kind of like sometimes shit on it,

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.900
 but you just have to learn to like it.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.380
 - Well, it's not bubble tea.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.780
 Like the people at Charm are amazing.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.460
 It's the Elm thing I'm not super into.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.300
 - Yeah, I know, I know.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.140
 It just isn't click for me either.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.900
 - It's not even like Elm's fault.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.460
 It's just my brain works some other way,

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.300
 and it's like not the way.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.140
 - No, it's Elm's fault.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.580
 - Okay, I would consider Elm being a failed experiment

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.700
 because a lot of people love it,

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.060
 but the component model is just better.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.860
 The component model is just better

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.580
 and as the reason React got so big as big as it did

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.380
 and you could preserve a lot of what's good about Elm

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.740
 without giving up the component model.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.340
 It's like an arbitrary, it's like a random trade off

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.380
 we have to make so.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.660
 - Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.460
 It's Elm's fault because like who uses Elm today

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.700
 and React is like everywhere.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.700
 - Yeah.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.580
 - Anyway, that's cool.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.220
 I'm gonna try it, I saw a quick video the other day

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.580
 or whenever you posted it and I meant to check back

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.820
 but I forgot, but it's exciting.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.460
 Yeah, these tools are pretty cool.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.900
 I feel stupid for not thinking about making them.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.500
 Like forever, I was like, man,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.060
 I wish I could have the cursor experience

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.340
 but not give up any of them.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.940
 And then my brain just stopped there.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.500
 It was like, I guess that's impossible.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.580
 - Yeah, it was like a couple months ago on the podcast.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.300
 You said something about like the file system

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.140
 as just the source of truth.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.180
 - Oh, that's something, so Kootie Tim's working on

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.020
 this is very exciting to me.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.980
 'Cause it actually has like a SQLite database

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.820
 and it actually stores--

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.500
 - I saw the SQL thing there.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.020
 - Yeah, so his idea is to like,

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.420
 and it feels like a thing gets should do

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.460
 but I get where maybe it's better just to do it in the app.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.420
 He's gonna like store file states

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.580
 so that you could always go back

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.540
 to any point in the message history

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.780
 and then branch off or just revert back to that state.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.620
 So you don't have to constantly like get add stuff

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.500
 just to stage it and keep it safe.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.340
 That's what I do.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.340
 Like in cloud code, I'm constantly staging files

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.580
 just to make sure they don't get borked.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.100
 So he's kind of building all that into the term AI app

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.700
 where it keeps track of file states

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.060
 and you can just bounce back.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.980
 - Damn, this is gonna be,

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.340
 I feel this is gonna be really successful.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.780
 - It's gonna be good, right?

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.620
 - Yeah.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.460
 - And I'm gonna work on it.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.300
 So it's gonna be awesome.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.140
 I'm just kidding.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:51.980
 - Yeah, no, I mean that too.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.740
 - That's where it's gonna go down.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.540
 I'm not making a good sales district.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.380
 - I mean if you're gonna work on it

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.220
 and it's something you use,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.580
 I feel like it's just gonna be a good outcome.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.860
 - I do feel like I've probably burned more cloud

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.500
 and anthropic tokens than many single devs have.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.860
 Maybe more than some teams.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.660
 - We got this grant, this credit grant of 15K,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.460
 which we got intended--

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.300
 - Who's we?

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.140
 - SST.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.420
 - SST got a credit grant for who?

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.260
 - Anthropic.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.340
 - 15K and anthropic credits.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.460
 - Oh nice.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.740
 - And we were like, okay, we're gonna use this

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.420
 'cause when we launch our hosted version of mobile control,

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.940
 that's what users will consume this.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.540
 But we've just been consuming it.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.100
 I've just been consuming it to build this stuff.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.420
 And I'm like, how much of this is gonna be used

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.180
 by the time we actually shipped this?

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.580
 But whenever I look back at my bill,

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.460
 it's always lower than I expect.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.300
 - Yeah.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.020
 - I'm always spending a thousand dollars on this,

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.860
 but I'm not really.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.460
 - It's like in the context of what it unlocks.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.740
 And I think just developing these skills right now

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:51.580
 is worth a lot.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.740
 I think flexing this muscle,

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.980
 even if the models are,

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.980
 I feel like we're like one generation,

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.460
 one, is that the name of the models?

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.620
 Is it a generation?

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.380
 If we go from 3.7 to four.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.540
 - I guess so.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.380
 - Okay, yeah.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.620
 We're like one step away from this being incredible.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.580
 I mean, it's already good.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.180
 And I think in a good code base,

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.060
 it really can like boost things quite a bit.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.620
 We've talked about that.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.500
 In not so good code bases, maybe not.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.100
 Maybe the next generation is just so smart.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.180
 It's still, it helps you kind of like get code bases

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.020
 to the point that they're good.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.020
 That would be great.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.300
 - Yeah, it's expensive, but it's, I don't know.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.700
 There's the caching thing.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.340
 The bedrock prompt caching stuff.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.360
 You got to like get accepted into it, I guess.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.200
 But it unlocks.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.180
 - The caching stuff is so confusing to me

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.460
 'cause it's like, it's so convoluted.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.900
 Not 'cause it's bad design.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.220
 It's just like, the solution is a complicated thing.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.580
 'Cause like, with prompt caching, you pay more,

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:54.320
 but future prompts that share the same prefix,

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:56.820
 will be cheaper.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.300
 So it's like very hard to into it.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.740
 Like, how much is this going to stay?

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.100
 - You know way more than I do.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.660
 I just thought prompt caching make cheaper.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.500
 That's all I know.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.380
 Turn it on, get cheaper.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.300
 - It does, but it's one of those things where like,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.300
 well, for open AI, it's turned on by default.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.620
 'Cause I don't really see a good reason not to turn it on.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.620
 Unless you're very sure that every single time you hit the API,

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:23.380
 it's a brand new prompt.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.220
 It's like, you ask one question, you get the response,

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.820
 and you never like follow up.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.660
 - Yeah.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.060
 - Then prompt caching doesn't make sense.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.300
 But yeah, like it makes sense to be turned on by default.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.660
 The thing that's funny to me is when I look at the API,

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.500
 like in my head, when I saw these apps being built,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.180
 I'm like, oh, you probably like, there's an API call

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.900
 to like start a session.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.260
 And then you like append messages to the session.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.660
 Like every time you send an API request,

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.700
 it's just a new message.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.740
 No, like you send the whole context back and forth.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.140
 Yeah, this is really inefficient, but I guess it's fine.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.340
 But like, yeah, it feels weird.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.700
 Like you just send the whole thing back and forth.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.380
 - I have a theory on that and it ties into Jim and I

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.740
 and all kinds of stuff, but just before I get to that,

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.460
 it kind of I put a bow on Kootie Tim and term AI.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.580
 Kootie Tim, I know you're gonna listen to this

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.540
 'cause I'm gonna send it to you.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.980
 And I'm sure you're gonna wanna hear what I had to say.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.100
 I'm sorry for all of it.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.100
 (laughing)

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.820
 That was pretty awful.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.420
 You probably don't want me involved at this point.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.900
 Like don't want me pushing PRs.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.420
 I'm still going to.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.900
 You can just shoot them down kindly as I know you will.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:27.200
 Anyway, okay, moving to the, so this idea that

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.260
 Cloud 3.7 is kind of the only model right now

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.100
 that can handle these giant contexts,

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.660
 not that it's the only model that can handle giant contexts.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.540
 I know Jim and I has a bigger context window.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.820
 I mean, it seems to be the only one that keeps trying

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.900
 with all the tool calling and all the turn based.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.380
 Yeah, the persistence, is that also the reason

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.220
 people complain about 3.7?

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.660
 Is that the same property that makes it do too much?

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.260
 People talk about it like it goes crazy and does too much

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.740
 in its actual like changes to your code base.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.140
 It's possible, but to be honest, my experience of it

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.780
 has been very good.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.300
 So I don't, when people say they're like not happy with it,

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.820
 I don't really know what they're talking about.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.500
 I honestly, I don't actually know either.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.300
 I'm not experienced it doing too much,

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.380
 but you hear people say like it created whole new

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.780
 somethings and implemented third party libraries

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.260
 and did all this stuff like.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.620
 Yeah, but there was definitely a period of me refining it

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.100
 with like some of the rules I wrote up and cleaning up

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.020
 some stuff in my code base that it was getting confused by,

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.580
 but yeah, I do stuff that's not mainstream.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.420
 Like I don't use tailwind and like the way we use CSS

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.260
 is a little weird.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.940
 And despite that, it like picked it up and it's,

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.100
 I should have something the other day,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.940
 which is pretty interesting where, you know,

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.380
 I imagine to you like in the beginning of the year,

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:46.700
 I switched to using normal CSS and like no tooling.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.300
 And it took me a few iterations of that

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.300
 to get my patterns right.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.740
 So I had some older stuff that was in like

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.860
 my initial experimentation.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.420
 So I was like, I need to clean this up

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.220
 because Cloud Code is getting confused by this older stuff.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.460
 But then I just did that by telling Cloud Code,

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.620
 hey, like look at this file.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.380
 This is the pattern that I like.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.500
 And then go like go back to this other file and fix it.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.220
 Yeah, it's so good at that stuff.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.100
 It's so good at that kind of thing.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.260
 Or like removing stuff.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.380
 If you're like, we're done with this feature,

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.140
 we're done with this concept and just removing it

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.740
 from the code base is so, it's so good at that.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.340
 Like it can do this whole grip searching

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.220
 and then start just cutting stuff out like a pro.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.940
 It's stuff that's really annoying to do, you know?

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.420
 Like that's like the kind of programming task

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.380
 that's not a fun task.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.900
 It's been a funny adjustment

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.660
 because sometimes when I'm working,

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.020
 I will actually, and there's a get tedious task

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.860
 that I need to go rename something in like 40 files

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.820
 or like clean up type errors in 40 files.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.380
 I have this thing where I kind of like doing that

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.780
 because like it would be like my break

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.500
 where I would just kind of like drop my brain

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.300
 and just focus on whatever I'm watching

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.780
 and kind of like, you know, do this.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.220
 But now like yeah, just like I never really should

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.420
 should be doing that.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.740
 And technically I don't mind.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.860
 Like now that I have the option of removing it

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.300
 actually is much better.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.180
 But I wouldn't say like I 100% hated it.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.540
 I like kind of liked it to some degree.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.540
 Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.780
 I mean, my brain's mostly off on a program all the time

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.340
 as you can tell.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.380
 Well, now I just get up and I go do something else.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.060
 So yeah, well, it's doing it same work on something else.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:19.900
 Yeah.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:20.740
 Man, the future is bright.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.060
 I am very excited about programming as an occupation

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.020
 in the twilight of my career.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.620
 Do you feel like you're into the twilight of your career

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.860
 or do you feel like you're in the prime?

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.140
 Are you in the, you're probably in the prime.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.300
 You're like way younger.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.340
 I'm not way younger.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.180
 I'm like, what?

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.100
 I'm younger than me.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:35.940
 Is that only four years?

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:36.780
 I'm 38.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.220
 I'm 33.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.220
 Five years.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.060
 Okay.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.140
 I don't know. I don't think I'm ever going to feel like

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.620
 I'm in the twilight of my career.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.460
 I just feel like.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.660
 I mean, none of us are retiring.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.180
 Who knows where the economy said it.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.420
 The world's going to shit.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.260
 I'm sorry.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.340
 I did say something to, I think it was Jay the other day

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.860
 where I was like, man, vibe coding feels like too fun.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.620
 Like I, this is like way too pleasant.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.900
 Like this just can't, there's no way this can continue

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.140
 to have like economic value.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.660
 Cause it's like too enjoyable.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.620
 Cause I literally just, cause you know, I always watch TV.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.060
 I always have TV on the background while I work anyway.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.740
 So it's the thing I've been doing for years.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.460
 But now I'm just literally just like, hey, computer do this.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.540
 I understand I watch TV and then it just does it work.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.180
 And then I'm like, okay, computer do this.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.980
 I'm like, I'm making how much money to do to do this?

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.740
 Like this doesn't make any sense at all.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.620
 This can't like the world can't work this way.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.860
 - When you use the term vibe coding,

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:35.660
 do you mean that in like some specific definition

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.500
 of vibe coding?

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.140
 I feel like some people there's like a very specific definition.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.660
 - I think when I use that phrase,

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.620
 it's when I'm like doing the most extreme version of this

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.540
 where I am building something new or experimental

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.740
 or like building out like a new screen

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.540
 where I'm just like not at all trying to actively do any work.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.180
 I'm just trying to get it to do everything.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.020
 So that to me is like the epitome of vibe coding.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.980
 Most of the time that's not what I'm doing.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:06.900
 It's more like intense where I like have a task.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.020
 I find a way to split it up into two ways

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.860
 and I give it half and I do the other half.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.580
 And then like the moment I'm done, I try to see if it's done.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.820
 And it's kind of like very intense thing.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:17.980
 That does not feel good.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.900
 It's very productive, but like it's not like a pleasant feeling.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.380
 - It's not, yeah, agreed.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.060
 Like I still haven't gotten,

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.020
 I wonder if there's a point where the models are good enough

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.100
 that I turn off my OCD and I don't read every line

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.260
 of generating code like--

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.100
 - I don't read it.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.260
 - You don't read it, oh really?

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:40.260
 That's how we end up with a somehow an incorrect build amount

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.580
 on a terminal shop bag.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.260
 It's like $10 extra for no reason.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.620
 - On Raycast?

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.460
 - The Raycast extension.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.700
 - It was like the Raycast thing, right?

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.220
 But they're like a $10 difference.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.140
 That was you.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:52.980
 - That was not me.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.020
 It was because our API was unclear

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.580
 for a little bit 'cause we had some weird notice in there.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.420
 - Gotcha.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.260
 Well, that's probably my fault then.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.820
 I'm kind of on the API side, my bad.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.020
 - It reminded me of the terminal feud.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.260
 - Yeah, exactly, exactly.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.220
 I really don't want to fix that 'cause it was so perfect.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.700
 Like the error was so perfect.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.540
 - I know, yeah.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.380
 It wasn't up by one.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.220
 It was like off by two.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.020
 - I stumbled on the perfect algorithm for comedy.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.820
 The perfect way to add numbers where it was hilarious.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:20.660
 - That's funny.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.860
 - Well, I still read every line.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.940
 I generally go through and like make changes even.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.500
 And that's probably slowing me down a lot,

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.540
 but I don't know, it makes me feel more comfortable

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.100
 about what I'm putting out there.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:30.940
 I don't know.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.260
 It's just an OCD thing probably.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.100
 - Yeah, well, I'll say two things.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.900
 The first thing is when I say unpleasant,

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:40.380
 I actually don't mean that I feel the tool is not good enough.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.740
 I just mean the process is not enjoyable.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.300
 And I don't know if we talked about this already,

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:50.300
 but it really feels like this idea of sitting down

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.260
 and doing focused work where you're in the flow

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.340
 is just history.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.900
 So for me, for most of my career, that's kind of what I had.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.820
 Then I started doing cloud formation stuff

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.620
 and I was like, okay, got to wait for confirmation.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.900
 Then let me go work on something else.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.580
 Oh, shit, I'm probably done.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.420
 Let me come back.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.940
 Okay, so that whole thing,

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.780
 it just feels like that I'm working on five things at once

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.620
 and juggling them all.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.700
 It's just getting work, it's just looking more

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.820
 and more and more like that.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.060
 So that's why, to me, it feels a little unpleasant.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.020
 I think I can get used to it, but--

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.820
 - I do prefer the single track, like I'm in the zone.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:28.980
 I got music going.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.740
 - It's been a very long time since my work felt.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:35.300
 Anything like that, like I'll get that like once a month, maybe.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.100
 - I guess I still get it on occasion.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.420
 I mean, I think there's,

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.900
 there's still, I do a lot of front end stuff

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.420
 and I guess you get kind of insulated

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.340
 from a lot of the nonsense.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.740
 - So the second thing I was going to say

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.620
 is the thing you're talking about.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.180
 So when I say vibe coding is really pleasant,

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.180
 a surprising thing is Liz finds it very unpleasant.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.100
 Don't you think that--

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:54.980
 - I saw her tweet.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.740
 I didn't know how much truth there was there.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.420
 - Yeah, so you would think, okay, she's new to this

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.980
 so you would expect this thing gives her

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.380
 way more capability, even just stuff straight up like,

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.020
 she does not as good at using her editor as I am.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.380
 So you would think this thing is like,

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.740
 so much more useful for her.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.580
 - Oh yeah.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:14.580
 - And it is, but it triggers her OCD a lot too

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:19.820
 where it's almost magnified 'cause free,

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.740
 so like it does something wrong and weird

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.540
 and you want to go clean it up, right?

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.460
 And she feels the same way, but it's magnified for her

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.220
 because when it does something weird,

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.540
 she has less experience to be able to understand

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.340
 what it even did.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.820
 So to her, if it does something that she hasn't seen before,

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.260
 it feels like 100 times worse than what you feel,

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.140
 which you feel you're like, oh, I get what it did,

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.260
 but it's kind of messy, so I'm going to clean it up.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.100
 For her, she's just like, what the fuck is this?

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.700
 Like, now what do I do, right?

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:53.260
 So yeah, for her, she like, it's been like

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:58.260
 a bunch of back and forth for me to get her to use it more.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.380
 And I think she understands that it's practically useful

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.860
 for all the practical reasons,

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.660
 but she finds it a much more frustrating experience

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.500
 than I do.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.700
 - Interesting.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.300
 - Yeah, 'cause that's what the whole vibe-coded thing

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.900
 is like targeted at, I feel like.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.620
 - It's people who don't know, if you don't know, yeah.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.500
 But I mean, I think some people just don't even look

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.660
 at the stuff and I'm kind of trying to encourage her

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.940
 like, just don't look at it 'cause I'm gonna have to clean it.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.180
 I'm gonna clean it up.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.180
 Once you're in a good spot, I'm gonna clean it up anyway,

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.940
 whether you hand-wrote that or whether you did this,

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.420
 I'm still gonna go through that pass

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.260
 and don't worry about it too much.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.860
 But yeah, it's just tough 'cause I think for a lot of people,

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.260
 it goes against their instincts.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.140
 And there's also this dynamic when you're new,

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.060
 you also don't know exactly what's good.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.060
 You might have a sense of what's good and what's bad,

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.580
 but we've all been through that phase

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.660
 where we'll overly try to clean up stuff

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.420
 and it's actually just making it worse.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.780
 - Yeah, for sure.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:00.220
 Yeah, I don't know where it's headed

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.980
 in terms of like my confidence in just the not looking thing.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:08.300
 It's hard for me to just like not look at the code.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.460
 I've just seen it do too many weird things

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.620
 like in new code bases and make those silly mistakes

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.660
 where you're like, actually, this.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.900
 And it's like, oh, I'm so sorry.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.140
 And it just goes through that loop

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.900
 and you do like six iterations of that

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.460
 and still won't fix it.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.420
 That kind of stuff just makes it where,

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.420
 but the terminal code base is a great example

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.460
 where it's like there's enough consistent patterns

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.860
 that it just seems to knock stuff out

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.340
 when you like give it something,

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.300
 it can follow the pattern and do the thing.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.420
 - And that's kind of why I took us so long

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:38.820
 to even like get to this point where we're really enjoying it

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.820
 because most of our work is on SST,

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:45.180
 which is like a weird Go CLI plus like really weird,

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.700
 it doesn't look anything like a normal app.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.260
 - I've heard framework authors in general

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.700
 have a hard time with this.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.100
 - Yeah, it just can't help you.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.300
 Like it's not, it's like so much of your work

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.660
 is like decision making and not like execution.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.820
 So it feels very good to switch

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.500
 to like very normal looking work

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.300
 and that's where it really shines.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.540
 Oh, I was gonna tell you, so I use it

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:10.020
 in a brand new way yesterday, which is really exciting for me.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.380
 I've had this PR 'cause we need to support those for SST,

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.180
 finally getting around to doing that.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.740
 - You need to support what?

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.660
 - Windows? - Those?

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.620
 - Oh, Windows.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.460
 - Yeah. - What?

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.300
 - Oh, like the operating system. - The operating system, yeah.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.220
 - Not like a t-max concept or something.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.020
 - No. (laughs)

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.940
 - Microsoft Windows. - Yeah.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.300
 - And someone put in a lot of work to do a PR

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.460
 that just they just went through

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.180
 and just kept hitting every issue

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.300
 and then like just figuring out how to fix for it.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.140
 - Wait, I'm sorry, I'm so dumb.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.380
 SST doesn't work on Windows today?

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.220
 - No.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.060
 - Oh, I didn't know this.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.100
 I guess like what about WSL or that kind of stuff?

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.380
 - It does work on WSL.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.220
 I think there's like it's, some people have issues with it.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.660
 I don't know, it just, it definitely works on WSL.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.780
 It doesn't does not work on Windows at all.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.900
 - And as you see, it's a Go app, right?

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.740
 - Yeah.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.060
 - You don't just like compile it,

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.220
 the Windows or something like that?

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.500
 - Yes, but there's just little details that are different

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.140
 that can't be abstracted away.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.700
 So someone like went through and just kept hitting those.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.780
 - Yeah, okay. - Okay.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.420
 - They kept patching things here and there.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.380
 I mean, it's really stupid things where like,

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.540
 when I spawn Pulumi, if I'm Windows,

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.020
 I need to add a .exe, you know?

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.380
 It's just like things like that you need to be aware of.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.660
 - Interesting. - And this is a big PR.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.140
 So I had it, so I checked out the PR

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.540
 and then I told Cloud Code,

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:27.540
 hey, compare this branch to the main branch.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:32.220
 Go through each like hunk of changes one by one,

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.660
 describe to me what the changes and why it's there.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.340
 And let's go through it one by one.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.260
 I literally did that.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.980
 It was like, in this file, you know, we changed this

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.620
 because on Windows, when you've closed a file,

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.700
 it's not guaranteed to like figure out why the change was made.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.660
 So I was able to review this PR in detail.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.180
 I feel confident that, okay, I understand what it's doing.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.140
 And I'm horrible at PR reviews otherwise,

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.260
 they're going to be doing them.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.740
 - And it's like such a chore.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.380
 Hey, yeah. - Yeah.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.340
 - So this was like a really pleasant way

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.580
 to do a PR review where it's just telling me one by one.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.900
 Look at this, this is good.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.300
 Look at this, this is good.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.140
 This is probably why they made a change.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.100
 This is exactly what was changed.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.540
 And having that side by side with the actual diff,

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.900
 very, very good experience.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.460
 - So Cloud Code did a good job with that.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.300
 - Yeah.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.900
 - 'Cause I've, I, doesn't GitHub have like a feature

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:26.900
 for like AI code review, maybe like a experimental thing,

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.700
 but I think GitHub has that.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.540
 - I wonder if anyone's tried it.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.660
 - I saw something with Copilot.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.540
 - Well, what is Copilot?

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.980
 Okay, I gotta, I gotta ask this.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.820
 'Cause I'm, I'm so confused.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.780
 Copilot used to be like line by line.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.460
 - Just, just to tap complete, yeah.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.300
 - Yeah.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.420
 - And then it became like a broader thing in Microsoft.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.060
 Like maybe, maybe all of Microsoft is Copilot,

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.900
 like Microsoft now?

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.220
 'Cause I feel like it became this giant thing

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.220
 and I don't know what it is anymore.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.740
 - It's not just for code even anymore.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.860
 It's just, it's just, it's kind of like what IBM Watson did.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.620
 Do you remember when IBM Watson was like a physical computer

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.500
 that's your pretty computer?

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.940
 And then it was so popular that they just put,

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.180
 they just made out the name of their like AI branch

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.780
 and then everything where they're like AI initiative.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.540
 So Copilot is just like, it's GitHub or Microsoft's

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.620
 entire AI initiative is just Copilot.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.460
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.300
 I think that's how it works.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.340
 'Cause I saw it, I think they even,

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.140
 they even call it just like the non-coding one

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.740
 just that's built into Windows

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.460
 and they just call that Copilot.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.300
 - Yeah, okay.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.860
 A little tip for branding people.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.740
 Copilot just means nothing to me now.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.900
 Like I just hear the word and I check out.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.020
 Like I don't, it doesn't have any,

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.220
 I can't tie it to a thing.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.580
 And that's a problem for me.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.620
 Like as someone who's not a version of products,

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.260
 it makes me not wanna dive into that world

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.660
 because it just seems like this big amorphous, unknown,

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.500
 I don't know.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.340
 - Yeah.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.820
 I mean, I have like an aversion to it.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.940
 - This is a whole big question of,

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:53.020
 Microsoft obviously has all the properties that are relevant

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.780
 and all the reach that's relevant

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.140
 and like the best sales team on the planet by far.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.420
 And this is like a massive, massive opportunity.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.340
 And it's also in a space where they have historic like,

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.260
 Microsoft and developer tools.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.100
 - Oh, yeah.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.540
 - That's like developers, developers, developers.

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.940
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.540
 - They're on top ever.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.740
 And I guess with a lot of money that they've made here,

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.740
 how is it plausible at all that they're gonna miss out on this?

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.660
 - Are they completely out of it?

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.260
 If they're not like, I don't know what the relationship

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.900
 with OpenAI is anymore, they're kind of separated.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.100
 There was a spat.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.300
 - Yeah, I mean, they did say they're like working

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.140
 on their own stuff.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.980
 - So they don't have a thing outside

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.340
 of the OpenAI investment.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.780
 They don't have like their own models.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.900
 - They are working on their own models.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.540
 And I also think they technically,

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.900
 don't they have some hold into Anthropic?

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.140
 I forgot what it was.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.980
 - Microsoft?

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.260
 - They're like a little diversified.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.100
 - I know AWS says.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.420
 - Even there.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.480
 Maybe it was Google that has something in Anthropic.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.320
 I don't know.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.620
 Anyway, point being, I don't think that it feels so easy

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.900
 to look at the landscape now and be like,

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.500
 yeah, Microsoft is like not anywhere

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.340
 'cause there's cursor.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.740
 Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff in GitHub,

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.140
 but GitHub just increasingly becomes like a product

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.420
 that feels like bad to use

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.340
 and like why they're so slow with all this.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.820
 But I really think it's,

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.460
 I still think they're just gonna win.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.460
 Like it's a-

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.580
 - Well, that's how I feel about Google, I guess.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.500
 - Yeah, same.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.940
 - It's the same kind of situation

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.600
 where it doesn't matter how behind they are.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.020
 It feels like they have the infrastructure,

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.580
 the bones to win in the end.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.420
 But yeah, Microsoft, I guess,

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:33.420
 I guess GitHub and Copilot, that is their current beachhead

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.700
 in the AI game.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.620
 But like they don't have a big frontier model.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.060
 That's kind of crazy, actually.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.060
 - But I think they do.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.900
 Like I-

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.740
 - Oh, they do?

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.580
 I just don't know where it goes.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.420
 - I just think it's not like-

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.240
 - It's called Azure or something.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.620
 - I've seen them talk about it internally

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.620
 or like talk about having it internally and stuff.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:51.380
 And to me, this stuff isn't like difficult to acquire

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.200
 at this point.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.660
 Like if random labs in China are like doing it,

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.260
 Microsoft can do it given it's like almost purely

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.100
 a capital problem from one direction.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.300
 - Apple can't do it, that's for sure.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.140
 Jeez.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.060
 - They can do it too.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.060
 They just, I don't know.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.940
 - Well, they're trying and they're not, right?

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.580
 I mean, they're just bad at it.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.220
 - They're trying to integrate.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.300
 They're trying to build a good product,

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.260
 which they are failing on, which yeah.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.620
 Nobody, there's no guarantee

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.380
 if we can make a good product for sure that that's a problem.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.620
 - I want Apple to do it so bad.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.860
 'Cause I just, I want the like,

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:24.780
 I want it on my phone.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.100
 I want it just embedded into everything.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.460
 Is that bad to want that?

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.140
 - Did you see my post about saying

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.780
 S.C. is gonna make a phone?

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:32.620
 - Oh, I did.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.460
 What was that about?

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.300
 That's good.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.140
 That's good.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:39.180
 - Like I usually can understand your jokes.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.180
 I did not get that one.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.060
 - It wasn't a joke.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.060
 It's only serious.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:42.980
 - Okay.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:43.820
 Why not?

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.660
 - Well, I followed up saying this probably so won't happen

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.780
 but every day it's getting like two times as more likely.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.620
 - Okay, yeah.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:49.460
 You got to explain this one.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.380
 - Well, we're like looking at all this stuff

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.380
 and it's not ridiculous to say there's maybe,

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.540
 maybe we're gonna look back on this in 10 years

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.380
 and be like, oh, there was like a new shift in computing

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.260
 that happened during this time.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.740
 What could that, something we tried to imagine?

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.460
 Like what, what could that be?

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.220
 - Like from the ground up, rethinking the phone.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.300
 - The exact ground up rethink, rethink what.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:16.100
 I mean, phone even, even that word is like up for question.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.460
 - Just the word, yeah, throw that away.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.660
 Just small form factor thing you have in your pocket

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:20.500
 all the time.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.740
 And so Jay's observation was,

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:24.820
 so we had a few different observations.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:28.420
 Jay's observation was these things are so much more powerful

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.020
 than we're actually using them for

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.460
 'cause we're bandwidth constrained.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.940
 Like all everything that you just talked about,

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.020
 that you in like working out,

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.140
 what's the thing called term UI, term AI?

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:39.980
 - Term AI.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.780
 - That's just improving how much stuff you can shove

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.340
 into the LM and like give it the right stuff, right?

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.980
 It's not about the LM itself becoming better.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.220
 It's like, it's already really good.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.740
 It's just not being given the right context.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:57.740
 So many of the bottlenecks are just like,

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.020
 yeah, the AI, if they could literally see everything

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.820
 you're seeing, it can do a lot of crazy stuff.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.220
 It just can't do that.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.900
 So it's like bandwidth constrained.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.240
 - You're gonna make a pendant.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.060
 SSC pendant.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.940
 You're gonna take on friend.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:13.780
 Is it friend?

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:14.620
 Is that the name of the one?

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.460
 - Yeah.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.700
 Well, there's like five of them.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.420
 I think they're all stupid.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.340
 - They're all stupid.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.900
 But it could work for it now.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.500
 - I don't think we're literally gonna try to solve that.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.860
 Like it can see whatever you can see problem,

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.420
 but it demonstrates it's like bandwidth constrained.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.260
 - Yeah.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.580
 - That's the issue.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.460
 So if you accept that,

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:34.860
 then you have to assume that some new form factor

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:38.780
 might make sense to enable all this.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:39.620
 - Mm-hmm.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.460
 - So yeah, the question is like,

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.620
 you know, what could that be?

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:42.900
 What could that look like?

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.380
 That's one observation.

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.060
 The second one is what you're talking about,

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:50.540
 which is forever, not forever, but for a while,

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.660
 both iOS and Android have encouraged app users

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.100
 to like model their app as a set of actions

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.980
 so that things can compose nicer together.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:04.260
 Like one app can trigger an action in another app.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.140
 And it's so clear that that model is perfect for AI

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.500
 'cause AI can just compose these actions together

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.420
 like perfectly.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.380
 And I think Apple kind of demoed something like that

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.820
 where you can ask it to do something,

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:17.980
 some like complex set of things

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.860
 and it can just like trigger the actions in different apps.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.300
 And this got, and so obviously that's what you're saying.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.220
 Like you want that, you want that in your phone,

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.900
 you want that everywhere, you want to be like,

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.100
 hey, like, you know, I have a meeting later

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.980
 like give me directions to it.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.260
 Like yeah, Google counter can directly integrate that feature

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.140
 or it can just look up your meeting

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.740
 and then call Google Maps and then like do a bunch of stuff.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:41.940
 That example, but like, you know,

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.460
 you can imagine some interesting things.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.740
 So that got me thinking around something else,

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.940
 which is there's no angle to do this.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.900
 No one's gonna switch off their iPhone.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.820
 Yeah, Apple has to do this.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.180
 Google has to do this.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:59.060
 This feature on its own is not enough.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.660
 As compelling and amazing as it'll be,

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.340
 they just have so many hooks in everywhere

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.540
 that this is not gonna be the thing

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:06.780
 that makes people switch.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:11.780
 So how do you even like try to disrupt the space?

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.660
 We don't have a lot of good ideas or any good ideas,

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.260
 but the one idea that I had was

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.940
 there's also this growing desire for people

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.500
 and it's small and it's niche

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.700
 and it's might not be big enough for people to say.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.620
 Ooh, I think I know where you're going.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.180
 I don't want this phone.

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:27.660
 Like this thing is just fucking like killing my brain.

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:28.660
 I want a dumb phone.

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:29.660
 I want a dumb phone.

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.340
 Yeah, that's a movement.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.900
 And it's increasingly growing.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.300
 There's been a few products out of shit,

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.740
 but the products always look like this.

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.140
 They're like, they look at the phone

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:40.540
 and they're like, okay, these five features

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:41.780
 are good and not distracting.

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.900
 And we're gonna put that on the phone

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.420
 or we're gonna like not include everything else, right?

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.900
 So they're gonna be like, okay, you can get texts,

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.780
 you can call, but that's it.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:49.620
 But then you're like, well,

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.100
 I kind of want to listen to music,

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.860
 but they don't, they decided that music

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.460
 is not something you should listen to.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.100
 And so it ultimately kind of ends up falling short

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:02.340
 because I don't think a general approach like that

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.900
 saying these are the only five apps everyone needs,

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.140
 is that compelling at the end of the day?

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.540
 But I think AI offers something kind of interesting

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.940
 which is there's two ways to use your phone.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:14.500
 You're like, I need to do something

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.020
 and I'm gonna use my phone to execute it.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.340
 Or I'm sitting on my toilet and I'm bored

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.380
 and I'm gonna like just, my phone's gonna help me

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.660
 like discover stuff, right?

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:22.500
 - Yeah.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.620
 - That latter thing is a thing that we're trying to give up.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.460
 - Yeah.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.300
 - And every single app is optimized for that.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.180
 So we say like, oh, we want to get social media

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.620
 off our phone, but there's definitely nothing wrong

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.100
 for me at least, for me being like,

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.740
 I have a thought, I want to post a tweet.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:38.580
 - Yeah.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.140
 - And for me to do that, I need to open this app

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:45.060
 that is hyper optimized to show me a ton of stuff,

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.260
 prevent me from leaving just so I can send it.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:49.220
 It's gonna show me my little notification thing,

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.220
 it's gonna show me my feed, it's gonna do all this stuff

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.900
 and all that is gonna grab my attention, distract it.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.180
 So that first category, I just want to do something,

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.780
 I'm trying to execute on it.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:58.940
 AI can do this, right?

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.580
 I can tell it what I want to do,

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:03.260
 I can just trigger that specific action

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:07.020
 and not show me anything like super compelling.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:11.100
 I can control, the OS can control that like end experience.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.660
 So I feel like that's maybe a good hook if you're like,

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.420
 is there a pool of people that are like,

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:20.420
 I am just sick of my iPhone, like I just don't want it anymore?

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.420
 They're kind of already willing to move to something.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.860
 Like can AI help you reimagine the device

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.140
 that what that looks like?

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:31.060
 And it's just this boring thing not meant to simulate,

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.700
 it's not gonna be useful on a toilet.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.700
 Yep, but when you're on the go and you need to do stuff,

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.140
 it is a perfect thing.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:39.500
 So when you first, when I saw the tweet,

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.300
 when you brought this back up, I'm thinking you're trying

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.740
 to like make a phone, like a phone phone

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.380
 and it's like this ridiculous,

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.340
 you're not gonna compete with Apple.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.500
 But I could imagine you guys actually making one of these

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:54.100
 in the class of these kind of like dumb down phones

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.820
 'cause they're not like crazy hardware engineering, right?

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:01.580
 It's not the Apple, like it's a very different device.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.660
 We probably wanted to do something interesting there too,

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.620
 but you do it well, but like I'm just saying.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.460
 You can white label a phone today, like very easily.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.820
 There's a bunch of Chinese manufacturers,

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.420
 I just like you totally white label a phone

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.260
 and make it feel like it's yours.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.140
 If it's coming from China, good luck.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.700
 Yeah, 50% more expensive, but.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.980
 We gotta have a tear if it's some point.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.180
 I just don't understand them and I'm afraid

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.680
 that our government doesn't either and that's scary.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.260
 Before we talk about that though, one last thing.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.180
 So one of the piece of inspiration for this

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.260
 was the daylight computer.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.700
 I don't know if you saw that.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.540
 No.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.900
 So it's a tablet that's an E-ink tablet.

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.340
 You must have come across 'cause it's going viral for a bit.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.180
 Oh, I do remember.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.980
 Was it like very exclusive and hard to get?

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:44.820
 'Cause I always want things like that.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.180
 So I think it's all kind of limited.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.540
 So it's an E-ink tablet.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.220
 It's a kind of bulky, a little bulky,

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.380
 but crazy battery life obviously, but really responsive.

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.380
 So unlike a Kindle, it's like you can do

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.180
 all kinds of interesting stuff in it.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.060
 And I think that's a great example of how you need to approach.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:04.720
 If you do want to disrupt this crazy space,

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.260
 you need to come up with a completely different angle

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.580
 that people would get interested in.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.420
 So a bunch of people are like,

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.940
 oh, this is a new form factor I haven't seen.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.220
 I like it.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.820
 If they get enough people to do that,

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:15.380
 they could do what I'm talking about, right?

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.180
 They can now explore like these like,

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.140
 what does an OS in an AI world look like?

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.540
 But like, that is not enough.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.060
 You can't just say, I'm gonna build OS with AI.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.140
 You need to actually invent something else

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:29.300
 that is compelling to be able to do the thing

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.500
 you kind of want to do.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.400
 So very hard.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.260
 - I'm on board now.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.860
 I want you guys to do it.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.340
 I think you'll do it well.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.540
 I don't know how you're gonna do it.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.700
 Under the SST branding.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.620
 I mean, I just don't know like, is it a different brand?

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:41.660
 - No, we probably saw a new company

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.060
 and raised like it's just on money or something.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.100
 - Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:44.940
 Cool.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:45.780
 Well, you guys should do it.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.500
 You're good at executing and this doesn't need to exist.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.340
 You've convinced me.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.180
 I'm sold.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.020
 - Yeah, it's funny.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:50.840
 - I warned you.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.680
 I'm easily sold.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.340
 If we take a budget steps back,

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.500
 where we're starting is we're gonna just try to make

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.700
 the UX of open control really weird.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:38:59.540
 - Oh, okay.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.380
 - So when we do this hosted thing,

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.300
 we're gonna try to like experiment with all kinds of ideas

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:07.300
 to see if we can build something in like a very limited

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.300
 sandbox that kind of steps in this direction.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.140
 - Yeah.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:11.980
 - It would be a massive kind of conviction.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.580
 And it's like maybe everything should work this way.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.820
 - I saw your tweet about trying things

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.900
 in the open control UI.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.580
 I didn't understand what you tried.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.300
 It wasn't clear to me what was different about that UI.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.140
 Like what was the-

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.420
 - That was just gonna study thing.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.740
 Like just like the terminal UI kind of look.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:30.180
 - Yeah, like that video probably wasn't a good example,

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.300
 but I'll post another one with like our dialogues

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.100
 like look really crazy and weird.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:39.500
 It's just one of those things where you typically wouldn't try

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:43.460
 a crazy or UI because you have to hand make it

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.620
 and that's a lot of work.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.460
 - Yeah.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.300
 - So if it ends up not working,

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.580
 you can't get to like start over, which is a lot of work.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.740
 But now we can take all that just kind of like vibe coded.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.580
 - Yeah.

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.380
 - So yeah, Jay built like this experiment.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:59.380
 - We've retro like MS DOS feeling like dialogue thing.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.020
 - Okay.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.500
 - I don't know if I like it or hate it.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.500
 It's confusing because like, like I've talked about a lot

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.420
 and very sick of this black and white UI stuff.

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.260
 But that dialogue-

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:10.100
 - I look at it more closely.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.540
 - It's very cool.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.620
 I can't, but it like kind of hurts my eyes at the same time.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.620
 So yeah, I don't know.

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.780
 I'm very confused about it.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.020
 - I just, I opened Twitter, which is a mistake.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:19.900
 Do we just, we literally just talked about this.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.460
 - So what if you could have been like,

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.700
 you could have said precisely what you wanted.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:24.740
 - Yeah.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.100
 - That would have been nice.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:26.940
 Get on it.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.420
 Give me a new phone.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.020
 But I happen to hit one of your tweets,

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.180
 which is often cause you tweet constantly.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.100
 Like you tweeted two tweets an hour ago.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.380
 So at the same time, what are you?

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.740
 What are you, an animal?

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.460
 3.46 AM and 8.29.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.900
 You tweeted twice in an hour?

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.340
 Okay, whatever.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.180
 Your top tweet is about eight or could you tell me

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.020
 is eight or good?

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:45.860
 It's Python, right?

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:46.700
 - No, I wasn't able to install it.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.340
 Cause my top tweet is about how people

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:49.500
 just stop making some of Python.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.340
 Cause I tried to install it.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.180
 - Yes, I'm so tired of Python.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:54.100
 - 829 dependencies. - I'm so tired of this.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.180
 I feel like Python is growing in a weird,

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.780
 like ass backwards way where why is it,

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.940
 it's growing because ML researchers,

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.180
 that's all they know.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.180
 Like they don't know anything.

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.820
 - Wait, I thought you were post about

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.860
 the software engineering bench is only Python.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:08.700
 Is that true?

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.540
 - It's true.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.380
 Sweet bench.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.020
 The one bench that everybody talks about

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.220
 for like software programming capabilities.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.780
 No, I know these frontier companies

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:18.860
 are like training it on data from all the languages.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.540
 Clearly it can write other languages.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.100
 But the one metric they always point to

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.660
 that's like this is the best coding model.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.900
 It's sweet bench and it's all Python.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:26.980
 Sweet bench is all Python.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.140
 That's crazy to me.

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.900
 - Yeah, that is really stupid.

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.260
 I did not realize that.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.700
 - And then you just keep seeing people

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.460
 come out with new tools written in Python.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.460
 Where did this come from?

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.700
 We need to kill Python.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.380
 I'm so tired of installing Python

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.340
 or different Python versions or pyint or virtual pyint

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.260
 or what it's like.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.860
 There's so many stupid little layers to that.

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.700
 I just hate it.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.900
 - It's funny cause UV actually works really well

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.660
 and it fixed everything.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:55.780
 But I can never tell if I can use it with a project.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.420
 So then I have to like then figure out like can UV work with it?

00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:59.620
 Like if I don't see it,

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.780
 if the default instruction isn't like use UV,

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.460
 I just assume it's a clusterfuck.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.180
 So even the fact that UV exists didn't really help.

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.140
 - Yeah, that's like new of in plugins now for me.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.780
 If it doesn't say lazy them at the top,

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.020
 then I'm like, hmm, probably not a good plugin.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.780
 - Exactly, it's funny how that works.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.540
 - And what kills me is on Arch,

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:22.820
 it tries to install all dependencies system wide

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:23.660
 for these things.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.100
 I don't know why this is a pattern.

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.380
 Like when I install cloud code

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.700
 through the Arch package manager,

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.060
 it's just like NPM installing anything.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.460
 It like has a scoped node modules for it.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.260
 Yes, that results in duplication,

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:40.660
 but at least random other shit is like OBS stops opening up

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.420
 cause I installed a data chat or something, right?

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:43.740
 That this my experience with Python

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.260
 where random shit my system will break

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.780
 cause they're like, oh, totally.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.180
 We can just have one version of dependency

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.020
 for the whole system.

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:49.980
 That's not gonna be a problem.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:50.820
 - Yeah.

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.380
 - Don't get why that's like a pattern in this world.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.500
 So it just makes me so angry.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.420
 - It's so funny that you ran the same thing

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.300
 cause everyone keeps saying aider

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.980
 and I went to this and I was like, nope, Python,

00:42:58.980 --> 00:42:59.820
 I didn't even try.

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:00.660
 I was just like, it's Python.

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:01.940
 I'm sorry, I'm not gonna do it.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:03.020
 It's just not gonna go through the thing.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:03.980
 - I always give it a shot.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.060
 I'm always like, maybe someone in that,

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.860
 someone packaged it as like a standalone nice thing.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.340
 And it's always, so if you watch that video,

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.020
 it's actually extra funny

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.220
 because it's like 300 something dependencies.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.420
 A third of them are Haskell dependencies

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.380
 and like a fourth of them are like Ruby dependencies.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.580
 So I'm just like, this is just not right.

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.500
 This is not right.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:26.940
 Whatever's going on here is not right.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:27.780
 - Well, it's not right.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.340
 I don't understand how Python and Haskell interrupt,

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.740
 but it's not right.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.580
 - Yeah.

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.620
 - Oh, two things I wanna still talk about.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:35.620
 We gotta talk about the terrorists

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.300
 just cause we can do that at the end.

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.140
 There's like a,

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:42.420
 I listened to the Bill Simmons podcast

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:43.580
 during the NFL season.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:47.860
 He has a cousin Sal on and they talk about NFL stuff.

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.180
 And they always do this segment at the end of the show

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.500
 called, oh, I'm blanking on it.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.340
 I always skip it.

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.940
 That's the whole point of this little segue.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:55.780
 Parent corner.

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.620
 They do this parent corner thing.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.860
 Like they talk about football for like 45 minutes

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.700
 and they spend 15 minutes talking about

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:01.940
 like things that happen in their family.

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:03.420
 And I just always skip it.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.060
 That's how I think of like putting world events

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:05.900
 at the end of our podcast.

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.980
 It's like if people just wanna skip that part,

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:08.820
 just skip it.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.660
 Like it's fine.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.500
 - Yeah, I feel good about that.

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.340
 - You don't care about tariffs?

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.180
 - Yeah.

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.700
 - I'm a portfolio and it is looking awesome.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.660
 - Yeah, we gotta go on the tariff thing.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:18.420
 Before we do on the tariff thing,

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.100
 I listened to this podcast that Casey sent me

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:21.940
 and I'm blanking.

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.940
 It's diary of CEO.

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.580
 You've seen him maybe?

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:26.420
 - I don't know.

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.260
 I think podcasts are dumb.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.260
 - What did you say?

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.940
 - I said I think podcasts are dumb.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:30.940
 (laughing)

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.380
 - Well, I don't know anything about diary of the CEO,

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.860
 but it was this episode he had these people on

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.900
 talking about have you heard some of the statistics

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.820
 on men in the younger generation?

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:45.420
 Like, there's a young man problem in the world.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.260
 - Yeah, for sure.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.500
 - I haven't heard the little statistics,

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.940
 but to me it's like, the statistics must be crazy

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.460
 'cause it's like visible without even looking at the statistics.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.220
 Like I can see it in the real world.

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.420
 - And I just had brushed off so much of the like,

00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.980
 people just on Twitter, it's so flippantly

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:01.540
 call people in cells.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:02.980
 And I didn't even know what that word meant,

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:03.900
 but it was just kind of like, yeah,

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.860
 I guess like just annoying guys.

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.700
 But it's like, it's a serious, serious problem.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.980
 And the reason I'm bringing it up is like,

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.140
 I feel like as millennial men,

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:19.140
 I think we do have like a modern take on men, manhood,

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.500
 masculinity, I hate the word masculinity.

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.980
 It just makes me think of podcasts that are like,

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:27.580
 masculine man, like how to be a man.

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:28.500
 And I just hate that stuff.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:33.500
 But I do think like our flavor of masculinity

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.340
 of being a man seems better to me

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.620
 than like our older generations were much more like

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.700
 hardened and cruel.

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:44.620
 I mean, see Trump.

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:49.620
 Like I think we're different as a generation of men.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:53.140
 But like, are we not passing it down or something?

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.220
 What's going on that?

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.020
 I mean, I guess a lot of it is like single family homes,

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.780
 no male role models, all this

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.540
 that they talk about in the podcast episode.

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:05.660
 How do we, like I feel like we as men, you and I,

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.660
 we're the men, remember the elevated thing where I'm the man.

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.220
 Yeah, yes.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.500
 We gotta be role models.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.180
 And I don't know how to be a role model.

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.580
 I don't feel like I could ever be a man role model,

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.780
 but I feel like we're men and adult men.

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.980
 And okay, I'm a stuff saying the word man.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:20.820
 I don't know.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.820
 My take on this is going to make you laugh

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.460
 because it's so, you're never going to expect

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.300
 what I'm going to say.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.220
 Okay, perfect.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.340
 But me and Liz talk about us all the time.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:31.020
 I think the problem is people aren't horny anymore.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:34.100
 I think that's the root issue that we live in the podcast.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.580
 We live in a sexual society and I'll kind of explain

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.540
 what the main observation I make that is so different

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:43.260
 from how I was in my twenties as a teenager.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:44.100
 Yeah.

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:49.020
 There's so much debate and like criticism of like

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:51.420
 from men and women about each other these days

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.460
 where men are like, oh, women are like,

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.940
 they're like always doing stuff like this.

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:55.980
 And it's like so annoying.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:57.340
 And like, and then women are like,

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.540
 well, yeah, like men are like,

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.500
 there's all just a bit you know each other.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.820
 There's a lot of content at the age.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.100
 I would just agree with anything any girl said

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.740
 because like all I cared about,

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.420
 like there was one thing I cared about.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:14.420
 And I just, I just can't imagine like being like,

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:17.140
 I wish you would be different, you know?

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.300
 To me, it's just like how?

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.580
 'Cause like that, and to me, that's so unnatural

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:25.660
 to like let something overpower that.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.100
 So I think that's just like the real thing

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:31.300
 at the bottom of all this where what worked is

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:36.300
 what created I guess like peace was that dynamic

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:39.140
 of being like, well, yeah, like we want to sleep

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:39.980
 with each other.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:43.220
 So we're going to like not be so annoying

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.660
 about technically superficial things.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.580
 But now I feel like that's gone.

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.340
 So everyone is just like constantly criticizing each other

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:54.300
 about like what women culture is and what man culture is.

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.820
 And it just does not lead to anything sexy.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:57.980
 - Why do you think that, you know,

00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.020
 why do you think that's gone?

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:01.860
 Like is it the internet that we're just in person less

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.300
 where there's like interacting online,

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:07.580
 it's easier to be a jerk to somebody online?

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:08.940
 - I think it's just everything to get.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:10.020
 That's part of it.

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.540
 I think I think people say like just the prevalence

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.500
 of like pornography, they say that's like another,

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.540
 another part of it.

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.500
 'Cause like all these people like the vibe they get

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.820
 from these people, like they're so proud that they're like

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.220
 not letting their sexual desire overpower

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.260
 like whatever quote unquote standards they have

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.700
 for the opposite sex.

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.060
 But the underlying feeling is like I feel like you're getting

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:33.460
 that elsewhere and it's probably a really fucked up way.

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:34.860
 That's kind of the vibe I get.

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:35.700
 - Yeah.

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.940
 - I think for 10 like they're so like, you know, above it.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.980
 But I think that's a part of it.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.620
 I think the work from home thing is also like it's hard

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.900
 for me to like not see any other way

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.220
 because I met my wife at work.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.100
 Everyone I know from my life is from work.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:53.380
 So I just can't imagine that like helping like it's hard enough

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:56.420
 to meet people adding that on top of it.

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.860
 Also the way like the online dating thing I think at scale

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:03.420
 just is not like, it just puts you in like a weird mindset,

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.220
 like headspace when you're just like, you know,

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.420
 flipping through those apps as well.

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:07.260
 So I don't know.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.500
 Something is just not working.

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:09.460
 Like all these things together.

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:10.300
 - It's not working.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.540
 And I think you're just kind of like hitting all the points

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:13.620
 in the podcast.

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.740
 So we've established there is this problem.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.340
 You don't feel like we should be,

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.820
 I just feel like increasingly compelled

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:20.380
 that we should be role models somehow.

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:21.220
 And I don't know how to do that.

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.740
 I feel like Prime does a good job of this.

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:25.540
 Like he's kind of like a role model to young men.

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.820
 - It just feels like every millennial man

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:27.740
 that has an online presence

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:29.540
 should probably be doing something about this problem.

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:32.060
 So we have a generation coming below this one

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.500
 because birth rates, all that.

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:38.500
 - I, for me personally, I am very reluctant to over,

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:43.100
 I mean, I'm very like cautious of over correcting, right?

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:48.100
 Because what we're witnessing is something was working

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.580
 and it stopped working.

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.980
 So the natural thing, what's going to happen

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.780
 is going to be a crazy over correction

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.780
 to being very traditional. - Hypermasculinity.

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.860
 - Yeah. - Or that also, right?

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.900
 That's also kind of happening.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.780
 So I don't even know what being a role model looks.

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:06.300
 I mean, for me, I just make fun of people.

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.660
 So I just want to make fun of like,

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:12.180
 I'm like, you are so, like to me that like me growing up,

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:15.060
 if there was like a bunch of guys in our group

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.980
 and one of the guys was like,

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.860
 oh, isn't it so annoying when girls like are like this?

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.540
 Like that person would just get demolished,

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:24.260
 completely demolished.

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:25.340
 - Yeah. - And we all know

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:26.620
 exactly how they'd be demolished.

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:27.460
 I'm not going to say it,

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:29.420
 but we all know what everyone would call that person.

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.860
 - East Coasters, not here in the Midwest.

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.220
 Okay, we had manners.

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.700
 But we're like, are you not trying to get girls?

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:36.540
 Like what?

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:39.940
 I just can't, it's just so, it's just so different.

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.820
 So I don't know.

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:45.660
 Yeah, I think the problem is the role models that,

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:47.460
 I'm saying I'm going to say role models in quotes

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:50.300
 'cause yeah, it's still just a minority of people

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:51.380
 that like kind of fall for this.

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:54.100
 But the people that are gaining popularity

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.300
 are the people kind of espousing this kind of thing

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.900
 of being like, oh, like, you know, you're cool.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.540
 If you like, don't need, like don't care

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:04.140
 about women at all, right?

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:05.420
 We gotta make fun of these people

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:06.260
 because that's what we-

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.260
 - Could you name names?

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.820
 Like, is this the Andrew Tate's?

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:09.660
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.500
 The whole Andrew Tate thing.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:14.420
 Like he's just such like a freak in every single way.

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:18.060
 And I don't want to get too specific,

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:23.060
 but there's people that we know in our lives

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:27.180
 that kind of follow the kind of like,

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.620
 are kind of trapped in that whole thing.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:34.620
 And all they can think about is how like every woman

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:38.460
 is like an only fans girl and like they're all like this

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.300
 and they're all like this.

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.500
 And like it's so hard to find like a good woman,

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.380
 but what they don't realize,

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:46.980
 and this is Elizabeth's observation is that,

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.220
 their model and their head of what women are alike

00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:52.740
 are just the equivalent to Andrew Tate on the opposite side.

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.980
 Like it's just another extreme that was like not really real.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.620
 So that there's like caught in this weird fake perception

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:01.140
 of the world when like most people in their lives

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.140
 are like pretty normal.

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:07.340
 But yeah, it's got bitter, bad road to head down.

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.500
 - Yeah, and I feel like that's the role models

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.060
 that do exist online.

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.420
 Like if young boys in the world today

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.260
 don't have a father in the home,

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:19.060
 so there's no male role model like in their home.

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:21.100
 And then they don't, they talk on the podcast

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:22.780
 about how most teachers are women.

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.900
 Like if they go to school and it's mostly women,

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:27.460
 if they don't have experiences around men

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:30.660
 and then they only experiences they have are online

00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:31.860
 and it's the Andrew Tate's the world,

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.300
 then shouldn't normal people like be role models too somehow?

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:36.140
 I don't know.

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:37.300
 I don't even know what I'm saying

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.140
 'cause like I don't wanna do something unnatural.

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:42.420
 - I don't know what that could be like.

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.620
 - Just like saying things to young, I don't know.

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.540
 - Yeah, it could be like say things

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.060
 that were specific that would help.

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.540
 Like we have families and jobs and we're normal.

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.660
 And I feel like that's worth aspiring to

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:54.660
 or is that boring to these people?

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:57.620
 - No, the problem is, I think these role models

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.300
 are as much a symptom as they are a cause.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.460
 Like there is just this emergent thing

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:06.340
 where this is a dynamic between men and women these days

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:09.540
 and you see it among young people,

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:12.500
 whenever I hear about what dating is like these days,

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.180
 it just seems really difficult and possible and crazy.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.260
 And I'm like, yeah, if I was this age,

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.260
 I don't even know what I would do.

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.740
 So I don't even have any advice for them.

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:23.860
 So yeah, I think it's like these role models

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.460
 are just kind of like symptoms as well.

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:26.300
 - Okay.

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.500
 Okay, well you've made me feel better

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.700
 'cause I just had this weird like,

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.460
 I don't know what we should do about it.

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:32.780
 I hate when someone presents a problem

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:36.060
 and it's like, could I be the part of the solution?

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:39.860
 And I don't know and I just, I think about it too much.

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:43.300
 - I have no clue, it's weird and I think it's really embarrassing.

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.300
 And I hope that these people get older

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.380
 and it's kind of one of those things

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:47.580
 where we're all kind of embarrassed

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.460
 what we were like at a younger age.

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.300
 - Oh, okay.

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:52.020
 - It's just ultimately one of those things.

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:54.540
 - It's a good outcome 'cause like,

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.620
 then we still have a civilization or not.

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.140
 I kind of know if I'm actually scared of the birthdays.

00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.580
 People bring up birthdays and like,

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:01.300
 this is a real problem.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.500
 I'm like, I don't know, how is it?

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.140
 It's less people, is that bad?

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:04.980
 I don't know.

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:06.500
 - Yeah, I mean, yeah, the birthright thing.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.660
 I think that also is like a huge,

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.940
 it's just like a multifaceted thing, right?

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.540
 There's like so many economic challenges

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:16.620
 with having children so that those need to get fixed too.

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.020
 - Okay, that's a good segue.

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:23.020
 Economic, economic, economic problems, troubles.

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.300
 Okay, I'm gonna tell you everything

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.340
 I've heard about the tariffs in 24 hours.

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:28.380
 I've been tossed in the winds every direction

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.980
 and I want you to tell me what's really going on

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.860
 so no pressure, you better now.

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:32.700
 - Okay, okay.

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:35.700
 - So I first saw the tweets where if you were like,

00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:39.260
 what an idiot, he literally just did this in chat GPT

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:41.180
 and reversed the trade deficit

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:43.980
 and set the tariffs on every country based on that.

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.460
 He dumb, we're going into the Great Depression.

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.780
 That was the first set of tweets.

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:50.180
 Then I saw tweets where people are like,

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:54.380
 actually he's big brain and he's lowering the yields

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:57.140
 on tenure treasury bonds so we can convert a bunch of debt.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:59.860
 It's like literally like this master plan

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.780
 and I'm like, I don't know.

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:03.180
 Is there some truth in the middle

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:04.860
 that's neither of these crazy scenarios

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:08.660
 or is the first one the right one we're just doomed?

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:10.820
 - So I saw, I watched something yesterday

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:15.820
 which helped me a lot because I think the biggest question here

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:20.660
 is and it's been the question from the beginning, right?

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:25.220
 It's ultimately is the, not just the president

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.300
 but is this new right?

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:28.300
 - Coalition.

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.340
 - Like the new right, yeah.

00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:33.660
 - Are they pro free trade or not, right?

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:35.820
 - You can say if they're pro free trade

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:38.060
 then the tariffs are simply a negotiating tactic

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:40.580
 with the ultimate goal to be--

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:41.940
 - Of the tariffs anyway, right?

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:43.620
 - Yeah, a lot of people argue for that.

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.340
 They're like, oh you guys are being stupid.

00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:47.940
 It's just a really good negotiating tactic.

00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:51.140
 Like they're like, that's all he's doing

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.860
 and they've been saying that from the beginning.

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:57.140
 But if that's true, if that's your goal,

00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:58.620
 you can't also have these other things, right?

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.940
 You can't also say, no, our goal is to bring manufacturing

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:04.820
 back here, our goal is to make these jobs build up here

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:06.340
 because that's not actually your goal.

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:08.780
 Your goal is to get back to better trade.

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:09.700
 - It's one of the other.

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:11.820
 - It's one of the other, it can't be your goal, right?

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:16.940
 So anyone arguing that the people that are kind of

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.300
 infinitely argue that everything they're doing is right,

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:22.140
 I think they come, they find themselves

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:24.300
 in conflict of these things.

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.660
 So and I'd be confused about that too.

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.460
 I'm like, what's the actual goal?

00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:31.860
 Is it just negotiating or is it that these are,

00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:33.060
 this is the way they view things

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.820
 and they think that it's like a ripoff

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:38.700
 and America's in a bad situation globally, economically.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.820
 And this is the new world order that they want.

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:44.540
 So they want it to be that we're not gonna absorb

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:46.780
 the production of the whole world.

00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:48.300
 You guys are on your own.

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.820
 We don't want armies across the whole world.

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.260
 You guys can develop your own armies

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:54.340
 or we're tired of finding all this

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.620
 because things aren't good back home.

00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:57.740
 And we need to fix that.

00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:00.620
 And this is like our silver bullet for fixing that.

00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:02.980
 So it's confusing which it is.

00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:07.220
 It doesn't help that I don't think Trump himself,

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:09.460
 himself has a particular clarity about this.

00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:11.140
 So I think almost all the actions

00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.260
 that are coming from him

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:15.700
 are pretty much you from the team week to week,

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.820
 new justification for this, roll it back.

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.460
 Like it's like not a lot of clarity.

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:22.740
 But the thing that I watched yesterday

00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:25.860
 was an interview with an economist

00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:30.460
 that is in charge of developing the policy for this new right.

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:31.820
 So this is him like talking about

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:35.060
 what he's been trying to push for many years.

00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:38.940
 And it is very much not pro free trade.

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:41.700
 They view things as the last 40 years

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.660
 have been effectively disaster.

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:47.380
 They think that the middle class and the low,

00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:50.580
 like middle class and blow have suffered

00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:53.020
 and they paid the price for globalization.

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:55.580
 They're very much eager to move to a system

00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:57.820
 that is not globalized.

00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:00.780
 Where America's insular focuses inside

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.980
 and we're gonna have these high barriers to do trade.

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.940
 So that is their actual goal.

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:09.860
 And they see that as this is the way to do it.

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:12.060
 What I give them credit for is I think they're genuine

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.660
 and saying they are really looking at the middle class

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:15.860
 and generally trying to help them.

00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:20.020
 It's not some like trick to like benefit someone rich.

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:21.860
 I think this person, as a person that was watching

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:23.780
 interviewed, that's generally his goal

00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:25.260
 and he's been looking after that lens.

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:26.980
 I ultimately think he's wrong,

00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:30.620
 but if he's the one and his group of people

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:31.860
 are the ones shaping policy,

00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:34.500
 then what that means is he's not a negotiation tactic.

00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:35.340
 - No, it's actually--

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:39.100
 - It's an effort to reshape how America fits in

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:40.900
 to the whole world going forward.

00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:43.860
 - Briefly, it is a very complex topic.

00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:47.820
 But could we briefly hit on like the theory

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:49.300
 and your expected outcome?

00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:53.580
 Because I guess the theory is it improves

00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:55.140
 like manufacturing jobs and stuff.

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:57.420
 Like we start doing things in America instead

00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:59.740
 and that gives the middle class better jobs.

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:01.780
 But all the prices go up, I don't understand.

00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:05.380
 - Yeah, well, I guess the way they look at things

00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:08.740
 is the world produces a lot of stuff

00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:10.660
 and Americans buy it, right?

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.740
 So they're like, we're absorbing the,

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:16.060
 we're paying people in other parts of the world

00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:18.540
 with our wealth for the stuff that they produce.

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.180
 And we're not betting, we're not benefiting,

00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:24.140
 we're just like a consumer economy.

00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:26.220
 - I think that's kind of a valid characterization.

00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:29.740
 Like most income from a lot of these big countries

00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:31.820
 that have grown a lot and have become a lot more developed

00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:35.060
 in the past 10 years has come from the US.

00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.500
 But I think the part they're missing

00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.300
 is that we pay them with money that we print.

00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:42.020
 Like we print money and we give it to them.

00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:44.540
 And we're like, you have to do all trade in dollars.

00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:48.700
 You have to buy all dollars because we use our military

00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:52.060
 to make sure that all trade globally happens with dollars.

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:56.300
 It's a very sophisticated and crazy control scheme

00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:58.580
 that the America has built in the past,

00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.820
 you know, since post World War II.

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:03.220
 Someone made a really good observation

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:05.540
 that it actually might be too effective

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:07.700
 in that it's totally, like the control mechanism

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.780
 is totally invisible to the point

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:12.220
 where the people running the system

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.860
 don't understand the system itself.

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.060
 And so they accidentally started dismantle it.

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:20.420
 - And then we lose, so if you play it out,

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:22.420
 we start manufacturing in the US.

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.660
 We're not doing as much trade globally,

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:28.140
 maybe trade globally, just generally declines.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:31.980
 And we lose those levers of control, like presumably.

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:33.260
 - We lose levers of control.

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.540
 Like more countries than our armies,

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:40.060
 like that leads to like more variability.

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.460
 - Conflict and yeah.

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.460
 - When you have armies, you tend to use them.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:46.220
 The other thing is, the other thing that I try to focus on

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:49.460
 is you have to really understand yourself

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:50.820
 and play to your strengths.

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:55.220
 Like the US, we are like a globalist country

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:59.220
 and we can play that game better than anyone else.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.220
 So much better than anyone else.

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.500
 Nobody else can even try to play that game.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:05.260
 So for me, and there's downsides to that game,

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.940
 but I'd like to look at the solution as

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:09.740
 let's play the game even harder

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:12.300
 and find a way to address those downsides

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.260
 without stopping playing the game.

01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.980
 I feel like now we're trying to play China's game

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:19.820
 where we're gonna like suddenly manufacture stuff.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.740
 - But we're like decades drying stuff

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.420
 that China literally cannot do.

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.820
 China would love to do, literally cannot do

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:29.940
 to now try to do stuff that anyone can do, right?

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:30.780
 - Interesting.

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.180
 - So that's why I ultimately disagree with this

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:35.180
 because I feel like it's kind of the like golden age

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.460
 thinking like, oh, things are so much better in the past.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:41.060
 And kind of let's go back to the good old days.

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:44.540
 I think it's that mixed with,

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.220
 I think Trump's just been, and we taught those before,

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:50.420
 just been in a part of business that is very zero sum,

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:53.500
 not in tech where things can really grow.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.340
 - Yeah.

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.260
 - So I think that also colors a few of things.

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.100
 But that's what's going on.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.860
 So I think these tariffs, whether they end up sticking

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.540
 or not, 'cause like I said, Trump is a politician

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:05.860
 and politicians are a fickle.

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:08.340
 Like they need to like, they will go with

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:09.500
 where the win pushes them.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.580
 And if like there's a bunch of pushback,

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.140
 they'll say, they'll roll them back and be,

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.480
 and they'll say the tariffs were, when I perfectly

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.220
 according to plan, and it helped us achieve our goal

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.100
 of rolling them back, and they'll declare it a victory

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:21.940
 and they'll roll it back.

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:22.780
 So I don't know if they're literally

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:26.700
 gonna be in place forever, but behind the scenes,

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:30.780
 I see like the underlying push towards this direction

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:35.380
 of like dismantling the current system.

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:38.100
 And so that's why your portfolio is down.

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:42.940
 - Then you took the other bet, it was wise.

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:45.580
 Yeah, I pulled out all my money from like the market

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.300
 like a month ago or so.

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:48.620
 - And good timing.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.380
 - It just funny what psychological impact

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:51.380
 that makes in your head, like.

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.620
 And this is the only thing that I was saying, like,

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:57.940
 I don't care who you are, how like moral you are.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.380
 We're all short-term thinkers

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.100
 who just care about our own self interest.

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:05.100
 So the moment I did that, I love the tariff news.

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.700
 Like I love that it's happening.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:07.540
 - All the term moral.

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:10.660
 - Like everything I said, even though I disagree with it,

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:13.340
 the emotion, it's hard to not feel happy to see the chart

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.740
 go down, 'cause like my money's going up, right?

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:19.860
 So all the people that are saying stuff like,

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:22.940
 there's always people saying the stock market doesn't matter.

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:24.020
 Like that's not what's important.

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.380
 Like these other things are important.

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:31.300
 I know for sure those people literally are either 14 years old,

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.380
 'cause they don't have a retirement account

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.420
 or they just straight up have no money at all,

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:37.140
 like they're unemployed.

01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:40.500
 'Cause then a day, if money goes down, people get mad.

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.740
 - Yeah, we'll see how this plays out,

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:44.460
 but anyway, that's my summary of it.

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.420
 - Okay, well I know more than I did

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:48.660
 before we started talking about it.

01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:49.500
 So that's good.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.180
 - Yeah, interesting, fun, funny times.

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:53.020
 - Funny times.

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:54.380
 - The memes have been really good.

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.420
 I've been loving the tariff memes.

01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:57.900
 - Side note on the memes,

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.780
 we had this giant explosion of Vance memes.

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.140
 And then we had this giant explosion of Ghibli images.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:06.700
 I never saw one Vance Ghibli, not one.

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:07.540
 How's that possible?

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.140
 - Oh, that's a good point.

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:09.980
 - How's that possible?

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:10.820
 - Can I tell you something?

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:12.300
 - I feel like they should be all over the timeline.

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:13.140
 - Yeah, what?

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.620
 - I hated the Vance meme thing.

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.300
 I don't know why, I just didn't like it.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:17.180
 - Yeah, I didn't think it was funny.

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.460
 - I didn't really understand it.

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.300
 - Yeah.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.740
 - I mean, I thought he sounded like a doofus

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.060
 in that meeting in the Oval Office.

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.180
 Like just some of the things he said

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:24.700
 were just kind of like annoying to me,

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.300
 but I don't understand where people just took off

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.060
 with his face and like started doing stuff to it.

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:29.900
 I don't understand it.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.300
 - And whoever made that like chubby curly hair version

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.220
 of him, like, very impressive,

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:39.940
 because it, you know, it like went crazy viral.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:41.300
 I hate the way it looks.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.620
 Like I hate it, but I also can't stop looking at it.

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:46.580
 - This is like, it's like how you hate the way

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:48.660
 that Boxer, that Box, Mike Tyson looks.

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:49.660
 What's this?

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.500
 - Wait, David?

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.340
 - David?

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:53.180
 - He's not even a boxer.

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:56.260
 Jake Paul, Jake Paul's brother, the other Paul.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.100
 - Whatever.

01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.100
 - I mean, I definitely hate the way he looks.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:59.180
 Like it looks like a douche, but.

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:00.860
 - Oh, I just remember you saying

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.660
 how much you hated the way he looks at nine

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:05.180
 in the boxing matches, I'm sorry.

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.100
 I don't know.

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.580
 - We were in person that night.

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:08.820
 - Yeah, he just looks unlikable.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:13.420
 And I deeply, this is probably like somehow racist

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:17.140
 or like very wrong, but in the past couple of years,

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:20.140
 I just keep seeing more and more proof

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:22.300
 that people are what they look like.

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:26.100
 And I'm like, look Adam, you look like a nice guy

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.300
 and you are a nice guy.

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.940
 I cannot picture your face with my personality.

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:32.900
 It just like does not, it seems impossible.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.700
 How could someone that looks like you

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:36.620
 have my personality?

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:37.700
 Does that seem impossible?

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.540
 - Yeah.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.380
 - Yeah, man, someone looks like me

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:40.220
 that has your personality.

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:41.060
 - Impossible.

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:42.020
 - I just, yeah, I guess I just know,

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:44.260
 I do have questions we can get into it some other time

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:45.860
 about what you mean by have a nice face.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.260
 I've heard that before, like that I look like a nice person.

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.100
 I don't know what that means.

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:49.940
 - But that's what I'm saying.

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:52.420
 It's like this mysterious innate thing where,

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.860
 okay, I'll just put it in another way.

01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:57.580
 There are some actors that are always in evil roles.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.420
 Why?

01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.260
 - Yeah, no, it's true.

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.340
 - 'Cause somewhere in our head,

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:01.660
 we're like, that's what an evil person looks like.

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:02.980
 - Their face just looks evil.

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.420
 - Yeah, there is something there, okay.

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.140
 - I'm not saying they're definitely evil, but you know,

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.100
 like I know they're not gonna have like

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:11.060
 a bubbly personality in real life, you know?

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:11.900
 - Yeah.

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:12.900
 - Like I mean, like kind of brooding.

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:17.060
 But I'm just convinced that this is a real thing.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.620
 - And that's why the Vans thing bothered you.

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:19.940
 - Like what were you even talking about?

01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.900
 This was completely something,

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:24.500
 this is completely something I just went totally off topic.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:25.340
 It's just--

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:26.460
 - Oh, okay, got it.

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:28.260
 - I just, yeah, I just think.

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:29.900
 I mean, I think that's why I look with Logan Paul.

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:33.460
 I'm just like, he just looks like a dick.

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.660
 - Yeah, no, I agree.

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.180
 - It just, it's just his look.

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:37.800
 - He does look like a bad person.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.940
 - Maybe he looked that way and the world treated him

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:41.140
 that way so he became that.

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:44.340
 Maybe that's dynamic, but yeah.

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.900
 Whenever you meet someone with a strong personality,

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:47.900
 like you can like clearly have,

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.020
 keep their like shape,

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:51.020
 particularly what their personality is.

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:52.380
 Imagine literally what they look like

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:53.620
 with the opposite personality.

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.540
 And like, you just will have no frame of reference

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:56.380
 for anyone like that.

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:57.220
 - Yeah.

01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.060
 - So there's something here.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:58.900
 - There's something there.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:06:59.740
 - Something here.

01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:00.580
 - Okay, we gotta get off here,

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:03.260
 but before we do terminal, we're shipping cron.

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:04.300
 - Oh, yes, we gotta do that.

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.380
 - Days away from the first cron.

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.220
 Yeah, let's do an ad.

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:10.460
 So the ad is there are hundreds of cron subscribers

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.580
 and you should be one of them.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:16.580
 - Yes, go to SSH terminal and SSH terminal dot shop

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:18.480
 and subscribe to cron.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.980
 You will get a really beautiful package.

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:21.340
 I'm really excited to get this package myself.

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:22.180
 - Oh, it's so good.

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:23.340
 - It's so good.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:26.140
 - I'm excited to see how that destroys and crushes it.

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.460
 - I know, yeah, we'll see.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.660
 It's gonna be in a bag,

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:30.340
 which will keep it nice and safe.

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.700
 Well, we'll see.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:33.820
 - It's gonna look super cool.

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:35.180
 There's all kinds of little details

01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:37.020
 that I'm very excited to see in person.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.140
 - Remember how funny you're first that a box is where

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:41.140
 where it looked like they just like shredded it.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.420
 - Yeah, it looked like that being on Twitter.

01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:46.060
 - They like just like ripped it apart as hard as they were.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:46.980
 - They were so bad.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.260
 I've seen so many terrible shipping mishaps.

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:50.780
 Like that's very common, I guess.

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.420
 Mailmen are angry, angry people.

01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:55.660
 - It can't be that, but this must be like,

01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:58.540
 it blows my mind that just incidental contact

01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:00.860
 can cause a box to get shredded.

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:03.660
 - Yeah, I don't really understand like tossing the box

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:05.780
 around how some of the states that the boxes were in.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.220
 Like they had to be stepped on.

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:08.860
 Some of them, it was bad.

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:09.940
 - And not just stepped on.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:11.860
 I feel like they like grabbed it and ripped it.

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:13.100
 Like they were shredded.

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:15.460
 When I say shredded, I think that's the one, yeah.

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:20.100
 - I feel like a paper shredder or something ridiculous.

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.780
 - E-commerce, they said, it'll be fun, they said.

01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:24.460
 Anyway, terminal that shop.

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.540
 - You should sign up for this experience.

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:27.380
 The one that we just described.

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.740
 - It's gonna be so good.

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:31.060
 First batch going out very soon.

01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.260
 Okay, I gotta get up here.

01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:33.100
 - All right.

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.100
 - See ya. - Thanks, Max.

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.420
 - See ya.

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:38.000
 (upbeat music)

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:52.460
 - What do you want?

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:56.420
 - HDS sir, and how are you this afternoon all righty then?

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.620
 I have a package for you.

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.780
 (metal clanging)

01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:02.180
 Sounds broken.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.340
 - Most likely, sir.

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.980
 I bet it was something nice though.
