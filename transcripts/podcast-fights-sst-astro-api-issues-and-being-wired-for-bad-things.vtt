00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
 - Wait, can you not hear me?

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.460
 - No, I'm just messing with you.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.480
 (laughing)

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.760
 - Okay, oh man, that was stressful.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.340
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.420
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.540
 - Number 47, there's nothing special,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.240
 that's a number 47, there's nothing I can say about it.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.080
 It's just a number.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.000
 - Did you see that we have competition?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.840
 - Mm-hmm.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.680
 - We have competition.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.040
 Did you see that we have competition?

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.120
 - Were you talking about competition in podcasting?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.280
 - We've got, yeah.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.760
 - There are a lot of podcast decks.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.240
 I don't know if you realize this.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.160
 It's a pretty popular medium.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.000
 (laughing)

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.840
 - Yeah, I didn't know.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.680
 - But what do you mean?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.520
 - Specifically?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.360
 - I thought we invented podcast.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.560
 - Is there another Adam and Dax?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.200
 - Well, Aaron Francis started one

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.080
 with someone and it's similar.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.200
 It's just two people that are friends that are talking,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.120
 I think, I didn't listen to their first episode.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.040
 - Oh, well, two friends that are talking.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.960
 I mean, they're in tech, so I guess that makes sense.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.280
 I'm assuming it's tech.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.240
 - In tech, I think they had a good name.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.920
 I think it was called Mostly Technical or something.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.360
 - Mm-hmm, that sounds like our podcast, kind of.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.240
 - I think we're more like sometimes technical.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.600
 - So, wait, yeah.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.360
 Sometimes accidentally technical.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.840
 - Yeah, when we have to be--

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.040
 - I wouldn't say mostly.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.720
 - Mostlytechnical.com.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.000
 - Who's his friend?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 I'm Aaron's friend.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.800
 - I'm not a podcast.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.160
 - I'm not a podcast, little friend.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.160
 - Ian Landsman.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.600
 - Ian Landsman.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.760
 I've not heard the name.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.200
 - I think it's another Laravel person.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.320
 - Oh, Laravel.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.800
 Ooh, okay.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.860
 I'm a big Laravel fan.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.640
 I don't know if you know this about me.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.200
 I was just recently in a GitHub article about it.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.200
 (laughing)

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.040
 - Really?

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.040
 What is it, hang on, what is a GitHub article?

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.560
 - Or like, the GitHub read me.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.440
 You know what I'm talking about?

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.360
 It's like, it's like a blog that they do.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.200
 - How are you in it?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.040
 What do they say?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.240
 - They interviewed me.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.920
 'Cause I'm a Laravel person.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.360
 I'm gonna tell you.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.960
 - Are you kidding me?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.640
 - No, they wanted someone with an outside perspective,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.560
 which I have.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.440
 (laughing)

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.440
 - Okay, I was gonna say,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.560
 like you're definitely a scammer if you got into it.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.320
 - Oh, come on, I don't know the scammer.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.200
 I've been very upfront that I've not actually used it.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.680
 I can't find their blog.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.520
 Where's their blog?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.360
 Read me?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.200
 No.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.040
 The Read Me Project.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.160
 - It's funny 'cause everyone uses Transistor.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.240
 So we all have the same like podcast page,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.440
 like a layout designer doing like the same.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.360
 So it just feels like a direct like clone,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.240
 but like obviously it's not our design, but yeah, it's funny.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.400
 - I wonder if they thought about our podcast

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.160
 when they started this mostly technical podcast.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.040
 'Cause I mean, that is kind of like what we are.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.520
 We are kind of mostly technical.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.360
 - Yeah.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.560
 - I mean, we're technical people.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.040
 We just don't like talk about much technical stuff, I guess.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.880
 - Yeah.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.520
 - If they're mostly technical, I gotta listen to it now.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.720
 'Cause if they're mostly technical,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.920
 then it will be pretty different.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.320
 - We started off more technical

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.440
 than we just ran out of stuff.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.280
 - Did we?

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.120
 Yeah, we did.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.320
 We just, we got tired of talking about next JS

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.160
 and whatever else.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.360
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.400
 Yeah, we'll see.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.240
 We'll see.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.080
 So it's competition.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.920
 - I like their logo.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.760
 It's a cool logo.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.600
 - It's competition.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.440
 We gotta take them down.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.440
 We gotta sabotage them.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.280
 - It's not competition.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.120
 That's such a, that's a stop it.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.040
 That's such a like a scarcity mindset.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.880
 You gotta have an abundance mindset.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.040
 We're all here just trying to grow the space.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.880
 That's what they say.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.000
 - Grow the space.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.800
 - But which one sounds more fun?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.080
 Does your version of the world sound more fun

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.320
 or does my version of the world sound more fun?

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.520
 - I mean, it does sound more fun,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.560
 but it also sounds just more hostile

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.380
 and more anxiety-inducing.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.320
 But fun too, I'll give you the fun.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.160
 Why are we wired?

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.280
 As humans, why are we so wired for the negative?

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.520
 Why do we thrive on like bad things?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.080
 It's like the whole reason the internet

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.240
 of comedy works, a comedy.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.360
 It's the reason a comedy works.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.400
 - Mostly technical.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.760
 Are we wired for bad things?

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.160
 I think, I mean, this place where I think about this is

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.280
 when something new comes out that could potentially work.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.560
 You have a lot of people that will bet that it doesn't work.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.400
 - Yeah.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.640
 - And oftentimes they're right,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.040
 but I always feel like it's not hard to bet

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.720
 that something would not work

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.960
 because most things don't work.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.200
 It's like a lot harder to bet that it would work.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.080
 - That it will work.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.520
 What's something you bet will work?

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.520
 - Sorry, that's a side note.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.280
 - Everything I do, everything you do specifically.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.120
 - I do.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.960
 Well, I have to think that way,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.800
 otherwise I wouldn't be able to do it.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.640
 - Oh, that's true.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.480
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.400
 You gotta get you out of bed every day.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.080
 - Yeah, but I think people feel like they have good

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.200
 predictability 'cause they're like,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.360
 "Oh, I knew that wouldn't work."

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.720
 And it didn't, but most things don't work.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.880
 So you're just playing the odds.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.960
 It's not really like any insight.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.000
 When someone bets that something will work

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.360
 and most people think it won't work

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.640
 and then it does work.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.920
 That's when I'm like, "Oh, that is like a special moment

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.760
 because that was working."

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.600
 - Oh, okay.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.000
 I'm just gonna start betting everything will work.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.840
 - Exactly.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.440
 - So that I can have one of those special moments.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.160
 - No one's gonna remember the times you were wrong,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.480
 but they're gonna remember that time that you were right.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.000
 - When you nailed it, no Stradamus style.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 - Exactly.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.800
 - Wasn't that no Stradamus, did I make that up?

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.640
 That's a person, right?

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.640
 That was like a person that predicted a lot of things.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.200
 - I don't know exactly what the origin is,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.800
 but I understand the reference.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.880
 It's like someone like a prophecy person.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.200
 - I think it was a person who nailed a bunch of stuff.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.600
 I gotta look it up now.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.680
 I remember as a kid,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.440
 I'm talking about all the things that he predicted came true.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.160
 I think if you're just vague enough,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.920
 it is a crazy name, no Stradamus.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.360
 - It's like a storybook name.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.560
 - Yeah, it's true.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.360
 He was probably from a long time ago

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.520
 when people had those names.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.760
 - He predicted that one day.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.080
 - Yeah, if you're vague enough, like,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.320
 I don't know, you can make a prediction

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.080
 that's pretty meaningless,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.120
 but can be interpreted as true later.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.160
 - I don't have an example, I'm terrible at examples

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.600
 and analogies and anything like that,

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.000
 but I bet there's some good ones.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.400
 If you wanna think of one, I'd agree.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.800
 - Yeah, I've seen this.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.320
 One of my favorite concepts is this scam

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.200
 that people can do,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.760
 where they first develop a mailing list

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.720
 of like, I don't know, 10,000 people, whatever it is.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.160
 And on some pivotal moment,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.760
 let's say like an earnings report or something,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.720
 like involving a moment for a publicly traded company,

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.120
 you send half the list that

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.160
 they're gonna fail to meet expectations by puts

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.760
 or the other side, other half you tell them to buy calls.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.760
 And obviously one half thinks you're lying,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.920
 well, things that you were wrong,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.280
 the other half thinks you're right.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.160
 And you do this like three or four times

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.200
 and you end up with like a list of a small group of people,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.280
 but from their point of view,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.600
 you are just like a genius

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.520
 that has predicted every single thing correctly.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.360
 And at that point, you sell them, of course.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.360
 - So you have 5,000 people now,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.080
 like half the people that take your genius,

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.640
 that's pretty smart.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.080
 - Yeah, and you do it like once or twice,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.160
 when you have 100, then again,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.640
 like then you end up with somewhere around 1,000

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.160
 and that's a lot of people that think you're a genius.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.040
 So, all it takes.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.040
 - Wait, is the math work there?

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.000
 So you cut it down to 5,000 by getting it wrong

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.680
 and right, like you got right for half of them.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.440
 And then you split that one in 2,500.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.280
 Okay, yeah.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.840
 So every time there's people who think

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.000
 you've got like three or four things right by the end.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.440
 - Yeah, as long as you're picking like binary situations

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.360
 that are, yes, no, then like half the people think you,

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.680
 you were right.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.520
 - Wow.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.560
 - You bet that you tell them like this,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.680
 this team is gonna win or whatever.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.520
 - Yeah.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.000
 Okay, I gotta work on the mailing list.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.400
 By the way, I don't have such a match.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.840
 I don't think I have one anymore.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.080
 - That's the only reason I'm building my Twitter

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.760
 following to one day,

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.280
 I'm just gonna spend years developing credibility

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.880
 to them one day run this scam on 50,000 people.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.640
 - But it only works in a newsletter, right?

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.000
 'Cause you gotta send,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.680
 like they can't be a public for it.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.520
 Yeah.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.200
 That makes sense.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.640
 I'll DM everyone on Twitter.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.840
 - Yeah, they're probably writing API thing.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.680
 I don't know.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.760
 - Yeah.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.720
 Yeah, so great scam, unsoppable.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.360
 - So what I was getting at with the negative thing,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.440
 like we're wired for like outrage.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.560
 It's like all the negative emotions are so much stronger.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.480
 Like we, I mean, that's why social media

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.680
 is the way it is, right?

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.040
 Because that's what gets so much engagement.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.840
 We get so fired up over the bad stuff, right?

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.920
 Like positive emotions don't sell.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.160
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.240
 'Cause I mean, the thing I said the other day

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.360
 where I feel like knowing how to be happy is a skill.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.240
 And I guess a lot of people,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.400
 it's a difficult skill.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.800
 And I think what we see is people struggling with that.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.720
 So they like tap into things that don't make them happy.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.560
 - Yeah.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.640
 - That's why I think it does well.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.080
 'Cause it takes work to like ignore those things

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.800
 to realize like, okay, long term is gonna make me feel better

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.280
 not to read this thing.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.120
 - Yeah.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.120
 - That's hard.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.960
 - It is.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.800
 - I don't know.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.400
 - It's mostly, it's easy if you just don't,

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.760
 if you don't use those apps.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.480
 I don't really use Twitter much anymore or X.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.760
 And I do find I'm happier.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.760
 It's like I'm busy.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.520
 I know once I'm not busy and like things calm down,

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.920
 I'll be back on there and I'll be back in the same patterns.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.080
 But every time I'm out of it,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.200
 it's like, oh, this isn't actually that hard to not be on it

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.200
 'cause I feel really great and not being on it.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.440
 Just a lot less like thinking about stuff

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.920
 that I would be thinking about.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.760
 I don't know.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.600
 - That's why it's really good to be busy.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.360
 And that's why I don't think people fantasize about

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.840
 not having no work and retiring.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.400
 And I'm like, I don't know if you're gonna like that.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.880
 I don't know if you're gonna like not having anything

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.400
 to do every single day.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.160
 I'm very busy right now too.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.760
 And I feel the same way.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.160
 I feel like I'm in better harmony with everything in my life.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.480
 'Cause I have, I'm gonna post my work.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.960
 I do wish I was able to stream.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.240
 I wish I could stream right now.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.080
 That would be nice.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.800
 - Technically you are streaming right now in a way.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.200
 - I mean, yeah, I guess, yeah.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.680
 I'm on your Twitch.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.720
 Oh, I just, I thought of something in the middle

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.360
 of something you were saying, I was totally listening.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.120
 But I thought of, you wanna go to war with this new podcast.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.200
 Aaron wasn't following me on Twitter.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.280
 And I noticed this one day and I was,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.240
 it's like this weird, I don't know how I ended up

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.960
 on his profile is like, wait, Aaron doesn't follow me?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.080
 And Aaron used to follow me.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.240
 And I was so outraged, but at the same time,

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.520
 I thought like there's no way he'd just like unfollowed me

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.360
 and not say anything.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.680
 Like we've been in the DMs, we've had calls like,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.680
 feel like we're pretty close.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.200
 Not like how close can you be with somebody over the internet

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.400
 when you haven't really met in person.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.880
 But like in terms of internet friends,

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.360
 I count them as a dear friend, you know,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.360
 like a dear internet friend.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.880
 And I finally, after a couple of glasses of wine one night

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.760
 at the offsite, cinema DM, I was like, Aaron,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.680
 why don't you follow me more?

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.960
 Like what's going on?

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.800
 And it was an accident.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.400
 It was like a total, like just a flu, he didn't know.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.000
 And I can resonate with that.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.560
 I actually retweeted something the other day.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.800
 I want to accident, like I guess like,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.800
 but die over something.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.640
 I watch that all the time.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.480
 All the time.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.760
 It's like someone said, like why did you retweet that?

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.600
 Like DM me?

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.240
 And I'm like, oh, it didn't mean to.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.400
 It was like some deep reply.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.340
 Oh my God, I accidentally retweeted.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.320
 I don't think, well, people must have saw it.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.600
 And no one liked it because it was something like,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.960
 I don't know.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.640
 I don't remember exactly what it was,

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.240
 but it was someone posting.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.120
 So the original tweet was someone posting like a picture

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.480
 from some meetup in San Francisco,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.920
 how it was like just all bunch of dudes.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.960
 And someone said something else, like as an overreaction,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.800
 something like kind of like maybe like anti women,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.160
 just something not good.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.240
 And I actually retweeted it.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.040
 And I'm like, oh man, I really hope nobody saw that.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.600
 'Cause I didn't notice till the next day.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.440
 And I was like, yeah, this was the next day for me too.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.360
 And my mind wasn't, my mind was innocuous.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.640
 But it wasn't really, it wasn't direct.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.320
 It was like, the problem is, okay,

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.640
 it was something that was like,

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.000
 it was said in a humorous way, but it wasn't funny enough.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Like it wasn't funny enough to be worth the thing.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.840
 - To retweet it.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.920
 - So they just sound like salty about something.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.840
 And I like retweeted it.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.680
 - Oh no.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.000
 - This is literally what works in the right to be.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.840
 Yeah.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.840
 And then my other situation is CEO, plant scale.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.920
 I started talking to him initially just over Twitter.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.760
 Yeah.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.160
 And we had like an initial brief conversation about

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.040
 just some things about how plant scale works.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.960
 And I was like, oh, this is cool.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.000
 I like him like this is a new relationship into.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.280
 Then I accidentally DM'd him,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.800
 just like a butt DM'd him.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.800
 Like this really stupid, like crypto related thing.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.720
 It was like.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.120
 - Wait, you butt DM'd him actual words

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.520
 and they were about crypto.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.320
 I sent him, I like somehow like sent him to tweet to him.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.680
 - Oh no.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.280
 - It was something, it was like just like the lamest point.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.080
 It was like something so stupid like,

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.360
 like crypto needs a GitHub or just like something

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.600
 like this like a lame, like really lame point.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.520
 And I sent it to him and then he replied in a really nice way

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.960
 to be like, oh yeah, that is true.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.160
 And I was like, no, like I think I like found this

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.960
 so interesting that I needed to send it to you

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.800
 of all people and reply to being like LOL.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.640
 That was a, yeah, I don't know if he believed it

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.760
 but I hope. - That's so funny.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.000
 - I hope in the time since as he got in to know me more

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.840
 that he would understand that.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.120
 - He'd realize you wouldn't have.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.160
 - He wouldn't have send him that.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.680
 - That's awesome.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.440
 Well, we could just pretend that Aaron really did unfollow me.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.680
 He did point out to me, like if he really didn't want

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.280
 to hear what I had to say, he could mute me

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.160
 and not create a big fuss.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.520
 So I believe him, it was an accident.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.360
 - I don't believe him.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.800
 - But we could just pretend, let's not believe him.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.880
 You know, they're competing on our podcast.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.600
 Let's just, we're going to make it a blood feud.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.400
 And let's just unfollow Aaron right now.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.720
 - He unfollowed you and he started his own fucking accident.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.560
 (laughing)

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.760
 - Look, this guy sucks.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.960
 We can do this so much better.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.980
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.680
 I wouldn't believe him if I were you

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.560
 and I would be, I would start more drama.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.160
 He probably thought, you heard it, Aaron.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.040
 - He probably thought that the content

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.960
 you were putting in his feed was really bad

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.960
 and negative and bad for the world.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.680
 - I mean, honestly, when I saw he had unfollowed me,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.000
 I was like, man, check that out.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.360
 He's really into positivity and I'm really negative.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.200
 (laughing)

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.880
 It kind of makes sense despite having a relationship.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.080
 But yeah, it never feels good.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.360
 It never feels good when you notice

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.680
 that somebody unfollowed you.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.580
 That's the thing that I've noticed in the past.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.800
 Or just when someone who you feel like

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.240
 you've got a mutual connection to just never does follow you.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.920
 I've talked about that before.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.320
 I'm weird about stuff like this.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.160
 Why am I so weird?

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.600
 - This is, I mean, this is like a great explanation

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.880
 of why it's been good for you to be off of Twitter.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.600
 - Yes, this has been nice

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.720
 'cause these are the kind of things

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.000
 that I go crazy over.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.400
 - Yeah, I've been enjoying this.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.080
 I don't know if you saw the stuff I've been doing

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.920
 for the past couple of weeks

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.760
 where I've been posting these challenges.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.880
 - Yeah, we were like, here's a challenge.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.840
 You're too dumb, you won't figure it out.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.160
 We'll see you, you'll see you try.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.160
 Dumb dums.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.520
 Sorry, that's how I interpret them.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.360
 Go ahead, yeah, tell me about it.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.640
 - I don't know that's fairly accurate.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.840
 (laughing)

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.520
 Yeah, so I mean, I always complain

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.520
 that they're just never back in discussion on Twitter.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.320
 So all I get to engage with is front end stuff.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.320
 And I was like, oh, but I can probably do more

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.160
 than just complain.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.600
 Like maybe I can just try like talking more

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.760
 about back end stuff.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.400
 And I think these challenges are good

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.720
 because they're very engaging.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.200
 Like people, it's a chance for like people to discuss

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.640
 and like actually take part as opposed

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.640
 to being just like a way thing.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.400
 - Almost as engaging as quote tweet this with.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.400
 Sorry, how are you doing? (laughing)

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.920
 - Yeah, so I've just been posting this

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.800
 and they all come from, I basically just pay attention

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.600
 to stuff I'm working on throughout the week.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.120
 And I'll be like, oh, that was like a very specific thing

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.640
 I had to do, but it's like a generalized problem.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.280
 Let me like make a generalized version

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.560
 of the challenge and I'll post it.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.560
 And it's been pretty cool because I've found

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.160
 that they're valuable in that almost no one,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.120
 as I was gonna say, what you said earlier,

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.440
 almost no one gets them.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.120
 I'm not saying that as in like, how high I went stupid,

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.520
 a little bit, I am a little bit

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.160
 saying how high I went stupid.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.000
 But it actually shows that's valuable

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.440
 'cause like it's an opportunity for most people to.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.280
 - To learn something. - It's something

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.120
 that you've rented.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.720
 I don't know why, but like whatever my career trajectory was

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.440
 like it hit these problems like very directly or early on.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.960
 So I just assumed, okay, everyone just thinks

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.840
 about stuff all the time, but I guess it's not the case.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.540
 And then I occasionally will actually get an answer

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.840
 that's very good and thorough.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.000
 And sometimes I even like learn something from it,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.500
 which is pretty awesome.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.800
 So yeah, it's been fun.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.680
 Of course it's Twitter, so there's always a way

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.720
 that people will find people will always find a way

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.360
 to be annoying no matter what.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.360
 And the classic thing is they'll reply being like,

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.760
 this isn't even hard.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.920
 (laughing)

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.120
 I'll be like, you do that, this isn't even hard.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.200
 And of course they're wrong.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.720
 They like miss something or like the thing

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.860
 they posted is wrong.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.320
 Someone on the first one, someone replied being like,

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.200
 this isn't even wrong, you just do this.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.200
 Then someone corrected them being like,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.320
 well, you have to consider this thing.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.920
 They were like, well, it's still not that hard.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.760
 You just do this.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.880
 And then they corrected them again,

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.000
 being able to miss this other thing.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.120
 And they concluded like, oh, it's just like so easy.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.040
 And I'm like, you literally proved this.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.840
 You demonstrated why it was a challenge

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.120
 because it seems straightforward,

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.000
 but it's a little bit more complicated than it seems.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.280
 That's a form of challenge I like.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.520
 I like when it seems simple,

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.560
 but like you start to go into it and you're like,

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.200
 oh, what about this case or about that case?

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.040
 - Yeah.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.480
 - But some people just take you to face value.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.840
 - Does it sort of, like I assumed when I saw

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.560
 you posting these things that it was sort of highlighting

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.640
 some of the challenges with the modern web stack

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.960
 that everyone's sort of gone down.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.680
 Like, does it challenge those things?

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.040
 Does it make it hard?

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.560
 If the only thing you know about back end

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.880
 is like next JS API routes,

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.920
 is it tough to implement some of these patterns

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.280
 or is that not part of your--

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.600
 - Well, I wasn't thinking about that,

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.160
 but you know, I would love to make that point.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.000
 - I did a little bit.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.880
 - So if I'm making that point, that's fantastic.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.360
 - No, I actually wasn't.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.560
 I, it started with something simple.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.840
 It was just, the first one was just,

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.920
 I have a thousand tasks I need to do,

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.720
 but I only want to do them 25 at a time.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.000
 But I do want to do that concurrently 25 at a time.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.320
 And I was thinking about how in other languages,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.640
 this is like very natural or native.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:14.640
 And in JavaScript, it's kind of not as straightforward

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.600
 or just takes a lot of code.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.040
 So yeah, it was just that, it's where it started.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.520
 And then I was kind of taking it from there.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.840
 And it's been pretty easy to think about them.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.080
 Like something, I run to something almost every day

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.200
 that fits into this.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.240
 - So I've been working very hard.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.080
 Lots of, lots of flinging code around and deleting code

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.920
 and doing all the things with code.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.880
 I never think of like a thing

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.040
 that I would distill and share with the world.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.040
 I just don't, is that like a different personality?

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.240
 Is it a different set of skills?

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.360
 Like I can't imagine at the end of my day

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.160
 being like, oh, I solved this problem today.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.880
 Here is how I can distill that

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.800
 and hand it over to the world to learn.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.680
 Oh, I don't think I could ever do that.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.800
 It's just not in me.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.440
 - I don't think it's like anything like that.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.080
 'Cause I remember very clearly thinking at one point

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.640
 where I would see people that were doing stuff more publicly.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.960
 And I was like, oh, all they're doing is remembering

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.400
 that once they finish solving a problem, they're not done.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.400
 They have this opportunity to then like post it.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.200
 So to me, just felt like a habit that I had to develop

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.000
 'cause I didn't have the mindset of,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.200
 okay, I should take note of this.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.440
 Or like this is useful more than just be on my direct problem.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.440
 Yeah, so I remember not doing that at all.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.600
 And then now like being able to constantly remember

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.440
 to do that.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.280
 So I don't know, I think it just--

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.400
 - So that's something I could develop.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.480
 It's something I could work on.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.120
 - Hmm, yeah.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.680
 I mean, even some of the stuff you ran into

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.080
 'cause you're doing all the asterisk stuff

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.240
 and AWS and all those little details,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.240
 there's probably some general stuff there.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.360
 - Yeah, it just feels so specific.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.520
 But I guess that's just my mindset.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.360
 I don't know.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.320
 - But people even like specific stuff.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.160
 - Yeah.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.160
 - It gives them a night to like something

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.640
 that they don't already know about.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.920
 - Yeah, it's so fun when like in the SSC Discord,

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.600
 seeing other people that are using Astro and SSC

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.400
 and like they're creating PRs.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.320
 And like knowing that there's other people

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.480
 that are like super into this very specific stack,

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.240
 enough to like contribute and push it forward.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.280
 I just love that.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.880
 I love knowing like I'm not a snowflake.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.560
 I'm not alone in this little tiny branch

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.160
 of software development I'm in.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.000
 - Yeah.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.680
 - There's people that think about this stuff all the time.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.520
 That's really cool.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.600
 - Yeah, that's crazy about the internet.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.800
 I just like no matter how small a minority you are,

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.960
 it'll like just connect you with enough people.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.040
 - That's what it feels like a real community.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.480
 But the SST, the Astro on AWS combo,

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.120
 I actually have heard from Fred

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.840
 that that's technically the majority,

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.160
 that that's if you rank all their deployments of Astro.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.160
 - Really?

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.680
 - It makes sense because we always forget

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.560
 like all real companies with paid employees deploy in AWS.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.600
 So any technology that's at all adopted,

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.760
 it just kind of is a default.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.120
 They might not be deploying it in this like really effective

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.280
 way it might be just like static pages

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.920
 or like something a lot simpler.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.000
 - Yeah.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.080
 - But yeah, AWS is like where most of most,

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.000
 if you always have to rank them.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 I don't know like what percentage it is.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.440
 - Yeah, that's so interesting.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.640
 I mean, I think it is the best way by a lot,

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.760
 but I just assumed that the easiness of like,

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.600
 just clicking a button

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.400
 and sending your Astro site to Versailles.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.880
 I just figured that would like be their predominant thing.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.360
 Can we talk about Astro as we've done this before?

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.440
 We've talked about Astro and SST,

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.000
 but can we talk about this PR specifically?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.160
 Is that getting a little weird?

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.560
 - No, let's do it, let's do it.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.040
 - Okay.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.760
 So let's talk about whether, you know,

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.920
 the fallback approach, this PR out there,

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.000
 I feel like we need to talk about this anyway.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.440
 Just like come to some kind of resolution

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.680
 or you can take something back and, I don't know,

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.160
 make a case, API Gateway versus not API Gateway,

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.480
 all that conversation, do you want, let's just do it.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.360
 - So I guess I'll lay out the situation.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.280
 So when you build, when you use some of these frameworks

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.160
 like Asha or Nexius, you start to define

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.240
 lots of routes, there's routes for dynamic content,

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.480
 there's routes for static content,

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.640
 there's routes for, I don't know, like your assets.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.000
 There's like all kinds of different ways

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.120
 that whatever is getting a request

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.560
 needs to route it to a different place.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.080
 Like sometimes it's to a function,

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.160
 to like render it live.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.240
 Sometimes it's to something cache and S3.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.680
 And as your app gets more complex,

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.800
 you just get a lot of these different patterns.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.960
 Unfortunately in AWS, they're front facing

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.000
 like the router that the end user hits,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.920
 called CloudFront, they're CDN.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.600
 There's a limitation, but default limitation,

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.760
 what is it, 20 behaviors?

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.760
 Oh my God.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.120
 - 25, I think, yeah, something like that.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.280
 - Okay, so basically they're saying

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.560
 like we can only specify 25 patterns of things.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.400
 And sometimes that works like if all of your static assets

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.120
 are under just flash assets or whatever,

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.720
 like that's just one behavior.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.600
 But with like a real like big website, like a real application,

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.600
 like you're gonna get all kinds of complicated patterns.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.280
 So we're trying to figure out how to work around

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:09.000
 this problem because AWS will lift the limits

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.040
 if you message them, but they don't lift it infinitely.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.760
 And they like, they'll bump you up

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.280
 and then you're gonna keep asking them to bump it up.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.120
 That's 'cause more complicated.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.280
 - We've got it up to 50 right now, for what it's worth.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.960
 - So as for us, like building an adapter to deploy AWS,

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.040
 we can't rely on people having the limit bumped up.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.080
 So we're looking at different options.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:29.960
 Is that a good summary?

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.800
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.000
 And I think the traditional, the easy answer is like

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.200
 you put API gateway in there between your handler code

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.160
 that's in Lambda's, Lambda functions.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.360
 Oh, I said Lambda's, I'm so sorry, Chris.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.800
 (laughs)

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.440
 I just, every time I hear the word, I think of Chris Moons,

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.560
 there's like putting API gateway in between

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.000
 and doing all the routing there.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.040
 So basically you have like one default behavior

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.120
 in your cloud front distribution

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.840
 that just routes everything into your API gateway

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.440
 and then you can do all the complicated routing stuff

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.240
 you want in your API gateway layer.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.800
 There's downsides that like API gateway

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.680
 is another thing that you kind of have to think about.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.760
 It's serverless.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.400
 I mean, there's not a lot of like,

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.640
 not a lot of management there,

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.680
 but it does introduce a little bit of latency.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.840
 It's not as fast as going straight to a Lambda function

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.160
 with just a Lambda function URL

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.000
 and you don't get streaming.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 And I don't know why I'm so hung up on streaming

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.480
 'cause the more I learn about streaming,

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.160
 the more I think it's a dumb feature.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.000
 No one cares.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.840
 It's really like, I don't know, it's kind of neat.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.040
 It's kind of neat, but like at the end of the day,

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.480
 you don't have loading states.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.560
 Like it's just sending chunks.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.880
 It's like if your page is really long

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.440
 and you could defer loading stuff on the bottom of the page,

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.000
 then like you get a little benefit.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.280
 The top of the page can render first.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.160
 And it's nice that like the CDN caches the full response,

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.760
 like after the stream is complete,

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.440
 it's a full page that ends up in the CDN.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.480
 So it's not like caching a spa

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.320
 where you have a bunch of spinner states

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.480
 and it's just a dumb, empty HTML page

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.080
 that then makes calls to fetch data.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.880
 It's better than that in that sense,

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.560
 but it's worse than that in the sense

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.840
 that you can't put like a skeleton loader in there

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.800
 or something like that

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.340
 because it's just streaming sequential chunks of HTML.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.480
 Does that make sense so far?

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.800
 - Yeah, the streaming thing is interesting

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.240
 'cause I've also been kind of confused by that.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.040
 And I think if you look at where it was kind of like

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.120
 born this pattern, it makes a lot more sense.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.160
 And your project might actually fall into this,

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.160
 but the majority of like SaaS applications

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.440
 talk to a singular backend.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.080
 You built your backend and like the majority of requests

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.520
 talk to like your database.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.760
 It's like pretty simple.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.680
 Yeah, it might be a little bit more complicated than that,

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.440
 but it doesn't go too crazy.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.320
 If you build like an e-commerce website,

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.640
 you might have like here's some content from Shopify.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.600
 Here's some content that's stored in our CMS.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.400
 Here's some content that's stored in our inventory system

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.080
 that might be separate for some reason.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.720
 So like a single page might be talking

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.320
 to like all kinds of data sources.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:05.000
 So I imagine like each UI component on the page

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.520
 talking to different data sources

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.320
 that you can't like batch the requests to

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.640
 or like they return at different speeds.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.720
 I see how streaming kind of makes sense there

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.880
 because like yeah, then just the fact

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.080
 that one of your back ends for one component on the page

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.040
 being slow doesn't prevent the whole page

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.280
 from not showing up.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.120
 Yep.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.120
 So I get that once again, I am extremely confused

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.120
 why this is at all exciting for anyone that I know

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.200
 working on anything.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.920
 They got lucky because there's weird coincidence

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.920
 that OpenAI, you know, is all like a streaming type interface.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.600
 So like there was some like synergy there.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.080
 But again, like still kind of niche

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:50.080
 because any like serious product integrating like OpenAI,

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.400
 you actually don't stream it.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.080
 You buffer and you do some additional processing.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:54.920
 Yeah.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.560
 If you're just wrapping the OpenAI or OpenAI,

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.400
 yeah.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.160
 Then like congratulations.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.440
 You're competing with the 1000 of the people

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.280
 doing the same thing and it's worthless.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.120
 Yeah.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:05.960
 Yeah, exactly.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.240
 So I am like just not, I'm confused by that.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.040
 So yeah, again, like your situation is a little bit different

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:16.000
 'cause you work on like a big consumer facing thing.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.200
 But most people I know don't.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.840
 They just work on business faces.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.280
 But honestly, yeah, the benefit of streaming is very tiny

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.280
 and I've considered just ripping it out

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.640
 even if it's supported because I don't know

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.800
 that it's really adding enough to justify.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.400
 I think like there's something in me

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.200
 that just hates the idea of like not being feature complete.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.960
 Like if Astro supports a thing.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.800
 Yeah, I know.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.360
 I want it to be there in the SSC adapter

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.800
 and then that goes to code splitting.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.600
 So then code splitting,

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.120
 the person that authored this PR says that they think

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.680
 there's a path to support code splitting with that approach,

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.640
 with the fallback approach.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.280
 I guess we didn't talk about the PR or the fallback approach.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.520
 This is a very weird, specific conversation

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.600
 to have on a podcast.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.640
 But it aren't all of our conversations, I guess.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.680
 We're always just talking about whatever is going on.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.600
 So whatever.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.320
 They did say, I don't know how that would work.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.000
 You can't just fall back, chain them together.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:11.960
 That would be awful.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.520
 Yeah, it would be too slow.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.800
 That would be really slow, yeah.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.160
 'Cause the Lambda Invocations are semi expensive

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.080
 as opposed to an S3, yes.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:20.920
 Yeah, exactly.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.120
 So yeah, I'm still not sure.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.920
 There's just so many dimensions of things you can trade off.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.640
 So if you want streaming, then you can't get splitting.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.800
 If you want splitting, then maybe you can't get streaming.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.160
 The reason I was thinking about splitting

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.880
 was I was actually giving the Astro team demo

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.440
 of the new SST console.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.640
 And I was showing them one of the things that I love

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.080
 about this event-driven stuff, the serverless stuff,

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.600
 is you can be way more aggressive with log statements.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.240
 So you can put way more log statements

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.560
 than you normally would,

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.200
 because it's not a single log stream

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.680
 of your whole application.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.000
 It's already naturally broken down into

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.760
 this function's log stream or this routes log stream.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.720
 And you get that granularity.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.240
 When you go into the console and you're like,

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.560
 okay, I'm looking for an issue that happened

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.560
 in this part of my application.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.040
 You just go to the function that handles it

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.080
 and you see just the logs for it, which is great.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.280
 But with our current way we do SSR sites,

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.440
 we bundle all of your routes into a single function.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.280
 So you lose that.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.600
 And then when you go to the log site function,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.760
 you see the logs for all of your routes.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.440
 So I like splitting, not from a performance point of view.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.920
 And again, if you look at our console

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.320
 for most applications, you'll see that

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.960
 even people that split up their functions,

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.840
 all the functions are like eerily almost the exact same size

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.120
 because your dependencies account for 99% of it.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.560
 So yeah, I don't care about splitting for performance,

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.040
 but from observability standpoint of like organizing it,

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.440
 like I'm almost willing to accept

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.880
 some performance trade off to like maintain

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.680
 that like niceness I get when I'm debugging.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.280
 - Yeah, I get that.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.520
 I guess like, I want to make sure I understand

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.360
 splitting fully.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.360
 If you have dependencies on one route

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.440
 that aren't on any other route,

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.920
 then that bundle is going to be larger in that function, right?

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.320
 'Cause like there are pages for us,

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.400
 like we have a finance product

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.920
 and then we have the sports product.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.160
 And on the finance side, we have to do a bunch of other stuff.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.160
 Like there's a bunch of stuff,

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.240
 a bunch of dependencies we pull in that I don't love,

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.400
 all of them, but I'd love for those dependencies

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.720
 to not affect the bloat of our sports page

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.000
 'cause they can be pretty light on the server side.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.680
 So I think splitting actually would benefit my use case.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.880
 - Yeah, it just depends, it's like very, very specific

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.280
 to exactly your situation.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.840
 And it's just hard to measure also

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.120
 because is a slower cold start worth it

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.560
 if you have fewer cold starts overall, right?

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.380
 It's a very hard question to answer.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.160
 And splitting means you have more cold starts,

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.280
 but theoretically they get slower, they get faster,

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.440
 but again, how faster?

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.360
 Like is it 10% faster, 20% faster,

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.840
 so three times faster.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.800
 So because they're just not like a slam dunk,

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.320
 obviously is what you should always do,

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.160
 it's hard for us to make a decision.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.240
 - Well, we got a lot of users,

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.600
 so I lean towards splitting would be better for us.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.360
 - Yeah, that makes sense 'cause you'll always have

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.480
 a bunch of warm stuff.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.440
 You're not gonna have a lot of cold starts in general.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.400
 - Right, 'cause the routes, I mean,

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.440
 it's like it's not a cold start per page.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.960
 I mean, it's a cold start per route,

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.320
 but the routes are all dynamic

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.800
 and there could be a million different pages,

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.320
 literally under one route with one dynamic segment.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.240
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.280
 So that's just one cold start for any of those million pages.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.560
 - Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.400
 Yeah, I think for you guys,

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.680
 like splitting is a little more obvious.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.600
 Yeah, I think the observability angle,

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.440
 to me, that's like universally a good thing, so.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.280
 - Yeah.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.440
 - That's like my first decision point.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.560
 But yeah, it might just be good to split as a default.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.320
 - So maybe you could follow up on the PR or Frank

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.760
 or somebody could follow up and just ask,

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.720
 how would we implement splitting in this

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.360
 because we want to move to splitting?

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.720
 And if there's not a path forward,

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.960
 then we want to look at the API gateway thing.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.800
 Maybe that's a good,

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.440
 I don't know, I'm telling you how to run SST here.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.280
 I'm sorry. - No, that makes sense.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.000
 - No, I have one, I just, I like when.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.440
 - Do you want me to take over your stream too?

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.760
 Is that, would you like me to?

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.840
 - Just run and just take everything over.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.880
 - Hey, Optie's here, I'm sorry.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.320
 (laughing)

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.560
 - It's called delegation.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.400
 I heard that's good.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.880
 - Yeah, exactly, delegate to the community.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.920
 It is, I think.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.600
 Especially when there's only three of you.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.160
 - Yeah, not what we like when people tell us what to do

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.560
 'cause then there's less that we have to think about.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.680
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.000
 - That will link the PR in the show notes

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.280
 so that any of this made maybe some sense

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.520
 if you care to dig in

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.000
 and you want to understand what we're talking about.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.120
 There's some documentation on GitHub.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.360
 There are things you could read

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.840
 and this would maybe make a little more sense.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.120
 If you've listened this far, you probably are curious.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:41.960
 - So there you go.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:42.800
 (laughing)

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.560
 - Yeah, we're at the odd intersection

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.000
 of like weird AWS infrastructure stuff

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.640
 with like the most front-endy things

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.960
 that you can think about.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.680
 - Yeah, it's a weird, it's a niche.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.960
 But it's the internet.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.720
 There's people out there that care about that niche.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.560
 - Yeah.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.480
 - I guess there's other people that listen to us

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.480
 'cause we talked about aliens once or something.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.320
 I don't know.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.160
 I don't know why anyone listens to us.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.160
 Do you know?

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.000
 - I don't know.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 But more and more every single day.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.840
 - More and more.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.680
 It's growing.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.760
 You're part of a burgeoning community.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.600
 Maybe we should have a Discord or something.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.640
 I don't know.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.360
 Do people that listen to the show want to hang out?

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.680
 No, you're shaking your head now.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.520
 - Yeah, I just like--

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.480
 - Too many Discords.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.120
 - I just don't have time to, I just realized

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.120
 I'm not able to allocate enough time

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.080
 to like invest in something like that.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:23.920
 - Yeah.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.760
 - No, I hear you've got to find something--

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.920
 - We'll wait 'til we have like a lot of listeners.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.160
 We'll wait 'til there's so many listeners

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.360
 that we have multiple people who are like,

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.880
 "Can I please run your Discord?"

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.480
 I'm like, "Okay, I guess."

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.600
 Hey, here's the thing.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.440
 There's a lot of people who listen to the show

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.600
 and there are not a lot of reviews or ratings

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.800
 or any of those things.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.000
 And if you're still listening 34 minutes

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.280
 into this podcast, that means you probably like this show

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.520
 and you could just go tell someone about it

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.320
 or write it on the internet

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.200
 so lots of someone's could see it.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.040
 That'd be good.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.120
 We'd like that.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.880
 I hear that that's good for spreading the show.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.360
 Okay, I always hate doing that,

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.760
 but I did it, I did it just now.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.600
 - No, it's good.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.440
 I appreciate that.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.280
 - Sometimes I do it.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.120
 I appreciate that you're the one

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.640
 that took the burden of doing that.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.480
 - You're welcome.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.320
 - Appreciate it.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.160
 Thank you.

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.000
 (laughing)

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.840
 I'll go write a review.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.880
 - Is appreciation a, well, is that a thank you or not?

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.520
 Like if somebody says, "I appreciate that."

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.600
 Is your welcome an appropriate response?

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.320
 - It does sound weird to say you're welcome.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.560
 - It does, yeah.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.520
 I don't know what to say in respect.

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.320
 - I appreciate that you appreciate it, Dax.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.160
 That's my response.

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.120
 - Maybe I should start saying thank you.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.360
 I'm gonna rotate out the phrase appreciate it.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.200
 I'm gonna say thank you

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.720
 so it's not awkward for the other person.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.760
 And they would appreciate me.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.840
 - So I could say, you're welcome.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.280
 I would appreciate that.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.120
 Now what do you say?

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:34.960
 - You're welcome.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.360
 (laughing)

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.600
 Oh man.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.640
 All right, let's get off here.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.560
 I think we gotta go.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.480
 - Okay.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.320
 - Yep.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.160
 - Okay, bye.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.880
 What do you look at me like that for?

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.880
 - Is it still in the silent?

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.720
 - I said, yeah.

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.560
 - Oh, you already said it.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.960
 - And there was a pause.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.800
 - Oh, okay.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.640
 - Okay, see ya.

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.480
 - Bye.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.060
 (upbeat music)
