00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
 I can't believe all of you are falling for Adam.dev's layervel scam.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.760
 Oh, my God.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.540
 He clicks away to you with the stream title say you're going to build a project with

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.600
 layervel and just talking about layervel never does any layer.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.960
 I hate that that's accurate.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.520
 I hate that it's true because I'm not scamming.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.040
 I'm not.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.240
 So many people think I'm trolling.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.240
 I'm really not.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.600
 I'm actually excited about layervel.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.960
 Why would I troll about that?

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.000
 It's like a fantastic community.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 It's amazing technology.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 You're doing it again.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.360
 You're again, just talking about it and not actually doing.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.040
 I've actually done some layervel, just not on stream yet, okay?

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.180
 I've built the starter project, okay?

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.180
 It was a lot of CLI commands.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.360
 It was a lot of CLI commands or one CLI command because you have to MPM install because nothing

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.400
 can escape the grasp of MPM and JavaScript.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.440
 So if it were for that, it would just be a couple that you got to build your front end

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.440
 assets or whatever.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.440
 I don't know.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.680
 You're not one of those people that just clones a starter thing and then starts talking

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.680
 about a technology.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.680
 Okay.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.680
 I'm not.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.520
 But in this case that maybe one of them, no, but but I'm not that kind of person.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.880
 It doesn't define me.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.200
 One, one action does not define my person.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.320
 I agree, but I'm just saying technically speaking, that is a bullet point when you're

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.360
 being judged later.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.360
 It's true that I did not actually alter the starter project in any way.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.360
 Not any meaningful way.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.120
 I did change the markup a little bit just to see that it doesn't have hot reloading, which

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.120
 we should talk about that.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.840
 Taylor, we should talk about what JavaScript developers expect.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.240
 Now that there's a flood of JavaScript developers flooding into the PHP and layervel world,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.920
 we need to set some expectations.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.120
 We expect when we make a change in the file and we save it, it just automatically updates

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.120
 in the browser.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.360
 It's just an expectation.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.360
 It's all we've got really JavaScript is hell on earth and this full stack JavaScript stuff.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.480
 If we're going to have a deal with all that, at least we can save a file and see it immediately

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.240
 reflected in the in the browser.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.240
 That's all we got.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.080
 I'm sure they're really happy that you're in this, you're in their space now.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.240
 I wonder actually, I wonder how much there's people like with some consternation.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.440
 Why did I use that word?

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.640
 I wonder how many people are like a little upset and a little nervous about JavaScript

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.280
 boys showing up into their very adult community.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.840
 There's no drama.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.040
 Yeah, I was messaging about this.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.920
 You were like, Oh man, layer of else of this peaceful paradise.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.120
 Okay, everyone go run into it.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.920
 That's so true.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.440
 What have I done?

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.320
 I'm going to be the person that took down the layer of our community and brought all the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.720
 JavaScript people to it.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.720
 Oh no.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.120
 Have you ever used it?

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.920
 So I've done even less than you, but I've like read every word.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.160
 I don't know if it's possible.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.360
 I don't know if it's possible if you've done less than me, but you've read every word

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.360
 of the docs.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.360
 Why?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.680
 Because one, it just says like, because I work on a framework and I, they're like kind

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.880
 of a gold standard in a lot of ways.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.840
 So just because I want to understand how to do their docs, how they structured it, but

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.400
 also like how everything works.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.640
 Because I think in terms of like what primitives do people need, it like sets a nice bar on

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.840
 here's a list of everything you need, and you have these you can directly build most

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840
 things.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.840
 Yeah.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.920
 So yeah, I just want to understand all that worked and how they organize stuff.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.720
 Big question I always have is, you know, you have to separate your concerns somehow and

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.600
 some applications separate them by what the thing is like all your events go here, all

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.080
 your data models go here, all your whatever goes here, or you separate them by like business

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.840
 concerns, like all your user stuff goes here, all your to do stuff goes, et cetera.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.840
 So yeah, that was kind of research and we kind of constantly refer back to it.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.840
 And they do they do the, the not the business, see you way, right?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.920
 They do like actions and controllers, they have folders like that.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.200
 Yeah, which is different than where I do the, I usually do the other thing, like to have,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.600
 if I'm working on user stuff, like to see like all the events and all the database models

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.000
 and everything all in one place, but yeah, just kind of looking at their approach, understand

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.720
 like if it's better, like when it's better, when it's worse.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.800
 So this would be a good exercise for me because I'd like to hear all the, like I'm very enamored.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.680
 I'm in that early honeymoon phase where I just love everything about this, everything

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.680
 I'm seeing about Laravel.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.920
 But I know there's trade offs because everything in technology is trade offs.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.080
 So you're helping me, you can help me kind of understand if you've read all the docs.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.880
 One thing, one big question I have is like, what is the performance story?

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.480
 Because I've heard a lot of people come at me now on Twitter, since I declared my love

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.800
 publicly for Laravel about how slow it is and PHP so slow.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800
 Is it really, has anyone actually done the benchmarks?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.680
 I wouldn't be surprised if no one's actually done the benchmarks, but that's the thing.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.680
 Yeah.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.680
 It just comes on here.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.880
 The thing I always say is like your speed is really never about your language.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.880
 It's usually about your architecture, like, because it's not about the benchmarks really.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.360
 It's about how people feel when they're using your app.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.640
 So what kind of database are you using, like what kind of strategies are you using with

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.640
 the database?

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.360
 I'm sure you can have a Laravel app that feels effective.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.000
 I imagine it's a little bit harder, just because some of the JavaScript tools are a little bit

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.360
 more integrated for the stuff that makes things feels fast, but I'm sure you can make

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.360
 it feel fast.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.320
 But on a technical basis, yes, it is slower, which means you're going to pay a little bit

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.800
 more the language itself.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.800
 The language itself.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.080
 If I had a page, and this is what I'd like to do, I'd like to take some sample app that's

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.960
 got some kind of like SSR scenario where you have to fetch some data from a database and

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.960
 then render the page.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.680
 I'd like to create that app with Next.js server components, and I'd like to create it with

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.360
 Laravel, and I'd like to like time it.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.360
 Can we do that?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.480
 Is that an exercise that I could do?

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.480
 Is it slower, like time differs by just generating a page?

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.000
 Yeah, but you have to like test adequate things like you have to, so you know how in JavaScript

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 you can easily do two requests at once because of the like event loop, like it'll kick off

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.360
 the narrow requests, do some of the work stuff and all that stuff.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.200
 I don't, I just don't know enough about PHP to understand, does it, one does it have that?

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.020
 Is it 100% like does it have this concept of like asynchronous IO, right?

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.480
 This stuff historically mattered a lot more when a single container server, whatever was

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.440
 handling a lot of requests, but these are all deployed to Lambda function.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.520
 So it's not like needs to handle a hundred requests at once, but within the context of

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.360
 a single request, you know, how, how much parallel work can it do?

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.600
 Yeah, I don't know the answer to these things, but it is a simpler language and I imagine

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.800
 that it doesn't have some of these optimizations, which is what keeps it simple.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.800
 Yeah.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.800
 Okay.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.800
 Are there other downsides I'm overlooking?

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.800
 Is the type system thing?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.440
 I guess people who are really big into type safety, I mean, you as someone that has been

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.320
 doing a bunch of in TypeScript and is using TypeScript language, TypeScript libraries,

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.560
 you might find like it feel, you might feel like it's like a slide backwards.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.240
 The other thing that I didn't get to when we're talking about the other day is the diversity

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.240
 thing.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.800
 But it does show up in some places, like, so for me, I hate class based doing things

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.800
 by classes.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.680
 I hate modeling everything as a class.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.600
 I love having like typed objects and passing them around to functions.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.000
 Like I just my background, if I shift to the Laravel world, like just can't do functional

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.880
 stuff as much in the JavaScript world, there's a lot of people that use classes.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880
 That's fine.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.160
 But there's also people like me that don't.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.960
 So yeah, there's certain styles that maybe you're willing to give up, maybe you want to

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.760
 shift, but in exchange for all this stuff you get.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.560
 But I think for me, there's like a few things that keep me away from it.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.040
 It's really just a type to some end, just a class oriented nature of everything.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.040
 Okay.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.640
 I'm still going down this path.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.640
 You didn't dissuade me.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.640
 No, I'm not trying to persuade you.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.640
 I'm going to try it.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.640
 I'm going to build something.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.640
 Yeah, you are.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.640
 Of course you are.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.440
 I was just trying to pop my balloon, Dax, I get all excited.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.540
 I'm easily excited.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.840
 I guess that's probably the problem, but then you always just want to pop my balloon.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.840
 I'm not doing anything.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.920
 You're going through your own roller coaster emotional journey right now.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.840
 Dax, you just sent me a tweet that you wrote this morning that's popping, literally popping

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.840
 my bubble.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840
 It's not literally.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.840
 Wait, what do you mean?

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.840
 What do you do?

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.240
 You just you denied it, but you just you sent me the tweet.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.040
 You told me that you wrote this tweet and you you're talking about how I'm scamming.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.440
 I'm not actually into Laravel.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:24.120
 If anything, that's encouraging you to prove me wrong and it's fair because I am feeling

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.120
 a little more motivated now.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.600
 Don't blame all your problems on on other people.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600
 Maybe look inwards.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.520
 Is that a valid criticism?

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.520
 Was that real?

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.720
 I can't tell if that's like the truth about it is not real.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.720
 Okay.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.520
 We've got that point in our relationship where I don't have the time.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.480
 I don't know if we're being serious or if we're joking.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.480
 Okay.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.480
 What's on your mind?

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.040
 I just said a lot of stuff about Lara, though.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.040
 What's on your mind?

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.040
 What is on my mind?

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.320
 I've been yesterday helping rocks with the thing he's working on, which has been kind

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.320
 of interesting.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.920
 And I may whole mention today he's kind of doing something very similar.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.520
 As I think we've talked about a bunch where if you just learn some of these tools, you

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.220
 can make things life a lot easier for yourself.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.800
 So the thing that rocks is doing, I think you're trying my Laravel, right?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.800
 If we just learn.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.800
 No, no.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.800
 I'm not.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.000
 We're not helping with this.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Nice try.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Good try.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.560
 He has this, he's trying to build this tool that people upload videos and extracts frames

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.560
 that you could potentially use for thumbnails for that video on YouTube.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.080
 So frames where there's a person's face and they're excited, et cetera.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.960
 And it turns out there is literally an AWS service that does exactly this.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.080
 I think you've actually played with this already.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:43.480
 It's like within an hour, I was able to kind of recreate the exact pipeline that he wanted,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.600
 which is basically core of his application.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.600
 Yeah.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.240
 And I think for him, the version he made also didn't take him that long, but the difference

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.520
 is this approach, once it's done, it's done forever.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.520
 It doesn't matter.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.200
 We're doing one video a day, a thousand videos a day, we don't ever worry about deploying.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.000
 And I think he was kind of in this constant cycle of like, where do I host?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 How do I deploy it?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Like what are my options?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.720
 So it kind of removes all those concerns and it was nice to see that.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.280
 That said, there is a reality of stuff that's using this kind of thing, which is the results

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.480
 were not amazing.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.480
 I think they were still there.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.960
 I think they were roughly the same as his results, but I think the ceiling to improve,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.400
 to get to do exactly what you want is lower because like you're kind of cooperating within

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.400
 the realm of what AWS supports, like you'd want to skip frames that have text on it because

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.480
 you don't want like random text in your video.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480
 Yep.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.160
 And it can't like also do text analysis at the same time.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.600
 So there is some rigidity, but the next level down is still like very managed and very serverless,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:47.480
 like seeing as it sees the long learning jobs to kind of do your own custom logic, as opposed

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.400
 to like, you know, deploying on a railway server and then it's overloaded and I spent

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.840
 up another one and like managing all that.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.880
 It's just a lot, especially for someone that like does not want to focus so much on the

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.560
 infrastructure stuff and do these other things.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.880
 So yeah, then Mayhol is doing something very similar and I'm like, can I just do a whole

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:12.520
 thing where I just like rebuild indie hackers, projects in like my setup, and then I basically

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.000
 do the napkins for everyone.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.520
 Yeah, I would love to see like all of the just the example repos for these use cases,

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:26.520
 because you just obviously think so fluently in SST that you're going to come up with like

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.040
 the best way to do it so quickly on AWS and yeah, you could turn them out so quickly.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.080
 So I don't know how we make this worth it for you, but I mean, it's not marketing.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:42.600
 Yeah, everything is a sea marketing, like it would be funny if like the end result of

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:48.360
 each of these things was just like an API with a very specific command just for these

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.120
 people's projects.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.920
 It's like, I just have like a hundred single customer API is that I whipped up in a day.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.640
 Did you actually give it to rocks to like run on this?

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.360
 He got to create his own AWS account. Did you actually get rocks to create an AWS account?

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.560
 Or are you hosting it for him?

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.480
 No, because again, this I can just run it on mine and I'll just send him the bill.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.120
 Oh, for real. You're going to like, you're just running it in your state.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:15.240
 I was like, I was like, if you just pay me two X to bill, I'll do it.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.240
 This is awesome.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.440
 If he's ever like naturally successful, I'm going to be twice as successful.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:26.400
 So I don't know if that works that way twice. You wouldn't be twice as you just be twice

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.960
 the the spend anyway.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.960
 Yes.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.960
 Okay.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.720
 So I want to see this code. I want to see recognition also does like the sharpness,

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.720
 right?

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.960
 If you're building something like that for like making thumbnails, which that's what

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.280
 he's doing, right?

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.320
 He'd want to know like, these are the best frames of this expression or something, but

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.480
 it's not very good, you said?

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:51.280
 No, no. So, okay. So my algorithm, my crazy algorithm I wrote in nine minutes yesterday,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.200
 basically, it's actually funny because the data that recognition gives you gives you

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.200
 a lot of stuff back.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:03.280
 So obviously, I was like, okay, score it by how happy they look, how surprised they look,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.920
 but also by how much their eyes are open and how open their mouth is and how much they're

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.480
 smiling and how bright the video is and how short you guys do.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.240
 Perfect YouTube clip.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.280
 The first, like, I first I just did happy and surprised and the results were like kind

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.200
 of okay. And then the more I added like all of those things, they like pretty much got

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:28.280
 the right clips, the right frames. The only issue is if within a one second window, if

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:33.160
 there's like one frame with text over it and one frame without text over it, like it might

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.200
 have just picked the one with text on it. So yeah, I'm trying like there's probably like

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.360
 two other alternatives I can build. Again, I could probably both those alternatives I

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:47.600
 can probably build within a day as well. And it's just like the initial effort is pretty

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:53.200
 small, but then like the time saved over time is like insane. Just never have to worry about

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200
 it again.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.560
 It's kind of hits on that whole serverless as a spectrum conversation. I mean, just like

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.200
 thinking about, yeah, okay, so it's a managed service, this Amazon recognition, he can only

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.240
 go so far with it, then he's got to go lower level, but he doesn't have to go to a virtual

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.800
 machine where he's installing everything on it. And like, that's too far down. There's

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.800
 there's things in between. It's a gradient.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.360
 Yeah, yeah, I think people do see as binary, but it really isn't. There's like so many

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.840
 stops, stops on the way. And even even like if you're going to run a container, it's also

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.320
 like more serverless place on a container, right?

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.440
 Yeah, right. You've got to do this next because the indie hacker crowd, if anyone should be

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:36.720
 using serverless, it's perfect for indie hacking. Like, indie hacking to me implies you don't

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:43.000
 have any money and you're working alone, and you're going to just rough something together

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.120
 quickly. And to me, serverless, like start with no costs. It'll grow as your your thing

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.680
 grows. I don't know. Is it not a perfect use case? Do you do you have the opposite take?

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.360
 I feel like that look, I think it is. It's just the, I think the mentality when the indie

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.720
 hacking space is like, don't learn stuff because that's a waste of time. You might not you

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.720
 might not need it.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.560
 I have so many problems with indie hacking as a concept. But it's like, it's like, it's

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.800
 not learn nothing. Just learn like one thing and then maybe you don't need to learn a bunch

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800
 of other stuff.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.120
 Yeah, I don't know why it bothers me. I feel like they should all just rebrand. They need

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:24.080
 a a new public relations person. Maybe I'll take over. Maybe I'll become an indie hacker.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:30.160
 Yeah, you become. Yes. Okay. Do it. And just funnel them all into SST. It's just one big

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.160
 marketing funnel.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:43.200
 Yeah, except, you know, that will make SST like dozens of dollars. Yeah, that's the best

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:51.520
 strategy for us. Oh, it's a funny thing you've ever said. It's funny because I posted about

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:57.960
 this, but just being in, I think maybe I've been messaging you about this, but just being

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.280
 in this Twitter bubble where everyone's like at the beginning of projects, like very, very

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.760
 small projects and we're always like trying to get something off the ground. When I was

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.120
 at React Miami, someone came over and they were like, Hey, like, you know, our company

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:15.760
 uses SST. That's awesome. Like what what's your company do? There's some oil and gas

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.800
 related company in Kansas City or somewhere around Kansas City that makes like $4 billion

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:28.320
 a year. And they had they were like, Oh, yeah, you know, we just moved 200 engineers to using

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.520
 SST every single day. I'm just like, wait, what? What? They have 200 engineers? Yeah,

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.080
 it's just like, and then all of them are just using SST and they're using it every day.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.840
 And they're like, and then we're on Twitter or our Discord talking. And he's like, wow,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.480
 you know, worst case scenario, if everything fails, I'm just going to go work for this

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:51.240
 company, you know, yeah, there you go. They need to keep you some SST. Yeah. And like, you

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.880
 know, it's just so I think there's just like this whole spectrum of these giant usages

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:02.360
 of it that we just don't really don't really come across directly. That's where for us,

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.960
 you know, all the opportunity is because if we build a nice product for them, you know,

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.760
 they're going to pay, they can pay a lot for it. So sorry, indie hacking crowd, just don't

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:16.680
 have the deep pockets. You guys can pay me back and making videos praising me.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:21.160
 There you go. That's a strategy. I do the real world thing. I think the Twitter bubble

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.320
 is so real. I realize how much my perception of everything in the world is warped through

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:32.440
 Twitter. Like this company that I would never know existed that has 200 software engineers.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.840
 But like everything we talk about on Twitter is about these tiny little startups that are

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.320
 really just dropping the bucket and the grand scheme of things.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.360
 Yeah, in my head, there's like, oh, there's like four companies out there that could employ

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.760
 me. That's like my perception of the world, but like there's like thousands of companies

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.720
 with like hundreds of engineers. Dark matter devs, the majority of devs in industry, but we don't

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.760
 see them. That's true. There's millions that that phrase that's from Scott Hanselman,

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:01.160
 you started your career in dot net, right? Yeah. You know, Scott Hanselman? Don't I think

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.680
 you don't know Scott Hanselman? Yeah, of course. Yeah. Why didn't you say that when I said Scott

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.240
 Hanselman? You should have been like, Oh, Scott. Yeah. Scott making you feel awkward. Okay. Well,

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.640
 it worked because I had to do all that whole thing. So Scott Hanselman wrote the article,

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:19.960
 Dark Matter devs, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, it's been a long time. That actually kind of

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:26.120
 started my well, this was the early early days for Adam in content. I made a blog because of that

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:34.680
 one article, Adam and more dot net. I wrote one blog post. It's so me in retrospect. It's so me.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.320
 I wrote one blog post about my home office because I had this amazing home office. It's still again,

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:44.920
 it's so me wrote one blog post. I was going to be a blogger. And then Scott Hanselman put it in his

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:50.920
 newsletter. He put a link to my blog posts. And it was the beginning. I was on a trajectory like

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:57.800
 no other and then I fell back down, did nothing to me. And yeah, dark matter dumps. I'll never

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.800
 forget that though. So when somebody says that, what is what is the concept that he wrote about?

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.800
 Oh, you really don't know? No, I've never, I don't know. I know who he is. I don't know that.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:11.880
 Do you know what dark matter is? Yeah. Well, that trick question. Nobody knows. Nobody knows what

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.200
 dark matter is. Dev. What do you know, the secrets of the universe? So dark matter. You call me Dev.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:23.800
 What? That calls you Dev. I meant that. I don't know why I would do that. I don't interact with

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.120
 Dev on the phone. So if you don't know what dark matter is, dark matter, like the whole known

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.640
 universe, everything we know, like the atoms, all the elements on the periodic table, all the stuff

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:40.360
 that makes up stars and clouds of dust and planets and all that. That's matter. Dark matter,

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.440
 there's six times more of it. We know nothing about it. We can't measure it in any way. We've

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:49.720
 never actually perceived it. We just see effects on gravity. Okay. So like, it's like scaffolding

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:54.840
 that holds up the galaxies or something. I don't know. We can see like on the outer bands of galaxies,

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.640
 the impact, why am I talking about astrophysics? How did we get into this? I don't know anything

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.400
 about astrophysics. I know more about Laravel than I know about astrophysics. I'm going to keep going.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.720
 It's not where you know more about astrophysics. I've listened to a lot of physics books.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:11.480
 So we see like the effects on like stars on the outer bands of galaxies. We see these weird effects

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.240
 on gravity that don't make sense unless there's like a lot of mass, but there's nothing. We don't

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.560
 see it. It's dark matter. That's dark matter. And the point of the blog post that Scott wrote,

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:25.000
 and apparently some of the adjacent also calls it dark matter, dark matter devs are the 99%

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.520
 of developers who aren't online. They don't have a public presence. You can't see them.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.200
 But they're out there writing code happily every day. They work at their oil and gas companies.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.600
 But they're not on Twitter. They're not making YouTube videos. That's the dark matter developers.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.680
 It's this tiny little sliver that are like active on Twitter and talk every day and think

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.920
 the JavaScript matters and all that. That's the idea. Yeah. I'm familiar with that concept because

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.720
 my dad's a software engineer and he definitely was in that category. Dark matter. He wasn't on

00:20:53.720 --> 00:21:00.840
 Twitter. Nope. And none of the technologies he's worked with even come up, but you know,

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:07.000
 they powered massive amounts of money moving around. So yeah, you never hear from them again,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.840
 because they are too busy. Yeah, they're too busy. Exactly. I think the amount of activity on social

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:20.840
 media is inversely proportionate. Am I saying words that make sense? Inversely, inversely proportionate

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:25.480
 to the amount that you're getting actually done. Does that sentence make sense?

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:32.440
 Sure. If you spend more time on social media, the more active, it's just so funny. I do like,

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:37.400
 I'm still straddling this fence of the worlds of like being a person who talks about software

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.320
 development and being someone who actually does software development. I feel like I'm straddling

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.240
 that line. Why are you looking at me like that, Dax? I feel like you've had an attitude, okay?

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:51.400
 We've got to talk about your attitude. I'm not listening to me. I was looking at your face,

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.320
 listening to you. What? I don't think you're looking at my face, but that's fine. You don't

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.640
 have a teleprompter, do you? I'm actually looking at your face. You're looking somewhere else.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.640
 So you're upset because I'm not using a teleprompter. I have a teleprompter. I'm just not using it.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.320
 Why are she using it? I just like, I can't find the right place to put it where it's kind of not

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.520
 annoying in the way. Okay, I was trying to say the word smirk and I said snark and smark. You missed

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:18.840
 it. You were talking. This is going fantastic. I was going somewhere. So I was, I'm still on the

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.160
 fence on whether I want to be someone who talks about this stuff on the internet. How are you on

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.920
 the fence? I'm on the fence. I don't know. Do I want to do this? I might just quit. One of these

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.120
 days, they actually are going to be like, where'd Adam go? And I'm just not going to show up again

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.640
 on special matter. My point of view, you're not on the fence. You're like deep in it. Deep in which

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:41.960
 side getting stuff done or deep in the way. You're saying I'm deep in the in the world of talking

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.000
 about stuff. I'm not saying that's all you do, but I'm saying, I feel like you're definitely

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.960
 committed. We're literally talking to each other on a podcast. I know anyone can have a podcast.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.040
 Anyone can just start recording their voice. I'm saying that, you know, it sounds like you

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.360
 like doing this and you're committed to doing more of it. Are you still you're like, what about that?

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.680
 Do you get the perception that like people who do all the conferences and they're all the faces

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.200
 of technology? Don't you get since they don't really do anything? Like they literally never

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:11.080
 build anything ever anymore? I don't want to be that person. Yeah. Definitely. And do you want to

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.080
 be that person? Are you at risk? I don't find I don't think I'm at risk of being that person.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:20.920
 Why? Why are you exempt? Because I don't that's not my full-time job. Like I still have to do

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:26.760
 other stuff. But like, okay, are any of those people is it their full-time job? I feel like most

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.040
 of the faces I'm talking about have actual jobs, don't they? You're talking about the

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.720
 conference people that let us go to every conference and do the job. Yeah, like the people who talk,

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:39.400
 I guess that's their job. Their job is dev rel. It's dev rel. I'm not a dev rel. So I don't

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.880
 have to worry. I'm not going to become that person. That's what you're saying to me. Yeah, I don't

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:48.680
 see you on that path at all. So I'm just going to kind of, it's like kind of weird for me to hear

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.680
 that you're worried about that. Okay. No, that's good. Good to know. Or you got the one conference

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.680
 and you're like, I've gotten to one conference. I'm going to another. I'm not even speaking. I'm

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.560
 just going to. Exactly. You're like worried and not getting stuck into this world that you're like

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:09.000
 barely, barely in. Does that make me a dark matter dev? No, dark matter dev is get stuff done.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.640
 That's the other side of it. Ouch, dax, ouch. First, you don't look at me.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.440
 You just like stare off to the side. Then you say, I don't get anything done.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:25.080
 You're just trying to make you feel awkward now. Look at that. Third, third bad thing in a row.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.520
 I'm not that one. I wasn't trying to make you feel awkward. That was just awkward.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:33.560
 Oh, okay. Should we just in the podcast? No, no, no, hang on. Let me summarize this whole thing.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:41.080
 Whatever this was, you do work and you also spend time talking about it. And that's it.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:47.000
 That's it. That's it. There's no drama here. The dark matter dev thing is just like,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.960
 they just don't do the other thing. You can do both. I'm sure you can do only one or the other,

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:57.960
 but I have a bunch of work I need to get done. And anything I talk about is from a conclusion

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.480
 because I was doing a bunch of work. You don't think it's like a slippery slope that people think

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.320
 this, they have good intentions, and then they end up just talking at all the conferences and

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:11.240
 never working again? Yeah, I think so. But I think, I definitely rebalance my life

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:17.480
 compared to where I was a while ago, but there's also less for me to do and improve on the just

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:22.920
 doing work side. I've just gotten good enough where like, if I spent all my time doing that,

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:27.080
 I'm like improving, I don't know, like 1% every month or whatever. But then on this side of

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.120
 things, like communicating ideas and all that, like I feel like I can improve 20% a month if I do it.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:37.400
 So yeah, for me, it's just like, I need something, I needed something new to work on and get better

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:42.280
 at. So this was that thing. Are you taking suggestions? Because a teleprompter would be one. If you

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.200
 would go and set that up, I think that's 20%. You could knock off this month, just immediately.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:55.800
 You're just trying to make it awkward. You're just stopping talking on purpose. Yeah, I guess

00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:01.720
 your perception of getting better, just buying a thing. It's true at your approach. Most of

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.680
 everything I feel like I've gotten better at was just more money I spent. It's true. Let's go get

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:11.000
 some work done. What do you say? Okay. Maybe. See you. All right, see you next.
