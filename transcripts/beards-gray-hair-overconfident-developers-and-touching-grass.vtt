WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 - That'd be quite an accomplishment to get to the point

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.700
 where I could be stabbed in the back.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.580
 Yeah, you're right.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.420
 - Yeah, it's true.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.920
 - I probably will if we got there.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.040
 - Okay, well that's good to know.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.700
 At least you're telling me upfront, you know?

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.900
 Won't be such a surprise.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.480
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.740
 (dramatic music)

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.200
 I did trim my beard.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.360
 So my beard was the longest it's ever been

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.640
 up until a couple of days ago.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.800
 And I started, I wanted to do like a light trim.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.120
 I just wanted to clean it up a little bit,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.560
 but I never tried to trim a beard that long.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.600
 And I just didn't know what I was doing,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.880
 so I just went really short.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.080
 And I actually really hate it.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.240
 Like now the contrast is so drastic.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.080
 'Cause like you're posting,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.380
 Adam's posting all those clips from the podcast

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.720
 with like my beautiful beard.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.120
 - Oh, it is shorter, yeah.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.340
 - Yeah, and I'm like, you know what?

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.440
 I like that other look.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.480
 So it'll be back there soon enough.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.320
 - How do you know it was the longest it's ever been?

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.280
 That's what I wanna know.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.440
 Did you measure it?

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.400
 Did you get a little tiny ruler

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.160
 and like pull out some hair?

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.800
 - No, there's just stuff that I could do

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.920
 that I just know I couldn't do before.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.640
 Like sometimes I pull it and it would be like insanely long.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.320
 And I was like, I don't think I could like touch

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.900
 the bottom of my beard to like my chest or something.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.400
 (laughing)

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.600
 - I posted a picture of the longest my beard

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.400
 has ever been on Twitter, maybe a few weeks ago.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.520
 - Yeah, but that picture is very distracting

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.680
 'cause there's a lot going on.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.800
 - There's a lot going on.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.240
 - Yeah, you look weird.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.520
 - Like the hair is kind of creepy.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.480
 - I was overweight.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.680
 I actually, each time my wife has been pregnant,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.760
 I have gained like as much weight as her.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.600
 - Literally.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.880
 (laughing)

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.280
 - I have a sympathy, like what?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.060
 - Well, no, like she, so she gets super sick.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.280
 Like doesn't get out of bed for months.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.160
 And it's not like, oh, morning sickness,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.000
 first trimester.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.280
 No, it's the entire like, well, like seven months

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.120
 out of the nine.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.800
 Like the last couple months, it gets a little better.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.600
 But she is just completely bedridden,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.320
 deathly ill, can't keep anything down.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.920
 We've had to take her to the hospital every time,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.960
 twice the last time with Archer.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.160
 'Cause she gets so dehydrated, she can't keep water down.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.360
 Like water makes her nauseous, nauseous, nauseated,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.760
 nauseous, which one is it?

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.600
 - I don't know.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.440
 - I don't know.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.280
 - Okay.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.120
 - And that's my second language.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.960
 - She gets super sick.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.800
 - It's not, wait, is it?

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.240
 - It really is, it's true, it is.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.800
 - What's your first language?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.680
 - Well, I was born in India.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.440
 So I spoke, it's a language called Tamil.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.520
 - You speak it?

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.920
 You can speak another language in your--

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.760
 - Not anymore.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.680
 I lost it when I was a, when I was a,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.800
 I can still understand it perfectly, but when I was young.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.640
 - That's amazing.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.600
 Okay, sorry, that was a total.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.440
 - Sorry, I don't know what did you have to go on.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.280
 - No, no, no, you're good.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.480
 That's a really cool fact that you knew how to speak

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.440
 another language.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.880
 So she gets really sick, she doesn't make food

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.840
 anymore, I go get us food.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.440
 And the only thing that ever sounds good to her is like,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.240
 I say, like it's ever gonna happen again,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.860
 it's never gonna happen again.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.320
 Back then, when she would get pregnant,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.280
 the only thing that would sound good to her

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.440
 would be like flaky biscuits.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.600
 Or like, so we eat that for like three weeks,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.200
 and that's all we would eat.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.080
 Like I would get other stuff,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.000
 but I would just be grabbing like frozen meals,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.480
 just whatever I could possibly find.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.760
 Yeah, I just eat terrible.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.600
 I don't know.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.400
 - Flaky biscuits, but you guys are vegan.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400
 Do you eat biscuits without butter?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.040
 - Oh, there's plenty of flaky biscuits.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.240
 Listen, you can eat a lot of terrible things

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.440
 that are vegan. - No, no, no, I know that,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.440
 but I just can't imagine biscuits being good

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.680
 without like a ton of butter in it.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.480
 - Oh, we got vegan butter in the fridge right now.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.800
 We don't go without butter.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.480
 I'm just like, we eat just as bad as everyone else.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.480
 - You know what I mean.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.720
 - I know what you mean.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.480
 I know, I just can't take you seriously now

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.640
 'cause your beard is so short.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.480
 - I know, I can't take myself seriously.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.640
 Just a lot of like the, I think a lot of the wisdom vibe

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.240
 was in the beard. - Oh, yeah.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.360
 It was in your hair, man.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.600
 It wasn't just the vibe, the actual wisdom

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.880
 was probably in your beard. - The actual wisdom.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.000
 - Yeah, a little cut it off.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Yeah. - Well, it'll be back.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.080
 Give me another three weeks.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.760
 - I almost trimmed mine last night.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.280
 Mine does not grow that fast, but it's definitely,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.920
 the longer it gets, the greater it gets.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.920
 So I have to trim it to keep it from.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.840
 - You don't like the gray.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.240
 - So I don't like it.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.360
 It's just, it's a reminder of mortality.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.920
 It's not like I care about the appearance of it.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.840
 I don't care.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.040
 But, I mean, look at my hair.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.360
 Do you think I care about anything in terms of my appearance?

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.040
 It's more just like, I'm getting gray.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.560
 I'm getting old than I think about death

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.600
 than I think about all the things.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.920
 I'm gonna not be with my kids soon.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.040
 Like they're gonna move out of the house.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.880
 All that stuff.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.720
 It's just, it's awful.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.360
 - Okay, I get why you trim it.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.960
 It's not that dramatic.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.800
 - I don't wanna be reminded.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.960
 - I haven't associated gray hair with age because,

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.960
 so one, so Liz has this gray streak that goes through her hair.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.920
 Like some people like dye their hair to make it look that way,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.120
 but she just randomly has it.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.680
 And she's had it since she was in high school.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.840
 It's like a genetic thing.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.400
 And it's funny.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.080
 So her family, part of her family is from Spain.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.000
 And when she goes back to the part of Spain where they're from,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.840
 she actually sees a bunch of other people with it.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.760
 And apparently it's like some quirk of the people

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.160
 that are from there have that gray streak.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.800
 So I don't really associate that with age.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.000
 I just think I just look at it like previously.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.720
 And I actually, I actually like the mixed,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.200
 a little bit of gray in the black.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.720
 - I knew a guy that was like full gray head of hair

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.480
 in mid 30s, like really early.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.320
 I don't know.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.240
 I don't know if it was just in his family.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.080
 I don't know.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.920
 I never asked him.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.000
 If you've seen the age filter, sorry,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.320
 before we get off the age thing,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.320
 have you seen the thing on TikTok that makes you look old

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.800
 and it's so realistic?

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.080
 - I've done the face app thing a bunch of times,

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.600
 which I love 'cause it's so funny.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.520
 - Face app.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.360
 - I don't know.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.200
 It's probably the same thing.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.120
 It's another app called Face App to get a picture of yourself

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.760
 and then it shows you like when you're old.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.120
 - Yeah, this is like a video though.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.480
 It's like real time.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.880
 - And you can like touch your face and it doesn't mess it up.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.560
 Have you seen face filters these days?

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.960
 They're so incredible.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.800
 - I know.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.640
 - It's nuts.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.480
 I don't even know how they're doing it.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.840
 Like the amount of the occlusion or whatever is what,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.240
 it's like a hard problem.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.080
 - Yeah.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.200
 - AR is like when something moves in front of it,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.280
 the illusion is broken when the thing is on top.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.440
 They do it perfectly.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.680
 Like it just, you can't,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.960
 I don't know how they're doing it.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.200
 - It's incredible.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.880
 I guess AI, I don't know.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.680
 - Yeah, I think, 'cause I think I saw something,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.520
 maybe like six months ago,

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.520
 I almost freaking out over some filter

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.320
 and it reached a level where even me just like being in tech,

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.520
 I think I can usually like tell when something is edited,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.960
 but I can barely, maybe not at all even tell.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.040
 So I think it reached a point of like,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.240
 basically being discernible unless you're maybe like a professional.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.480
 - Yep.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.320
 - Yeah, stuff is crap.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.160
 I want to try the age one.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.000
 I love the age one.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.840
 - You should do the age one.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.680
 I want to know what you look like.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.480
 - We should maybe, let's make it a Twitter thing.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.440
 Well, we'll oppose.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.560
 - Oh yes, I will say,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.800
 I will say that it doesn't do anything with my beard.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.400
 Like it just doesn't even try.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.240
 - Oh really?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.800
 - So it kind of breaks the illusion of my hair is gray,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.120
 but my beard is just partially gray.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.960
 So I don't know.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.800
 - I have some pictures from Faceab that I'll send you.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.160
 It looks incredibly accurate.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.240
 I think it's easy for me,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.680
 'cause I like roughly look like an old man already,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.760
 just like using a few more wrinkles and make my beard gray.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.920
 It's like pretty simple.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.800
 And I'm pretty sure it's 100% accurate.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.600
 I think that's literally what I'm going to look like.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.600
 I'm super into it.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.200
 I'm really like what I look like as an old man.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.400
 Liz is also really into it.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.440
 - Oh, nice.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.280
 - That's what matters.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.120
 - You already got that going.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.960
 Yeah.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.080
 I feel like it's a science at this point.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.800
 They know how people age and what your face will do.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.640
 It's not like an idea of what you might look like.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.200
 It is what you'll look like.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.040
 Pretty incredible.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.320
 - There's also the other filter on the same Faceab

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.880
 that renders you as the opposite gender, but opposite sex.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.880
 So Liz has a funny thing where she finds the male version

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.080
 of her super attractive.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.840
 She's like really into it, really into it, really into it.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.040
 - That is awesome.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.840
 - And it is a good looking man.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.360
 Like, you know, I have to admit, it's a good looking guy.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.880
 What's more awkward though is Alan,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.200
 when he does it, he is very attractive as a woman.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.160
 So that's like kind of weird also.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.800
 - Yeah, that gives you kind of weird feelings like.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.280
 - Yeah, it doesn't work on me at all

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.600
 'cause there's no idea what to do with the beard.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.400
 It just like rewrites my whole face

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.760
 and doesn't look anything like me.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.720
 - Maybe you could get a super realistic filter

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.400
 that makes your beard lying again.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.240
 So I could look at you in the face

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.080
 and enjoy this conversation.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.040
 You just look like a different person, Dax.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:20.880
 It's my kids.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.520
 Whenever I like cut my hair, my kids, they hate it.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.160
 Like Aysa will cry, like you just look different

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.080
 when you're used to seeing somebody all the time

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.300
 and then they look different all of a sudden.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.960
 - I mean, I can't even handle it looking at myself.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.200
 I'm like, I feel less trustworthy.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.040
 I literally look at myself.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.720
 I'm like, that's like a less trustworthy person.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.320
 - Which you don't need that in your life.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.040
 You don't need to look less trustworthy.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.120
 I already think you're, I don't know.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.960
 - I know.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.120
 - I think you're not trustworthy, but yeah, shifty.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.360
 Just like your demeanor on Twitter, you know?

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.960
 You've kind of got that thing going on.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.600
 Might stab somebody in the back at any moment.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.440
 Oh no.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.960
 Are you gonna stab me in the back?

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.800
 (laughs)

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.440
 - Well, I mean, if we're at the point

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.440
 where I'm stabbing in the back,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.240
 that means we've like really made it.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.160
 - Oh, that's true.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.000
 Yeah.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.840
 - It has to be really worth it.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.280
 - That'd be quite an accomplishment

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.200
 to get to the point where I could be stabbed in the back.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.040
 Yeah, you're right.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.880
 - Yeah, it's true.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.240
 I probably will if we get there.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.320
 - Okay, well that's good to know.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.000
 At least you're telling me upfront, you know?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.120
 Won't be such a surprise.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.080
 Can I go on a quick rant about prompt engineering?

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.000
 - Yes, yes, yes.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.320
 - Okay, I just saw something this morning.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.160
 There's like a whole podcast and whole like newsletters

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.080
 about prompt engineering and I just wanna throw up.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.960
 If you're taking a course or trying to learn

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.400
 how to do prompt engineering,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.480
 let me just tell you, it's a complete waste of time.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.320
 Please don't spend another second.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.200
 It's such an like intermediate step.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.920
 And I don't know what the final form is gonna be,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.120
 but it's not gonna be memorizing like whatever

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.560
 you put at the end, hyper realistic,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.040
 photos, whatever, like 16 by 16, all that stuff's garbage.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.160
 It's such a waste of time.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.000
 I just think it's so stupid.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 It's like trying to learn, this is what I imagine.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.360
 Like I'm gonna predict the market value of NFTs.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.840
 Like I'm gonna invest a year in my life

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.800
 trying to understand NFT pricing.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.440
 Like that's what prompt engineering feels like to me.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.280
 It's just a waste of time.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.920
 Please, do you think there's like a thing

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.280
 where we're gonna all get good at prompt engineering?

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.940
 Is that like actually a thing?

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.440
 - The stuff you're seeing, is this specifically

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.280
 for images or is it for everything?

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.240
 - I don't know.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.920
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.800
 I mean, either way.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.560
 Yeah, to me, I also think it's dumb.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.560
 It's like taking a course on how to Google,

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.800
 which I'm sure can help you, but just do it more.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.600
 And that's probably the best way to learn it.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.480
 - But do you think like you could develop the skill?

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.160
 Do you think it's like a thing that is gonna stay like this?

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.680
 We're gonna be like riding these super esoteric prompts

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.760
 into these models and getting good feedback?

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.760
 - Maybe, I don't know.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.560
 I think for images, I can, yeah, I have no idea.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.000
 'Cause the super esoteric prompt is more an image thing.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.800
 'Cause that's when I look at like the mid journey page

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.960
 and you see all the really crazy images

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.000
 and you see what they actually put in.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.760
 Like it is like a lot of detail.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.280
 And that detail usually comes from knowledge of like cameras

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.680
 and like certain lighting terms.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.320
 And it's things that you like need to know

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.520
 about that you can't just randomly put those works together

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.200
 or not know what they mean.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.920
 So yeah, I don't think it's like the little prompt thing.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.040
 It's like understanding that this type of camera typically

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.200
 gives you this type of image.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.600
 It makes sense in this context, you know?

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.800
 - But the LLMs you're saying, it's not as obtuse looking,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.360
 like it's normal language.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.880
 - Yeah, the LLMs is just, I think it's definitely a skill

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.560
 you can develop when you get better at talking back

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.400
 and forth to it.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.760
 - Yeah, it's stupid to take a course in it.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.480
 It's more like just realizing there are certain situations

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.880
 that can help you with that you maybe didn't realize before.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.000
 It's just so like natural.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.320
 Like once you know it's there and you start using

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.160
 you're gonna get better at it.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.640
 I don't understand how prompt engineering is like a course

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.880
 or like, I thought it was a joke.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.880
 I thought when people were talking about prompt engineering.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.800
 - No, I think it's serious.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.400
 I think there's a whole like cottage industry

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.360
 sprouting up over prompt engineering.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.600
 It just sounds so silly to me.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.560
 Like it's like the same people who are like,

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.040
 look, all the cool images I created in mid-journey.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:05.960
 Like I'm an artist now.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.000
 No, you're not, you're an asshole with the GPU.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.840
 You know what I'm saying?

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.840
 Like, you're not, you're not an artist

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.560
 just because you can type stuff in a mid-journey.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.000
 It's just so dumb.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.800
 And the prompt engineering thing, you're not an engineer

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.320
 because you learned how to gimmick these AI models.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.320
 I just think it's stupid.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.000
 - I, well, the fundamental thing is,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.880
 I just don't think this has been long enough for,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.240
 it's been around for long enough

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.680
 for anyone to teach me anything, you know?

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.480
 Like how could you have developed expertise in it?

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.320
 - Like what have you learned in six months of, yeah.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.160
 So, I default to feeling that's probably a scam.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.480
 It's, I can't believe people point to your sources already.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.280
 - I guess I just feel like the interfaces

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.400
 to these models should be just meeting us

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.880
 where we are, natural language.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.760
 Like, if they're not, then it feels like

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.880
 it's an intermediate step.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.240
 If you're having to type out these weird,

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.080
 they're not even sentences,

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.800
 specifically with the image generation stuff.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.080
 It's just little chunks of phrases that all,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.280
 like if you string these together,

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.760
 you get this kind of output.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.280
 I feel like that's just some intermediate step.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.960
 And it's eventually gonna get better.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.120
 And it'll just speak to it like a person

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.400
 if it's gonna work at all.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.240
 I don't know.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.680
 - The thing I keep going back to is there's all this other

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.360
 contextual information that you still need.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.320
 So, the other day I was trying to figure out,

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.240
 oh, how do I do like pixel art type stuff?

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.080
 - Yeah.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.920
 - Same.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.760
 - I've been playing with that.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.600
 - Yeah.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.880
 I'm sure you can, maybe you can run the same article

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.360
 where from my point of view, I was like,

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.840
 oh yeah, I just want pixel art.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.560
 But there's actually like crazy variation of styles

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.400
 of pixel art.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.160
 And someone compiled years like some really great sources

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.160
 that to draw inspiration from like the old

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.800
 Castlevania game or like different games.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.680
 And I was like, oh, yeah, that does give me better results.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.280
 I wouldn't have been able to come up with that

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.560
 'cause I just don't have the knowledge of that.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.640
 It's funny though, because, you know,

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.120
 people always make fun of art history degrees

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.360
 'cause they are like, what are you gonna do with that?

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.560
 But now having like an encyclopedic knowledge

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.280
 of different art styles, that probably it's very useful.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.400
 And you can probably leverage that in a very interesting way.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.000
 - Yeah, 'cause I mean, these things are really good

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.840
 at like style transfer from known artists.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.080
 If you know all of that art history, interesting.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.560
 It's like the most qualified people in the world

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.800
 to be using mid-journey.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.640
 - Yeah.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.720
 - Are those people that we all made fun of?

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.400
 I got their art history degrees.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.360
 - That is funny.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.720
 - Can you talk about some of your like spicy Twitter polls?

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.800
 You've been, they're very condescending.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.640
 I don't know if you know this,

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.400
 but you put a triple out there.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.760
 And everybody knows the gag now.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.840
 Like we know we're not supposed to say yes,

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.360
 but maybe we feel like yes.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.560
 - Dude, do you know?

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.560
 No, it he knows.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.960
 Okay, for context, I've been putting polls out there

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.360
 involving people self-assessing some abilities,

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.320
 some skillset, like where they feel confident.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.840
 And I put one out yesterday that was,

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.600
 you have all the skills and knowledge

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.040
 to take something from literally zero

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.600
 to in-produce production with a significant amount of usage.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.600
 And I think so far the results are like 60%, yes, 40%.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.440
 No.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.600
 The reason I do these polls is because

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.640
 I have a certain perspective

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.960
 or I've experienced something

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.480
 and I'm curious to see if I poll for it, does that line up?

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.680
 And with this specific one,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.680
 I was really thinking about when I was at a previous company.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.680
 And this was, so most of my career has been,

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.600
 like I said before, a founder or like first employee

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.600
 like very early, but I did spend some time

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.720
 at a larger company, it's still a startup,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.440
 but they were like in the hypergrowth phase

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.960
 and it's been a lot of time hiring.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.920
 And I remember in the hiring process

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.680
 and also just how the company was structured,

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.040
 we had a lot of really great engineers

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.280
 that could build a lot of the features.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.960
 You know, the code was great.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.560
 You know, they thought about things right.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.840
 But almost known that the company

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.040
 could actually deliver the whole thing

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.560
 from like the beginning to actually deploying it

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.320
 to dealing with problems that come up

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.200
 and the entire company was structured, in fact,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.680
 make sure that not only you didn't have to do that,

00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.520
 'cause there's always somebody else

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.960
 that would handle some other thing,

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.640
 but there's also no incentive to be good at that.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.800
 So even if you're someone that was good at everything,

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.440
 yeah, you actually didn't even gain from being able to do that.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.800
 I think I kind of gained a little bit

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.760
 because because I had that,

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.400
 I was able to be in like a director role

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.920
 'cause I was able to talk to the other departments

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.640
 in a way that like they knew I wasn't an idiot.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.480
 So, you know, things things moved in a smoother way.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.000
 But beyond that, there was almost no incentive

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.760
 to go beyond your narrow scope.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.800
 And I think that this is how most companies,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.760
 if not whole companies are structured.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.280
 So I put that poll out there.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.320
 And yeah, I think most people think that they could do it all,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.080
 but I am very skeptical about that

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.360
 'cause in the hiring process in that situation,

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.680
 I think I would say less than 10% of people

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.000
 I interviewed or brought to the team

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.840
 could really do all that,

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.040
 specifically because most environments don't force you to

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.000
 and most environments don't even benefit from

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.400
 if you can do all portions of that.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.840
 - Like would most people, would you say most people

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.000
 spend their whole career just working at a place

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.480
 where they're just sort of a small piece

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.920
 of a bigger organization and they don't have the skills

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.440
 to kind of go across the whole stack?

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.400
 Is that probably most engineers?

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.640
 - I think so 'cause, you know, by definition,

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.800
 most jobs are at the biggest companies

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.560
 and the biggest companies are structured this way.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.160
 Yeah, so in my experience, I don't think so,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.080
 but then it leads to a more interesting question is,

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.960
 what is the perception that people have

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.120
 that leads them to say, yes,

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.960
 it must be a much narrower definition

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.080
 where they might not even be aware

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.080
 that something else is being handled for them,

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.400
 that they're not thinking about, you don't even know

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.440
 what you don't know type of thing.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.120
 - So my thought with that question was,

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.040
 is it really just, are you able to ship something?

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.920
 Like if you can just build a side project by yourself,

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.120
 get it deployed and have people using it,

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.360
 isn't that really like most of it?

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.040
 'Cause I feel like the scale thing,

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.600
 yeah, there's like starting with a good architecture

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.400
 that's gonna be able to like ease a lot of pain,

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.640
 but isn't it scale mostly just like as it grows,

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.880
 you're always figuring it out and always making,

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.920
 you know, like making leaps and figuring out

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.360
 how to handle the new loads.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.080
 I feel like it's not one set of skills.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.120
 It's like, I know how to scale a thing.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.360
 It's like you learn it as an organization

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.520
 or as a small startup all along the way as you reach scale.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.120
 - Yeah, but if you've done that once,

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.680
 then the next time you do it,

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.920
 it looks pretty different, right?

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.400
 Like you're not really learning as you go.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.240
 - Yeah.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.840
 - You've seen it, but well, I've never done it twice.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.680
 Yeah, I guess I've never heard of it.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.160
 - But I'm saying if you, at this point,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.240
 if you were to do it,

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.080
 you probably start off in a different place

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.280
 and like really, like your ceiling is much, much higher.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.600
 But the thing I was also thinking about was,

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.520
 I'm gonna post this later.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.880
 I just didn't figure out how to say correctly.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.600
 So we're working on this logs thing

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.320
 and I post that screenshot with a video

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.480
 with a ton of logs flying by on a screen, right?

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.040
 And it's like rendering smoothly, et cetera.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:59.040
 So that feature that we built will scale to just one user,

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.160
 to thousands of users, to probably like million plus users.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.640
 Like we probably can, we realistically can probably do that.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.840
 Fingers crossed and there might be stuff

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.680
 that we haven't thought of.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.400
 But generally, like we're not really in for a crazy surprise.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.160
 But to have done that,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.200
 there's a few things that need to be in place.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.200
 The first thing wasn't technical.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.160
 The first thing isn't entirely a business model thing.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.400
 We decided on a certain business model

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.720
 that enables that type of scaling.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.360
 Then there's a technical thing.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.440
 Then there's a bunch of product trade-offs.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.800
 So if you're not in a situation

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.080
 where you're able to like significantly influence

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.080
 all three of these things,

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.040
 I actually don't know how you can scale stuff

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.040
 because in that situation,

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.680
 like it required us to really think

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.840
 about all three of those things in combination

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.960
 to build something that worked.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.800
 And the other thing is,

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.240
 if you look at a lot of the replies,

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.560
 and this is what I was saying was proof of my point,

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.080
 which is people were asking like,

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.720
 oh, how many users do you consider a lot of scale?

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.440
 Or how many users do you consider a lot of usage,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.720
 whatever it is?

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.320
 But in my experience,

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.760
 some of the hard scaling problems were on products

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.360
 that were used by like a dozen people.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.280
 Not because we had a ton of users,

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.800
 but because the actual thing we were building required

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.000
 on the incredibly complex,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.800
 like looking across billions of records of data,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.840
 or I worked at a place that maybe had a few hundred users,

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.000
 but there were IoT devices that were sending like,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.200
 you know, data points every,

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.720
 like so data points every second.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.760
 So that's kind of what I'm talking about,

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.200
 where I think people that have had the experience

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.040
 know what I'm talking about,

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.240
 like they wouldn't really need me to say like,

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.160
 oh, it's when you have a million users,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.520
 'cause it doesn't depends on what you're doing.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.200
 So yeah, there's like all kinds of scale.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.000
 But generally you know you've been through it once,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.600
 you know like, okay,

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.360
 I know what it's like to not foresee something

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.240
 and run into a problem and then rework it

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.320
 while stuff is growing, you know?

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.160
 Yeah.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.880
 And I don't think the majority of people in a situation

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.080
 that exposes them to every portion of what's required.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.800
 So how many people do you think,

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.720
 what percentage should that have been in your opinion?

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.160
 'Cause I know you're always looking for a discrepancy.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.320
 Yeah.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.760
 I think on Twitter and like in the Twitter bubble,

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.720
 I would probably guess like 10%.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.160
 And I would say if you like literally pulled

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.720
 every developer is probably way smaller than that even.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.800
 Well, I'd say a lot of that 60% is the Americans

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.720
 in your bubble 'cause we're over confident.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.840
 We just, we're pretty sure we can do whatever you ask.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.520
 Like, sure, I could do that.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.360
 Scale it, build the whole thing, got it.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.720
 Is that an American trait, the confidence?

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.560
 You think so?

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.400
 Oh, for sure.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.160
 We like export confidence, don't we?

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.200
 That's awesome.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.520
 I think that's a thing.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.280
 I'm pretty sure I didn't make that up.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.800
 I'm pretty sure that's, there was like a big poll.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.280
 There was like a big, this was a study or something.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.520
 I'm gonna say study 'cause it sounds way more official.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.000
 There was like a study and the Americans,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.480
 like the percentage of Americans who said

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.300
 they were good at something.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.040
 I can't, oh man, I have nothing to go on here.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.000
 I just know that America leads the way in overconfidence

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.360
 basically worldwide.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.480
 You could say that you're over confident

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.360
 in your statement right now,

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.960
 given that you don't even remember the study.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.280
 I am an American.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.400
 So there's proof right there.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.960
 Yeah, look it up, somebody look it up.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.320
 Yeah, and to me it's like not even,

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.560
 yeah, I guess there, yeah.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.640
 It's not even overconfidence, it's just like unawareness.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.640
 But I guess that's what overconfidence maybe is.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.320
 No awareness that there's more.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.160
 Is it?

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.280
 Wait, what?

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.440
 Awareness that there's more?

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.960
 Unawareness that there's more.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.720
 Oh, unawareness that there's more.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.840
 Yeah, okay.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.320
 Like oversimplification.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.360
 The other tweet that I haven't posted exactly,

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.680
 I haven't forgot the right words for it is,

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.360
 I want to say something, just kind of in my usual theme.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.360
 Everyone's always telling me,

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.280
 or everyone's always posting about,

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.440
 here's the best way to build stuff.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.680
 And my question is, where the hell is all the stuff?

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.040
 There's so much stuff that I need,

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.120
 and everyone's always talking about,

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.600
 here's the best way to build it.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.440
 Where is it?

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.800
 Like, what is it, what's everyone doing all day?

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.360
 Like, there's so many things I need, but it's not there.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.960
 But you're always telling me, here's how you build it.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.160
 Like how many, yeah, we talk about this linear,

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.960
 you know, how many good sites,

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.400
 how many good apps are there on the web?

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.640
 And like, all this discourse around trade-offs with frameworks,

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.800
 and this one's so good,

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.680
 and this one is making all these moves,

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.360
 and you know, like we're advancing the field,

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.360
 by leaps and bounds, and the web is a disaster.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.720
 So like, who's using them to good effect?

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.200
 Is just nobody good at using them?

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.040
 Is that the problem?

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.600
 Are we making great tools?

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.320
 And we're all just about to dumb cavemen,

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.480
 we don't know how to build anything?

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.320
 Is that the problem?

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.160
 'Cause last I checked, most every site I have to go to,

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.840
 for some reason, is terrible.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.680
 Yeah.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.720
 The big ones. Yup, yup, even the big ones.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.040
 There's like, most software is really bad.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.320
 I want everyone that's posting myself,

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.320
 what do you guys work on?

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.640
 Show me your actual product that you work on.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.640
 I bet it sucks.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.120
 I bet it's not good.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:46.960
 So what's the deal?

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.200
 We just all just like dream up the best case scenario

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.000
 when we look at tools or languages or frameworks.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.720
 Like what something could be?

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.280
 Yeah, I think we just, we forget that no matter the tool,

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.080
 making something really, really good

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.520
 takes a lot, a lot of effort.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.360
 Yeah, I'm excited for you to talk to the linear guy.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.840
 Yeah, that's exciting.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.760
 Your tool, the way I always see is your tool

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.280
 doesn't make it easier to ship the same thing.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.080
 It really just increases the bar

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.520
 on what you should be shooting for.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.760
 'Cause if it makes certain things easier,

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.600
 you shouldn't just be like,

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.920
 "Okay, we're gonna do the same thing in the same way,

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.720
 but now it just has to work."

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.360
 No, you should like do something even harder now.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.160
 Yeah.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.520
 And so simultaneously, so one, I think most software

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.800
 is terrible and we will experience that.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.720
 Like most of what we use is like kind of annoying

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.240
 because it's hard to build a company that built something good.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.800
 Like that is just very hard.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.640
 Yeah.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.480
 I also don't agree with this sentiment of like,

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.720
 "Oh, software used to be so much better and faster now.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.040
 It's all blurred and shitty."

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.120
 No.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.920
 I think people forget like what an incredible bar

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.000
 that we're at, that's just expected.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.920
 Like you deploy something in every personal,

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.800
 the computer or phone in the world can use it.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.840
 Like that just was not even a thing

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.520
 that was remotely an option, even just 10 years ago.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.800
 Where were all the designers?

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.680
 I'm just thinking back to like the early web,

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.080
 like all those GeoCity sites

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.840
 with all the just disaster of like aesthetic.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.760
 Where were the designers like never touched digital stuff?

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.920
 So they were just like, they were busy designing,

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.760
 I don't know, architecture or just painting or something.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.240
 I don't know, what were they doing?

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.520
 Like, why weren't like those first sites,

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.160
 why wasn't there a few like really good looking early websites?

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.880
 Why did they all look so terrible?

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.720
 I think the knowledges didn't exist.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.120
 We had to learn, even people in the field

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.960
 had to learn what is good and what is bad.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.560
 And I don't think this stuff,

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.640
 so people talk about it as like,

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.360
 oh, it's just like a trend like this is an aesthetic.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.000
 Like sometimes this is good, sometimes that's good.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.840
 I don't think that's true.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.080
 I think things generally like get better over time,

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.880
 even stuff that is aesthetic.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.720
 Same.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.120
 Yeah, so I think just know that the knowledges

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.960
 didn't exist period.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.880
 And I would guess like just a number of people

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.480
 were just way smaller.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.280
 And so the knowledge transferring between people

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.120
 was also just way smaller.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.400
 I imagine there was probably some early site

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.640
 that looked good.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.840
 I don't know.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.840
 I don't think so.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.840
 No, no, there's not.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.800
 No, zero, they're all painting.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.880
 They were just, they're busy.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.960
 You should do a poll.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.160
 How many, no, there's no way to twist that

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.360
 into one of your polls.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.720
 (laughing)

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.720
 Did you see the J Larky like history of the web thread

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.280
 on Twitter yesterday?

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.320
 I saw, I didn't read it 'cause it was too long,

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.760
 but I was gonna go back and look at it later.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.960
 It was really long.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.120
 Yeah, I probably read like the first five or six,

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.640
 but really interesting stuff took me way back.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.480
 I don't know.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.280
 Were you doing stuff on the web in the early days?

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.440
 Yeah, I was saying, I was when I joined--

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.760
 What are you, 30?

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.600
 Sorry.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.440
 31.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.280
 31.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.120
 I'm just kidding.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:39.960
 I'm like five or something.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.400
 (laughing)

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.160
 Yeah, I think, I definitely was.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.640
 I remember I was telling, I was telling Prime the other day,

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.240
 the, I remember making a website on Microsoft front page

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.040
 about bald eagles 'cause I love bald eagles.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.960
 I bet it looked awful, didn't it?

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.240
 Zero good looking website.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.080
 I think it did.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.880
 Oh, I want proof.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.240
 If you really think you made a good looking website,

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.600
 like in the 90s, I need proof.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.120
 Well, you were probably born in the 90s.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.560
 You were born in the 90s.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.720
 Yeah, I was.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.560
 Good.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.400
 How do I know that?

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.240
 I knew that from something.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.680
 I just recently saw the year you were born.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.760
 Why did I see that?

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.720
 I'm a 90s kid.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.560
 That's not important.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.400
 That's not important.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.240
 That's so wild.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.080
 Yeah, of course.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:21.920
 That's so crazy.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.760
 I'm a millennial.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.880
 Are you a millennial?

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.960
 Are you Gen Z?

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.800
 No.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.880
 (laughing)

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.720
 I can't see you.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.560
 What?

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.560
 (laughing)

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.400
 I'm definitely at the,

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.280
 towards the end of millennial.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.840
 But you know that all the TV shows and stuff

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.280
 are about 80s kids now 'cause I think

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.920
 you're like the market, technically?

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.760
 Yeah, I think we are.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.800
 Like everything is like 80s things.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.640
 I'm the market.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.480
 You're not the market.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.320
 You're a 90s kid.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.160
 I'll just wait five years.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.000
 That's wild.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:47.840
 I'm gonna be the market.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.280
 (laughing)

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.960
 And after that, no one's gonna care about either of us.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.800
 Yeah, true.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.640
 We'll be irrelevant.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.040
 Ooh, we've just got like 10 years left of relevancy

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.040
 if this is relevancy.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.280
 I'm not sure if it is, but.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.800
 It's crazy 'cause then you still have half your life left.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.640
 I know.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.480
 And what do you do?

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.080
 You just play shuffleboard and like, I don't know.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.240
 Someone said this to me.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.440
 You could spend like half your life as an old person,

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.480
 which is kind of crazy.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.320
 That is wild.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.880
 Like you think of, I mean, assuming, well,

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.080
 that's given people a lot of credit

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.720
 that they're gonna live to be a hundred.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.520
 But if you think like 50, you're pretty old

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.640
 and that's halfway if you live to be a hundred.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.720
 Yeah, it's like half-ish.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.240
 Isn't like the life expectancy?

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.280
 I don't know, isn't like 70 or something.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.960
 So we are at the halfway point now.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.800
 I don't know, 'cause you know what,

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.880
 with averages like they probably don't apply

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.320
 to you personally, especially in America.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.760
 And better or worse?

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.640
 I bet the life expectancy is lower

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.840
 than what we would, what doctor would tell us

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.600
 for ourselves individually.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.440
 Okay.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.280
 Just given like.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.160
 And why is that, Dax?

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.080
 Let's break that down.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.500
 Why do you think we'll live longer than other people?

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.380
 Is this about class?

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.040
 Is this about money?

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:50.880
 I was just gonna say.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.080
 What are you insinuating?

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.560
 I'm just kidding. (laughs)

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.600
 People B.O.B's, you know?

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.000
 Yeah, yeah, so heart disease.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.780
 Like, I don't think I'm gonna die of heart disease.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.760
 I don't ingest any cholesterol, any animal,

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.800
 any animal, anything.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.720
 So I think I can cut that one out.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.940
 Can you cut that one out, Dax?

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.400
 Do you think you could die of heart disease?

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.880
 I don't think I have heart disease.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.840
 I'm very unlikely.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.480
 Even though I eat a lot of-

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.120
 I mean, you're just describing to the fake news

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.840
 about cholesterol, so that's the whole different thing.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.920
 Wait a minute.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.480
 That's not fake.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.800
 You're telling me that eating, wait, wait, wait,

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.000
 what's your, make your claim?

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.080
 I'm not gonna put words in your mouth.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.640
 So typically high cholesterol has always been like a thing

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.080
 that is, oh, like be careful with high cholesterol.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.600
 But it's always been kind of complicated

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.080
 'cause not necessarily just high cholesterol.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.800
 It's like high cholesterol can be fine

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.600
 if your ratios are okay.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.040
 But then beyond that, I don't think we really know much

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.280
 about anything with cholesterol correlating with much.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.920
 A lot of the research has been pulled back

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.920
 in the last like five to 10 years.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.880
 There was a moment where I was so confident

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.320
 and then it just slowly started to fade

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.280
 when I realized you know more about this to me.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.720
 So I'm gonna back down.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.360
 Yeah, if you talk to most doctors today,

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.960
 like they are, they still are kind of concerned

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:10.120
 about cholesterol, but just like the love of confidence

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.840
 we have with cholesterol, correlating with stuff

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.800
 is kind of questionable given that again,

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.440
 like diet is such a complex thing

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.800
 because you can find any group of people

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.640
 that represent some like potentially like, you know,

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.640
 extreme diet, but you'll find that they may generally

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.920
 be healthy, so.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.280
 Yeah, it is complex.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.680
 And it sucks, like so much of the science is funded

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.280
 from the food industry, which makes things even harder

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.080
 on both sides.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.400
 Like people trying to make their case for their products.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.240
 And yeah, it's a disaster.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.160
 Yeah.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:52.160
 Well, we had like this weird era of like, what was it?

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:57.400
 I think the sugar industry wanted to blame everything on fat.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.360
 So we have just like fat being like,

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.480
 there's old ads where it's like,

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.680
 butter will kill you, have a spoon of sugar instead.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.000
 Like some crazy stuff like that.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 Yeah.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.440
 And a lot of the social studies come from that era.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.120
 So it's kind of unclear, like the maybe the stuff,

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.600
 maybe the intentions were corrupt,

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.840
 but the studies maybe are fine.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.680
 But then we're seeing that some of them are hard to like

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.520
 even replicate.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.520
 So yeah, again, complex system, we know very little,

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.760
 understand very little.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.400
 I just try to listen to what my body tells me.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.200
 Like I have tried all kinds of different diets

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.480
 and certain diets just make my stomach really,

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.040
 like my, just a thing that's like not feel good at all.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.600
 I mean, I can't go back to that soil and clip,

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.680
 like soil and my stomach, no.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.360
 Like I just was in pain.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.720
 Probably soil it in anybody's stomach. Yeah.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.880
 I think the problem is that you have to drink

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.680
 like an obnoxious amount of water if you're going to drink

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.240
 soil it and no one did that.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.120
 So when we just had like, yeah, they were just in pain.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.120
 I think that's probably true for Larabars too.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.280
 Do you do you have days where you eat a lot of Larabars?

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.000
 You don't drink enough water and you just don't feel good?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.080
 I generally don't drink enough water.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.840
 No, but I don't think I don't have many days

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.640
 where I'm eating a lot of Larabars from being honest.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.640
 I've had some days.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.600
 I think you messaged me the other day

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.080
 where you're like, hey, four Larabars.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.400
 Let's just not talk about it later.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.320
 You were like, I met five.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.400
 I know I said I avoided five.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.760
 You misread it. Oh, you have.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.960
 I was doing very proud of myself.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.240
 Not eating the fifth. Oh my goodness.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.440
 Can I tell you a crazy, crazy thing I just read?

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.440
 Oh, yes, please.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.200
 It's actually from 2020.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.680
 I don't know where I was.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.160
 I was like social distancing or something.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.680
 I don't know. I missed the story when it happened.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.840
 It was in vice.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.640
 They actually did a podcast episode, interviewed this guy.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.880
 This guy in Australia, and you're going to have heard this

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.040
 and you're going to tell the story about it to me.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.040
 That's what's going to happen right now.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:51.160
 But this guy in Australia found this hack in an ATM by accident.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:55.880
 He's like out drinking and goes to the ATM to get some cash.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.800
 What he finds is that like between the hours of one and three AM,

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.200
 he can make transfers from his checking to a savings account.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.080
 They fail, but he can then withdraw money

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.720
 from his savings account.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.480
 So if he transfers $500 from his checking to savings,

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.240
 between one and three AM, the ATMs are like offline or something,

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.920
 and it would fail to transfer.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.200
 But then he could withdraw the funds from his savings account

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.400
 as if the transfer had been completed.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:24.040
 OK, so I had like some faulty transaction logic in this ATM.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:29.000
 Yeah, he feels like it was like $1.5 million over four months

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.360
 and just like lives it up.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.080
 Like buys a yacht, like pays off his friend's college debt.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.600
 I mean, like he's doing all this crazy stuff,

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.280
 just partying it up, moving from city to city.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.880
 And then eventually, he's like eating at him so badly

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.000
 that a therapist tells him to turn himself in.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.280
 Like he's never going to be OK with himself

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.560
 until he turns himself in.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.160
 So he calls the bank and tells them what had happened.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.840
 Like he's spent-- he's been withdrawing this money.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.400
 And they're like, this is a policeman.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.560
 We can't talk to you about it.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.920
 Nothing happens.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.760
 Like they don't-- the police doesn't come after him.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.080
 He eventually has to actually turn himself into the police

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:03.920
 and explain what he did.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.280
 They take him to court, even the judges, like nobody

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.360
 has any idea what he did.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.560
 They couldn't understand it.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.160
 Like the technology part of it.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.760
 Like what were you doing?

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.600
 So he ended up having to spend like a year in prison.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.040
 But basically got away with stealing

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.040
 a $1.5 million from this bank.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:18.960
 Wow.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.920
 And spending year in prison, that was it.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.680
 It's a crazy story.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.880
 I've never heard of that before.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.880
 That was very cool.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.440
 That was during COVID.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.080
 Yeah.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.800
 Or the story came out during COVID, I guess.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.160
 So this is probably prior.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.600
 It reminds me of something I had to tell people

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.200
 and I think it gives people an interesting perspective

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.520
 on just technology and making technology decisions.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.200
 So I don't know if this is exactly the issue,

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:46.080
 but ATMs have a very traditional distributed systems

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.280
 problem, right?

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.840
 If I'm in one part of the world, and someone else

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.680
 is another part of the world, and we both

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.960
 try to withdraw money from the same account,

00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.200
 there's a chance for a double spend to happen, right?

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.320
 Like, we pull out the same $100.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.480
 Like, how do you solve this technically?

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.400
 And you can spend a lot of time thinking

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.720
 about all of the distributed systems trade-offs.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.520
 And there really is just no good solution,

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.120
 because when it comes to some of these things,

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.600
 there are just constraints that exist.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.160
 There's always a trade-off of, like,

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.160
 if you want to provide maximum security,

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.520
 you have to, like, sacrifice throughput, which

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.680
 doesn't make sense as a business.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.240
 You don't want to, like, borrow your 8TM.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.720
 So you can, like, spin your wheels a lot,

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.160
 figuring out really complex ways,

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.400
 and increasingly complex ways to limit these situations.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.120
 But there is no good solution technically.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.880
 And if you look at what you do in real life,

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:41.200
 we're like, the right decision is to not solve the problem.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.080
 And we're going to solve it using a non-technical solution,

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.920
 which is just let it go through and we'll

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:50.200
 reconcile problems later, and then we'll, like, you know,

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.440
 punish people that took advantage of it, right?

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.640
 We don't actually solve it technically.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.920
 So it's a great example of, like, to actually scale something

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.800
 like an 8TM, it's not just a technical thing.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.800
 You have to, like, think about it from, like,

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.960
 the solution exists somewhere else.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.280
 Like, you just let this credit the account,

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.120
 and then if people want to negative at the end of the month

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.040
 and then that's a problem.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.920
 I guess, in this case, like, they, you know,

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.800
 didn't really care, it seems like.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.800
 They didn't understand it, I think.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.960
 So he would make the-- it's like he'd go into the negative

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.040
 every day, but every night, he would transfer enough

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.440
 to go back into the positive, but using these fake transfers.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.440
 Right, yeah.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.240
 So it's confusing enough, like, I had to really sit and think

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.840
 about exactly what he's saying.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.400
 I think, like, they just didn't know what to do with it.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.440
 But I love that he turned himself in, like, told the bank.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.520
 He had sold this much money, and how he had done it.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.120
 And for months after that, nothing-- like, nobody--

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.320
 the police didn't come after him.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.080
 They told him, like, they're going to have to tell the police

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.240
 and whatever, but, like, still didn't track it down.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.920
 And it's just because it's a bunch of employees, I guess.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.400
 Like, they don't-- it's not their money.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.040
 They're just like--

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.440
 Yeah, and it was-- it was busy with whatever they're doing.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.720
 And, yeah.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.640
 And again, like, within the margin of error for maybe a bank

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.480
 that big, it's maybe not a big deal.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.760
 And it kind of goes back to this.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.520
 Like, even a problem worth solving if it's, like,

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.440
 you know, a 0.1% loss or whatever.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.080
 I just thought it was funny, too, that it's between 1 and 3 a.m.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.800
 Like, is this some kind of time zone thing?

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.520
 Like, a bug, like, a developer?

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.640
 1 and 3 a.m.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.000
 Yeah, it's kind of like when daylight savings kicks in,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.200
 it, like, jumps forward two hours or whatever.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.040
 Yeah.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.520
 Is daylight savings going away?

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.840
 I-- well, I think it's--

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.320
 I mean, to be that annoying person.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.320
 Technically, I mean, we're trying to make it safe forever,

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.200
 because--

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.120
 Or, yeah, whatever.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:33.920
 Either direction.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.080
 I don't care if it stays or goes.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.720
 But is-- are we going to stop changing the clock?

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.600
 I do care if it stays or goes.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.560
 Oh, you care.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.760
 Which one do you care about?

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.760
 The one where it's not dark at 5 p.m.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.560
 Like, don't you hate saying that winter?

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.120
 Say you want it to be--

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.320
 You want it to be brighter later?

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.160
 Yeah, so the fake tunnel.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.040
 No, I want it to be dark earlier.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.960
 So my kids will go to bed at a reasonable hour.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.400
 Oh, my God, you're the problem.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.600
 I'll fight you.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.440
 You're the problem.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.640
 The problem.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.440
 It's not as big as a problem now, because I'm in Florida.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.120
 But when I lived in New York, 4.30 p.m.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.600
 You look out the window completely dark.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.680
 In the winter, yeah, same here.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.200
 So that's standard time, but that's just how the Earth spins.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.360
 No, no, no, no, that's--

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.880
 That's the fake time that we added--

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.200
 No, no, no, no.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.360
 No, no, no, you're right, you're right.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:14.720
 That's standard.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.640
 That's what the Earth wants us to do.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.000
 Well, I guess time is made up.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.760
 No, it's not what the Earth wants us to do.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.720
 We made up both times.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.120
 We made up a first time.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:24.920
 It sucks.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.040
 We made up a better time.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.000
 And now we've flipped back and forth for some reason.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.440
 Debatable.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.360
 What do you mean your kids will go to bed earlier?

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.240
 What's their bedtime?

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.360
 They were up till 9 o'clock last night.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.520
 You know what time I want to go to bed?

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.440
 9 o'clock.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.840
 But it's dark by 9 in both situations.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.280
 It's dark at 9.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.920
 It's not dark until 9 in the summer in daylight savings time.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.320
 It would have been dark last night today.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.520
 Yeah, I guess it depends on where you live.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.480
 Yeah, it depends on where you live.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.680
 It depends on where you live inside.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.680
 They're like solar powered.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.440
 I guess it's--

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.720
 Well, it's really hard to tuck your kid in when

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.600
 it's bright outside.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.000
 And they know, like, it's still bright outside.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.600
 I could be playing outside right now.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.840
 Why am I going to sleep?

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.240
 Like, I get that question all the time.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.640
 And I don't have a good answer.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.320
 It's just, daddy wants to go to bed.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.920
 I got to get in sign and go to bed, OK?

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.920
 So you got to go to bed so I can go to bed.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.320
 You could crush up sleeping pills and put it in their food.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.120
 Oh geez, that's so evil sounding.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.120
 Are there side effects?

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:21.600
 Or is he considering it?

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.080
 I will say, when they get, like, a cold--

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.640
 I do love that we give them, like, this nighttime cold medicine

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.360
 that's got melanin, whatever in it.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.080
 They knock out so fast.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.480
 Not like I love knocking my kids out.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.200
 But it's just like, it's an easy bedtime,

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.600
 whereas other times it's not.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.920
 So I don't like them to be sick.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.400
 I will say too.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.120
 I can't even trouble this, right?

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.720
 We make sure they're better before we come off the cop syrup.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.600
 So maybe a couple extra days at the end

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.240
 just to make sure.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.800
 But I think it's mostly we get hooked on the easy bedtime.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.760
 It's so easy.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.480
 There's nothing illegal about giving your kids

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.120
 melatonin or something, right?

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.240
 Chris, would you double check that in the US, please?

00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.400
 I know you're Canadian.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.720
 You don't have to worry about illegal.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.000
 These days, you know, anyone hears about anything.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.160
 They're going to come after you.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.480
 Oh, I'll just get canceled.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.640
 It's not about the law.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.040
 It's about, OK, well, that's fine.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.080
 I think I've been canceled a few times because of this show.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.000
 Adam.dev drugs his children.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.520
 Stop it.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:19.960
 Would you stop and give names that you hear this passing?

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.920
 I literally called you.dev, is that your legal last name?

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.920
 That's my new name.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.720
 Yeah, we're having trash on this week,

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:29.960
 and that'll be the third guest in a row that is not their name.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.680
 We had the primegine, milky, and trash dev.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.800
 These are not real people.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.440
 But I tell my wife about these people, and she thinks I'm crazy.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.120
 Like, oh, yeah.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:42.320
 And then trash said, it's just like, who are we?

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.320
 We're all anonymous.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:46.480
 Trash is the most ridiculous one because it's like--

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.480
 it's obviously just so extreme.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.240
 So that company, Log Rocket, has a podcast

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.400
 called Pod Rocket.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:03.200
 And they hired trash to be a host occasionally.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:03.960
 Oh, really?

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.160
 So someone from there reached out to-- well, it's funny.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.280
 Someone from there reached out to me

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.920
 to ask me about to come talk about a project that is not

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.800
 a project I work on.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.640
 Like, they confused the name or whatever.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.680
 But then she goes, oh, yeah.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.960
 But we-- you know, she definitely come on, too.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.640
 And I was like, OK, cool.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.160
 And she goes, yeah, just talk with trash

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.600
 and figure out what you guys would be talking about.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.040
 And I'm like, is this?

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.480
 This is like a professional person

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.320
 at a big, boring, seeming company.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.520
 And she's referring to someone as trash.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.920
 And that's just normal now?

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:43.280
 And that's just like, I did not see that coming,

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.360
 that we would just be living in a world where

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.240
 people are calling each other trash.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.800
 And that's completely fine.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.520
 Yeah, I am jealous, though.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.720
 We've talked about it.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.240
 I wish I had a fake name.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.280
 I guess Adam.dev, maybe I can ride that one.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.720
 Maybe people won't find my last name,

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.960
 although it is on my Twitter and my GitHub.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.600
 And my-- OK.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.000
 It's Elmore.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.680
 OK.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.120
 All of our listeners, Dax.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.880
 All of our listeners now know my last name.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.680
 Thanks.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.200
 Yeah.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.520
 Well, I forgot to spell it.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.240
 That's true.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.400
 Most people ask me to spell it.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.200
 Like, if I'm in a place and I'm like, maybe my name,

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.000
 they don't know how to spell it.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.080
 But I don't know why.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.240
 It seems like a pretty easy one.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.440
 Am I misremembering this?

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.440
 Do you live on a street with your last name?

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.240
 No.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.080
 What?

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.000
 The phrase Elmore Avenue is like in my head.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.680
 Oh, I think there's an Elmore Avenue by me or something.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.360
 Maybe.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.320
 There was one in a town that I--

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.040
 near where I grew up.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.680
 And we used to say it was our street.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.200
 Nice.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.720
 My parents actually-- OK, so my parents actually moved.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.400
 Wow.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:42.640
 My parents moved to a house just off Elmore Street Avenue.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.080
 I'm not sure.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.440
 So yeah, kind of.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.880
 My parents did almost--

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.360
 I imagine the Ozarks are like seven last names

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.080
 that you all share.

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.600
 OK.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.480
 Another misrepresentation of the wonderful people

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.800
 here in the Ozarks.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.960
 We do wear shoes.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.080
 We have a diverse lineup of last names.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.000
 That's a weird flex.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.360
 I never thought I'd be defending last name diversity.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.400
 But lots of them, OK?

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.200
 I will say, if your last name was Collins or Smith,

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.880
 you were just in a sea of people in school.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.160
 Like, no one knew what family you belong to.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.840
 The only thing funny.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.680
 Yes.

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.680
 Someone told me this.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.440
 And I don't know if it's true.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.880
 Well, I guess it's just a theory.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.560
 It could be true or not.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.440
 You know how there's this depiction

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:31.080
 of a southern person as like slow and like kind of dimwitted?

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:33.240
 I don't-- yes, I don't believe that.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.040
 But I know that there is that depiction.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:35.320
 Yes.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.200
 But there's a theory that a lot of people just had hookworm.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.160
 What is hookworm?

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.920
 It's a thing you get from walking outdoors without shoes on.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.880
 Like, you can get it through your feet.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:45.800
 No, it's not.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:46.680
 Are you serious?

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.360
 And apparently that makes you like slower or something.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.360
 I think it was hookworm or something like that.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.640
 There's a theory that that's where

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.880
 that stereotype originated from.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.200
 Well, I need a source.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:55.960
 I need a source.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.200
 So I'm just going to assume this is a very racist, classist

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.440
 thing that you've made up.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:01.120
 Here's the thing.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.440
 I would not have told this story.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.480
 Because nobody cares when you're racist about this group

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:05.920
 of people.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.840
 So I'm able to tell this story because who's going to come out

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.440
 for me now?

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.560
 I mean, I'm from the south, kind of, around the line.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.920
 I'm from the south and dimwitted.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.840
 Do you have hookworm?

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.360
 OK.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.560
 This has just gone too far.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.120
 Hookworm?

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:17.800
 It's called hookworm.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:18.200
 I think it's hookworm.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:18.960
 I'm googling it.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.840
 I think.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.320
 I think you made that up just to make fun of Southerners.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.680
 I'm on your side Southerners, kind of,

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.200
 except for the whole confederacy.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.840
 We'll rise saying that's ridiculous.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.680
 You guys are insane.

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.560
 I live in the south.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.000
 Oh, you do.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.240
 You live in Florida.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.200
 Yeah.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:34.880
 Yeah.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:35.800
 Hookworm.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.200
 Centers for Disease Control.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.040
 So it's not made up.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.080
 Ooh, it's an actual worm.

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.720
 Ooh, I wish I wouldn't have Googled it.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.680
 But I want a ground, OK?

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.200
 I want to walk around in the grass with my bare feet

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.580
 and be one with the earth.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:48.560
 And you're telling me now I'm going to get a hookworm?

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.200
 OK.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.040
 Speaking of, we need to talk about this grounding thing.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.160
 Because the other day Liz came up to me

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.880
 and she was like, I feel like--

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.200
 she started describing grounding,

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.840
 but she didn't know what it was.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.360
 She was like, so there's something

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.840
 like the electricity and I think there's something to it.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.000
 So what actually is it?

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.440
 And you keep saying it's not woo-woo stuff.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.160
 It's like real stuff.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.080
 There is science.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:09.760
 Yeah, no, no.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.800
 So when I first heard it, I thought, oh, yeah,

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.120
 those magnetic bracelets that change your ionization.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.360
 Sure.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.760
 It's not that, but it sounds like what

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.880
 that was supposed to be, which is somehow

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.040
 the positive or negative charge in the earth.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.000
 I don't remember which one.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.520
 We get very built up.

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.400
 If you never touch the earth, you're

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:35.400
 never releasing some of that positive charge, I guess.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.000
 What does touch the earth mean?

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.080
 Like your body, your skin touching planet earth

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.600
 that we live on.

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.080
 OK, so when I go outside, I never wear shoes.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.560
 Whenever I'm outside, I'm always barefoot.

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.400
 You never wear shoes?

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.960
 Not like when I go out out, but when I'm

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.600
 walking around my--

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.560
 Well, astroturf doesn't count.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.360
 That would be the astroturf counts.

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:54.960
 No.

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.160
 I mean, is it conductive?

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.160
 Apparently, you have to be touching the earth

00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.200
 or something conductive.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.640
 If you sit on concrete, I think it's OK.

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.040
 How is concrete conductive?

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.480
 That doesn't seem right.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.200
 But basically, if you touch grass,

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:12.040
 it's like 45 minutes a day for maximum effect, I think.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.200
 There's studies, man.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.040
 I'm telling you, look at the science.

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.040
 OK.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:16.520
 I do need to go.

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.840
 Who benefits from that science?

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.240
 But I feel like that doesn't seem like a thing anyone benefits

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.120
 from.

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:22.960
 Big outside.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.640
 Big outside.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.800
 Big grass.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.440
 It's like Scott's lawn and fertilizer or whatever.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.480
 No, seriously, I try to do it now.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.040
 I try to touch.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.920
 And now I'm terrified to go outside with my shoes off

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.200
 because I'm going to get a hookworm.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.000
 Thanks, Stacks.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.400
 My positive charge is all your fault.

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.560
 It's not just all your fault.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.360
 It's all your fault.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.720
 An infestation or is that like just one hookworm goes up?

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.000
 So they're not just like everywhere in the south?

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.560
 Are they everywhere?

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.360
 It's just people in the south wear less shoes?

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.960
 I generally don't wear it.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.680
 Compared to the average person, I rarely

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.240
 wear shoes like I have my mom.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.120
 Almost a billion people are affected.

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:00.960
 Sorry.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.280
 So you don't wear shoes.

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.040
 I've got to go barefoot always.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.520
 I've been like this always.

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.920
 What do you go outside for?

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.880
 Like you walk places?

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.000
 I mean, obviously, if I'm like going to a place,

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.120
 I'm going to have to wear shoes.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.320
 But any opportunity where I don't strictly

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.880
 have to wear shoes, I generally don't.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.920
 So you don't have to wear shoes.

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.680
 When I walk around my backyard, around my house,

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.720
 and the front yard, whatever, I just

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.360
 wouldn't wear shoes.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.080
 The same thing here.

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.000
 I mean, I have ashlifter, but even if it

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.560
 wasn't ashlifter, if I wouldn't be

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.120
 wearing shoes, I just--

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.760
 So you're probably pretty well grounded.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.240
 You're a pretty grounded person.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.480
 I'm hoping this is-- there's a benefit.

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.600
 I always wear shoes.

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.760
 Even if I'm just going out in the driveway with the kids,

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.680
 they're riding their bikes, we go out in the lawn.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.000
 I'm always wearing shoes.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.760
 I just don't like stuff on my feet.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.680
 But apparently, over years of that,

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:46.840
 I went a year straight without touching the earth.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.360
 Wow.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.080
 I'm guessing.

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.040
 And apparently I can kill you.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.880
 And I think that has some kind of an effect.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.400
 Yeah, I'm probably going to die of too much positivity

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.600
 or whatever.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.760
 Toxic positivity.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.480
 Toxic positivity, a different form.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:01.040
 To be honest, the reason I don't wear shoes is I just find it.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.240
 We talk about other damn realizes it's the same thing.

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.680
 I just hate the steps between being inside to being outside.

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.080
 But I don't like putting out clothes.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.080
 You don't like putting out clothes, yeah.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.480
 I don't like putting out your underwear.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.240
 It's just like, I just want to go outside and be inside.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.120
 You just want to be Florida man.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.000
 I know that's what you're going for right now.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.960
 You just want to be the epitome of a Florida man.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.160
 I think what I'm realizing is that I am Florida man,

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.080
 because I don't want to or care to.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.280
 But I just genuinely feel this from my heart.

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.160
 I just want to be outside.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.720
 You know what Florida man doesn't have?

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.520
 What?

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.800
 An apartment in New York City.

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.760
 I don't think you can be Florida man

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.920
 and have dual residency in New York City.

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.520
 Yeah, I got to give up my apartment.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:43.400
 Yeah, I'd probably do that one foot out in some case.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.920
 You know, that's Florida man doesn't have thousands of dollars

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.200
 worth of computer and audio equipment in their home office.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.440
 That's not true.

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:52.600
 I don't think that's true.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.120
 Is it true?

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:53.960
 It's true.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.360
 I feel like I can imagine, like, it's definitely--

00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:01.200
 you can definitely frame in the prepper category of person, you know?

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.000
 Prepper?

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.080
 Oh, that's what Florida man is.

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:03.960
 It's like a prepper.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.040
 I think it's like adjacent.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:05.880
 It's like adjacent.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.320
 And I feel like I could be in my bunker

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:13.480
 with this transmitting over AM radio or something.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.760
 I just remembered-- do you remember Y2K?

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.720
 Yeah.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.360
 I had-- you were born.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:19.880
 Right?

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:20.560
 You had 90.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:21.920
 Yeah, it was born.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.560
 The year 2000.

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.320
 It's always weird to me when I see somebody's birthday,

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.080
 like, after 2000, that just blows my mind.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.280
 I know, it's not possible.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:33.240
 I had, like, a direct family member, not, like, second cousin,

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:37.360
 like, very close family member that they had, like,

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:42.440
 an entire trailer full of canned goods, like, all kinds of stuff

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:46.240
 prepared for the end of the world, which was Y2K.

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.000
 And I just think, what a bummer for them.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.560
 Like, the moment it clicked over and then, like, the next day.

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.440
 And, like, it's going to happen.

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.360
 Society's collapsing.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.320
 And then when it doesn't, can you imagine being bummed

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.760
 that society didn't collapse?

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.000
 This is the classic thing.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.800
 It's like, when you prepare so hard for a potentially negative

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.160
 event, you want it to happen.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.480
 Because then you end up at the top.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.000
 Because you're the one that prepared everyone's didn't.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.240
 So you're kind of disappointed that the bad thing doesn't happen.

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:09.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.280
 I can't believe that was a thing.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:14.080
 Was-- how serious-- like, was there, like, serious--

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:15.880
 people were, like, seriously worried about it?

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.040
 Or was it just like--

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.440
 I think it was the lead up, like, when it was months out

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.880
 that everyone freaked out.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.720
 And, like, I think people were unprepared.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.920
 But I think everybody went really hard at work.

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:28.120
 All the computer and software developers back then fixing

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.240
 all the code that was assuming, you know, the two-digit year

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:31.760
 thing.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.000
 I think, like, the banking system, people were really concerned

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.160
 that, like, there was code that was not going to handle this.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.240
 And I think they went out and they fixed it all.

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.520
 They managed to get it all wrapped up.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.320
 But then I think there was just still this mystery

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:46.040
 and this unknown about, like, what did we forget about?

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.200
 And, like, are planes going to drop from the sky?

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.000
 Yeah, I'm sure some stuff did fail.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.760
 I do remember a lot of my parents' friends

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.520
 came over to America.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.840
 They got to come to America because of Y2K,

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.320
 because these companies were hiring

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.440
 to help people to get people to fix these issues.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.800
 So it's just like a weird thing if you really think about it,

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:04.000
 right?

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.960
 It's like a SAR chapter, yeah.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:10.520
 A weird quirk of integers in a computer system

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.160
 resulted in, like, a generation of people

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.600
 living in a different country.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.320
 And, like, their children and their grandchildren

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.400
 can, we'll be able to trace back the reason they exist

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.880
 and what I would say to, like, this weird quirk, which

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.440
 is really insane.

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:29.200
 So there's also, like, the zippers, say Y2K on them.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.520
 I remember there's some, like, some, like,

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.280
 what's the deal with the zippers?

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.200
 Do you remember that, though?

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.440
 You probably wouldn't remember that.

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:40.080
 Have you ever noticed, like, on a zipper, like, on pants?

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.120
 They say Y2K.

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.000
 There's a lot of weird Y2K stuff.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.200
 Is there some, like, zipper conglomerate that just, like,

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.920
 I think this is a company that, yeah, yeah,

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:51.480
 that just has the corner on zippers or whatever.

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.000
 I've heard they're really hard to manufacture.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:54.840
 Oh, really?

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.520
 Yeah.

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.360
 It's funny to think about all the little things

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.240
 that, like, people became millionaires and billionaires

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.480
 inventing that you just don't ever think about.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.600
 Yeah, so it's--

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.680
 I feel like I run this a lot in Miami,

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.840
 because I feel like people that are rich off of random stuff

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.680
 for a reason live here or, like, have houses here or whatever.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.160
 Yeah.

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.880
 Because I'm always, like, running into people that I'm just,

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.800
 like, what, like, how is this person?

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:18.880
 That's Crazy House.

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:19.800
 There's always something ridiculous.

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.880
 Like, there's this crazy house we drive by.

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:24.480
 And they just make this, like, really popular cracker.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.440
 That's, like, this dude.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.160
 They just make this cracker that is really popular

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.040
 among Cuban people.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.000
 And they have, like, this crazy mansion.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.520
 So I think every big city or, like, a lot of towns

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.200
 have, like, some famous person's name placer and everything,

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:40.440
 because they, like, donated the museum and whatever.

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.120
 So our guy--

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:41.720
 Hammond.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:42.640
 And Springfield, this name is--

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.120
 What's the name?

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:43.600
 Hammond.

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.120
 Hammond.

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:44.620
 Hammond.

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.240
 Like, there's four Hammond towers.

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.120
 There's Hammond Field.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.520
 There's Hammond-- yeah, Hammond.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.120
 Are Hammond's?

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.840
 Like, John Hammond from Jurassic Park.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:51.920
 I think his name is John.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:52.760
 John Q. Hammond's.

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:53.280
 Yeah.

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:53.640
 Wow.

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.600
 JQH Arena.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.160
 Everything in Springfield is named after John Q. Hammond's.

00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.960
 The one heart gazars are there.

00:52:58.960 --> 00:52:59.880
 No.

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:00.480
 OK.

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.760
 I don't think so.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:05.000
 Well, our guy is Frost.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.200
 I forgot his first name.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:06.880
 Something Frost.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.360
 Something that Frost Museum, the University of Miami's

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:12.360
 Music School is, like, the Frost Music School, whatever.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:12.600
 Yeah.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.600
 And we're on that boat this weekend.

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.800
 We go by this insane, insane house.

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:19.360
 It's like, from Miami standards, it's insane.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.760
 Which is, like, really, really crazy.

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.520
 It looks like three completely separate houses.

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.040
 But it's all one.

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.100
 And it's his house.

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.200
 And of course, all the lights are off

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.160
 because he doesn't live there.

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.640
 But I think he's famous--

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.240
 he's not famous.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.240
 He's rich from Viagra.

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:32.740
 Really?

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:33.440
 Yep.

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.640
 He's a pharmaceutical guy.

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.920
 And I think his claim to--

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.840
 like, when his company went huge, it was from Viagra.

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:40.760
 When it went huge, huh?

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.040
 There you go.

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.280
 What a thing this world created.

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:48.780
 Yeah.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.920
 And that person got rich off of.

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.200
 It's wild.

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.960
 So pharmaceutical stuff is wild.

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.720
 Like, when you think about the way we can, like,

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.120
 influence our body with medicines,

00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:59.120
 this is going to sound really gross.

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.400
 But how we can target-- like, how in the world--

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:01.840
 I have no idea.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.720
 I don't know.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.040
 I don't understand it.

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.080
 I mean, just if I start thinking about the human body

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.920
 for five minutes, I get all squeamish

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.280
 and start feeling delicate.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.120
 Yeah, it's mind-blowing to me that I

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:14.520
 can have a pain in my toe or in my head

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:17.280
 or in my arm and just take one pill.

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.200
 Yeah.

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.600
 It's not going to need to, like, put it in my arm.

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.040
 Like, I just fall over and it, you know,

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.560
 reduces inflammation everywhere.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.040
 It's crazy.

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.720
 I can't even believe we, like, figure it out.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.160
 Some of this stuff is so complicated.

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.160
 And some of this stuff has been around for a long time, too.

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.520
 Like, who went and, like, tried all these weird combinations

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.680
 of-- like, you have to, first, find a person with a problem.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.400
 Then, like, keep trying different combinations

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:38.880
 of completely random things.

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:39.240
 Yeah.

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.600
 Because, you know, early on, like, you

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:43.520
 don't have any other way to introspect it.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.200
 And then, find some kind of pattern.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.400
 It's, like, really insane.

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.240
 Yeah.

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.080
 So that's, like, super sophisticated.

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:52.720
 But I just told Casey the other day, who, like, made bread?

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.760
 Who was, like, if we take wheat and we grind it up,

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.920
 and then we mix it with water and then put other stuff in it,

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.200
 and then we bake it.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.400
 That's just a lot of steps.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:01.920
 So many steps.

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.640
 So that's the person that figured that out.

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.160
 Yeah, it's really mind-blowing.

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.960
 Almost all food it fits into this.

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.160
 Like, even just chocolate.

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.400
 Like, chocolate, the input of chocolate,

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.120
 looks and tastes completely different than the output.

00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:13.620
 Yep.

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:14.320
 It is.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.120
 It is crazy.

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:15.960
 I'm not that smart.

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:17.600
 I just don't think I'm that kind of person.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.000
 Like, take a bunch of random things, put them together,

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:20.960
 come up with something.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:21.720
 Me neither.

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.200
 Everything I do is so incremental.

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:23.720
 We suck.

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:24.520
 We do suck.

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.440
 And with that, we should probably get off here.

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.200
 Yeah.

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.200
 All right.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:28.880
 All right, see ya.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:29.380
 See ya.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:29.880
 Oh, sorry.

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:30.680
 That was too abrupt.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.760
 I didn't say it was good talking.

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:32.760
 See ya.

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.720
 It's good.

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:34.280
 You too.

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.160
 Yeah, it was good.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.000
 It was good to talk.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:36.920
 Always good.

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:37.720
 All right, see ya.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:38.360
 Bye.
