00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760
 Adam, I was excited to see how excited you got when you heard about the news today about

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.760
 the acquisition.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.760
 You were on your stream, and you just-

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.760
 I'm so excited.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.760
 Yeah.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.360
 I'd love to hear more about that.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.360
 Yeah, no.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.480
 You told me Shopify acquires remix, and then I went on and on about how excited I was before

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.580
 I realized half of what you were saying.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.660
 You explained that it was hydrogen, they were the first to adopt react components, but I'm

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.960
 like not reading chat, and I'm just like, "This is so crazy, oh my word," and then like

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.760
 I didn't understand half the plot, so it seems the writer.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.200
 Yeah, that whole goes deep in this one.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.640
 I can't wait to unpack it.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:01:04.460
 I don't even know where to start, do you have thoughts on where to start here?

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.620
 No, I guess let's just lay out what happened, I guess, and so it's all happening.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.540
 It's unfolding right now, so there's going to be more that's probably happening as we're

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.460
 talking about it, but yeah, news this morning, remix acquired by Shopify, which is pretty

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.740
 crazy because people have been wondering, "Remix is the underdog, are they going to be

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.380
 able to take on Next.js on their own for sales backing and all this stuff," but now they're

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.540
 backed by Shopify.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:40.700
 So one huge on its own, then Fred from Astro tweeted, he actually read through the blog post

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.620
 in the roadmap, and Shopify seems to be suggesting that their own framework, which they've been

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.020
 building, Hydrogen, which was the only other React Server component framework, is going

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.460
 to be moving away from RSC, which is a really big deal, I think the narrative is really

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.620
 interesting where, you know, Next.js conference happened, React Server components was released,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.480
 everyone wanted to try it, I know you have a lot of thoughts on this, and it felt like

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.220
 half-baked, terrible, like not good, then Shopify is announcing, "Well, we're not going

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.820
 to be using it either, we just prefer to use React Router and that whole model."

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.580
 Yeah, can you unpack that for me?

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.580
 Because it looked like when I read the posts, I didn't read the whole thing, but I read

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.500
 parts of it, quoted parts on tweets and stuff.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.060
 It sounded like they were saying, "For now, is there a chance they're going to still use

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.660
 RSCs in the future?

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.660
 Did you see that?"

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.740
 They definitely hedged a lot, and every single place where someone said something about

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.980
 moving away from RSC, they like prefaced it or qualified it by saying, "We still believe

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.420
 RSCs are great in the future, and we're really excited that we think that's a future of

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.780
 React, but we're not using them, right?"

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.580
 So it's like, yeah, it is interesting.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.140
 So I think ultimately, and we were just having a meeting at SST, and we ended up talking

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.940
 about a bunch about this as well, because now Next and React are so tied together, any

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.940
 fumble that Next does or Vercel does splashes back on a React, right?

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.940
 Yeah.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.940
 Oh, sure.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.940
 Yeah.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.980
 So I think RSCs are fine and great, and they're going to be really-- they're going to be good

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.940
 and they're going to work the way they're advertised.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.860
 But I think Next kind of fumbled this release, and like, you know, with people trying it

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.300
 out, and the bundle size are bigger, there's a lot of questions and ambiguity around it.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.300
 Yeah.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.260
 And I want to get into that a lot, because I think that's so much of this story to me

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.820
 is the Vercel response, the Guillermo response, like all of this stuff.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:44.220
 But I guess, like, so to summarize here, Shopify buying remix, Shopify powers, like, everything

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.980
 that's e-commerce, but Amazon, right?

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.740
 Like, they are it for e-commerce.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.900
 So now you've got remix, and they sort of build a lot of tooling for developers who

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.540
 are building storefronts, right?

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.820
 Like, Shopify provides all this, like, in the past, they've got APIs for interacting

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.940
 with your merchant account and all that, but they also provide, like, front-end stuff,

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.940
 right?

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.500
 And so now, presumably, remix is going to be the way people build their Shopify stores.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.500
 Is that parsed correctly?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.540
 Yeah, I think that makes sense.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.580
 I think from the beginning, remix felt like a weird set of trade-offs, like, the way that

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.620
 they say you should build stuff.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.540
 But that set of trade-offs made perfect sense for e-commerce, and I would argue, like, maybe

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.540
 for nothing else.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.540
 Yeah.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.260
 So, teaming up with Shopify is perfect.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
 Yeah, and that's the next JS thing, too, right?

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.580
 Like, it's mostly, it fits really well in terms of feature set for e-commerce, and that's

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.860
 what they always cite, like, at the conference they just said.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.780
 It's like, here's all the major e-commerce stores using next JS in Versailles.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.860
 So it's a big deal to Versailles if remix falls into the hands of Shopify, where, presumably,

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.020
 there's a lot of next-ish stores built for Shopify, I guess.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.220
 Yeah, and I think that's where Versailles makes a lot of money, because I think we're

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.420
 talking about this in a previous podcast, where e-commerce stores deliver a lot of traffic

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.460
 with, like, high-quality images, like, all this stuff, and Versailles gets to charge people

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.460
 for that.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.460
 Yeah.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.420
 So, yeah, it's, like, it's really interesting, and it goes right to the heart of their business

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.420
 model, I think.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.300
 Yeah, and did you see any of the Guillermo response tweets, because there's been stuff?

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.300
 Yeah.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.180
 I saw the one where he was kind of stuff tweeting, like, "Oh, you don't want your front-end coupled

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.420
 with your back-end," and something like that, which is really odd, because I don't think

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.220
 remakes is going to get, like, Shopify-specific features.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.460
 That doesn't really make sense.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.620
 I think it's just going to be a framework that you can use with Shopify or with other

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.620
 stuff if you want.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.620
 So I think that was kind of a weird.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.260
 I think he, like, he should have a workshop that one more, because you're going to get

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.260
 a response.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.460
 And it just drew attention to the fact that, well, actually, next JS in Bursailles are coupled.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.860
 Yeah, exactly.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:58.080
 That's the big, such, like, everybody's sort of piled on, the pot calling the kettle black.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.860
 I don't want to just keep talking and jumping straight to Bursailles and next JS, but that's

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.260
 just where my head's at right now.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:09.860
 I guess, like, for the Shopify remix situation, they're going to continue to operate remix

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.860
 as this open-source unit, like, they're going to keep doing what they've been doing.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.620
 The remix folks aren't, like, suddenly working on Shopify internal stuff.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.620
 They're building remix just as they have them, but they've got this backing.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.720
 So now, I think one of them, Michael Jackson, or I can't remember, Ryan, one of them pointed

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.900
 out that it's a huge deal for a framework like this, just for any open-source framework,

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.660
 to now have, like, an indefinite timeline, like, they have financial backing, they don't

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.940
 have to worry about money.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.100
 They can focus on building.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.140
 It's just a whole other element to this whole thing.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.140
 Is that all accurate?

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.140
 Did I get all that right?

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.140
 That they're stating?

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.140
 Yeah.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.140
 Yeah, I think so.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.140
 And for a couple of minutes, I had to Shopify.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.140
 This is...

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.340
 The numbers are probably pretty low for them.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.780
 It's probably, like, a good deal.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.520
 Even though they're probably really high, like, subjectively.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.580
 But for them, you know, to hire two developers of that quality, to work on something like

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.140
 this, like, it's like a tiny fraction of anything else they spend their money on.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.340
 So Shopify gets to, I mean, it's an acquisition, right?

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.340
 They're acquiring...

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.340
 It's like an Aquaire.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:16.500
 I don't know if you can acquire MIT license software, but they're going to have some say,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.780
 right, over Ryan and Michael's focus, like, what they're building into remix.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.540
 Like, it's going to be better and better all the time for e-commerce use cases, I would

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.540
 imagine.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.540
 Yeah.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.700
 I wonder what degree, like, even needs to specialize that hard.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.500
 I feel like just their model, just making that better and more complete and, like, seeing

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.540
 through their vision, coincidentally happens to work well for e-commerce, so I think that

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.380
 might be enough for a long time.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.060
 And I'm sure they, like, negotiated all of that because they had probably, after working

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:51.820
 independently for so long, and they'd have probably wanted to retain that control.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.820
 Yeah.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.820
 Sorry.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:08:00.260
 And then, on the Shopify benefits side, like, what they're going to get, I assume they're

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.260
 going to...

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.180
 Like, I wasn't jumping to conclusions, but I had that they're going to, like, package

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.300
 some of remix up into their dev tools that they provide to merchants.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.300
 Is that presumptuous?

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.020
 Or does it say in the blog post?

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.860
 I should read the blog post.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.620
 No, I don't think, well, I don't think they explicitly mentioned any of that.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.180
 And I think if they do that, it'll be...

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.620
 I don't think they need to do that any time soon, but, yeah, I guess, hydrogen...

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.140
 Can you explain hydrogen to me, because I've never used or known anything about hydrogen?

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.140
 Yeah.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.140
 I'm also a little bit...

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.060
 I'm, like, not super familiar with it.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.060
 Or I'm not...

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:39.700
 I don't know it to a crazy degree either, but yeah, it is a React-based framework that...

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.220
 It's kind of what you're describing.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:46.640
 It's a little bit more that I give you stuff to build storefronts with, for you to find

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.300
 things where it all works.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.820
 And the interesting part is they really focused on the architecture of it so that it renders

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.460
 in a way that is efficient for e-commerce.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.340
 So I think they will...

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:07.780
 I honestly feel like the remix team might just go work on React Router more and just make

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.220
 all the remix features, and they've already been doing this, but it's bringing all the

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:17.740
 features to React Router, and then hydrogen will just use React Router.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.700
 So they're still kind of independent, but there's a nice energy there.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.540
 And hydrogen can be like the very Shopify-focused effort.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.700
 Yeah.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.820
 So I can remember, I've played with Shopify in the past.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.900
 I was building a thing that involved a Shopify plugin.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.620
 And I can remember, like, if you want to build a Shopify site for your store, your e-commerce

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.620
 store, and have it be completely headless, kind of getting to gear modes tweet where

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.220
 he said like they should allow Shopify merchants to build with any front end or whatever and

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.500
 use their back end APIs.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.820
 They do allow you to do that unless things have changed.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:54.940
 You just have to have one of the like expensive premium accounts if they should be doing business.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.940
 Yeah.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:56.940
 Yeah.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.660
 So like the current, if you're not one of those premium customers, you build with all

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.860
 the Shopify UI stuff and you don't think that part, or is that hydrogen?

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.140
 I'm not sure I understand like how it all fits into, I'm a merchant, I want to store

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.780
 on Shopify.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:18.140
 Am I choosing remix and remix-like technologies more in the future, or does it not affect

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.620
 it at all based on this deal?

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.620
 I think, yeah.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:27.180
 I do think they have to figure out their pricing model because you can't, yeah, you're right.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.700
 The tier is so high.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.420
 I think it's like several thousand a month.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.420
 Yeah, it's a lot.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:36.380
 For the headless API, and I do wonder why they structured it that way, but it like eliminates

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.780
 the type of person that's just going to pick up remix and try to build any commerce because

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.020
 you literally can't do that.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:47.300
 But also the kind of person who would take a next JS project, like build a next JS storefront,

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.300
 I guess.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.300
 Yeah.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.900
 It seems like they're really focused on the funnel of when you're small, use our no code

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.140
 tools, when you're successful, build your own thing.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.140
 Yeah.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:04.060
 It makes sense historically, but I think now there's just so many good tools for building

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.420
 e-commerce front ends, like remakes, and actually all these things.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.420
 Yeah.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.580
 So, yeah, I feel like they got to figure out their pricing there, if it makes sense.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.980
 So the bigger story here then, I think I'm still missing the plot because I think I keep

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.300
 circling around trying to find something bigger, but the big story here is maybe a not vote

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.300
 of confidence.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.660
 What's a lack of vote of confidence?

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:30.740
 An anti-vote of confidence for RSCs in hydrogen, and the financial backing that now the remix

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.580
 team will have to continue competing with next JS and Versailles and the others.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.580
 Is that accurate?

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.580
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:46.960
 Yeah, I think the vote of no confidence, I guess, I don't know if it's that dramatic,

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.820
 like they hedged everywhere they said stuff, but you can say stuff, I think the actions

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.820
 matter more.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:56.860
 They're not betting on it now, and they have a business running, they have to make bets

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:57.860
 that make sense.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.860
 Yeah.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.860
 And they're choosing not to bet on RSCs for the time being, just a timing of everything

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.860
 I think is insane.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:09.300
 I think there's been all these negative feelings around just a confusion around RSCs and next

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:16.020
 13, and then now someone who should really be pro RSC that's been doing it for a long

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.860
 time is also bailing, it just doesn't look good.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.740
 So let's talk about all that confusion.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.900
 This is the thing that I'm most, it's in my head right now.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:31.020
 So next year, 13, they just launched at next comp, and I thought next year, 13 would be

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.540
 the thing that was pretty baked.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:37.020
 Like if Turbo Pack is a thing that is clearly very unbaked, they're just still mixing stuff

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.940
 in the mixing bowl, then I thought like next 13 and all the routing stuff, the layouts

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:48.260
 RFC, all of that, I assumed was pretty well done, like ready for public consumption.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:54.520
 But so far, it sounds a lot like the next 13, the layouts, the routing, all of it makes

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.380
 sense except it's still a giant client bundle, no matter what you do with server components,

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.540
 there's server components by default in the app directory.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.340
 As far as I know, there's people building projects and I should do this, but with entirely

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.940
 server components, no client components whatsoever.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.100
 And it's like a bigger bundle than ever.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.780
 So is this a, you said, maybe this is the next JS fumble of herself humble, not so much

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.620
 a react server component fumble, but can you, what do you understand of the whole thing?

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.660
 I've been asking, I don't seem to get any answers.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.660
 Yeah.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.420
 I was going to ask you, have you, have you seen anyone get a good result yet?

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.420
 No.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.620
 Because I saw people who replies me like, well, you did XYZ wrong.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.620
 Oh, no.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.180
 I've not seen a single example, like a single project that was like, look here, you did

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.220
 the right thing, you turned on the right experimental flag or whatever.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.300
 Now the bundles are tiny.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.300
 Haven't seen it.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.300
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.580
 So I, from what I understand about RSCs, I feel like this is, it's just not packaged.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.580
 Like I don't know what they're doing.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.220
 They did something wrong.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.420
 It shouldn't be worse than next 12, which is what I'm seeing.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.420
 That seems impossible.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.420
 Like RSCs can't be that bad, right?

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.420
 Yeah.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.020
 So yeah, I think, I don't know, it just feels like maybe I haven't heard anything from

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.020
 them either.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.140
 I feel like there's like this big vacuum of, yes, wait, what?

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.460
 And I haven't seen anyone from their side clarifying, even just saying, oh, you guys

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.460
 are right.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.580
 This isn't working right now, but it's going to work.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.820
 So I saw Dan or somebody.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.780
 Oh, I think it was somebody from the React team say that, oh, yeah, next 13 is missing

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.060
 this XYZ optimization, which sounds like the whole thing.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.940
 Like if it's not pulling JavaScript out of the bundle, it's the whole point, what we've

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.260
 been sold on the whole next 13 server components, all of this was like small bundles and not

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
 shipping JavaScript if you don't need to.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.660
 And that's not the case.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.420
 And when is it going to be the case?

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.420
 Yeah.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.420
 Okay.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.420
 I think something clicked for me.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:47.420
 What happened was Vercel was very excited about the API changes that RSCs provide right

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.340
 before you had like get server side props, all these things.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.900
 And now there's like one clean way to do everything.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:53.900
 Yeah.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.980
 Like whether it's client, whether it's ISR, whether it's SSR, like there's just one very

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.820
 natural react way of fetching data.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.660
 That's probably what they were super excited about and excited a demo because that stuff

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.860
 works, right?

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.860
 Yeah.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.140
 But I think everyone, what made what they have missed is everyone is so trained on these

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.220
 performance things now, just because it's been the conversation for the past year.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.020
 Everyone's obsessed with this.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:20.220
 So I almost was like, people are like, don't really care about the API change, which are

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.540
 I think good and will clean up all the code.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.300
 It just seems like everyone's glossing over that.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.340
 And they just focus on the performance thing, which maybe Vercel expected it to be the other

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.340
 way around.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.820
 We're like, oh, they can wait for the performance stuff.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.540
 They're going to be excited about the API.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.220
 I think they just didn't read the room.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.700
 Like you've got all these HTML first frameworks that are making more and more buzz.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.100
 Everyone's really excited about shipping as little JavaScript as possible.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.100
 Yeah.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.060
 And I mean, for e-commerce, that makes sense, right?

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:50.540
 Like, you should be shipping as little JavaScript as possible, like 160k bundle for a storefront.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.540
 That's bad.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.540
 Like, right?

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.540
 Am I crazy?

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.540
 Yeah.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.540
 No, that is bad.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.660
 And I feel like really interactive apps I've built haven't even been that big.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.660
 Right.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.660
 Yeah.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.660
 It's worse than like a spa.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.660
 And it's not supposed to be.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.860
 It's supposed to be this other thing.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:09.660
 So I just think like most of the conversation, at least in Twitter circles and wherever else,

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.820
 like most of the conversation these days is very performance aware.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.860
 Like people know how big bundles are and how big the React runtime is.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.460
 And like all these things, people are very aware.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:24.220
 So I think it's pretty crazy to me that no one on their side expected this kind of pushback

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.460
 or this kind of confusion when the bundles are giant and we're using server components.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.060
 And that was the whole thing, I thought.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.060
 I don't know.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:36.740
 Yeah, and yelling at class right now.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.740
 What else?

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.740
 What else happened?

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:43.060
 I think, oh, there was some more details about remixes of business.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.580
 I don't know if you saw that Ryan Florence tweeted some stuff about it.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.580
 He mentioned that.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.220
 Do you remember that remix used to be a private or proprietary framework, your license?

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.220
 Pay for the license.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.220
 Yeah.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.220
 Yeah.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.220
 Yeah.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.620
 So he said they were closing in on 200k ARR prior to their 1.0.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:04.580
 AR, annual, okay, occurring 200, okay.

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:10.900
 So like, okay, I think the license must renew every year or something.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.740
 Otherwise, it's so one time they wouldn't be ARR.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.740
 Yeah.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:19.180
 So then they, they, then they decided to erase VC so that they could, what did they say?

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.180
 So they could.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.180
 Oh, I did see this tweet.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.180
 Yeah.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.180
 Yeah.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.900
 So they could skip, like having a focus on growing AR in the short term.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.900
 Yeah.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.260
 And now that was a focus.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.260
 Yeah, exactly.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.260
 Yeah.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.380
 So that was interesting because everyone's been curious about like what was their business

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.860
 model and what did it look like when they were charging.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:43.340
 So yeah, 200k ARR, you know, for, it's not that big, but I'm surprised it was.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.340
 Yeah.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.660
 I was going to say, but what it was, what it was, I'm pretty surprised for proprietary

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.660
 framework.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.660
 200k ARR.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.660
 Very good.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.660
 Yeah.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.660
 Interesting.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.660
 I don't.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.660
 Yeah.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.660
 The whole remix crap.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.660
 I just don't know.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.100
 Like I've never played, but they've actually built anything with remix.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.100
 Yeah.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.100
 I've played with it.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.340
 We actually support remix on SST is I want to, we don't support next very well.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.380
 We support remakes incredibly well.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.380
 Yeah.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.780
 Well, cause it's a lot easier to deploy, right?

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.780
 Yeah, exactly.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:10.780
 Like X is a nightmare to deploy.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.780
 That was funny.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.780
 I saw a gearmo tweet.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.740
 I keep bringing all this back to gearmo in Vercelle, but I saw a gearmo tweet that was

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.820
 like about, he was trying to combat the whole argument that you can't deploy next anywhere

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.820
 else.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.340
 And it was like, you can deploy it on AWS and yada, yada, yada, and like, I've know all

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.700
 these sites that, that are doing that.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.700
 It's impossible.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.700
 It's not impossible.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.700
 But it's a lot of work.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.420
 And to have all the features is just a fool's errand you're just not keeping up with all

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.580
 the features they roll out.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.580
 Next 13.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:43.220
 Now, I don't think the open source solution for deploying next JS on AWS is that serverless

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.620
 next JS framework.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.700
 It's like an open source library.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.060
 There's like a single maintainer and he's trying to get out there.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.060
 He's done.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.060
 It's been done.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.060
 It's been done.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.060
 It's completely about it.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.060
 Yeah.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.060
 It was on next 11.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.060
 They couldn't get next 12 done.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.060
 And now there's 13.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.060
 So yeah.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.060
 Yeah.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.060
 We've tried.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.060
 We really tried.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.060
 Yeah.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.060
 Yeah.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.780
 So, so the remix, what is it with the remix crew though?

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.580
 Why are they, why are they so bitter?

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.340
 That's just the only, my only question is like, why are they so angry on the internet?

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.340
 I don't know.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.340
 This is like, especially if they're getting a fire.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.340
 Yeah.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.340
 It was a great day for them.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.380
 And I feel like the last month they've surely known this.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.540
 And why are they even salty at all?

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.220
 I'd be like doing my victory lap, just not saying it yet.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.260
 Like, yeah, everything is timing out amazing for them.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.140
 But I think, I just feel this is the way they, they like living their life.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.780
 Like this is what they're into is the way they want to interact with the world and how

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.500
 they want to get their stuff out there.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.860
 I think, yeah, like you said, for me, it's like, oh, now I can chill.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.860
 I'm not stressed anymore.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:42.700
 Because we were perceiving it as the angst comes from the stress of being this underdog,

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.820
 trying to get something out there and like worried about being crushed.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:46.820
 Yeah.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.020
 But now they have like backing, they don't have to worry anymore.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.020
 But it's still the same.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.980
 So I guess it was never angst driven, it's just like they still have the same like chip

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.500
 on their shoulder because they're still like gearmo still talking down to them on Twitter.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.940
 And like, yeah, they're still having to deal with the like, are we relevant?

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.500
 Is it just a next year's world that we live in that whole thing?

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.180
 I guess that makes sense.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.180
 That's another thing.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.060
 I feel like I hadn't seen gearmo tweet anything specific and like, I've been following him

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.060
 forever.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.380
 I feel like I just generally hear like, read tweets about next year's or their events.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:23.060
 And all of a sudden, there's like, you know, like, yeah, out of nowhere.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.980
 So that behavior changes all something to note, you know, Oh, for sure.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.260
 I know I've been reading the gearmo tea leaves.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.300
 I can't help it.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.500
 Like I went through his tweets and replies, I'm just like reading everything he's tweeted

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.420
 in the last 24 hours, just after this announcement.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.980
 And I've just not seen him be this like vocally against other things.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.340
 It always felt like Vercel was kind of up on this mountain above everything else.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.500
 They just above the fray, they didn't have to think about other competitors or like acknowledge

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.820
 their existence.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.020
 That has definitely changed in some tangible sense.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.540
 And it's interesting that they just came off their big conference.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.660
 Big moment for them.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:03.820
 This should be like peak Vercel excitement and does not seem that that is the case.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.860
 I mean, just based on gearmo tweets, I don't know, I'm reading into a lot, but we got it.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.860
 It's just, it's so fun.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.860
 All this.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.860
 It's just so fun.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.580
 I was so excited when I saw it today, because I saw this morning and I started watching

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.220
 your stream and I was like, I'm an idiot, how did that not bring us up already?

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.220
 It's been like 20 minutes.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.220
 Yeah.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.820
 And I brought it up and you're like, boom, like, like flew into it.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.900
 This is so exciting.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:32.020
 I, yeah, I just, I feel like things are changing the most they've changed in the web landscape

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.500
 in a long time.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.540
 And I do think this is the year, I think it's just a high likelihood.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.700
 I feel like five years from now, we're looking back at this kind of time period where things

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.300
 started to change.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.420
 And I don't know what it all looks like, but I do think there's a lot of interesting players

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.860
 in the space, like a lot of frameworks that are very compelling and look more compelling

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.860
 all the time.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.860
 And if you already were looking for a reason not to use React, you're just kind of tired

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.860
 of it.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.100
 If you've been building with React for five years, there's, there's a lot of interesting

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.540
 places you can look now.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:07.660
 Yeah, we were talking about this earlier where we love, like I said, we have a remix

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.260
 contract that works perfectly.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:14.060
 We love building stuff for these new frameworks, like remakes, we're doing one for Astro, we're

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.340
 doing one for Solid Start, we're going to do one for Svelte Kit.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:22.580
 It's so easy for us because all these frameworks standardize around HTTP request.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.580
 We do our magic.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.260
 Here's the HTTP response.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.380
 Just make sure you serve that correctly and everything's just going to work.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.380
 And that is like so easy for us to implement.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.300
 We can just support all of these frameworks on AWS really easily.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:39.460
 And it really feels like, oh, these projects are architected for like the future, like they're

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.960
 going to be deployed serverlessly on AWS, on Cloudflare, like wherever you need it, it's

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.700
 going to work exactly the same way.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:52.300
 That feels definitely different than the story around next JS in Brazil.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.300
 Yeah.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:57.380
 Next JS feels like it's designed around building something that only Vercel can run.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.140
 I mean, it has to be right.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.180
 Like there's no way, I know they would never like admit that, but there's no way that doesn't

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.980
 play into their consideration in terms of the roadmap.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:11.060
 Like they know they got a way to deploy next JS, a lot of people use next JS and you need

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.820
 to run it on Vercel if you don't want pain.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.820
 And they can point to a few cases of huge companies that deploy it in other ways.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.460
 But ultimately, like that's, that's their whole thing.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:25.820
 And it drives, has to drive their product roadmap, I would think.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.820
 Yeah.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.820
 Yeah, exactly.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:32.820
 And I think like who's, who actually offers like a commercial solution for next JS outside

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.820
 of that?

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.820
 I think I think Netlify has now.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.820
 Netlify.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.820
 Yeah.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:37.820
 And amplify.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.820
 Yeah.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.820
 Amplify.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.060
 I think amplifies is going to get a little better.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:47.500
 I think right now, I don't know what Amplify does, but I think it's getting ready to support

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.500
 more of the features.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.620
 I think they're going to go more of the containerized, like the Netlify route where like they're

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:58.940
 running next JS and managing the infrastructure for you, not just deploying it into serverless

00:23:58.940 --> 00:23:59.940
 stuff.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.300
 I don't actually, I don't know yet.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.900
 I do know, amplify, not leaking anything.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:09.180
 This is just the current amplify implementation uses that abandoned open source library.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.180
 Yeah.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.180
 As do we.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.180
 Yeah.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.180
 Just like SST.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.980
 So they're moving away from that into more of the Netlify model, which I think Netlify

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.100
 runs it in containers.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.100
 It's running next to us.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:24.940
 So they get all the features, just like Vercel does, but the only people like Netlify or AWS

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:29.220
 can compete with a Vercel, I mean, like smaller, it's hard for like SST.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.420
 You guys can't, well, maybe you can, but run.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.420
 No, it's hard.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.420
 We can't.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.420
 We tried and we've, we did.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:40.380
 I think now we Frank tried and he's like bloodied by the effort and we're talking about

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:45.260
 his offering a container version of it as well because yeah, like it's going to take a full

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.420
 time team to support those features.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.420
 Yep.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.420
 Oh man.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.420
 All the drama.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.420
 I love it.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.700
 I feel like I've probably missed like five tweets that are really juicy just in the time

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.700
 we've been talking.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.700
 Yeah.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.700
 Yeah.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.620
 And they also announced it in, um, they're not so early.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:07.820
 So like me and you, like if a time zone we're in, it's, uh, like it works for us.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:08.820
 Yeah.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.900
 I think a lot of people woke up to the drama already on fellow people on the West Coast.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:12.900
 Yeah.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.900
 Yeah.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:14.900
 Yeah.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:15.900
 I haven't seen.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.900
 They're still rolling out of bed in the West Coast.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:17.900
 I think.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.900
 Yeah.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.900
 Like the usual people commenting on this.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.900
 I haven't seen them comment on it yet.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.340
 So I think they maybe haven't even woken up and seen it yet.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.340
 Yeah.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.660
 I think the best is still yet to come.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.660
 Still to come.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.140
 Well, this has been fun.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.060
 I really am enjoying this.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:36.820
 We can talk about whatever we want podcasts coming from like having an AWS podcast.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:42.380
 Now it's like there's no, no limits to what we could talk about in one episode, really.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.380
 Yeah.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.060
 As long as the dev world keeps providing us with drama every single week, I think, I think

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.060
 we're safe.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.060
 I think we're safe.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.060
 Yeah.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.060
 Yeah.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.060
 Keep continuing to happen.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.060
 All right.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.460
 Do you have anything else you want to say on this?

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.460
 No, I think that's it.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.460
 Yeah.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.460
 Same.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.460
 All right.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.460
 Thanks, Max.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.460
 See you.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:01.460
 See you.
