WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 I keep tapping the screen to, like, make sure it doesn't go to sleep and it keeps

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.880
 hardening it on Twitter.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.840
 I don't know if you've seen this.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.800
 And so people are going to think I'm just really obsessed with us.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.720
 I just love us so much.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.960
 But it doesn't show who said it.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.880
 It just says it was hard.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.800
 So we should just keep just keep doing that.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.320
 Look at that.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.000
 Oh my God.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.960
 We're beloved.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.160
 We are beloved.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:47.760
 What are we streaming on Twitch?

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.560
 No, I put it on Twitter.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.760
 I remember to, like, did you turn on chat?

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.360
 Yes.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.840
 That was critical.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.800
 And I remember now critical.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.200
 Does this work on web or is this, like, purely a mobile thing?

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.720
 I actually just just going to the web to see.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.160
 I was going to check.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
 I have some, like, weird Twitter extension that, like, hides most of the UI.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.440
 So I can't tell.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.960
 Yeah.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.480
 Yeah.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.560
 So my mom watching the boys, uh, I was heading downstairs and I was like, I'm

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.160
 going to go and record a podcast.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.680
 She's like, Oh, what's your podcast about?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.560
 And I was like, I was like, well, we don't, uh, we just talk.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.960
 She's like, Oh, that's so neat.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.280
 Like, she's going to listen to now.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.160
 Mom's always listening.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
 Maybe no matter how irrelevant it is.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.840
 Yeah, I know.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.120
 I actually thought she already did, if I'm being honest.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.000
 So I was a little, I was a little mama or I was a little hurt, but it's okay.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.200
 Uh, why is this so dark where you are?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.760
 I got brighter and you got darker.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.760
 Did I get darker?

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.880
 There's no purple light behind you or something.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.720
 Oh, you're super villain.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.760
 Globe is off.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.240
 I don't know.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.160
 It looks kind of dull.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.760
 I don't know what's going on.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.560
 It's on.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.760
 It looks like I got to look into it.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.440
 I got to debug it.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.240
 Well, it could be my screen brightness too.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.960
 Who knows?

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.040
 Everything I just like literally had to sweep cobwebs off of my teleprompter.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.200
 There's like this whole room has been abandoned for the holidays.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.120
 Isn't my first day getting back into into things?

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.040
 I've like, I've just been in that weird phase where I'm like, not technically.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.120
 I didn't like technically take a break for the holidays, but yeah, kind of did.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.560
 So everything just kind of nice right now.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.920
 Yeah, same.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.520
 OK, I found you on Twitter.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.360
 You are actually streaming.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.320
 I also don't see the purple light on Twitter.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.520
 I'm just going to throw that out there.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.040
 I miss your purple light, but it's OK.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.640
 I'll bring it back.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.640
 Don't worry.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.560
 I'll bring it back.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.000
 OK, Google turned on taxes.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.640
 Oh, we got stuff to talk about today.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.520
 We actually do have.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.480
 I could have told my mom.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.760
 Well, actually, mom, we're going to talk about home labs and hardware and stuff like that.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.280
 Yeah.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.360
 So we were talking about this.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.160
 I think it's been talking about this for a couple of months because you just

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.280
 did a home lab setup. Do you want to talk a little bit about that?

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.400
 I did.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.280
 Twitter is saying that your sound is not working because of Linux.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.800
 They specifically said Linux and I said, listen, it's just probably an honest.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.560
 I'm just not used to turning all.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.360
 I'm just not using going through all the checks.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.760
 It's working now.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.600
 Like they can hear you know.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.000
 Yeah, no, same feeling.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.520
 I feel like I'm forgetting to click so many buttons right now.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.360
 We have other stuff to talk about with the home lab stuff will be interesting.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.960
 Is there any news before like anything going on right now? It's being topical.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.160
 So no, I feel like nothing's happened.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.960
 It's funny because so much of my emotions are tied to our business metrics.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.280
 So they just check constantly to get a feel for things.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.520
 And then obviously this past week, there's a reasonable explanation for it.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.560
 Like, of course, who's going to sign up for a SaaS product?

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.560
 Yeah, the week between Christmas and New Year's.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.160
 Yeah, but it still feels bad because all the numbers are down.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.640
 I hate it.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.680
 I hate the holidays.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.160
 I really do.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.520
 It feels like we're making no progress.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.760
 I'm just so much of my, yeah, it's being excited to wake up every morning.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.440
 It's tied to work stuff and when like it's just so dead right now.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.960
 Yeah, it's just nothing to look forward to.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.000
 But it's January got that January boost of motivation.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.840
 Are you feeling it?

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.840
 I'm feeling it.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.320
 Am I feeling it?

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.720
 Oh, you're not feeling it.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.160
 I don't think I've ever been someone that does like the, OK, it's like a new year

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.880
 that's like reset or like, you know, yeah, it doesn't feel that way.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.800
 It's never really felt that way with to me.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.400
 I used to feel like bad about doing the cliche things in January.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.000
 I literally went for a run yesterday morning, like no joke, January 1st as cliche as that

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 could be.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 I used to feel bad about now.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 I just lean into it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.800
 It's like, I'm going to get this boost of energy for the first couple of months of the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.800
 year.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800
 I've got to take advantage of it.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.080
 Like I'm going to do stuff and then I'm going to fall out of all the good habits and

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.080
 whatever.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.560
 But yeah, no, I definitely agree with that.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.280
 Like you have to do things that give you temporary productivity boost even if they don't last

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.640
 because it just, it just is helpful, like changing up your setup, like, yeah, like reworking

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.640
 how your computer works.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.800
 Like that gives you like a temporary boost for a month.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800
 That's useful.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800
 And then you do it again.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.800
 Six months.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.640
 So yeah, Liz's family has maybe like a lot in tradition.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.560
 You come up with 12 things you want to come true.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.520
 And then you eat the 12 grapes that represent each thing and then you reflect on it the next

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.520
 year.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.520
 Yeah, nothing like crazy.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.320
 Like everyone kind of allowed to do some form of this.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.120
 This year we decided to just put one thing down for each of us.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.120
 Oh, nice.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.040
 I'm a little lower.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.040
 Yeah.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.760
 And right down on a piece of paper that survives the channel that we put it in.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.760
 Okay.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.760
 Yeah.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.760
 Yeah.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.440
 Like the crazy annoying people we are.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.000
 Yeah, but there was one that I put down last year that was like have full control over

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.120
 Zuko off leash.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.400
 And this one, this one's interesting because a year ago, he was like crazy, crazy, well-trained

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.400
 off leash.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.880
 And we'd go everywhere and like it was like, oh, I'm going to have a dog that's like totally

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.840
 can be totally off leash.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.480
 But a couple of months after that, like when he became like more mature, he just started

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.200
 having problems with like like 10% of other dogs.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.560
 And it's like, oh, life is completely changed in terms of like how we do stuff with him.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.680
 Like we do stuff away from other dogs now.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.960
 He used to go to the dog park every single day for two hours back then.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.240
 So seeing that, I was like, I was like, I had this vision that I thought was going to

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.240
 happen.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.600
 And I was reminded that like, oh, that was like completely wrong.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.360
 And my expectations had to change and I didn't like that.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.560
 So I was like, okay, I don't know if I like this.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.560
 Yeah.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.000
 And he said that I laughed because I've seen the delivery people coming to your door and

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 those videos.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.240
 Oh, Zuko came out and tear his eyes with people.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.240
 But that one is.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.240
 Yeah.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.240
 Yeah.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.240
 I mean, he is protective of the house.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.240
 That's a.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.240
 As he should be.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.240
 That's the whole point.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.240
 Very useful.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.120
 But it's just, yeah, just funny because there's always funny situations with delivery people.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:42.120
 We have in the instructions always, we're like, leave it by the gate, like you come into

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.120
 the house.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.120
 Mm hmm.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.680
 But yeah, UPS drivers, FedEx drivers, like they're always like, they, they, they, they

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.000
 take two steps in and they see him because he does his thing.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.920
 We're like flies out the front door, like, like Superman style.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.920
 Yeah.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.920
 Cause my friend was really open.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.920
 That's terrifying.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.520
 And then you just see them like run back and like shut the gate and they must deal with

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.520
 this all the time.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.520
 I would think so.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.520
 Weird part of the job.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.520
 I know where you live now.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.520
 Kind of.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.520
 Close to the water.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.520
 Sorry.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.520
 Is that doggy too much?

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.520
 No, no, no.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.520
 I mean, okay.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.520
 Close to the water in Miami.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.120
 Close to the water in Miami.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.120
 There's a lot of places.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.120
 Close to the water.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.120
 Yeah.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120
 Yeah.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.240
 You were, you're coming down for a tournament.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.240
 I'm trying to decide.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.200
 So yeah, I don't want to go into like my health or Jiu Jitsu too much again because I just,

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.960
 I feel like that's all I ever talk about.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.440
 But I was thinking about taking some time off because my knee is still really swollen.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.440
 I almost died again.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:38.080
 Just give a little quick, ended up in the ER on Chris received and had a leg infection.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.960
 It was probably more serious, but there was no pains that we didn't see it didn't like

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.760
 feel that serious.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.760
 But it's still swollen.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.560
 The infections mostly gone down.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.440
 Yeah, I just thought maybe I do need to take some time off.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.280
 So that's that tournament would be between two big tournaments that I'm doing.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.280
 Oh, I see.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.280
 I got one in a couple weeks.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.280
 So we'll see.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.280
 Yeah.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.840
 The thing that was confusing about that is that was a purely internal injury and then it

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.840
 got infected.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.840
 Yeah.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.840
 So it's called.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.680
 I didn't know we had these in the human body, bursa sacks.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.680
 Yeah.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.680
 It just sounds crazy.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.680
 Okay.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.320
 So like a little fluid, they just like cushion your joints, you have in your knee and I guess

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:21.160
 I burst one and it can get infected when that fluid from the bursa sack.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:26.960
 It was like life threatening technically and it didn't really hurt and it seems so like

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.960
 casual.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.960
 Yeah.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.000
 And then last time I was in there, I was in so much pain and it probably wasn't that

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 big a deal.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.580
 So it was very different experience.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.440
 This time I had to wait in the waiting room for like three and a half hours.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.200
 Last time they took me straight back because I was like, I felt like I was going to die

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.320
 and that was clearly a lot of pain.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.480
 So different experience is probably more serious.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.480
 Yes.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.480
 Sepsis is no joke.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.000
 If it gets in your bloodstream.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Yeah.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Anyway, almost died.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 I'm here.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.160
 I made it to the new year.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.160
 Yeah.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.280
 But you know how we're saying like maybe the podcast won't come back like it wasn't crazy

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.280
 about his wife.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.280
 If I would have died.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.280
 Yeah.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.280
 Did we record before that one though?

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.280
 I think we recorded that.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.280
 Yeah, we did.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.040
 And I would have been like your, you know, how they publish.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.680
 Yeah, they publish like one famous musician's die.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.320
 They publish like what's it called?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.040
 A posthumous or what a posthumous and I said that word.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.040
 Yeah.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.280
 It would have been like that.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.120
 I'm sure our last episode would have been a great lasting legacy.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.160
 What did we talk about?

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
 We're still again.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.160
 We're still.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.160
 Yeah.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
 That's what I want to talk about when I die.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.160
 Oh, it's a homelabs.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.160
 Let's talk about homelabs.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.160
 It's just stuff that's different.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.160
 Yeah.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.160
 So you just did a homelab setup.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.160
 I did.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:43.320
 In fact, I had like eight tabs open for months in my Chrome browser.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.920
 Like I literally like started looking at this a long time ago.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.000
 And it was like I never wanted to touch those tabs because I knew there was all this important

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 information.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.240
 I mean, that's relatable right.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.000
 We all do that.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.680
 So I had all these like homelabs.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.680
 I don't do that at all.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.680
 I keep tabs around.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.680
 Okay.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.680
 Awesome.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.680
 Wait.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.680
 Oh, you don't because you're on Linux and you just like window manager and do all your

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.920
 no, I just, I just hate.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.920
 Okay.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.920
 Here's my issue.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.840
 I like when I have a bunch of tabs open, I can't find the tabs I care about.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.400
 So I like nuke all my tabs like every hour.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.400
 Oh, like an app that does it for you?

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.280
 No, like I just like click on it.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.280
 You just go through it.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.280
 Yeah.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.280
 The mall.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.280
 I don't get the keeping the tabs around.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.280
 Like how do you find?

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.280
 I don't know.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.280
 I'm a hoarder.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.280
 I have like hoarding tendencies.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.960
 I need like a lot of people talk about keeping tabs around, but my issue is, okay, there's

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.800
 like, let's say you have like a hundred tabs open, uh, 90 of those tabs are not irrelevant

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.400
 day to day, but there's 10 that are like GitHub or like, whatever you're doing.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.400
 Isn't it annoying?

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400
 Just to understand the problem.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400
 Oh, no, it is.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.400
 Yeah.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.720
 And like as I start finally closing them, I'll be like, why did I think I was going to open

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.720
 this tab again?

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.720
 Like, I think it's more just laziness.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.440
 I don't even like, I'm not hanging on to all of them.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.240
 I just forget to close them and I just open a tab.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.240
 It's so weird to me.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.240
 It's so frustrating when I have more than like five tabs open.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.240
 Okay.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.080
 Well, I had a bunch of tabs for my home lab and I finally, uh, well, it was the theater.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:08.280
 We did the home theater and I needed some solutions to some problems and my home theater set up

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.480
 and a home lab was part of that solution.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.000
 So I did like, I mean, I already had some network storage.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Yeah.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.200
 Uh, so I have like a Synology network storage thing and, and maybe you're going to tell

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.760
 me like this is bad.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:28.880
 And like the more I read about stuff on the internet about home labs, like I guess, NAS

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:34.640
 devices are really slow and terrible for like using as a home server, but I basically just

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.120
 installed everything on my Synology.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120
 Yeah.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.120
 So I've got like all the different stuff now running in Docker containers on Synology,

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.640
 which sounds like it would be really slow, but it hasn't been an issue.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.640
 Yeah.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.360
 I mean, it just, it's just like for what you're doing, you don't need like the pinnacle performance.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.960
 If you already had the NAS, it's just like why not, um, for people that don't know what

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.960
 a home lab is.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.960
 I'm realizing like, oh, yeah.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.960
 Yeah.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.760
 It didn't do you have a bunch of servers in your house and you have, you know, it's like,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.760
 I took a lab.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.920
 You can like toy, toy around with stuff, uh, I think a lot of people use it for media.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.000
 My personal experience with home labs goes way back.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.800
 And I think I've shared with this before, uh, because my dad at one point was experimenting

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.480
 with Hadoop when Hadoop first came out and I don't really understand why this was his

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:26.120
 process, but he was like, okay, actually now thinking back, I forget that, like, you know,

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.800
 it's easy to forget your parents are like normal people just like you.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.800
 Yeah.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.800
 I'm like, it's all time.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:37.400
 Like why did he, he, so he bought like a rack, uh, it was maybe I think eight servers and

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.400
 put it in our basement.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.800
 How do I get an electrician come in and like have that expensive plug for the, uh, the

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.760
 UPS, um, and he like, use it for three months.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.580
 And he was like, okay, it's, it's years now, like we've prototyped on anything that was

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.840
 using it for work.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.360
 Now looking back, I'm like, Oh yeah, of course.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.560
 I would take any excuse to buy a rack of servers and he probably got his work to pay for

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.560
 her or something.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.560
 Yeah.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.760
 But in the moment it felt so excessive, but I'm like, oh, he's just like a person just

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.760
 like me.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.760
 Like, of course.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.760
 Yeah.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.760
 I'm going to do something excessive like that.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.000
 Um, but he gave them to me and he only, like, like I said, you only use them for three

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.960
 or six months and that's when I learned like head and minister servers and like manage

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.960
 a cluster of it.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.960
 I've always liked it.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.280
 Like I learned so much for a minute.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.240
 It's just convenient to have that there.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.240
 Yeah.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.280
 And they're actually still in there in the basement and I'm sure they still work and

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:33.840
 these are probably from 2008 or nine, uh, whenever Hadoop was first coming out.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.840
 Yeah.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:40.720
 Uh, so yeah, I miss that and I'm like, I want some of that again.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.880
 So I was like looking back into what type of stuff I can get now and how it, how it

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.880
 differs.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.000
 It actually hasn't changed much.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.600
 It's like still just racks and servers.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.160
 So do you have like a, like a standard server rack in your closet?

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.160
 I've got two.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160
 Yeah.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.720
 So I've got, uh, a rack in my office closet, which fun fact that's where my fiber terminates

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.720
 fiber.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.680
 So I know, uh, so I've got a big rack there.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.000
 It's got a bunch of like unified network equipment.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Nice.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.400
 Do you have something besides the switch?

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.400
 Yes.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.400
 I'm trying to remember what I have in there.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:20.360
 So there's the dream machine pro is like the router, I guess, like the brain of the whole

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.360
 thing.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.240
 And then I have a big, yeah, big, uh, unified switch.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.400
 And then there's a unified RPS like backup power thing.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.400
 Okay.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.160
 Uh, there's something else.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.600
 There's another silver box in there.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.600
 What does it do?

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.520
 Uh, no, that might be it.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.360
 And then, yeah, and then my Synology and then fans and power.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.360
 I don't know.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.360
 It's a pretty tall rack.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.360
 There's not that much going on in it.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.360
 Yeah.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.360
 In the middle of it's pretty open.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.360
 Yeah.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.360
 Uh, yeah.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.440
 And then all my other stuff is in.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.000
 So just off the theater, there's some unfinished space.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.840
 I've got a small like half rack in there that's got amps and that kind of stuff.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.840
 Yeah.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.840
 Surround processors and all that.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.020
 Wait, your amp fits in a server rack.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.020
 It does.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.760
 Are they like the same specs in terms of like the size or do you get like rails that like

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.960
 make it sit in there?

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:21.160
 Uh, so there's just little like ears that screw on the side, but it basically is shaped

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.400
 as if it were made to fit in a rack.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400
 Yeah.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.400
 Yeah.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.680
 So I'm thinking about getting a half rack, uh, just to put in so my desk is way too big.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.280
 I need to get a new desk that's like less aggressive.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.640
 I do like having like a massive desk area, but it's just not a good use of space because

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.520
 I ended up putting like bullshit on it, like stuff that I just put away in the quick passes.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:45.520
 Uh, so I'm going to like lower the space a little bit, like a smaller desk and put a

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.520
 half rack.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.680
 Oh, like under your desk or just like you're off the, they're like a little bit behind

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.680
 it.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.680
 Yeah.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.680
 It's a little bit of space.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.680
 Uh, yeah.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.680
 Yeah.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.680
 Yeah.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.680
 So here's what I want.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.680
 And I haven't figured out how to make this exactly happen.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.960
 One, I want media stuff because I don't want media stuff is like, uh, not hosted locally.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.120
 That's the kind of thing you did.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.120
 So I want a lot of storage.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:12.800
 Uh, but I also have this dream of like doing all my work SSH into a server, but that way

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.760
 when I'm like on the go, it's like the same sessions and everything and I'm not like sinking

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.760
 stuff to places.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.760
 Oh, interesting.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.120
 Um, but here's my struggle.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.960
 So a very easy way to do this is at least for like the storage part.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:31.840
 Uh, you just go to, I mean, probably not an option for you, but if you're in, if you're

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:38.080
 in a city, like there's just a ton of refurbished server equipment, like everywhere.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.240
 Oh, really?

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:45.680
 So I can get like a pretty like powerful server for just media stuff, you can handle that

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.680
 really well.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.680
 And for not too expensive, like loaded with hard drives, whatever, and it's effectively

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:56.840
 got similar to like a Nazi by, yeah, off the shelf, uh, but server CPUs are slow.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.040
 Like, yeah, they just know they're not optimized for like high clocks.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.960
 They're optimized for like, uh, the ECC ram and all that stuff that I don't really care

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.960
 about.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.600
 So they wouldn't be great for like software development workflows.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.600
 Yeah.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:15.120
 Because at the end of the day, uh, unfortunately, most of our software stuff because we're in

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.960
 the JavaScript TypeScript world is all single threaded, like your, the things that end up

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.760
 being slow on your computer, like building your front end with a Vte or, uh, your language

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.760
 server for TypeScript, the stuff that kind of gets slow and annoying, uh, those are all

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.760
 single threaded.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:36.480
 So the server or CPU that I get will have a ton of cores, but it just won't be fast enough.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.840
 And I'm trying to figure out like, how do I get?

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.840
 Okay.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.840
 So instead of doing that, like should I just get a high end desktop CPU and like put it

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:49.120
 in a, in a sort of configuration, but as a thing I was telling you this morning where I'm like,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.040
 I like the idea of building computers and I've always done that because they're upgradable.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:18:00.120
 But in practice, I like rarely ever get to do this because, yeah, uh, my current CPU is

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:07.320
 an AMD 3900X, which came out, I don't know, I think like 2017 or something has been a

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.400
 while and it's due for an upgrade, but the socket is like totally different now.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.000
 So if I'm doing an upgrade, I have to replace pretty much everything in there.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 The whole motherboard and everything.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Yeah.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 So it's not really an upgrade.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.040
 And I actually don't, it's not, for me, it's not really a good cost thing.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.680
 Like I derive so much value from this stuff that I'm mind spending on it.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.040
 It's just, I don't immediately know what to do with the old stuff.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.040
 Yeah.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.040
 And it just pops up.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.960
 And I know somebody could use it and it feels really wasteful and bad.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.560
 And I just like, I was very lost about all this stuff.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.560
 Yeah.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.560
 Yeah.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.560
 You should just buy max.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.560
 But even then, like what do you do with old and bad?

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.560
 They're so great.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.560
 Oh, that's a great question.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:48.200
 When I went from my Mac mini to my Mac studio, I left my Mac mini attached under my desk

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.240
 and it's just sitting there doing nothing.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.240
 Exactly.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.240
 I just remembered that.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.240
 Exactly.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.240
 It's still there.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.240
 It's just there.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.000
 And then let's say you upgrade because now, now there's like the M3 or whatever.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 Yeah.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Let's say you want to go for that.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 What are you going to do with your studio now?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 I don't know.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.640
 Maybe I'll send it to someone who needs it.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.640
 Maybe I'll do a giveaway.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.640
 Yeah.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.640
 That's generally what I do.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:12.480
 And I gave a wait, so I used to have this funny thing where when I used to travel between

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:18.680
 Miami and New York, I had half a PC that I would keep in Miami, which was like all the

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.720
 parts except for the graphics card in the RAM because it was expensive and easy to travel

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.720
 with.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.800
 Does it just carry them back and forth and plug it in?

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.080
 But now that I live your full time, I'm like, I have a computer left.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:35.000
 So I found someone to give that away to, yeah, in Miami, but it's just like, I have to look

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.560
 into this more because I just have a ton of electronics that I know that someone who knows

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:44.080
 what they're doing can like extract the value out of and like put it in the right place.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.760
 And I have seen some recycling companies here.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.800
 I just haven't had to talk to them yet, but I have so much stuff and it just feels bad

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.800
 when it piles up.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.800
 It does feel bad.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.800
 No, I feel you.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.800
 Why do you?

00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:01.520
 So I'm just thinking about the server thing like getting a PC, but running it as a server.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:07.000
 Why not just having a desktop PC like you do and doing like an external network thing?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Yeah.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 I use tail scale.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 Yeah.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 I use tail scale too.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Yeah.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 Okay.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 Yeah.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 So can you just like SSH into your like when you're traveling from your laptop?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 Yeah.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 Is that just work?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Yeah.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 That actually is what I do right now.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 Okay.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.120
 But yeah, for me, it's more around this like I want it like my CPU right now is too slow

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.800
 for the work that I do, like I need to upgrade it.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.800
 So I'm trying to forget.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.800
 I'm more trying to figure out the scripts.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.760
 It's hard. I know, but it's really it's thick.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.760
 It's heavy.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.760
 I see.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.440
 I just crazy how much hard work power is running down the screen.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.440
 It's just the types of blamest over the end of the day.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.120
 It's really just that.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:51.200
 And if anyone in the world is willing to take on that task of fixing it, I mean, Donnie.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200
 He is right.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.520
 He's just maybe burn out, but he was I feel like that.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.920
 I feel like like ruined his life and killed his soul.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.460
 Yeah, he just drained him of all anymore.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.320
 What about JS doc or whatever it's called?

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.320
 That's just using the TypeScript.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.320
 They're running.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.320
 Oh, it is.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.600
 What's the thing that that's felt code-based it?

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.600
 Yeah.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.600
 That's that's using.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.600
 Yeah.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.600
 So use this TypeScript.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.000
 People call it JS doc, but it's actually TS doc because a lot of the syntax it uses like

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 is just TypeScript syntax.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.080
 So you need that it's all built up on top of that gigantic TypeScript file.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.080
 Interesting.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.480
 I thought this was like to get away from the big TypeScript compiler thing.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.440
 Well, it gets you away from having a build step.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.440
 Okay.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.880
 Well, and I'm not I'm not like complaining about building my JavaScript, I don't do that that

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.000
 often, but it's more that the language server.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.960
 Yeah, just the editor experience.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960
 Yeah.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:46.080
 And this is my fault because I go really overboard with types and stuff and I just put myself

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.080
 into.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.080
 You're good at TypeScript.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.520
 You don't just yeah, you don't do what I do, which is just use whatever other people

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.520
 make.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.520
 Yeah.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.520
 Well, if you're like building a library, you just have to.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.520
 And it's just yeah.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.600
 But it's just fast on the M threes, just fast on the M. Oh, in three.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.600
 Yeah.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:06.400
 I just saw that that I you got you said something about Apple and I end up open the Apple store

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.800
 because I wanted to know if the vision pro is available yet.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.800
 It's not.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.960
 But then I saw the M three and the MacBook Pros, I was like, do I have an M three?

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.960
 I just got my MacBook Pro.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.960
 I don't even know.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.680
 And that's not like me.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.480
 But before I say this, don't say anything else, I'm going to forget.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.120
 Don't let me get off this podcast episode without asking for a laundry list of things

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.840
 I need from you because I have a list and I'm going to do it publicly just to put more

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.840
 pressure on.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.840
 Okay.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.840
 We can keep going.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.840
 Oh, my idea.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840
 What you mean by that?

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.840
 But I'm looking for it.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.560
 I have things I need from you and I just thought I would ask for them here in this format.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.840
 It's better than sending DMS.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.840
 Nice.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.760
 I'm going to probably already ask for them on DMS, but back to the home lab.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.880
 So yeah, I'm from trying to figure this out.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.240
 And I, yeah, it's just, I don't, I maybe what I want is impossible.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.160
 So for a while I was trying to like rent servers that were in Miami.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.800
 So like very little in see how that way someone else deals with upgrades, right?

00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.800
 Like they figure out.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.800
 Yeah.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.800
 This is old.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800
 I'm sure they find a way to like reuse it in another way.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:09.760
 And I can just, okay, it's into this one, but like, I don't know, just in and up sticking.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.040
 So you actually rent like a specific sort of like, you could go visit it if you wanted

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.040
 to.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.040
 Yeah.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.920
 Well, it's a, I found this one hosting company where you just like pick how many cores you

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.920
 want.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.200
 And like they, um, they do pay per court.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.200
 Mm hmm.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.200
 And I don't need it.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.200
 Like I said, I don't need a lot of core.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.200
 I just need a few really fast ones.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.400
 So I had like a six core thing and that was like reasonably priced, of course it'd be

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.960
 cheaper if I bought it and like hosted myself like after a year and a half, you break even

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.960
 or something.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.960
 But again, it's the upgrades that.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.960
 Yeah.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.960
 Yeah.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.960
 That kill me.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.960
 And I'm like, what is the future of all this?

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.960
 You don't know.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.960
 The cloud.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.960
 Right.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.960
 I don't know.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.960
 Maybe.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.960
 I wanted to be but I just, it just is not sticking.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:54.760
 Yeah. If you ever used any of the like cloud IDEs, it just feels so stack religious to me

00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:00.900
 to not configure my own like machine to run my own tools, just like open up a browser

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.800
 window and be like, there it is.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.800
 Yeah.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800
 There's my stuff.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.800
 I can't either.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.800
 It's just slow.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.800
 Like at the end of the day, it's just slow.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.800
 Is it slow?

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.800
 I haven't even tried.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.800
 Yeah.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.580
 So I think when I was figuring out the server set up the one I'm renting currently, I was

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.920
 trying out all different options.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.080
 Like I even tried like the Amazon to workspaces thing.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.080
 That is so slow.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.080
 So, so, so, so slow.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.080
 Is it?

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.080
 Let's just look at that.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.080
 Like slow to boot into a workspace.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.920
 Is that what I'm just clicking and the latency and everything.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.920
 Oh, everything.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.920
 I got you.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.920
 Yeah.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:36.320
 I've also ruined my own life because I spent so much time like one inch from my screen,

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.320
 like clicking around linear and like observing all the interactions and how long they take.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:46.240
 And now I can just perceive like the smallest delay.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.240
 You're so much more sensitive to it.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.240
 Yeah.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.240
 I just can't enjoy anything.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.040
 I can enjoy like two apps and everything else feels slow.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.760
 That's why I'm always complaining to everyone on Twitter all the time because I want your

00:24:54.760 --> 00:25:00.320
 apps to be faster because I use your apps and I hate them because I can see all this

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.160
 little, all these little delays and stuff.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.080
 So local first bad for your health.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.080
 Yeah.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.080
 It's not a good idea.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.080
 Don't study it as hard as I did.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.080
 Yeah.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.080
 But you're happy with your setup then?

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.080
 I'm happy with it.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.080
 Yeah.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.400
 I'm running a ton of stuff, but I'm starting to think like we would not have any overlap

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.440
 with what we use our home lab for.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.520
 Like you just want to do software Devlin.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.520
 No, no.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.520
 I have media stuff too.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.760
 Oh, you do the media stuff too.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.760
 Yeah, right.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.880
 So right now, because right now that's remote hosted and I want it, want it local just vague

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:36.040
 media stuff is as specific as we're going to get filming a lot more stuff.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.240
 On my iPhone with the with the ProRes and the, oh, yeah.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.240
 Yeah.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.240
 So I want to like use that as a comedian.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.240
 So take up a lot of space.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.240
 I've heard about this.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.240
 Yeah.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.240
 It's pretty big.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.240
 I feel like it's not necessary though.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.680
 They have like a few options.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:54.460
 They have ProRes and like HEVC and HEVC is like so much smaller and I cannot tell the

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.460
 difference.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.460
 Like it looks so good.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.460
 Yeah.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.460
 Both of them.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.320
 Well, it isn't the advantage like ProRes when you're editing with certain tools is just

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.520
 a lot faster from like an editor standpoint.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.520
 Oh, is it?

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.520
 I think so.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.520
 That was the draw that I remember my videographer roommate from college told me like, if you

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.880
 shoot everything in ProRes, then when you put it into, I don't remember which tool.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.440
 I think premiere, but I want to, I guess the Apple with it was the Apple added final cut.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.440
 Yeah.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.440
 It's just a lot faster to edit.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.440
 Yeah.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.840
 ProRes files versus like from press stuff.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.840
 I didn't know that.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.840
 Yeah.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.840
 Well, so that's what I want to.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:36.320
 I bought, I went super deep into like using your iPhone as like what's a crazy setup you

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.240
 can get with an iPhone 15 camera because it is quite crazy.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.880
 And we, we all saw that Apple event where they filmed the whole thing on iPhone.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.880
 Yeah.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.880
 Really impressive.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.280
 Obviously they had like the best lighting people in the world work on it, but even so

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.280
 pretty impressive.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.280
 And yet it's a whole world.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:59.440
 They sell these like they're called cages like you can put your, it's like a case basically,

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.160
 but like you can attach all this stuff and it has like these two handles to like hold

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.360
 it steady and stuff.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.640
 But I bought a one terabyte SSD so I can just record a ton to it.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.800
 They even have like these nice shotgun mics that you can attach to it that look really

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.800
 good.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.800
 From your iPhone.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.800
 How do you?

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.800
 Is it plug into?

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.800
 Oh, USB C.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:24.440
 Look at, so the setup, it's so crazy like the setups that people have because they attach

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.640
 so many accessories to it and just becomes like a super high end setup.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.640
 Yeah.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.640
 They get it.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.480
 They get like a USB C hub and they plug in a mic to it.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.480
 It plug in.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.480
 Oh, wow.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.480
 The hard drive to it.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.480
 They even put it.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480
 Yeah.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.960
 It's a pretty crazy what people do.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.960
 I've gone too.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.080
 I've gone too deep like you with the local first I've gone too deep into camera stuff.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.080
 Right.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.480
 It just seems like it could never be as good.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.480
 Probably not.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.320
 Like when you say a mic in USB C, I'm like, how could it not know?

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.320
 It's not XLR.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.320
 Get out.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.320
 But like, what do I know?

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.320
 Okay.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.400
 Also for the mic I have, I'm using the tentacle.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.840
 So that's completely separate.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.840
 The one that was one of you recommended to me.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.840
 Yeah.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.840
 This one right here.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:03.840
 That was probably a bad recommendation.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.840
 But yeah.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.640
 No, it's good for.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.640
 It's not good for streaming is what we've discussed.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.640
 This isn't meant for streaming.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.640
 Yeah.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.640
 Just for recording.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.640
 Yeah.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.600
 But here's actually why I like this setup.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:21.200
 So one, I feel like with my research, you can't beat this setup unless you go for like

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.800
 a three thousand plus dollar camera.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.240
 I think that's like when you start to really be able to tell.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.240
 Yeah.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240
 But this is so versatile.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.840
 Like I don't, like I'm to like, it's like so easy for me to carry around.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.680
 It's like can shift to a bunch of situations.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.680
 Yeah.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.960
 While you're recording, you get a phone call from your mom.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.960
 That's awesome.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.120
 What could go wrong?

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.920
 My mom doesn't call me versatile.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.320
 Oh, well, I'm sorry.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.600
 I don't know, I just like, I like the portability.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.840
 I like that I already have this phone and I'm like, cause you know, phones are so expensive

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.200
 and I want to feel like I'm like getting the value out of it.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.800
 So doing this helps me feel that way.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.800
 Well, yeah.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.000
 So that's another reason why I wanted the home lab so I can store, I can dump stuff there

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.120
 and I get it on my computer.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.120
 Yeah.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.120
 I'm running.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.240
 I just pulled up like all the containers that are running on my home lab so I could remember

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.240
 what I'm doing.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.960
 I couldn't remember anything outside the media, but like the home assistant stuff and home

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.960
 bridge.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.960
 Oh, I have home assistant too.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.960
 Yeah.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.960
 Do you use home bridge?

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.960
 That's for the apple.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.960
 That's for the apple kit stuff.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.960
 Okay.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.240
 Here's what I love about the home assistant.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.440
 I don't have to worry about any of that stuff because oh wait, you don't have the you didn't

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.960
 buy the actual home assistant device to do.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.680
 Oh, no, no, I'm just running it on my, my ass.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.680
 Okay.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.680
 So the physical hardware, it's not very expensive and it's great because it has every possible

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.880
 radio that you need like the Z wave.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.920
 Oh, it actually has all of it.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.800
 So you don't have to worry about the crazy mess that is like the IOT space.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.520
 You just add any device and it just works.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.520
 Interesting.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.520
 Okay.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.160
 So they'll use the right protocol for whatever.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:59.080
 The reason I went in the home, home bridge route is that I wanted to set up some shortcuts

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.720
 on iOS and that requires it working with home kit.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.720
 Yeah.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.720
 And home turns out nothing works with home kit.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:13.680
 So you need home bridge, which is like the home assistant equivalent for Apple, I think.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.680
 Right.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.680
 It's like an open source.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.680
 Yeah.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.680
 Yeah.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.680
 It's such a mess though.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.680
 I know.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.960
 Like trying to get, I've spent so many hours now trying to get a few things that we can't

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.960
 get our shades.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.560
 Like I just, I want to just have an easy life where when I take my phone off the charger

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.800
 in the morning, things happen.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:36.560
 And it turns out that's it can't happen 24 because home kit or sorry, home assistance

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.000
 automation stuff is very good.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.240
 I feel like I can control anything.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.240
 Home assistant.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:47.040
 Well, if I could trigger a home assistant thing from like actions related to my phone, like

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.040
 my location.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.040
 Oh, I can.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.040
 Yeah.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.640
 Because your, your phone shows up as a device and home assistant and your phone has quote

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.640
 unquote sensors.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.080
 So like, there's like a Boolean sensor for whether it's charging or not.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.960
 So you can have an automation that's like, are you kidding me, if it goes from charging

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.440
 to not charging within these hours, like trigger these things.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.800
 Like that's why home assistant's trying to do all this with a shortcuts thing in iOS,

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.520
 just assuming they had some advantage, they could do stuff in there.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:17.040
 But no, this is exactly why I moved also because the, the Google home equivalent, like they

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.520
 have these like automations things.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.100
 And it's just so like, it just can't do anything complicated.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.100
 It's like way too basic.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.100
 Yeah.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.280
 So I entirely ejected out of that.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:29.200
 And what's great about home assistant is, um, you can still like, so you like add all

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.240
 your devices, a home assistant, the home assistant knows about every single time.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.920
 So really, my car is in there, like it knows like, wow, the state of my car has status.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.920
 Yeah.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.920
 Stuff from your car.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920
 Yeah.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:48.140
 And then you can expose those to all these like Apple, iOS, cool home ecosystems where

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.360
 like they see, they think they're directly connected to these devices, but they're not

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.680
 because home assistant is the one that's, it's like a proxy.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.680
 Okay.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.680
 I need to get better at this.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.680
 Yeah.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.680
 Better home assistant.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.480
 And, and then you just have all your automations in, in home assistant and yeah, we have like,

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.480
 we have a couple of funny ones.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:09.160
 I have one that alerts us if we leave the house and both of our bedroom and Liz's office

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.160
 doors are closed.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:15.360
 The reason we need to alert is if we leave them closed, we probably I sound like trapped

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.360
 from the cats in there.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.360
 Oh, the cat.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:21.200
 And if that happens long enough, we're going to come back to a poop in our bed.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.120
 So, oh, no, critical, critical.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.620
 Oh, it's funny.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.620
 I do.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:31.440
 I guess I do have some set up, like when I, but I'm not using homelessness.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.520
 I got to do the home assistant thing.

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:39.200
 But when I like put my phone down on my charger at night and I'm at home, it does like the

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.120
 four things I always have to do every night is like turn on the alarm because we used to

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:48.120
 have the alarm like at a certain time, but then it's like our bed change, our schedule

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.120
 changes.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.880
 And it's like, so I just have it turns on the alarm and turns on the sound machine, puts

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.600
 it in sleep mode, all that kind of stuff.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:33:00.040
 It's really nice to not have that mental overhead of like checklist things.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.040
 I got to go through.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.040
 Yeah.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.040
 Yeah.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.320
 So I definitely recommend buying the home assistant yellow hardware.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:10.080
 Just like a little bit like finally gets you out of this mess of like, is this compatible

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.080
 with this?

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.080
 And is that compatible with that?

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.520
 Would it work from like a basement corner of the house?

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.520
 Yeah.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.520
 Would it connect to stuff?

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.080
 Well, because it's all, it's all mesh, right?

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.120
 So as long as you can reach one device, you can reach all of them.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.120
 Okay.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.120
 Yeah.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.120
 And you can put it anywhere.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.320
 It doesn't have to be near all your other stuff because it's not like high bandwidth or

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.320
 anything.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.320
 It doesn't have to be hardwired.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.320
 Right.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.320
 Yeah.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.320
 It can be all Wi-Fi.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.320
 Yeah.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.320
 Okay.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.320
 There's like plug in your office somewhere and probably be fine.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.320
 All right.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.200
 I can't wait to get rid of home bridge forever because it's awful.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.200
 So bad.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200
 It's stuff is complicated.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.200
 Okay.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.200
 I have things I need from you.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.200
 Okay.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.200
 I'm just going to, I'm going to lay my eye here.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.360
 Uh, one, when, when is the day of this stuff going to get good?

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.120
 AWS released the data data.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.120
 Yeah.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.120
 Data.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.120
 What's it called?

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.120
 Data API.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.120
 For serverless V2.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:02.400
 The deprecated Aurora serverless V1 or they're like force upgrading everyone in a year or something

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.400
 or a couple months.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.400
 I forgot what it was.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.400
 Yeah.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.460
 When can I expect this to make it into the SST construct or what would be a new construct?

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.460
 It's going to be a new construct.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.440
 So we are trying to figure out a name this stuff moving forward.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:17.160
 I think we're going to have like an SST dot MySQL and an SST dot Postgres is a great

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.160
 amount.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.160
 Okay.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.880
 I think there's enough differences between the two that it makes sense.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.920
 Uh, and we realized like going with like recognizable names is much better than doing

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.920
 it.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:27.920
 Not RDS.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.920
 Yeah.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.920
 What is an RDS?

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:30.920
 Yeah.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.920
 So we are, yeah, we are looking into that.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.480
 Uh, it only supports Postgres right now.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.480
 I think the data API B2.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.480
 They said they were going to fast fall with MySQL.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.480
 Yeah.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.000
 And then you guys are using Postgres.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Correct.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Yes.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 Yeah.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Cool.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 And we're using serverless V2.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.560
 So we could start using, we could swap out our RDS proxy with, uh, the data.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.560
 Yeah.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.640
 It's nice that the RDS proxy is no longer a thing or has to be a thing.

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.640
 That is great.

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.640
 I'm excited for the setup.

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:59.200
 We need to figure out though, what we recommend for like dev environments and stuff because

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.160
 the V2 doesn't scale to zero.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.160
 Yeah.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.160
 Right.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.400
 And I think the minimum ends up being like 60 bucks.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.400
 So just local.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.680
 Well, there's like PR, ER environments and stuff.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.000
 Like a lot of people use that workflow and the extent of like PR environments.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 Yeah.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.560
 Dozens of feature branch stuff.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.560
 Hmm.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.560
 Yeah.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.160
 I don't really care about scale to zero anywhere except for that use case like that.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.160
 For that.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.160
 Yeah, it does matter.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:28.440
 So we might like, we should have like a good set of where maybe you can just have one and

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.680
 you can like create a database per feature branch or something.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.680
 Okay.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.680
 So no time commitment.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.600
 You're just going to, you're going to vaguely, you're not going to recommend that.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.520
 This is, this is probably like competing with ION, isn't it?

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.520
 Like you got ION.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.520
 It's going to be an ION.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.680
 I don't think it's going to be in SST.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.680
 Okay.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.680
 It's not going to be in.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.520
 So I'll be on ION when I get to take advantage of all that stuff.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.520
 Yeah.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.000
 I guess I could like probably hack my way around and start using it.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 Yeah.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.560
 You can put, yeah, I can use it directly because we don't, to be honest, we don't do much on

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.560
 top.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.960
 Yeah, that can, that contracts probably pretty light.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.880
 We actually know we used to have to hang on.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.880
 What do we do?

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:04.180
 So I think that the setup we do is we make sure that a pass turned on, we create its

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.720
 own VPC because most people don't have a VPC at all outside of this.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.920
 But that's the case for you already have one.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.920
 So we already have one.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.480
 I don't know if we would be doing much for you there.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.480
 Yeah.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.000
 I might just do it manually or something.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 Yeah.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 We'll see.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 Okay.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.320
 Other thing I need is the secret professor.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.320
 When is that?

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.320
 When is that?

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:29.960
 Tell me, tell Adam he'll have it before 2024 and it's 2024.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:30.960
 It's 2024.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.960
 I don't have it.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.640
 But maybe he did put it in release and I just haven't updated it.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.640
 It's possible.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.640
 It's like basically done forever.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.200
 I don't know why it hasn't come out, but yeah, I know that like saves you guys a ton

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.200
 of money.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.200
 So it is a priority.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.200
 Yeah.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:49.000
 I realized I could have done this after the podcast, but I miss you to Bertrand.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.280
 I don't even care if this is the podcast and I'm talking to people on stream.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.660
 I don't stream anymore, so I have to do this.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.660
 I mean, I'm my stream.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:57.660
 I'm not saying I'm never going to.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.440
 No, I did dream yesterday.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.480
 We were recording our podcast, but it was four of us.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.480
 Ken Wheeler was one of them.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.640
 I don't remember who the fourth one was.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.320
 I remember we were like laughing a lot and it seemed really good and I was sad.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.800
 I mean, four people sounds chaotic.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.800
 Yeah.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.800
 But somehow it was like fine.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.800
 It was what it worked.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.800
 Yeah.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.400
 I don't think it would work in real life, but in my dream, it worked.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.120
 You know, I've had this that just brings up some insecurities of mine that I have to

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.880
 just get on the open.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.640
 I've had this feeling like the two.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:29.440
 I've been to like two tech conferences now, two, three, so I got three.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.440
 I don't know.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.440
 Two or three.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.440
 I went to TwitchCon.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.760
 Yeah, reinvent TwitchCon and render.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.760
 Yeah.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.200
 So I've been to some real life events and I've gotten to hang out with some friends and I

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.120
 just don't feel like I have a personality like I literally don't think I have one in person.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.800
 I already felt like that online, like, I don't know.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.560
 I can't talk about anymore because I'm just insecure about it and I can't talk about

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.560
 things I didn't care about.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.560
 What do you mean you don't have personality?

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.800
 You have a very distinct personality.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.800
 I don't have one.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.800
 I really don't.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.800
 No.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.800
 Really?

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.800
 I just don't.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.240
 Maybe it's only in very small settings.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.400
 I have a personality one on one and that's it.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.080
 But as soon as it's a group, you're just like, you know, you're just like, two or three

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.080
 people.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.440
 I'm just like, okay, you guys are interesting.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.440
 I'm just going to be here hanging out.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.920
 It just sounds like you're an introvert.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:18.920
 Is that what it is?

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.920
 Okay.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.520
 It's because I'm an introvert.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.520
 That sounds weird.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.520
 This is your personality.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.640
 Like this is like whole reaction to me saying that that's what your personality is.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.720
 You're like, wait, there's a label that fully explains everything?

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.640
 Like, yeah, please, that's your personality.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.640
 Okay.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.640
 Coming out right there.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.120
 Well, I guess that doesn't come up in the group settings.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.120
 Yeah.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.120
 I don't know.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.120
 I feel pretty uncomfortable.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.080
 Like, I like being around people.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.320
 I just like people.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:49.240
 I feel like I generally like people and I have people close to me in my life that generally

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.320
 don't like people, like given the choice between liking a person and not liking the

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.320
 person.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.320
 They're probably not going to like the person by default.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:59.520
 I feel like by default, I just like people, even the people that other people don't like.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.520
 So it's not that.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.000
 It's something I don't want to be around people.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 I love it.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.800
 But there's just something about being in a group setting.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.000
 I just feel uncomfortable.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 You know what it is?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.360
 I think it's actually very simple.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.360
 It's something you need to practice.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.520
 And if you're not practice that because I feel the exact same way I've gone through periods

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:20.960
 of my life where I've been like not in group settings for a while and then I'll go into

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:26.520
 one and it'll just feel like I can't get like a word in or like my brain is just kind of

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.520
 blank.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.520
 Yeah.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.520
 Blank.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.520
 So I think it's really just just that.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.240
 And there's been times where I've like been doing it more and I've become very comfortable

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.720
 and then I stop and then I lose practice.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.880
 So I think if I think some people naturally are like very good at that stuff, but I'm

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.920
 also technically an introvert, so trying to kind of lose practice and I can kind of relate

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.920
 to that.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.320
 I feel like reinvent wasn't as bad because you were there and it was like there I didn't

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.920
 feel a pressure to like like we could just talk and hang out and then other people would

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.600
 come around and we'd be around other people and it was just easy.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.240
 Are we wearing the same color shirt?

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.240
 I'm wearing a sweater.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240
 Look at this.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240
 I'm in Miami.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.240
 Yeah.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.240
 Is that like a maroon?

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.240
 In Miami.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.240
 Is that maroon?

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.240
 Yeah, it is.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.240
 So am I.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.240
 Wow.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.240
 Look at that.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.240
 Yeah, I know.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.320
 It's just we've been talking for 43 minutes and I just realized we've got the same shirt

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.320
 on.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.320
 Look at that.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.320
 You've created a conversation.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.320
 I'm so good.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.320
 I'm so good.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.320
 Okay.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:27.320
 Well, I don't feel any better than I did when I first brought up my insecurities, but

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.560
 I'm going to take your word for it.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.560
 I can practice.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.560
 Hey, you're not practiced.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.560
 Why would you be good at that?

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.560
 Yeah.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.560
 Why would I be good at that?

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.560
 If you don't practice.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.560
 I practice a lot of jiu-jitsu.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.560
 I'm not good at it either.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.520
 Maybe I'm not good at it practicing.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:45.120
 I can't wait for React Miami, like all the things I just said aside, the part where I

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.200
 hate being around groups of people and I feel very uncomfortable and I feel like I don't

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.000
 have a personality and I question everything aside from all of that.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 I'm so excited.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.160
 I feel like everyone's going.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.480
 I got to figure out the dates and everything.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:02.080
 I think they're I want to like throw like a little event like before it starts.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.720
 Oh, like a little free party.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:13.120
 There's this like vision in my head where like all of the weirdos from Twitter are just

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.040
 like standing around my front yard.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.440
 It's like so funny that I like want to make it happen.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.440
 Please make it happen.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:25.480
 Because I think the way it works is I think it was an arrive on the first day.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.480
 There's nothing.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.000
 There's technically like the other conference like React Miami is embedded into a bigger

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 conference called e-Merge Americas.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.640
 And I think the first day that everyone's in our ride, there's not any like pure React

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.880
 Miami stuff going on.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.800
 I think Germo's giving a talk at the e-Merge one.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:48.040
 Don't care about that.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:55.160
 So I'm like, oh, if people arrive early enough the first day, I can do like like a mid-afternoon

00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:01.120
 outdoor thing in my house and just invite like everyone that we know, that'd be pretty

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:01.960
 fun.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.960
 So fun.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.960
 Miami in April, right?

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:04.960
 It's in April.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.960
 It'll be great.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:06.960
 It'll be great weather.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.960
 Yeah.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:08.960
 So it won't be disgusting.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:09.960
 Yeah.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.960
 Yeah.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.960
 It's not until like May, June, right?

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.960
 I think it's so gross.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.960
 Yeah.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:14.960
 It'll be perfect.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.960
 Oh, let's make it happen.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.960
 I'd fly in a day early.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:17.960
 If it needs to be a day early, I'm sure a lot of people would.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:18.960
 Yeah.

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:19.960
 Yeah.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:20.960
 If I can like get it together ahead of time.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.960
 Here's my only issue.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:26.160
 My only issue is I only have one bathroom.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.760
 And we've never had like a large thing at our house because I don't know if it can handle

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.760
 the throughput.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.760
 Yeah.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.760
 No, let's just rent some porta-potties.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.760
 Well, that's the thing.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.760
 Should I rent a porta-potty?

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:37.760
 Is that weird?

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.280
 Are there like upper class ones?

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.280
 Sorry.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:41.280
 There are.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.280
 That sounded awful.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.280
 There are.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.280
 I figured there had to be.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:48.120
 There are like fancier ones, which are basically just, I think they show up in like a trailer.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.120
 A trailer.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.360
 And it's just a bathroom.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.360
 Yes.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.360
 That's just like on the back of a trailer.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.360
 It's just a bathroom on wheels.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.360
 Yeah.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.360
 I've been in one.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.360
 Yeah.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.360
 Yeah.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.360
 Yeah.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.360
 The other thing is, here's another option.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:05.320
 I'm big because right across the street from me, there is an empty lot.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:11.080
 The reason it's empty is the person who purchased it many years ago knocked down the house and

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:15.840
 was planning on building two plexus on the other side of the cell.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:21.880
 But this person ended up being indicted for running up like a hundred million dollar real

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:22.880
 estate fraud.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.880
 He got like a crazy place.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.880
 Whoa.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.880
 Like his massive, massive, massive, massive.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:32.880
 So this empty lot has just been sitting there with the court owns it and my landlord has

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.880
 a key to the gate and he opens it every once in a while for we're trying to party people

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:37.880
 can park there.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.040
 But I'm like, you can just have a party right there.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.400
 They just haven't there.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.000
 So that's like another option as well.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.240
 Just a big empty lot.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.720
 What would we, what would you put on it?

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.360
 Just like just like a like part of the lawn chairs.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.360
 Yeah.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.840
 Just like a barn, you know, I mean, it depends on where they got a lot of parties.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.880
 I think I have no further questions.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.800
 I can imagine exactly what it will be like bouncy castle, like, I don't know what, what

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.800
 are you?

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.800
 Okay.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.120
 Those are kind of parties I've been to.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.120
 Yeah.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:12.880
 And it's funny that law is actually my landlord who's in his, who's 60 now, I grew up on the

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:17.720
 house that was on that lot, like moving and he's been on the same street since then.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:22.720
 He's seen all the change that crazy is just like of the street in the neighborhood.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.720
 It's really insane.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:24.720
 I'm so curious.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.720
 He has a key.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.720
 I don't know.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.920
 He's just one of those guys that just has, has like he's been around forever.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.920
 He owns all the houses.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.920
 Yeah.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.920
 It's like our media server.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:33.920
 Don't ask questions.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.840
 This is vague has a key.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.840
 It's fine.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.840
 Yeah.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:38.840
 So I'm very excited.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.960
 And prime was also saying he wanted to do like a stream with, do you remember when he

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.600
 tagged a bunch of people?

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.440
 And then Oh, I do remember.

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.440
 Yeah.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.680
 When you guys are all going to do your thing and then string and then the other things

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:55.880
 behind the piece, I was proud to be fair.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.880
 I was the last one.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:58.880
 He tagged.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.520
 And I was like, what the hell?

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.520
 Why last?

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.200
 I think he wanted.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.920
 I was like, Oh, we're all going to be around for react Miami together in person and react

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.920
 Miami.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.080
 We can do a nice, nice stream.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.280
 I was a really good location to do that.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.440
 And if we end up doing it, if it's like just like the 10 people, I'm so glad prime goes

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.800
 to all these front end things like, why is he going to?

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.800
 Otherwise we'd never see him.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.800
 I don't know.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:21.800
 He's not at all.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.800
 Yeah.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:23.800
 Yeah.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:24.800
 Well, I guess you that's funny.

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.800
 Yeah.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:30.920
 So me prime Theo and one other person are going to be streaming the whole first day.

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.120
 And only Theo does react.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.120
 That's awesome.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.280
 You were in your solid shirt.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.280
 Okay.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.000
 No, I do want to wear.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:48.080
 I have, I have an original solid JS sweater and it's I say original because I think they

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.280
 don't make them anymore, limited edition, sorry, anyone that didn't grab it.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.280
 And I love it.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.280
 I think it looks great.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.280
 I think the font is great.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.280
 I love it.

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.280
 It was great.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.920
 But I don't want to wear a sweatshirt in April in Miami.

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.920
 Yeah.

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.280
 There's not a lot of times in Miami you can wear a sweatshirt.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.960
 I mean, you're wearing one right now, but like, it's cold.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:08.960
 Is it?

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:12.480
 Because it was, we, I just saw we had like the warmest December is like the fifth warmest

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.040
 December ever where I live.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.040
 Yeah.

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.040
 Well, it got down to 60 degrees.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.040
 Oh.

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.040
 God.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.880
 You've done this before.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:20.880
 I literally got sick.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.840
 I'm literally sick right now because oh, yeah, you're sick.

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:27.560
 I feel like I should have been nicer to you on this whole call and took Advil, huh?

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.560
 Yeah, it was cold.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.560
 And I got sick.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.680
 60 degrees is what it takes now.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.680
 I'm sorry.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.680
 I'm sorry.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:38.880
 You got a cold and 60 degree of weather in Miami, the poor thing.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.320
 I've never taken Advil in my life.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.640
 I just realized like I'm an ibuprofen man, I guess.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:43.640
 Advil is ibuprofen.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.640
 Isn't it?

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.640
 Oh, is it?

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.640
 I'm pretty sure Advil is ibuprofen.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.640
 Well, then what's ibuprofen?

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.640
 Sorry that you can't.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:49.640
 You don't get the brand new stuff.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.640
 Oh, it's good.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.640
 I can afford your fancy Advil.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.640
 Advil is just ibuprofen.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.640
 Oh.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.640
 How about that?

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.640
 What do you take?

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.640
 It's a generic.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.640
 Uh, I used to take just ibuprofen.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.640
 I don't know.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.640
 It's called ibuprofen.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.640
 It's like on the bottle.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.640
 It says ibuprofen.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:02.640
 But like, these are like a logo.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.640
 They're a pharmacy.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.240
 I don't take it anymore because I think it messes with my stomach.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.240
 Uh, yes.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.240
 Yeah.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.240
 Is that a thing?

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.240
 Yeah, that's a thing for you too.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.240
 Yeah.

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.240
 Not for you.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:19.560
 Other people, yeah, for weaker people, I actually think it's what caused, uh, my first ER is

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.560
 it.

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.560
 Yeah.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.560
 Cause I was taking a lot of ibuprofen.

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.560
 Yes.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.560
 And I think I do not handle it well.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.560
 Yeah.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.280
 And, uh, yeah, it was like beginning of my jujitsu stuff.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.920
 So I was very sore all the time.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.200
 So I was popping Advil or sorry, ibuprofen.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.200
 That stuff is a miracle.

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.200
 It works really well.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.200
 Like can you imagine?

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.960
 I was talking to Elizabeth this other day that, uh, what did people do before they were

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.960
 just in pain all the time?

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.200
 All the time, I guess.

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.200
 Yeah.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.200
 Insane.

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.840
 I mean, they also died really early, right?

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:48.840
 People just died of stuff.

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.120
 Like you got the flu and you just died.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.800
 Well, if you're in pain all the time, it's kind of a relief to die.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:53.800
 That's true.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.320
 Also kind of permanent.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.280
 Uh, what do you think about all the people?

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.560
 I feel like it's more like public than ever.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:05.080
 All of the like anti-aging, never going to die stuff.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:06.720
 People, people are on this.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.720
 Yeah.

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:08.720
 Well, many people.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:13.000
 This too, because the whole Brian Johnson thing here.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.980
 I don't know why people get so upset at him because he's basically running an experiment

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:21.280
 that's going to be very useful for the world.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.840
 He's spending $2 million a year running his experiment.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.840
 Okay.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.520
 It's, it's selfish to want to live forever, but let's be real.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.520
 We all want to.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.520
 Uh, yeah.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.520
 Sure.

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.520
 And he's just really funny.

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.520
 I find him hilarious.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.520
 So I do too.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.520
 I actually do.

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.720
 I know a lot of people don't like him.

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:42.240
 And I get like the things that they poke at, but like, I, I just think he's quirky and it's,

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.240
 it's funny.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.240
 Yeah.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:49.040
 But the whole $2 million a year thing, it's like, I feel like the, the stuff they're going

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:54.280
 to uncover over the next five years, like we all for pennies can get 80% of the benefit,

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.560
 you know, like we don't have to, we don't have to measure ourselves and do all these

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.640
 things once they uncover whatever they uncover about aging and health.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.960
 So I think it's really awesome.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:03.960
 Yeah.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.960
 Me too.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:09.160
 And living such a crazy extreme life to like do this.

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.160
 Yeah.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.160
 It's good for the world.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.160
 Can you imagine?

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.160
 Yeah.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:17.160
 Like just the way everything that goes in your body, all the food you eat being so calculated,

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.160
 that's not easy.

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.920
 Like it's not an easy existence.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:23.640
 So yeah, hats off to Brian Johnson.

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.640
 Yeah.

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.640
 I don't hate him like everyone else.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:29.400
 But, uh, I also don't think, I know people poke at him, but I feel like his responses are

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.400
 so good.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.000
 I feel you actually can't make fun of him because he'll just his responses just make

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.720
 fun of himself even better than you just did.

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:36.720
 So yeah.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.720
 Yeah.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:38.720
 Yeah.

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:43.440
 I saw one the other day where they were like, uh, they were making fun of him for something

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.600
 and they were like, Oh, imagine being 40 and caring about this stuff.

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.600
 And then he responds going, what do you mean?

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:49.600
 I'm 20.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.600
 I'm very legal.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:51.600
 It's biological.

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:52.600
 What are you doing?

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.600
 Did he like take blood from the sun?

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.600
 Is that like?

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.720
 There's something about that.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.720
 Yeah.

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.240
 And I don't know the details.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:05.200
 I think it's like his response was that it's a common treatment for something and I can't

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.200
 remember what it was.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:10.440
 Uh, but the fact that it was the sun and people like think he looks like a vampire, they just

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.440
 blew it up.

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.480
 Well, the thing I, I'm more curious about the logistics like, okay, if you live near each

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:20.520
 other, how often do you need to donate, how often do you need to do whatever?

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:24.880
 If your son decides to move away, is that like now impacting your health?

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:29.020
 Cause they can't, can't give you his, you don't have your found much use anymore.

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:35.160
 Yeah, I don't plan to go to those extremes, like swapping people's blood in with mine

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.160
 or whatever.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.160
 I'm down to do that.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.160
 I have no problem with that.

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.160
 Why not?

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.160
 Okay.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.160
 Well, it just sounds like needles.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.160
 I just don't like needles.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.160
 I really don't enjoy the poking.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.160
 Yeah.

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.160
 It sucks.

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:51.640
 When exchange for eternal youth, is it eternal youth, like, do we, do we really think, I,

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:55.880
 I had this thought and it's really morbid and it's terrible, but what if it gets hit like

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.640
 in a car accident and gets killed?

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.720
 So this exact same thing, she's like, we're so worried that he's going to die in some

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.720
 ironic day.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.160
 All that, you know, like all that effort.

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.160
 Yeah.

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.160
 Yeah.

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:09.520
 Some like dumb, stupid accident, but it's just like, we need more, we need redundancy.

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:14.320
 I mean, more people do in these experiments with anti-aging stuff because, so you want

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.080
 to clone him is what you're saying.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:21.880
 Maybe or just like, I know there's other studies, other people are going to less drastic extremes.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:27.620
 Uh, just not all our eggs and one Brian Johnson basket, you know, like, cause he's going to

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:28.620
 die of something.

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:29.620
 Yeah.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.820
 If it's not all day, it's just going to be something eventually, right?

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:36.560
 I'm sure we've, we'll learn a bunch, even if he dies, but, uh, yeah, he's ready to do

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.560
 some of this stuff.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.560
 I mean, go through that type of lifestyle.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.560
 Yeah.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.080
 I mean, have you eaten super veggie?

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.840
 It's not delicious.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.840
 What is super veggie?

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:46.840
 No.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.880
 Uh, it's just like his main, uh, now it's like his breakfast.

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:50.880
 What does exactly mean?

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:56.280
 Oh, it's just what he named the meal he eats that's like, it's the lentil, the black lentil

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.040
 based meal.

00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.040
 And that's it.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.040
 It's just lentils.

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.040
 No, no, no.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.560
 It's like a bunch of different veggies and stuff.

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.680
 And sometimes he blends it into like a hummus.

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.400
 It's like his every breakfast, I think.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:11.000
 So then he has nutty pudding for like his second meal, he has three meals a day.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 Yeah.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 This is always changing too.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 That's the thing about Brian Johnson.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.300
 If you follow this stuff, it's like every month, it's a different take on, cause they're

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.300
 learning stuff.

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.560
 I mean, they're measuring all those things, right?

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:25.560
 Uh, so now that super veggies is first meal and then he has the nutty pudding, which is

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:26.560
 delicious.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.080
 It's like macadamia nuts.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.280
 It's just like tons of nuts and cocoa and she's like a pudding.

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:33.440
 It's like a chia pudding.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.440
 It's delicious.

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.600
 Uh, and then the third meal, he has some actual variants.

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.200
 Like it's not the same meal every day.

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:43.120
 So he has some like sweet potato meals and other stuff.

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.640
 Anyway, super veggie is not great.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:51.040
 I mean, it's a lot of nutrition, just not a super tasty, like can't wait to wake up

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.040
 and eat my super veggie.

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:56.000
 But like, how much does this differ from your diet?

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.040
 Like what are you eating that he's not?

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.880
 Uh, what am I eating that he's not?

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:05.720
 Uh, so we vary our meals more.

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:11.320
 So we don't stick to like, we're not like he talks about every, uh, every calorie has

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.880
 to fight for its right to be in each of his meals.

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.640
 We're not that like judicious.

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.440
 Is that the word?

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.440
 Is that a word?

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:23.080
 Diches means like you're fair or like reasonable.

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.080
 Oh, no.

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.080
 We're not that legalistic.

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.840
 I don't know what's the word.

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:27.840
 It's strict.

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:28.840
 Strict?

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:29.840
 I don't know.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:30.840
 Stick with some words.

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.840
 Okay.

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:32.840
 Here's my thing.

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:36.120
 I think we all knew all the words we needed to do by the time we were like 15 years old,

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.920
 and we don't need to add more words.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:38.920
 Yeah.

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.440
 And then we just keep trying to, yeah, get smarter.

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.440
 Yeah.

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:48.160
 Did you see that author on Twitter though that took down, uh, somebody that went communist?

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.160
 What was it?

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.160
 Did you see this?

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.160
 What?

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:57.840
 Uh, former, former, sorry, very weird sentence, uh, former Twitch CEO.

00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:58.840
 What's this name?

00:53:58.840 --> 00:53:59.840
 Yes.

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:05.200
 I did see some of this or former interim CEO, that guy, the opening eye, open eye eye, see

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.200
 what ever his name is.

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.200
 I can't think of his name.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.200
 Edward.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:09.200
 No, I meant something.

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.200
 I'm sure.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.200
 Thank you.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.200
 Emmett Sheer.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.200
 Basically tweeted.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.200
 You didn't see any of this.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.840
 I kind of saw it.

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.840
 Oh, like I'm so glad I get to catch you up.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.840
 Yes.

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.840
 But you kind of saw it.

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:20.840
 We'll see.

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:24.440
 Uh, maybe, maybe somebody listening didn't see any of it because they're not a degenerate

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:25.440
 on Twitter.

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:31.800
 Uh, Emmett Sheer tweets, you know, inheritance is like dumb and we should just split it up

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.640
 between everybody and like, was this an Akita that sort of this?

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:41.440
 Oh, I don't know because maybe beer posted something like that where like a hundred percent

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.600
 tax on death and everyone else.

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.160
 Yeah.

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:51.000
 Because they did in this scenario when Emmett said similar things.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:57.040
 This author though, he wrote like a science fiction novel and I got to get his name.

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.040
 Who?

00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.040
 Ted Chiang.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:05.840
 Uh, I don't know who that is, I don't think so because that's not familiar.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:09.800
 The author's name is it's going to be worth it.

00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:10.800
 Just wait.

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.800
 Devin Erickson.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.240
 We'll put that in the show notes.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:17.120
 What did he do?

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:19.440
 So he wrote, he's an author, right?

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.440
 So he's good with words.

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:24.040
 He knows lots of big ones and knows when to use them.

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:30.520
 And he wrote this amazing, like I think he quote tweeted maybe or screenshot it, Emmett's

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:36.560
 tweets and just wrote this amazing like takedown of what's wrong with Emmett's line of thinking

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:42.720
 and it dives into so many things that I care about or just like things that really make

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:50.200
 me feel good, like when people poke at Silicon Valley elite people and he just like goes,

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.320
 he just tears it down.

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:54.240
 And then Emmett has replies and then he just tears those replies down.

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.680
 I think tore them down.

00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:00.480
 I guess someone might be like on the other side of the argument thinking, I don't know.

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:05.720
 It's hard for me to imagine that you could argue against Devin's words because they were

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:07.920
 so well put and there's a lot of them.

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.360
 I feel like I might end up on the other side.

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.360
 Which side?

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.400
 You think we should tax the inheritance?

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.400
 Okay.

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:18.880
 So my perception of this situation was Nikita Beard tweeted in his usual style, which is

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:23.920
 like very extreme and crazy because he's trying to like, yeah, provoke a conversation.

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.960
 Whole set of people take it way too literally and they're like a hundred percent like that

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:27.960
 makes no sense.

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:28.960
 Like you can't tax a hundred percent.

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:29.960
 Just okay, whatever.

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:38.000
 But the point being like the underlying principle is if you are capitalist and you like capitalism,

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.960
 which I am, I'm like extremely pro-capitalism, you know that about you, yeah, you should

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:50.600
 be pro something like this in this direction because inheriting a lot of wealth, that is

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:55.240
 kind of what leads to non-capitalist systems where you have like wealth that gets conserved

00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:00.160
 over years without ever like being redistributed or like reused in useful ways.

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.160
 Interesting.

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:05.960
 And you end up with like a landlord type class that doesn't actually develop anything, but

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:10.200
 they can just kind of live comfortably off of wealth that was created, genuinely created

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.860
 by someone, you know, a long time ago.

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:14.520
 Of course, hundred percent doesn't make sense.

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.520
 I don't know what percent makes sense.

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:20.400
 I don't even know if it needs to be a percent, but like fundamentally this is it's like not,

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.400
 it like breaks capitalism when wealth can accrue.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:28.280
 Capitalism requires like stuff being created, stuff being destroyed when it's bad like reallocating

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.720
 stuff to more efficient places.

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:34.880
 So yeah, they're like, I'm fine with someone becoming a billionaire if they are someone

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:39.960
 that like that created the wealth and like figured out how to do that and was a good capital

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:40.960
 allocator.

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:45.600
 I can trust them with that stuff to continue to do stuff that's productive and efficient

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.200
 more than the average person.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.200
 Their kids.

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.200
 I don't know.

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.360
 I don't know if I like feel like their kids I can trust.

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.360
 Yeah.

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:59.120
 I feel like history tells us that it's very hard for that to like repeat across multiple

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.120
 generations.

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.120
 I mean, Trump did it.

00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:05.720
 He took his dad's money and built amazing things, right?

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.720
 That's true.

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.720
 He didn't make it bigger.

00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:08.720
 I mean, it's technically true.

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.720
 Yeah.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.720
 Oh, maybe.

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.720
 I don't know.

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:12.720
 Yeah.

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.720
 I was thinking of another example.

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.720
 Oh, Elon Musk and Trump.

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:15.720
 They both inherited something, right?

00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.720
 I don't know.

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.520
 I think Elon Musk one is not really like, I think that's really in here.

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.520
 Yeah.

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.720
 His dad was kind of a storyteller, I think.

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:23.720
 Yeah.

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.720
 That's what it seems like.

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.720
 Yeah.

00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:31.560
 Oh, yeah, like very few generations like grow it, they usually just either depleted or like

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:32.560
 just keep it flat.

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:39.200
 And that's why like, so Bill Gates does this thing with his, he's the one behind the pledge

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.200
 or whatever.

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.360
 So the money he donates.

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.360
 Wasn't that buffet?

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.360
 Yeah.

00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.360
 Buff it.

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.360
 Yeah.

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:51.520
 But they when they, when they died, they're going to donate a large percent of their wealth

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:56.880
 to these, these foundations, they mandate that it has to be spent within X number of

00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:57.880
 years.

00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:58.880
 Oh, interesting.

00:58:58.880 --> 00:58:59.880
 Because the most.

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:00.880
 That's very capitalist.

00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:01.880
 Yeah.

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:02.880
 Because like, realistically, you know exactly what's going to happen.

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:07.200
 This foundation is going to do nothing and then just like coast off of like the gains and

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.720
 like have very little impact and do like, you know, you can see how that, that's kind

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:11.720
 of what would happen.

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:16.480
 So they wanted to all be spent in 50 years to have like as much impact as possible.

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:20.120
 So yeah, I like get where it's all coming from.

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:26.400
 I don't know if this guy that replied, if that's what he was cooking at or or I don't

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.400
 either.

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.560
 I'm not smart enough that you should read it off.

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.280
 You should read the tweets because I thought they were very well worded.

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:35.640
 None of it matters because no one's inheriting anything when we all live forever.

00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:36.800
 Who cares?

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:38.240
 There's no such things inheritance.

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.240
 That's true.

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:41.320
 That is true.

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.320
 Thanks, Brandon Johnson.

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.440
 That's a problem solving that's a whole new problem.

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.440
 Whole new problem.

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:51.640
 So was he saying that and it was being communist by saying this?

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:52.640
 Yes.

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:53.640
 I know that much.

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:54.640
 Yeah.

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.640
 It's just funny because I think it's the opposite.

00:59:55.640 --> 01:00:02.240
 I think if you are really dedicated capitalism, you do do this thing that seems like because

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.960
 it's all redistributing wealth that that seems like a not capitalist thing, but actually

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.400
 is one of the most capitalist things you can interest me in favor of.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:13.840
 Well, now you've got me all jumbled because I just take the most like whatever the most

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:19.200
 coherent argument was that a last heard doesn't have to be the most coherent argument.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.200
 Yeah.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.400
 If it was coherent at all, then that's the thing I believe.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.720
 So now I don't know who to believe because I believe what you just said, but also those

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:26.920
 tweets they were so good.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.920
 I got a little.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.160
 I mean, you're really impressed.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.200
 So I mean, I'm really impressed.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.320
 I like I followed him.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.320
 I might buy his book.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.320
 I don't even need fiction.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.400
 I'm going to go straight into his kids pockets.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.400
 Okay.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.560
 Here's another thing.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.600
 I don't know if this is how it plays out in other people's families, but I'm not

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:49.400
 inheriting anything from my parents because like, I'm going to be pretty old by the time.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.600
 Like, I'm not like waiting on a hair and said it's going to land.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:57.360
 I'm like 60 years old, you know, like maybe my grandkids, but like, maybe my parents grandkids

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.760
 like my kids.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.440
 So it's usually going to the grandkids.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.400
 And do you really trust someone's grandkids?

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.560
 You know what I mean?

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.560
 I think so.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:11.360
 I think I know what you mean, just read the tweets and then come back to me and please

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:14.880
 explain to me who's right, because I don't know anymore and I don't want to become something

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.880
 I shouldn't be.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.880
 I don't know.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.880
 I'll follow anybody.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.880
 Just make a good argument.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.240
 I think with all these things, it's like, I think that people that pointed out this problem

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.920
 in our system where like stuff just a cruise, I think that is a real problem and we need

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.640
 to be aware of that.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.120
 And we need to like deal with it.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120
 It's hard to though.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.000
 Like it just feels unfair to say you can't pass stuff down to your kids or you can't even

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.400
 pass down X percent to your kids.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.400
 Yeah.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.120
 And that probably creates all kinds of side effects where if you like put in laws to place,

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.480
 like they might find ways around it and create a worse situation like that.

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.480
 I don't know.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.080
 But it is like a good concept that people should be aware of.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.480
 Do you see my eyes glazing over?

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.800
 This is the point where we have to talk about something else because I have nothing to add.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.760
 Because you have no personality.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.280
 I have no personality.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.800
 I guess we should probably get out here because it is it's over an hour now.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.800
 An hour?

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.800
 We're out of practice.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:07.080
 I think we used to just like stop at an hour and now I can't actually read it.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.400
 I don't know what it says, but I know it's been over an hour.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.400
 This is 106.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.400
 Oh, not bad.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.400
 Look at us.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.400
 Getting it back.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.120
 Hey, we're only like 30 episodes away from 100.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.400
 Every single episode, you're very excited to get to 100.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.520
 You're a lot more excited to get to 100 than I am.

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.400
 It's I'm building up this hundred thing.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.320
 I'm moving just a social contract, man.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.320
 Oh, yeah.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:26.320
 Right.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.320
 They're all made up.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.320
 Yeah.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.320
 It's going to feel like an accomplishment though.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.880
 Once we've done 100 episodes, you know what I'm saying?

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.240
 We should really just do 99 and then stop forever.

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.240
 Wouldn't that be funny?

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.240
 No.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.240
 That'd be a pretty funny build up.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.240
 We know.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.240
 We'll think about it.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.240
 10,000 episodes.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.240
 How about that?

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.240
 10,000.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.120
 I read that you can't you don't get good at podcasting till you put in 10,000 episodes

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.120
 worth.

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.120
 No, you didn't read that.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120
 It's true.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120
 Did you really?

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120
 No, 10,000.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.120
 No, podcasts didn't go that far.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.120
 They've done the research.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.880
 They've done the and the and the analytics.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.880
 You're making this up.

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:55.880
 They crunch the numbers.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.600
 They put it into a machine learning model and 10,000.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.200
 So they're saying no podcasts are good basically.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:07.040
 Why is it run doing this?

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.040
 Whatever happened to like.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.040
 So cereal.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.040
 I listened.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.040
 Did you listen to cereal?

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.040
 We talked about those.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.040
 I don't like those.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.040
 Remember, like I'm not a big fan of crime ones.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.040
 You don't like those.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.040
 Okay.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.040
 Well, I want another one.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.040
 People love cereal.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.040
 I loved it.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.040
 I loved all the seasons of it.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.040
 Well, except for the bow, whatever one.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.040
 That was stupid.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.640
 But I like I want something like that to listen to again.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.280
 So you want more crime to happen so that you can enjoy it.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.280
 Is it crime?

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.280
 Am I attracted to the crime?

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.280
 I don't think so.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.320
 What cereal is about crime stuff, right?

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.320
 It was a crime.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.320
 Yeah.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.320
 It was like a, uh-huh.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:41.000
 S town, part of the same like production group, the people that made cereal, made S town.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.160
 It's like seasoned some.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.800
 Not really a crime thing.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.960
 It's just like about this guy.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.920
 So I think it's just good storytellers.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:53.760
 Someone reply to something, I don't know, send us a message on Twitter or something and

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.840
 give us some good podcast, uh, like nonfiction recommendations.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.840
 I would like a good podcast series to listen to.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.720
 I feel there's a lot of what you're looking for.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.280
 Oh, do you know some?

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.000
 Well, not me, I don't really listen to podcasts, but Liz has consumed a lot of stuff.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
 Okay.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
 Maybe have listened to me.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
 Isn't it a lore?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
 No.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
 Never heard of it.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
 Okay.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
 You might like it.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
 Like L-O-R-E.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
 Yeah.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.600
 I think it's like, I think they do like, uh, it's not, it's nonfiction.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.200
 I think it's like real stuff, but stuff that is almost like mythical or like, oh, common

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.200
 forklift.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.200
 Okay.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.900
 Frightening history behind common folklore.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:29.900
 This sounds really good.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:30.900
 Yes, folklore.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:31.900
 That's the word.

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:33.640
 That's the word that they use on the website.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:34.640
 Yeah.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:35.640
 Big plus.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.620
 We listened to a few of these things when we drive, when we used to drive from Miami,

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:38.620
 New York.

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:39.620
 So I've sampled a few things.

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:40.620
 Nice.

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:41.620
 Okay.

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.620
 I'm going to, I'm going to sample this one as well.

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:46.560
 Uh, it was funny, uh, Liz the other night on New Year's.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.560
 That was funny.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.560
 I saw the next morning.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:52.660
 What's funny about it is I tweeted and then I went to sleep and then five hours later,

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.200
 she says, go to bed.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:05:01.440
 I was literally almost done sleeping about like, uh, sleep and then five hours after that,

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.160
 she's like, sorry, I'm, I was drunk.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.160
 Yeah.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.160
 I'm drunk.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.160
 But what was it a reply to?

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.160
 It was fine.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.960
 I think it was in reply to a very Adam type tweet.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.280
 Oh, was it?

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:14.320
 I mean, when you're drunk, it was like, it was an Adam type tweet and it was a, I think

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:19.400
 it was the one I asked, uh, if I have bruises and black eyes and stuff, well, that detract

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.920
 from my educational video.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.920
 Okay.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.920
 Okay.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.920
 Exactly.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.920
 Perfect.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.720
 I really need to know, because I need to know if I take like a break from Jiu Jitsu to

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:27.720
 do a course.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:28.720
 Okay.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:33.920
 I said, no, do it, it'll be fun or like it'll be interesting and some people said yes that

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:34.920
 they would be distracted.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:39.880
 I said, don't like, I don't, I don't think, okay, here's, here's how I think about it.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.880
 Yeah.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:46.680
 You put in all this work, making this course and you look back on it and like there's like

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.960
 a flaw on your face, like I know how you are.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.480
 I feel like that's going to annoy you.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.480
 Right?

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.480
 Yeah.

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:54.480
 Yeah.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.760
 Can you see like, can you see my gee burns?

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:57.760
 I've got my nose.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.760
 It's like all brooms.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:01.280
 I mean, the quality isn't great on Riverside, but I can't see anything.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.280
 Oh, probably.

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.280
 Yeah.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.280
 Oh, thanks.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.360
 Well, hey, this is about as bad as my faces looked in Jiu Jitsu, like the most I've had

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.680
 like marks on my face.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.600
 So if you can't really tell right now, then I might be in the clear.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.200
 I always picturing like a scar, like a black eye.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.720
 I've had one black eye.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.160
 So that would be a possibility as well.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.160
 But I don't know.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:20.080
 I feel like it would just drive you crazy if you just seriously, what are you saying

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.080
 I should do?

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:24.760
 Stop doing Jiu Jitsu or wait to record my course until my face looks better.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.520
 I mean, I don't think your face looks weird right now.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.520
 I don't know.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.520
 Send me a sample.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.120
 Send me like a HD sample and I'll give you thumbs over them sound.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.120
 Yeah.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.120
 And full 4K.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.120
 I'll do it.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.120
 Yeah.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.120
 Open game.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.120
 Okay.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.120
 Let's get off here.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.120
 Okay.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.120
 Thanks, thanks.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.120
 I don't even have to pee or anything.

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.120
 Just we're just going.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.120
 We're just leaving.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.040
 Did you finish your list of things you need from me?

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.880
 No, I didn't.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.120
 I gave you two.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.720
 There was at least three.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.720
 Uh, the day they die.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.720
 Oh, yes.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.720
 Secret Prefecture.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.520
 Sometime in 2025 you'll get me that one.

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.520
 Secret Prefecture.

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.520
 That one.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:06:59.520
 Yeah.

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:00.520
 If you follow up with Frank, just let me know.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.600
 Or I could follow up with Frank.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.680
 There was a third thing and I can't remember.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.880
 I was going to write these down.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.320
 It was so important that I almost wrote all of them down.

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:10.520
 But I didn't.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:11.520
 It's okay.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.520
 All right.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.520
 See you next.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.520
 All right.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:15.520
 See you as miss Frank.

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.520
 See you.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:28.040
 Bye.
