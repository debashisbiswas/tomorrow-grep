00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 People commented that I am a skinwalker, or I look like a skinwalker, or I'm definitely AI.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.000
 Listen, I'm not AI, ah, could AI do this? That's what I thought.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 So, look, I'm a person, I'm a human being with real feelings.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.300
 I don't actually have real many feelings. Oh my God, I am AI.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.800
 Am I a real boy?

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.600
 No, Pinocchio. To make Jupetto's wish come true will be entirely up to you.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.600
 Up to me? Prude yourself brave, truthful and unselfish, and someday you will be a real boy.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.600
 A real boy!

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 I've been in hell for the past like 48 hours.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.600
 Oh, really? I feel like you've been quieter than normal. What's been going on?

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.600
 Yeah, so, you know this multiplexer thing that I showed you?

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 Yes.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.600
 And I was like, okay, it's basically done.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 It was pretty hard to put together, like not doing a little bit of terminal stuff like that,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 but thankfully I glued together a bunch of random code that I found on GitHub and I got something working.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 And the last step was to support scrolling.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 Oh, no.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 And I was like, okay, I checked a while ago.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 There was a scroll function in one of the libraries that I'm using.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 So, let me just map it up.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 So, I mapped it up and it turns out that it does not work.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:55.600
 Like, their understanding what scroll meant was totally different than what I needed, which is like keeping a scroll back buffer so you can scroll up and down your output.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 So, I was like, okay, what does this mean?

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 And I started digging more into, okay, what do I need to do to support this?

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 And it like unraveled everything, like pretty much everything that I was relying on could not work.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600
 I had to go like one level lower.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.600
 The past 48 hours, I've just been like figuring out what the hell to do.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.600
 And like, I'll solve one thing and there's like so many cascading issues.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.600
 And for the last, I would say like eight hours or so, I've been struggling with this one issue where.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.600
 So in my multiplex here, when I spawn processes, everything's working.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.600
 But when I spawn a fancy process, like one that like the terminal website or the terminal server, for example, or.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:43.600
 But the STF that does like more complex stuff inside terminal, it would like a lag for five seconds for it started. I was like, what the hell is this issue.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.600
 I've been trying to track it down the last eight hours and literally five minutes ago, I found it.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 Nice.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.600
 There is a, but the answer.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.600
 So, I mean, I don't know what the fix is, but I know the problem is I traced it all the way down to where it's freezing.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:07.600
 And there is 10 lines commented out in this low level library that I'm using that says to do.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.600
 Oh, that's good.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.600
 Yeah.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.600
 So you've got it right.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.600
 Those two lines.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600
 Yeah, I got to figure that out.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:27.600
 It's a, yeah, the stuff is interesting because, you know, like the stuff we're using for, for terminal bubble tea.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.600
 That gives us a high level abstraction over building UIs in the terminal.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.600
 And if you keep going lower and lower level, it gets like more and more crazy.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.600
 But if you go like low level enough, it gets simple again, because it's just like the most basic stuff.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.600
 I mean, it's the complexity comes from the fact that it can't do much on its own.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.600
 Like you have to implement all the functionality yourself, but the underlying system is very, very easy.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.600
 It's just like a grid and you can move the cursor and like paint on the grid.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.600
 And when you get down to that level, that that's all there is.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.600
 There's nothing else.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.600
 And you can paint text and you can change like the color of the text.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.600
 You can change it, whatever.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.600
 And if you want to like update it, you like repaint the screen.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.600
 It's like very, very straightforward.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 But yeah, it's been quite a journey.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.600
 I am in love with terminal UIs.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.600
 I think it's so fun.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.600
 Me too.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.600
 It's like this whole world that, yeah, I mean, you've been engrossed in it.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.600
 So you've, you know, where I'm coming from, like building the terminal shop.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.600
 There's, there's just parts of it that tickle the brain in ways that hasn't been tickled in a while.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600
 You know what I mean?

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.600
 It's been a lot of building stuff in the browser.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.600
 And this has been so refreshing to build back to the basics.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.600
 What's cool about it is, I think there's this dream for the browser where there's like a

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.600
 really rich set of components that every website uses and everything kind of same.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600
 It's consistent, et cetera.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.600
 But obviously it will never happen on web and the web has different goals.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.600
 But you kind of have that in the terminal just because there's so many constraints.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.600
 Like you can't even have like one element that's one font size.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.600
 Another amount of different font size.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.600
 So that like standardizes all UIs.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.600
 And then people can theme their stuff locally so that all the apps look the same and match

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.600
 each other.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.600
 So it's like a different take on like optimizing for different, different goals.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.600
 It's like optimizing more for standardization.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.600
 You lose out on some of the creativity, but you kind of get this like I get to build the

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600
 experience that I want.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.600
 And no matter what app I'm using, it's going to look the same as a user.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.600
 Yeah.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.600
 So a few thoughts in response to your specific situation.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.600
 First, I'm glad I didn't start using it.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.600
 I guess you said I could start using the you had a version of it.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.600
 Well, I was using it and I was like, wow, and I'll be able to scroll up the logs.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.600
 It's like really bad.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.600
 It's really not usable without that.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.600
 Yeah.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.600
 Well, I hadn't gotten to using it.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.600
 So you added it to terminal.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.120
 The second thought is, man, scroll, scroll sucks, scroll in the terminal.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.600
 Like the bubble tea solution to it, there's like a bubble, which is like a component for

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.600
 scrolling.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.600
 Right.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600
 And it's given us a lot of issues.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.600
 Like there's still all kinds of outstanding stuff in terminal that I want to fix.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.040
 Terminal to capital T. When you have a company named, what in the world, why did my music

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040
 just start?

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.040
 Hang on.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.040
 Okay.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.040
 So title, title, do you use title or Spotify?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.040
 I used to back in the day, I'm back on Spotify now.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.040
 So I use Spotify in my headphones.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.040
 Oh, geez.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.040
 Where did you go?

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.800
 I use Spotify in my headphones, but I've been playing title because I got these speakers.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.040
 I got speakers, physical speakers, again, like computer speakers.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.040
 It's been a long time.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040
 They're not computer speakers.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.040
 They're like these kef.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040
 I don't know.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.040
 Yeah.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.040
 Yeah.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.040
 They're awesome.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.040
 I got this quality.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.760
 So I got the title for that, but title will just randomly start playing.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.760
 I've noticed this.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.280
 I leave that all the time and it'll just start randomly playing for no reason.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.280
 I can stop it.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.280
 That's so funny.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.280
 I'm just.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.000
 They should fix that because that means they're paying more to the artist.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 Oh, good point.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Yeah.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 No, but like I've come to my computer like in the morning and it's been playing overnight

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 for sure.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.120
 So there's definitely a bug there they need to figure out.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.800
 This scrolling thing's funny because I think it.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.680
 So even though this was hell for the last 48 hours, I think there was something about

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.140
 it that I felt like I'd been missing for a while.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.200
 So I think we've talked about how when I do normal development these days, like if I'm

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:43.960
 making a web application or whatever, things have gotten so simple and abstracted and it

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.040
 feels like I'm writing configuration more than I'm programming.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.720
 You haven't written any next year, slightly, have you?

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.320
 Especially next year, it's like really like you're programming.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.280
 You feel like you're writing configuration.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.760
 The simple is not the word I was thinking of with my experiences lately.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.760
 I wouldn't say.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.760
 Okay.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.240
 So yeah, maybe simple isn't the right word.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.680
 It's that you're, you're operating in such like a high level that I feel like I've lost

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.200
 the feel of programming, like it doesn't feel like I'm programming.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200
 Yeah.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.200
 Yeah.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.480
 But with this type of works, again, if mine is scrolling, right, there's like very like

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.080
 programming, programming stuff to it, right?

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.080
 Yeah.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.080
 What is scrolling?

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.000
 It's just calculating when the height of your buffers outside the height of the screen

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.480
 and like putting it into a different matrix.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:35.120
 And then when someone hits scroll, like they want to scroll up one, you like render a part

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.560
 of that matrix and then part of the active screen.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.240
 But then what if it's like more stuff is printing while they're scrolling?

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.560
 Like how do you manage all that?

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:50.080
 That to me really scratches what I think I've been missing for a while, which is like just

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:57.240
 the very basic arithmetic to do that, the very basic logic to do that, that to me feels

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.240
 like programming.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.560
 And I think a lot of that is basically gone from the day to day.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.560
 Okay.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.560
 I have a lot to say here.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.560
 I'm sorry.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.560
 Yeah.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.200
 I'm going to do that thing where I talked to much and you just got stopped me.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.360
 But this is tying together a lot of thoughts I've had, which is like, I've said it, I don't

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.560
 have to sit on the podcast, but I've said it before that I just, I hate that newcomers

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.360
 are being shoved into like react because it's just such a different thing than what I started

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.640
 programming in, not that everybody has to start programming the way we started programming.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.400
 But exactly what you're saying, doing this like terminal UI and go has like brought back

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.080
 that like, Oh yeah, this, like this is what programming computers used to feel like.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:40.440
 I'm not writing react hooks and stuff that just feels so like different from programming.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.680
 It takes me back to like early, when I was in college and I, or when I first started dating

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.120
 Casey, my now wife, I made her like a little tile game, like a picture, scramble up the

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.200
 picture.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.120
 And like you slide the tiles around and I made it like wind forms or something.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.240
 It was like super old school, but it ran on her laptop and the doing that kind of stuff,

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.800
 like the math for like figuring out where the tiles can go and can't go and like moving

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.680
 them around and how you would represent that, you know, in state, that kind of stuff.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.680
 Yeah.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.720
 It's connected from it, writing a modern web app, like in some ways, that's great.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.920
 All the abstractions we have are wonderful.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.760
 In other ways, it just feels less and less like this familiar thing.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.760
 I don't know.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.760
 Is that going away?

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.920
 Is like our roots of programming?

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.400
 Is that just going to be like a thing you do?

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.960
 It's like a hobby, but it's not really part of day to day business operations.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.960
 Yeah.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.920
 I've been trying to figure out, I don't think it was until this week, I really understood

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.840
 what like I felt like something was off and then after this week, I think I really understand

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.840
 what was off.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.520
 But so I'm still trying to understand how I feel or think about it.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.520
 Yeah.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.720
 It's just like in certain scenarios, I have certain goals, right?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:53.600
 So when me and Liz are working on radiant, here's a perfect example of this.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.800
 We have like the ultimate boss of lists.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.000
 We have a list that needs to be keyboard navigatable, needs to be able to multi select

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 toggle it.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.920
 And all these little details that we need to get right.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:11.520
 And in that situation, it's a little frustrating to have to do the programming parts.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.080
 Because yeah, like I'm, I'm actually excited about something quite different with that

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.080
 project.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.720
 Like I'm not trying to get into those details.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.560
 It's kind of like a like a burden.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.120
 It's funny because I did end up implementing it because I have this problem everywhere.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.840
 Like in the SEC console, like everywhere at this keyboard navigator list is the problem.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.360
 And I was talking in the solid discord about it and literally the next day, like one of

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.880
 the best solid people like happened to just build a list thing for it right after I spent

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.960
 like time, time doing it, which again, it was fun.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.800
 But like it wasn't, it's not a point of that of that project.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.720
 But like I can't letting that go to zero where I'm never doing that stuff feels hollow to

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.720
 me.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.040
 It feels like I've like over optimized on something to a weird, weird place.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.200
 I don't know if it goes away in terms of like it's only like a fake thing you do for

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.200
 fun.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.600
 Like if I look at my other work at SST, I'm there, there's unique work of there too,

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.600
 but it's quite different.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.160
 So the work there is like designing very good abstractions, which is not like this, but

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.400
 it's also very like stimulating and interesting.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.400
 Yeah.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:20.600
 But yeah, I think it just goes to show there's so many like sub categories of program, so

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:27.840
 like zones, your brain is in, and it does feel off when you're not getting to do all

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.840
 of them.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.240
 And I guess a lot of people might not even be aware that there are different zones.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.240
 That's the thing.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.280
 So many people just operate in the one zone probably for their day job and they don't

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.280
 tickle all those zones.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.040
 I think like being a part of small companies, being a founder, we probably get more of that

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.640
 on average than the average dev, I guess.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.960
 Like I think of the thing that makes me think of, I think I've said this before.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.680
 I don't know where I said it, or I may be tweeted it.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:00.080
 It reminds me of like, like you can just buy like a glass jar at the store and they're

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.520
 made like by the thousands in some factory, we can also go to Silver Dollar City, which

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:09.160
 is like this old timey amusement park here in Branson, Missouri.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.320
 You can go there and watch people blow glass and they do it through the tube and they like

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.360
 they have the furnace and they heat up the stuff and whatever.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.280
 But it's like they're wearing these old timey clothes and they're like behind these glass

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.720
 panels and you just watch them and people are lined up just watching them blow glass.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.600
 I feel like that's what some of the like roots of programming you're going to feel like.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.640
 It feels more and more like this novel thing, like remember when we used to do this stuff,

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:38.080
 but it's like commercialized to the Instagram, we have always abstractions and now you'd

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.840
 never need to do this stuff, but some people did do it for fun, like on stream or something.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.840
 I don't know.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.880
 When you do like weird versions of it, yeah, that might be a two thing.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.640
 So the first thing is, I'm sure you can relate to this because you spend time as a consultant.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:59.840
 I will never stop being like mind blown by how when I'm working on something that feels

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.840
 very, very specific for one project, it like somehow shows up on the other project too.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.520
 And I can never tell whether I'm forcing it or if it's just actually happening, like what

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.680
 are the chances that we do this like crazy terminal thing for our coffee thing and then

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.920
 like the biggest problem we have at SST is that we need to build like a lower level terminal.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.920
 That's really odd.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:22.920
 Yeah.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.200
 And then if you look at what Prime did, Prime did the whole doom and ask you the thing.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200
 The doom.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200
 Yeah.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.200
 I think it was one of the best videos ever.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.200
 I think that was so good.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.160
 I feel like it's incredible to a whole new thing.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.160
 Yeah.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.600
 You're so entertaining and so interesting.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:42.320
 He's doing a bunch of like ASCII like like terminal character quotes over the exact same

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.000
 thing I've been staring at the past week.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.200
 So it's like, how is this happening?

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.640
 Is this just pure coincidence?

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.840
 Are we like forced?

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.240
 Is there like some correlation here where it's in our heads and we're actually making

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.240
 it happen?

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.920
 It's always mind blowing when, when that's the case.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.920
 Yeah.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.400
 I'd love it if we could somehow create an industry shift back to terminal UIs.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.400
 I know.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.360
 We'd some more coffee that way.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.200
 There's more tension on the terminal.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.880
 It is wild because someone picked up on this because we've had the experience where we

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.440
 go in and like place an order and everything's already set up and like, this is the best

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.920
 checkout experience that exists here.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.920
 It's so good.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.920
 Now.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.560
 And then I saw someone, someone did a reorder and they were like, what the hell, this is

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.560
 so great.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.920
 They're like, everything was saved and it was so easy.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.920
 Yeah.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.760
 Once it's got your card and your address, yeah, it's you don't want to open a browser anymore.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.880
 It is wild when you step back and you forget everything that exists and you're like, the

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.720
 goal is to build the best possible experience.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:46.480
 This actually is the best possible experience and it is, it is really crazy that how so much

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.960
 gets in the way of that and we like convince ourselves of other stuff.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.040
 But yeah, I mean, obviously I don't think the world will shift to this, but there is

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.520
 something to be learned, I think from it.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.800
 There will be more e-commerce experiences in the terminal.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.960
 I know that we've inspired enough people.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.960
 That's going to happen.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.960
 Right.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.760
 There's been too many people like very excited about this, even if it's not in the terminal,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:14.160
 I'm just like, there's nothing innate about the terminal that like that good experience

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.800
 that we gave you in the terminal you could get in the browser too.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:23.720
 But for some reason, yeah, even Amazon is slower to just reorder something.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.720
 Yeah.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.720
 It is a little weird.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.640
 The second thing I was going to say was this thing you talked about the class was interesting.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:37.280
 The world tries to optimize in certain ways and we lose a lot of things by like kind of

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.680
 blindly pursuing it.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:46.200
 So an example of this is obviously like as like a species we're trying to get our emissions

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.160
 down and we're trying to get our cars to be electric and put in policies in place that

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.160
 make it so that you know, more and more vehicles than we're electric.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:00.960
 There was this whole thing with Ferrari where they were like, oh, yeah, you guys can't do

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.960
 this.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.840
 You guys can't make Ferraris anymore and like you need to make them electric and everyone

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:09.960
 was like, yeah, like fuck rich people and like they think they can not be part of this.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.720
 And I get like that's like the immediate sentiment, but it's a little if you really think about

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.720
 what it actually is like, I think they should get an exemption because what a Ferrari actually

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:29.640
 is is this extremely tiny niche thing of people that still hand build cars in a very inefficient

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.160
 way in a very artistic way in a very like craftsmanship way.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.600
 And the reality is is like the literal carbon impact of those vehicles is probably basically

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.600
 zero.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.600
 Right.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.800
 I get that there's like this metaphorical thing where it feels like if you're rich, you get

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:51.480
 it away with it, but do we really want to lose that in pursuit of this other thing?

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.720
 And I feel like this check shows up in a bunch of the bunch of places in the world.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:18:00.480
 Yeah, I think it's my personality to is drawn towards like, I would love to do more work

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:10.080
 that felt like that, like artisan, like artisanal, extremely like inefficient yet rare.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:15.620
 That's like, I would love to just throw time at things that shouldn't have a lot of time

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.620
 spent on them.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:21.280
 Like, if I could somehow make a living doing that, I just love, I don't know, something

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.520
 about, I mean, you just describing Ferrari, I drive electric, but now I want a Ferrari.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.320
 I mean, just the idea that's handmade and like something about that.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.320
 It just feels nice.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.320
 I don't know.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.280
 Yeah, it's I think the I had this rule that I figured out a while ago where when it comes

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:42.480
 to luxury items, I am definitely willing to pay a crazy amount of money for a luxury.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:48.860
 But only when it's expensive because it hasn't scaled and if you look at the world, there's

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.720
 a lot of things that are expensive and skilled, which means it's a kind of a scam.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.720
 And I think recently it's actually showed up in a very little way.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.520
 I don't know if you saw the there's a bunch of news about I think Dior, where it turns

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:06.600
 out like their bags cost like $57 to make the ones they're selling for $1,000 like those

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.960
 things are expensive for no reason, like it could be a lot cheaper.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:15.520
 It just there's like a scam going around it where people think it's rare, but it's not.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.920
 But there are other things in fashion where it's a small group that is doing something

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.560
 that's not that there's not a lot of demand for, but like you might personally like it.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.840
 And then it's very expensive because, you know, that's what they need to keep it going.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.880
 I'm like super happy to pay for stuff like that.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.880
 And I don't think that's a scam.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.560
 I think that's like, yeah, I'm also very interested in things like that.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.000
 Those are things that should exist in the world.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Can we talk about turmoil?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.840
 Can we have like a strategy session here?

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.720
 I know like we're two fifths of the team on the call right now, but I just feel like

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:53.400
 I could use a little bit of like high level discussion, co-founder to co-founder on the

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.400
 terminal coffee.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.440
 It kind of ties into this conversation because like, really, the question is, what is terminal?

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.440
 What is it going to be?

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.440
 What do you want it to be?

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.440
 What's interesting to you?

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.480
 Every time I think of like a million things I could do every day towards the terminal

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:10.080
 effort, I just hear you in my head being like, well, that's not a business worth even making.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.640
 And I'm like, what is the business worth making backs?

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.640
 What does DAX want to make?

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.640
 Yeah.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:20.880
 I think the way I'm thinking about things is we, there's a lot of things we want, I talk

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.720
 about things in these terms all the time.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.920
 There's a lot of things we want to do, but they actually fall in the category of things

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.440
 we get to do after we hit a certain point.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.920
 We usually get to a place where we like, understand the numbers, we have a sale amount of money

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.920
 coming in and then we can figure out how to reinvest all of the stuff that people bring

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.920
 up.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.600
 I think they're like, interesting ideas that we should do.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.960
 It's just like, we don't get to do that yet because we got to figure out a way where we're

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.360
 not doing these like single shot, like two weeks, we're doing a bunch of sales and it

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.800
 goes to basically zero and then we're like saying, like, we got to have like something

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.800
 steady.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.720
 Otherwise, it's, it's quite hard.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.480
 Yeah, I'm not thinking about the new ideas, even like there's been a lot of ideas thrown

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.160
 out over the last three months in our Discord.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.760
 I'm saying just in terms of the business we have right now with coffee, selling coffee,

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:14.320
 what are like the next moves and what in your mind is it just, we need to wait and learn

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.720
 more about how much coffee we're selling over time.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.720
 Yeah.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.720
 I think so.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:26.520
 I think I'm going to be back from what I was saying, it's, I want to have predictable sales

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.520
 every month.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.520
 Yeah.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.960
 And to do that, you need to sell something that is somewhat recurring, which is why the

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:38.620
 only thing I really care about right now is, is getting that, uh, subscription, that monthly

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:39.920
 thing, thing going.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.720
 And that also, it like serves two purposes.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.920
 Like it solves that problem, but it also is a channel for all our weird ideas because

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.800
 every one month we can execute on one, on one weird idea, so it took a nice like stable

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.240
 schedule for us to actually do something with the ideas that we have.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.240
 That's the only thing I care about.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.240
 But I also am like, I don't think we can do anything till we get all the layer, layer

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.240
 of concept.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.240
 Oh, yeah, layer con.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.240
 Yep.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.240
 Done.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.240
 Yeah.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.240
 That makes sense.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.240
 So we get, yeah, it makes sense.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:14.040
 So we get layer con next month that behind us, which I was thinking about a, so we're doing

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.240
 some set amount of bags for the conference, we're going to have to have those bags shipped

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.240
 to Mahra.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.080
 He's going to fill them all and ship them to us in Dallas, right?

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.480
 It's just got it really in the weeds.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.480
 Okay.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:32.760
 So sort of, but not really, uh, we are going to, so yes, the number one thing is we get

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:37.040
 the bags I imprinted because that's actually the only thing that's like kind of sensitive

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:42.520
 that can get screwed, uh, they can screw us, they need to ship to our roaster, but he doesn't

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.360
 have to fill all the bags.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:49.440
 He's needs to fill 30 or 40 that he can ship to Texas because we're only going to sell

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.080
 not that many in person, mostly, we're not going to sell very many in person.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.080
 Okay.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.360
 We'll sell some in person, but like people can just order.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.360
 Yeah.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.360
 Like, okay.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.360
 Ideas with the bags will be in the store.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.960
 I had a time before the conference and I can just fulfill those normally.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.960
 So, okay.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.960
 Cool.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.960
 Yeah.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.560
 His side of it is bracing by and he's going to ship a few larger bags, just actually serve

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.160
 the coffee there for the people to end the conference.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.400
 So the only, only variable thing here is, uh, getting the bags printed.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.400
 Um, yeah.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.760
 Me and Liz made up a big list of a few other things, but yeah, it's operationally forward.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.520
 So Laracon, then we do the monthly subs thing, which is like going to be a different blend

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.880
 every month, which is very exciting for the creativity.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.880
 Yeah.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.080
 If that works, like there's so many ways to make that work like we can eat.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.840
 We can say like the first hunter subscribers get the first month free, uh, the partnerships

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.400
 with other companies that sponsor the boxes that there's not even a charge that month

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.760
 for, yeah, people subscribe to like, there's so many things that I'm able.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.800
 So if that works, then yeah, then this thing can stick around for a long time.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.800
 Cool.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.800
 Okay.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.800
 And then we can, we get to do all the stuff we want to do.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.800
 Yeah.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.800
 We, we do want to do a lot of stuff.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.800
 I know.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.800
 Yeah.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.800
 There's also like people just rebying coffee.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:01.160
 How do you ever learn like whether people are buying coffee, uh, because they saw something

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:08.160
 on Twitter versus, I feel like we need some intelligence around knowing why we sell coffee.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.160
 Like our people just rebying.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.480
 I guess we know that if there's a previous customer, well, I'm getting way too in the

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.480
 weed too.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.680
 This, this just got way too specific for a podcast.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.680
 Probably.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.760
 Well, I mean, if you take a step back.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.920
 So I am curious of that, like what analytics you guys look.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.680
 So at SST, we're like really, we're pretty numbers driven.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.720
 I think that's a lot more relevant when you're earlier than when maybe where is that means

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.720
 is that?

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.400
 Yeah, everything we're doing, it's like very clear for the numbers, whether it's working

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.400
 or what we should be doing.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.600
 There's like no mystery on.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.600
 Yeah.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.600
 About anything.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.120
 Uh, so I feel like it'll be the same way given that terminals early, but do you guys

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.600
 still like obsess over the numbers the way like an earlier stage company would?

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.600
 Yeah.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.400
 I mean, like we've grown over a hundred percent year over year the last three years in a row.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:01.400
 So like the, it's, we're obsessed in like the way that, uh, it's just exciting to look

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.400
 at them every day.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.880
 Eventually when the numbers aren't so good every year, if it slows down, then we'll be

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.760
 obsessed in the bad way where it's like, Oh, we got to get these numbers up right now.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.200
 It's just kind of like enjoying the ride and like, look at number go up.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:20.560
 Uh, the main, like our main metric is just page views, which is what we sell ads against.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.880
 So I mean, that's the main driver of revenue.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.120
 Uh, but like a large percentage of our page views just come from Google.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.880
 So we also stare at the Google search console a lot, just seeing the numbers day-to-day clicks

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.200
 from Google and what pages are driving traffic.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.240
 Yeah, we, I'd say we're like, we're very aware of the numbers as a team over the last few

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.920
 years, just since they got so big, uh, but I wouldn't say obsess because we all, we just

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.120
 have so much to do.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:51.520
 Uh, we do kind of like take bets on like, we think this will drive up time on page, like

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.160
 engagement numbers could be better here on this page.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:26:00.480
 So, uh, I'd say it like influences product decisions, but, uh, it's mostly a healthy relationship

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.440
 because again, the numbers have been good.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.440
 Yeah.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.000
 So for us, we literally look at the same numbers every week and that kind of tells us whether

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.520
 what we did the last week.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.520
 Yeah.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.520
 Worked or not.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.160
 Uh, so we're like still pretty in like in the micro of like, when we go to be good,

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.400
 the next week will be bad.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.200
 So things change pretty frequently.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.200
 Yeah.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.960
 Like for stammies, it's so driven off the sports schedule.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960
 Right.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.960
 Yeah.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.960
 It's super interesting.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.960
 Yeah.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.600
 Like you can see a down day and then you look at year over year and it's like, oh, this

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.760
 week, every single year is a low week just because of the nature of the sports schedule.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.360
 The sports schedule is oddly consistent, but we have like added sports and that kind of

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.360
 fills in some of the gaps and yeah, it's largely like day to day.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.960
 We can't get too worked up over numbers just because it just totally depends on what happens.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.880
 Somebody could break a record in a game and we can have our best day in the last six months

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.880
 and it's just kind of random.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.880
 Mm.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.880
 I see.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.880
 That makes sense.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.880
 I look forward to having some basic numbers that we can look at week to week.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:01.200
 So I think next week will be the first week where we have like stable data.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.680
 The last two weeks have been like crazy spiky because of we just launched and then we'll

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.200
 see from there like how many new people are we getting week to week, which is very hard

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.160
 to change by the way, like the user sense of the flat for like just hard to move that

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.160
 number.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.160
 Yeah.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.160
 And with how many reorders we get it, we see how much all that and think it'll be clear

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.160
 what to do.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.720
 So you said something and discord about like ready for it to settle into like a normal

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.720
 rent.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.240
 And I guess like for me, will there be a normal rate?

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:35.120
 I feel like it's always going to be pretty spiky depending on like our activity on socials.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.920
 Like I don't know what other driver right now.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:42.240
 Well, the active if the activity on socials don't translate to increasing your baseline

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.480
 of like this, we can always guarantee on this happening.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.200
 You're like not compounding anything.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.200
 Yeah.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.200
 You know what I mean?

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.200
 Like that's what we are right now.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.880
 We're like, we can do a bunch of effort and we'll get a bunch of sales, but they don't

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.880
 keep coming.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.880
 Yeah.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.400
 But they're slower things that'll take time, like word of mouth.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.560
 I feel like word of mouth is going to be really strong with this.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.560
 Like everybody who's in an office is going to tell their friends.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.560
 That's a developer.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.560
 Right.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.720
 I mean, it's just kind of like it's got that novelty.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.720
 That's kind of what I'm talking about.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:15.240
 Like if you have a healthy thing going, like, yeah, you'll see growth just from long term

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.240
 things like that.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.240
 Okay.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:22.000
 Fresh is in the pan kind of like help seed more little champions of the company and the

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 brand.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Yeah.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Yeah, they should.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 They should increase.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Just like an overtime.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 It all just grows.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 What?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Like our averages should go up over time, I guess.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 Yeah.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 Like week to week.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Yeah.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.240
 If they're flats, then you know, it's, it's still fun, but it's not like something that

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.240
 is compounding.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.520
 Yeah, I gotcha.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.480
 So business is basically it's the number keeps going up.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.480
 Things are good.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:49.520
 Well, so it's really funny it's we were a second years ago, we were hanging out with

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:55.200
 Liz's very successful uncle, and I mentioned before he's got like probably a second biggest

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.360
 healthcare business in Miami billboards everywhere, like vehicles on the road.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.960
 You see it all the time, massive, massive company.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.120
 And what time we're hanging out with him?

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:13.080
 Of course, this was at his, he's got a giant apartment on the beach and has a private beach

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.160
 with like people that like serve you when you're there.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.320
 So you go and you just hang on the beach and people, like it's like you're at a resort,

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.320
 but it's house.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.320
 So we're there.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.360
 Like obviously enjoying this like really like rich, successful situation.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.680
 And he was like describing to us is like a bunch of random things about his outlook on

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.040
 life and business and all that.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.320
 And he was literally, he literally said what you said, he was like, I go to people every

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.280
 week, the people that are managers and I look at their chart, if the numbers are going up,

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.280
 that's good.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:45.240
 They're not going up, they're out and that was like, it was really that simple.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.960
 And I think a lot of stuff in business is that simple, like you can complicate it.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.640
 But yeah, and that was it.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.800
 And like it was so convincing because we were like around all of his success.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:00.440
 Yeah, he had this other funny point where he was like, oh yeah, like people should definitely

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:05.000
 like go to a really good school and like go to Harvard and get a business degree so that

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.240
 you can, so I can hire you, you can come work for me.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:15.640
 It was like this kind of condescending thing, but I was like, yeah, yeah, it was, yes,

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.960
 number go up is good.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.840
 Number go up, we'll just keep making that number go up.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:25.000
 I got to say something here before we move on to something else before I forget.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.200
 We had a clip on TikTok and people commented that I am a skinwalker or I look like a skinwalker

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.000
 or I'm definitely AI.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.720
 Listen, I'm not AI.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.640
 Ah, could they I do this, that's what I thought.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.400
 So look, I'm a person, I'm a human being with real feelings.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.680
 I don't actually have very many feelings.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.680
 Oh my God.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.680
 I am AI.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.680
 Oh, am I AI?

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:55.440
 Oh no, I found that so funny, like that, okay, that you post a screenshot, like of like five

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.120
 or six people agreeing that you only comment from the video, they're all like that guy's

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.120
 definitely AI.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.440
 What does that mean?

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.280
 Just my voice, the tone?

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:09.360
 I found it so funny because to me it's so random, but to have such a consistent response.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.800
 It's such a consistent response, yeah, like what are people saying?

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.800
 Is it?

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.800
 What were you saying?

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.800
 Was it the content that we were saying?

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800
 I mean, I watched the clip.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.640
 I was just kind of like, it was like five seconds of me just talking very monotone before

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.800
 you then like elaborated on a bunch of stuff.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.880
 I was kind of asking you a question, but I did it very monotone.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.880
 I don't know.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.000
 I guess that was enough to make me look like AI.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 A nice camera?

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 I don't know.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 I look sick.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.160
 It was so funny and I think there's like, and I got me thinking about this, like there's

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:47.400
 some kind of reverse Turing test now, if you're not, like people think you're AI when you're

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.400
 actually a human.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.880
 It's like the opposite of what we were trying to do.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.880
 Yeah.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.880
 That's a great question.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.880
 Yeah.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.680
 What's like the most human thing you could do on a video that would be like, that's clearly

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.680
 not AI.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.360
 Like how could I literally not be AI?

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.360
 What would be a thing?

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:07.120
 Like when you think of text, like that chat GPT spits out and like there's models that

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.800
 can figure out that it was AI generated, what's the equivalent for like a talking head?

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.200
 Like what would be proved easy answer?

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.200
 Is it?

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.200
 Yeah.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.200
 Pick my nose.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.200
 What?

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.200
 No.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.200
 Just say the most offensive word you can think of.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.200
 Oh, because AI would do that.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.200
 That's funny.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.200
 I'm not going to do that.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.200
 Yeah.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.200
 Exactly.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:31.360
 Oh, man.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:36.280
 So if anything on this podcast episode ends up on TikTok, I'd appreciate if you kept in

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.480
 mind that we're real human beings that we're here.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.680
 There's no AI on this podcast.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.080
 Hey, I wasn't accused of being AI.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.960
 It did make me think like it's so easy to create like an AI version of yourself now.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.440
 There's so many tools that like offer AI voices or like why not?

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:54.040
 If people already think I'm AI, why shouldn't I just like clone me and then check out and

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:59.560
 like never show up on the podcast I'm just talking to an AI version of you.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.200
 I won't even tell you actually.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.440
 You won't even be able to tell.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.760
 I'll just make sure it's super convincing and you'll just think you're talking to me.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.760
 You might be talking to AI right now.

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.760
 Just saying.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.760
 I wouldn't be surprised.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.920
 I can't prove that I'm not.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.920
 What's going on?

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.040
 I've been in a hole myself doing some programming.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.720
 What's the what's the latest?

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.520
 What's what is going on?

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.880
 Have you been like plugged into the tech scene?

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.460
 I saw on Twitter people are talking about commit hooks or something.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.240
 I swear it really is just like a cycle.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.840
 It's just like we get bored of something and then we talk we bring up the same thing.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.480
 We brought up three months ago.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.800
 I had a bunch of fun with that yesterday.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.040
 I posted like I post like 50 tweets in 30 minutes.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.000
 I believe you're in favor of commit hooks.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.640
 I could tell you the list of people who are not it's just it's getting.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.640
 It's getting out of hand.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.520
 We got to come up with something in favor of commit hooks in general.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:34:00.320
 I have one hook that I set up a pre push hook to do a type check because I've observed

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.240
 behavior in myself and my team where that's an easy thing.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.320
 We miss and then waiting for CI to fail is like way too slow with the.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.320
 Yeah.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.320
 I get that.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.320
 Just run it there.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.720
 It's definitely very teams.

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:19.080
 The context specific right like within a given team what you do from code authoring like

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:24.840
 your little fingers hit in the keyboard to it being deployed somewhere that's very team

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.960
 specific right like there's no general like this is how you should do things for every

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.960
 single team.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.960
 Well the thing I was having fun with was this is making fun of as usual making fun of everyone

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.960
 else's process because they have process it's oh yeah.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:42.720
 So in my head I'm like when I make a code change and I push I want to be done like I'm

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.880
 done when I get push on my code is done so I want to make sure that if it pushed successfully

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.040
 like I can consider it done.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.040
 Yep.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:55.240
 But then I realized oh that's not how everyone else works they're like oh I'm actually pushing

00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:01.800
 to a feature branch so no matter what I have to go to GitHub like to wait for the PR checks

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.120
 to finish and then squash merge so to them I guess it's fine.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.640
 I said squash merge other instincts probably not squash merge probably some other weird

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.640
 thing.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:15.240
 So other weird thing that people do it's all because it wait.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.000
 I mean teams aren't just made up of taxes you know there's believe it or not there are

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.920
 some programmers who aren't very good.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.800
 That's what I made fun of everyone for it's like you guys all suck so you need this stupid

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.680
 ass linter running so I can tell you that please add an underscore to this variable that is

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.720
 not used because if there wasn't an underscore there like the world would collapse like it

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:40.240
 was just like they're just people just add so many tools and all this stuff so I get why

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.800
 you don't want to run all that on every commit because that's just a lot of stuff but for

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:49.000
 me I'm just like just don't use any of that just don't use it just be good at programming

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.960
 and you don't need all that stuff and then of course responses like that works for you

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:55.040
 because you're a small team but it doesn't work for us because we're a big team and we

00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.080
 have a big team and people don't know anything and we have to make them do the right thing

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:04.800
 that's basically the gist of it right yeah like we hire a bunch of people who are still

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.040
 learning lots of things and we're like we want our code to be perfect and just like this

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:14.880
 and so we're going to force everyone into this through automated tooling and my response

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:20.120
 to that is always oh like but if it was just you would you still need it or you do this

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.520
 for everyone else because everyone else is stupid on your team and that's when they don't

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.560
 have an answer for it it's like well I bet like everybody's side projects have all the

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.800
 same it's also because you're stupid well I'm sure like most people's side projects have

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.000
 all the same tooling they use at work because they're just in that habit and then like you're

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.040
 a solo person working in repo with all this nonsense you helped me see the light of like

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:43.120
 getting rid of ESLent and like why don't I do this for why do I have ESLent at all I was

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.920
 so tired of configuring ESLent and all the other tools that everybody configures I just

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.800
 just sheep you know I just follow along I just I see everybody else with all these things

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:56.360
 in their repos and I'm like I guess I need all that stuff they'll talk to you yeah ESLent

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:02.760
 is so important that we've now like rewritten it in Rust it just and wait okay here's another

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.840
 thing that's funny if you asked people the question if all of your pre commit hooks could

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.960
 run a hundred times faster would you still be against them and they probably would say

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.400
 no they wouldn't be against them that was a question I had for you like I saw somebody

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:22.920
 was it was it can't see dots that said he runs them no it was Matt Pokkok somebody runs

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:30.720
 them like in a watcher they run TSC in a watcher and you said you don't like that I

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.260
 think but my question to you was I mean that's that's fine but that doesn't guarantee that

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:41.200
 I even noticed the watcher like I see I said I want to know when I push I'm good that's

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:46.360
 my thought was also just like if you have a big complex code base TSC is not exactly

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:52.480
 instant but if it could be instant what TSC watcher is gonna be faster than running it

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.640
 full type check on oh it's just it does like a diff or something like it only well and

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:02.160
 you can still do that with what I'm describing but okay I don't I don't know if there's

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:07.280
 a speed difference between the two I just I just know that TSC watchers is gonna be like

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:11.440
 I'm not gonna pay attention to it or it's easy to miss that makes sense I've officially

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.960
 waited into waters I am not smart enough to understand we ended up just talking about

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:22.480
 the thing we were being in front of actually don't care about any of that I don't even

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:27.840
 run type checking I don't care I just put stuff and sometimes it we actually don't even have

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:32.480
 it turned on and it's our code base sometimes things work when I push sometimes they don't

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:37.800
 and we do we also haven't turned it on and the ion code base either but we need to but

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:45.040
 yeah it's just like I posted a picture of the SR-71 blackbird being like people built

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.300
 this was a fucking roller it's all that is that true like they actually had like hand

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:54.640
 tool that they that's crazy yeah the hand can operate a calculator wait a minute we're

00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:01.720
 like modern commercial aircraft built that way no that was the last like big effort that

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:05.280
 was ever built okay okay slide rule I think because I got a couple flights coming up

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:12.760
 and I don't want to be thinking about that slide rule nonsense I mean it works I guess

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:18.240
 yeah it's true sometimes I stare especially in New York sometimes I would like just stand

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:23.000
 and stare at buildings being like how the hell is that door like in the exact center of the

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.880
 building like how did they do that it's such a large building a large door on like on even

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.800
 ground like every part of the building is like perfectly symmetrical it's impossible

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:38.120
 yeah I mean the pyramids right yeah okay I just I just said that because I've heard like

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.240
 the pyramids are amazing are they really that amazing they look kind of shitty to me if I'm

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:46.600
 being honest like I mean they don't look like perfectly straight edges like what why do we

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.520
 just like we praise the people who built the pyramids I think a skyscraper is a little

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.220
 more impressive personally people are like I can't even imagine we could build the pyramids

00:39:54.220 --> 00:40:00.000
 now the picture with a long time ago yeah but like I'm just saying it's not okay they're

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.520
 impressive because they're large and they were built a long time ago we are ancestors

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:09.560
 were dumb dums they can't build big things only little things is that is out is out is

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:17.040
 well hang on this is a complex topic because well Stonehenge is funny cuz it's just a that

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:21.040
 is also just not impressive it's not very impressive don't we just yeah it's not impressive but

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.160
 don't we like not know why it's like that like clearly somebody did it but we're like

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:29.800
 who and why yeah there's theories yeah let's go back to the pyramids I want you to explain

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.160
 to me why the pyramids are impressive well the pyramids is just it's a lot of these things

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:40.080
 are funny cuz it's like how do they do that well you know through slavery how do they achieve

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:47.020
 this crazy thing that by forcing lots of people to do it yeah and you know is ground people

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:51.440
 but there's like there's like actually some impressive engineering stuff about the pyramids

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.840
 I guess I'm sure there is like I mean people there's so many theories on how they think

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.720
 they've lifted all the blocks up there's like some really wild theories involving like basically

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:03.800
 like high hydraulics like when like water pushes things up like there's all those weird

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:08.160
 theories but there's no like definitive answer I don't I don't think on this is the exact

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:12.160
 process that was used and I think that's makes it interesting that does make it interesting

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.040
 yeah it's interesting I should take back all the bad things I said about the pyramids

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:20.600
 you're very impressive apologize to the ancient Egyptians right now I'm so sorry if you are

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:26.680
 listening to this podcast I'm so sorry do you ever think about like when we're all dead

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.720
 and gone and it's been how many years has been since previous were made like 3,000 years

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:36.760
 2000 what was it I don't know it's some thousands in the thousands right do you ever think about

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:40.800
 like when it's been thousands of years and like some remnants of these skyscrapers and

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.960
 stuff are left and people are like look at what they built that's so impressive and like

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:49.640
 that is on the head they made these nice little towers they're like floating up in space driving

00:41:49.640 --> 00:42:00.800
 their flying cars and all that and they're like look at those towers how soon more you

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.560
 want to get morbid do you ever think about like how many millions of years before there's

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:11.600
 no trace of us literally on earth it's not that long it's kind of wild I heard this in

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.800
 a book actually or maybe a podcast it's like 10 million years or something it's not a lot

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:22.120
 somebody looked at a fact check me but it's like there'll be literally no trace of humanity

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:28.520
 in that wild way but like if we die out yeah assuming like well I think you make the number

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:32.040
 big enough and you can just kind of like I guess unless we start traveling to the planets

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.760
 or something maybe that's the whole you own Mustang I don't know but I it was this book

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:40.640
 that talked about well we'll be transformed to pure energy oh okay well I'm just ball

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:46.480
 be Adams across the universe okay I don't know what that means but I believe I'm sure there's

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:52.280
 an optimistic that's probably optimistic case right the thing I heard was like if we wanted

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:57.560
 to determine if another intelligent species lived on this planet a hundred million years

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:04.400
 ago a billion years ago could we actually do it and the conclusion was no like you go

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:11.040
 far enough back is in the millions of years and literally there's no trace like the way

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:17.120
 the sediment layers work and isotope half lives and all that stuff it's like literally do we

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.200
 would have no idea there could have been another intelligent civilization living on earth far

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.840
 enough back in time that we just can't even detect it and then it's like well you do the

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:32.480
 same thing forward if we die out there will be no trace of us isn't that wild that is true

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:37.560
 it's nuts yeah I mean it's crazy how nothing is permanent like you but we build these things

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:41.720
 and they slowly erode just entropy always I think it is all the time with my house because

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:47.200
 it's so old and I'm like there's so many forces working against it there's like physical forces

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:51.200
 of like just deteriorating the house and there's like yeah economic forces that like also want

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:57.400
 to get rid of it spiritual forces like the voodoo dolls that I just poke around about

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:04.240
 your house this isn't a hundred percent related but there's a short story that if you haven't

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:11.600
 read you should you should read called the last question it's an isogasm of thing and it like plays

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:18.040
 forward like trillions of years of a little imagines like all these all these other trillion years

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:22.880
 there have been a trillion years that's a good question what is a year is a spin around the earth

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:30.640
 I'm talking very badly today I might be a a year no that this proves you're not because a year is a

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:37.560
 spin around the earth is that what you said I said it's been around the earth rotation of the earth

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:51.280
 oh yeah that's it that's it okay a year when we say a year we mean one trip around the Sun for

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:56.240
 the planet earth what is a year in the universe there is no such thing time isn't like that

00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:04.280
 no time is a thing you can measure it but it's really different ways right it's like saying Fahrenheit

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:08.240
 and Celsius you know we got two different ways of measuring the same concept kind of the same

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.920
 thing okay so but when we say like no I'm so curious about this one night when people are like the

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:18.760
 universe is 13 billion years old they're basing that off 13 billion earth trips around the Sun yeah

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:24.040
 but it's not like the earth had to exist for all those all that time right okay there could still be

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:28.640
 years even if we weren't floating around the Sun that makes sense but there hasn't been a trillion

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:33.000
 years yet right so when you say like trillions years in the future no there hasn't it's it's in

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.920
 the billions so like what is this book how does it explore trillions of years like what do we know

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:43.080
 about what would happen in a trillion years I mean it's actually not about that concept that's kind

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:49.360
 of the fact that trillions are passing is kind of a side thing to the main story but wow what is the

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:55.120
 main story because that's quite a side thing it's about a computer that is just ingesting data to

00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:00.540
 answer the last question and just ingesting data over time and it plays forward millions of your

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:05.000
 trillions years and now I got it now I got to know what the last question is can you just tell me

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.080
 no I'm gonna tell you yeah I have to like read the book or something okay or just listen to it

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:13.480
 listen to it on like just search the last question on YouTube and someone will have narrated it

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:20.600
 I don't know if you could audible it's a short story little little sketch ripping it off YouTube

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:28.080
 huh it's a short story short story fine I'll look it up on YouTube what was last question I listen to

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:34.080
 it I want to my drives to Miami yeah okay you need to listen to if I told you about Project

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:39.000
 Hail Mary have I told the podcast about Project Hail Mary because yes we talked about it and I

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.800
 need to wait like this is really pissing me that I haven't read it yeah you have to read it and listen

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:48.920
 to it on audible don't read it she listened to it right yeah yeah okay yeah I feel like it has to

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:54.640
 be better on audible than it would be reading it just like yeah I know yeah yeah okay so if you're

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.960
 listening to this podcast right now please stop and download Project Hail Mary it's on audible because

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:04.600
 it's an actual book you won't find it on YouTube if it's on YouTube it'll probably get taken down

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:10.120
 because that's how books work you have to get like the author has to get money somehow so you don't

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:15.560
 listen to books on YouTube commentary to to Dax's I'm really struggling with English today like

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:21.400
 just like every word it feels so labored I've not been talking much I feel like I've been in a

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:29.560
 hole in my office for a week and I haven't been practicing English or communicating I also really

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:37.240
 have to pee are you just letting me squirm right now so I refresh my memory on this last question

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:42.680
 short story exactly what it was so I can tell you what the question is that's not oh okay yes the

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.840
 the premise of the short story is they build a computer and the purpose of the computers to

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:51.960
 answer the question how do we stop and reverse entropy oh and they keep revisiting the computer

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:58.520
 every million billion billion years and asking at the question how do we do it and at the end it

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:05.080
 finally tells you basically oh I want to listen to it now how many hours we talking not that I mean

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:10.360
 probably one or two oh really maybe less than you weren't kidding on the short story no it's only

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:18.920
 28 minutes 28 minutes yeah wow do you listen to those like 36 hour books unaudible I've got a few

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:23.480
 of those biographies is that a lot or a little I'd like no like 12 hours is normal I think right

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:30.040
 I mean a lot of books are five to ten I mean not really and then if you listen at two times speed

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:37.160
 it's half that everything's half that everything is half that yet like I'm struggling decks I feel

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:43.640
 like did I have a stroke every like every yes everything every number divided by two is in fact

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:51.480
 half of that number what is going on with me you discovered a new law of mathematics i don't know

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:58.120
 what's going on uh it just feels like everything feels slow check your CO2 meter okay no kidding

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:06.200
 1400 it's actually pretty high yeah that's actually big that's funny that's funny if you listen at

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:12.040
 two x speed though that's that's not very big i don't know i'm talking about i'm not a two extreme

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:17.800
 person you're not a two x speed what are you what what do you listen at i'm a one x i mean i don't

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:23.080
 listen to much what i don't listen to much but when i do it's a one x thing wait a minute

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:29.240
 you don't you don't listen like do you go for walks i guess you like have to walk places

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:35.560
 for purposes and usually i'm walking with Liz so do you never okay you never just go on like an

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:41.560
 arbitrary walk just to get steps i do sometimes when i'm walking zuko but i mean i walk in my backyard

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:45.960
 like when i'm playing with him especially with the whole yeah bubble thing as you saw but i'm

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:52.600
 usually not alone and walking huh so i go on like several little 15-minute walks every day just

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:57.400
 because i literally just have to move because the human race has gotten so convenient that we

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:03.560
 don't have to move so we have to do it for arbitrary reasons uh so i always listen to books or podcasts

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.800
 when i walk but if i didn't have that i guess if i didn't walk i wouldn't listen anything either

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:13.080
 so for a while when i was doing my mowingward team with zuko i had uh an audiobook playing

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:17.240
 i did definitely maybe two months and i haven't for a month now yeah i don't know i just like just

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:21.320
 have it never sticks for me i never like really listen to stuff maybe you need to you just need

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.720
 to start listening to project hillmary you need something so riveting that you can't like i go for

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:30.280
 more walks like that yeah when i get into a book like really into it i just go for more walks which

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:36.600
 is good i need to move more anyway so i'm gonna listen to project hillmary at two time or you're

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:41.400
 gonna listen to project hillmary and i'm gonna listen to have one x at one x and i'm gonna have fun with

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:47.160
 that i'm gonna listen to your recommendation at point three x i don't know i gotta make it

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:53.400
 last longer than 20 minutes yeah otherwise you might be left alone with your thoughts oh okay

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:58.920
 actually it's funny you said that this morning i did my first not my first ever but like in a long

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:06.200
 time uh meditation meditation practice yeah i'm trying casey's making me uh because there's some

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:12.520
 alarming things about my brain well you've seen today on this podcast so uh she's making me just like

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:18.200
 sit and the the instruction is i've set a five-minute timer i do this every morning now today was day

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:24.840
 one uh i have to just sit and observe my thoughts like watch them go by like cars on the road it's

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:30.600
 like the stereotypical meditation thing like for beginners and i'm a beginner it's very hard

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:36.120
 and my brain does not want to sit still did yours i don't know if you know this but jay is like has

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:41.000
 had a very consistent i thought of ancient practice and it's like hat made some pretty big

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.640
 profound changes in his life i want that yeah could you just talk about some of the changes

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:52.280
 mmm no okay that's fair we'll have you on the podcast and maybe he can he can tell you

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.560
 oh yeah that's that's pretty personal yeah yeah but i i like i think i know what i i was asking not

00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:03.960
 because i want to know jay's whatever it asking because i want to know like what to expect what

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:09.000
 can i expect to improve in my life with meditation could you tell me some generic things that generally

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.320
 people improve it's it's really i think yeah i just can't articulate it because i haven't yeah it's

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:24.280
 not a me thing but i will say that uh back when i used to do a lot more hallucinogens i also was

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:33.240
 doing meditative stuff a lot where i would just let my mind just run on its own and honestly i found

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:37.320
 this like infinitely entertaining and when i remember when i remember this every now and then

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:41.880
 when i'm bored i'll do it again and i find it like really really fun like for me when i just like

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:48.600
 release control like i started seeing all this like crazy interesting stuff and it's all wild to

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:53.240
 me how like my brain just jumped from one thing to another so yeah it's weird because i don't find

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:59.880
 meditating boring really i just find it i like i think it's like really fun i don't know how to

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:06.520
 put it i yeah i didn't it's not like this morning in my experience of meditating of one day i thought

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:12.040
 that i found it boring it's just really hard it's really hard to not run with every release control

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:16.200
 yeah to like literally just do the thing you're supposed to do when you meditate it feels like my

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:22.600
 brain it's it's a learned skill and it has not done it yeah for sure i gotta learn it and i want to i

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:28.200
 think there are some things that i need to improve in my brain and my and there is a big that people

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:33.720
 link meditation and husgens a lot together they like kind of can put you in the same mental state

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:38.520
 right that's what i've heard that like uh like hallucinogens are the cheap

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:43.080
 and easy way to get into states that through years and years of practice with meditation you can

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:49.000
 eventually get to is that kind of what you've gathered yeah i've heard that too and i i can kind

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:56.680
 of see the link uh because i definitely wasn't able to much more release in that way yeah when i was

00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:01.720
 when i was doing that stuff more um the visual i always got was it felt like i was in the ocean

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:07.800
 that like the waves were just like all the bombing around that's deep ocean with the waves and that's

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:12.280
 what it felt like my brain was doing for me this morning and my one experience it felt kind of like

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:20.840
 being in the middle of stone hinge and wondering what the hell are lots of rocks doing in my head

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:28.040
 i can't wait till i have really deep profound things to say after my years of meditation i'm

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:32.040
 going to become dax basically i'm going to like get on twitter and like wow people with my wisdom

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:37.880
 because i meditate that's the goal it's really the only goal you could do that now if you just

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:42.360
 limit yourself to like five words and just randomly pick five words that kind of sound like it makes

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:46.440
 sense together and post it and you'll probably get like 80 percent the way they're i'm gonna do

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:50.440
 that actually right after we get off i'm gonna write i'm gonna do exactly five words i'm gonna

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:54.040
 tweet something that's five words and they will be random words i don't know about random but they

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.920
 won't make sense and we'll see what that we'll see what happens if you hear this find the tweet

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:03.720
 like it boost it thank you it's funny we're talking about stone hinge so much and the stone hinge was

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:10.200
 recently vandalized i saw that i did see that what are your feelings on that i really hate

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:15.880
 stuff like this because that's exactly why i hate it it's like one of my core things that i just

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:21.480
 that really bother me so again it's one of the situations where there are so-called climate

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:27.880
 activists that do these crazy things uh to get attention for that or like it's like a way to like

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:36.280
 you know in their view i think it's to like find places to strike that are painful uh yeah to you

00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:41.160
 know it's like trying to get leverage in that way yep what i hate about this kind of thing is

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:51.160
 this type of thing tends to be done by people that have no personal risk of their cause not working

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:57.000
 out and you can see it because they don't consider backlash at all if you were truly someone that

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.560
 is like dedicated their life to solving your climate problems you don't want stuff like that

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:05.640
 because you know it creates backlash and you know it creates it just makes it harder for you to do

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:10.280
 your actual job of like convincing people to care about things in a genuine way and to you know do

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:15.400
 whatever you need to do i think so much in life is like this there's just people that are unaffected

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:20.360
 by the problems they're trying to solve and they do things that create backlash for the people

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:27.160
 they're supposedly trying to help um but yeah i just i just hate all that yeah how how do they get

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:33.160
 to that i mean i guess like how does one become insulated from the ramifications of just like

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:37.320
 doing stupid stuff most people are rich for one like if you look at all if you look up all these

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:42.360
 people they're just like children of wealthy people that have this so that's where they're not having

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:49.160
 root guilt ramifications okay like if they if they weren't made of money then they'd be worried about

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:54.600
 losing a job or they'd be worried about yeah other just normal pressures interesting the

00:56:54.600 --> 00:57:00.440
 the climate one's interesting because it's obviously so big that it's hard to imagine like an individual

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:04.920
 that's more affected by it so i kind of categorize it more as people that are like trying to do actual

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:10.440
 work to improve the stuff versus people that are just like role-playing and this weird thing that

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:14.920
 they're trying to do yeah i gotcha yeah if you're someone that like is trying to get a certain

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:20.360
 policy passed and then these climate activists are pissing off millions of people that does not

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:25.720
 help you no right you're upset yeah yeah but yeah i mean it's become a trend like there's

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:32.440
 though shit on the on paintings and stuff yes i saw the painting i saw the painting the uh stone

00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:37.080
 hinge things it made me sad a little bit like i didn't i didn't actually see in the initial

00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:42.280
 articles like does it come off can they get that off i don't know no i i think pretty much every

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:48.360
 situation they've been able to undo the damage as far as to undo okay i see but because that's

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:54.760
 artisanal handmade stone yeah it's gonna be nice back to our original thing like it yeah it's rare

00:57:54.760 --> 00:58:00.840
 what's the purpose of our species continuing to exist if like we're gonna destroy right these

00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:06.760
 things yeah seems bad don't be like that if you're a listener of the podcast and you're considering

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:13.640
 vandalizing precious humanity no maybe just don't i doubt any of our listeners would do that we got

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:18.360
 really good listeners i hear they're really nice i like them i don't know what am i talking about

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:22.680
 we should get off here i my brain i should not be talking right now i don't know what's going on

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:28.760
 you should go get some oxygen i think yeah i'm gonna open the window it's at me what it seems like

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:33.720
 is this meditation has had a reverse effect on you meditation it's meditations fault it's the

00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:38.840
 first day i'm meditated and my brain is like mashed potatoes oh my word it's like it's like you

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:43.960
 have a fixed number of thoughts you can have and then use you just use them all in the morning

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:52.760
 remember when i said that uh one uh one year is when the earth one spin earth

00:58:53.400 --> 00:59:03.000
 what if i can't oh man i know there's one spin of the earth i'm gonna one spin that's what i said

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.280
 i'm gonna uh i'm gonna submit this episode to kc as evidence that maybe meditation not for me

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.960
 just possibly were you breathing during it like maybe you were focused so hard on meditation

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:18.280
 that you just you know i said five minutes not breathing back you're talking to me but dad this

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:25.400
