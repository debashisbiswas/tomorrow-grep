WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 - All right, that's what is the edge.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.680
 Can you tell me please?

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.640
 - Oh my, no, no prepper, like no build up.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.000
 - No, just straight go.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.840
 - What is the edge?

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.960
 - The edge is something everyone's talking about.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.920
 People can't get enough of the edge.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.560
 Everything has to be edge.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.400
 But what is it?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.760
 Does anyone do it actually?

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.880
 - I don't know if anyone's really doing it.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.460
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:49.760
 - So I'm more seriously, so I did a video on this topic

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.400
 just 'cause it was like coming up so much

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.880
 and people asked about it so much.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.240
 - I feel bad that I haven't seen it.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.680
 Is this been up for a while?

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.600
 Or have you not published it?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.200
 - No, I have, I mean, it wasn't anything crazy.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.840
 But yeah, I think it comes up a lot

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.240
 because there's always like, you know,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.400
 the hype cycle always happens with everything.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.400
 There's a new concept.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.760
 It's genuinely exciting.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.200
 There's like genuinely really interesting things about it.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.080
 But because it's exciting, it gets talked about a lot.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.960
 And then it blows up.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.920
 People feel like everything is gonna be on this new thing.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.320
 Everything has to switch to it.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.120
 It's a future if you don't have it,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.360
 if you're not doing it, you're over.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.640
 - I feel that way.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.840
 - Yeah. (laughs)

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.400
 I've gone through this process so many times

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.960
 and one of the new thing comes, I still,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.640
 it just still sucks you in, it's really hard.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.000
 - Yeah.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.800
 - To like look at something objectively.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.160
 And then eventually at some point,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.680
 it goes the other way where people are like,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.200
 "This sucks, this is terrible."

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.580
 Like we've all been lied to.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.760
 - I've seen that curve.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.120
 - And that's just the hype cycle curve.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.760
 I've definitely seen that where it's like,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.920
 it peaks and then crashes way low and then slowly.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.600
 So it will eventually be relevant

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.280
 and we're just not there yet.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.400
 I feel like I've just seen this happen so many times

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.880
 with literally every single thing that I'm like,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.040
 it just has to happen again.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.640
 Like this is what we do as an industry.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.280
 So it's the tech not there yet.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.160
 'Cause like I know next JSConf,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.080
 they're getting ready to talk about the edge

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.640
 like nonstop for a whole day from what I've gathered,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.480
 from tweets.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.280
 Is it just not there yet?

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.880
 - I think it's, I don't think it's,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.400
 I think it's more like,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.880
 with like with every single thing in engineering,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.120
 there's always trade offs.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.680
 And if you make one thing better,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.280
 you're making another thing worse.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.520
 The edge isn't magic.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.600
 It's so is subject to distributed systems rules.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.720
 If you move stuff,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.520
 if you move some things closer to your users,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.000
 now those things are further away

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 from some of your other stuff.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.720
 So you're paying the price somewhere else.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.760
 - Is this the kind of point out with the cap theorem?

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.600
 Sorry, I just keep it.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.440
 - Yeah, exactly, exactly.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.000
 The cap theorem still applies.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.400
 You still have to do with all those issues.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.400
 And I think a lot of these services

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.040
 have done a good job moving your front end to the edge,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.040
 which makes a lot of sense.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.960
 Like that's like the least computationally heavy,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.200
 state heavy thing in your whole architecture.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.520
 - So just like the files sitting on a CDN,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.360
 like that's, they're at the edge.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.800
 You get them quickly,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.600
 but then all your API calls and things like that

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.280
 are slow because they're not the edge.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.640
 - Yeah, they still go to a region, like a centralized region.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.800
 Or maybe you have multiple regions, whatever it is.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.400
 You know, that, you know, it's pretty good

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.320
 for certain architectures.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.840
 But now we have like computing at the edge

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.560
 where you're moving your business logic to the edge.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.960
 And that feels great 'cause like,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.040
 oh, the user is right there.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.160
 The business logic is right there.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.600
 It's gonna be instant.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.560
 But then it's kind of like, okay,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.520
 but your business logic still needs to write things

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.800
 to a database, which is probably still in a regional zone.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.480
 So now every round trip is more expensive.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.640
 Is this all actually worth it?

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.960
 Things might actually be slower.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.320
 Your compute and your database are now separated

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.280
 geographically and that's slow.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.200
 Can you just put everything on the edge?

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.920
 I know people talk about like SQLite.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.880
 Can you just put SQLite databases everywhere on the edge?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.720
 How does that work?

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.520
 How do they all stay in sync?

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.920
 - Well, so that's the next problem.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.320
 Okay, so now let's move the database to the edge.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.720
 Now it feels like we solved it,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.080
 but now your database is further away

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.480
 from other database nodes than it used to be.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.960
 It has a whole new suite of problems there.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.920
 And you know, all that SQLite stuff is really interesting.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.320
 Like they're good options.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.440
 I think we're just kind of like,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.760
 I feel like all of the cloud has just been,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.520
 we optimize for one use case,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.960
 then we flip like the decisions

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.600
 and now you have a different set of things

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.000
 you optimize for that you flip it

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.520
 and you have a different set of things you optimize for.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.240
 So the SQLite stuff, pretty interesting,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.520
 like reads at the edge that are eventually consistent,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.440
 all your rights will go to a single place.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.480
 I think for some stuff that could be cool.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.320
 Do I think every single thing is gonna move to that?

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.640
 No, I think my proof is,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.720
 I mean, I have a question for you,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.120
 like how often do you even see companies

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.880
 operating in multiple regions?

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.920
 Like if I'm rarely ever something like that?

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.760
 Yeah.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.600
 Yeah.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.680
 So if people haven't,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.640
 the option to operate in multiple regions

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.400
 has been possible forever.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.400
 Very few companies opt to do that

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.280
 'cause it comes with trade-offs, difficulty, et cetera.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.800
 So if you haven't even done multiple regions,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.240
 like doing edge is like doing a thousand regions, right?

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.360
 So, yeah, it's challenging.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.640
 So like if you think about Vercel and Next.js Conf,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.520
 they're gonna be talking a lot about,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.160
 'cause you can basically do,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.400
 you're not an Next.js user, I forget.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.480
 But you can run like your API routes in Next.js

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.200
 or your SSR at the edge now.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.560
 I know that was like a recent thing.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.440
 But like, is it just, are they just glossing over?

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.760
 Does anyone talk about what you do with your data store?

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.520
 I've never heard Vercel talk about that,

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.600
 but if I just missed it?

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.320
 No, I honestly don't know either.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.520
 And we see a lot of people.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.880
 So I think the edge stuff is great.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.480
 You can move more, like you're back into your edge,

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.600
 but people end up moving their whole back into the edge.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.080
 So they don't have like an API anymore.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.160
 That's regional.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.000
 Yeah.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.160
 And then stuff starts to be slow.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.600
 Like the round trips, like it's at a database or slow.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.920
 I had an ideal setup,

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.360
 which is probably too extreme for most companies,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.800
 but the ideal setup is your Next.js.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.800
 Next.js, next.js app deployed to the edge,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.080
 but the back, but it's not talking to your database.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.920
 It's talking to a regional API,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.080
 like a GraphQL API, whatever,

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.320
 AppSync API, whatever it is.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.200
 And then that talks to your database.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.360
 That way your edge to regional can still be a single round trip

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.080
 'cause GraphQL, you can kind of like batch

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.720
 everything you need into a single request.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.920
 Then you can do as many round trips with the databases you want

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.200
 'cause your regional API is close to it

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.040
 like the response back.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.560
 I think that's like the ideal setup,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.240
 but I think people are not pursuing it as,

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.960
 oh, I don't need that regional API.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.320
 So the regional API just lives like in U.S. East one

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.640
 or something, if you're dumb.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.200
 And everyone else, yeah.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.880
 So if in that scenario, your Next.js API route

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.920
 is maybe hitting from like central Europe,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.120
 it's going across and hitting the U.S. data center.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.840
 So that's the slow part.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.040
 But how does that manifest?

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.200
 I'm just trying to think through,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.200
 that's the other thing I started thinking about is like

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.640
 on the right side, like on mutations in a GraphQL sense,

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.440
 how much does it even matter?

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.320
 How much does performance,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.160
 like I started getting really into nerding out on this stuff

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.920
 and then it's like, if you just optimistically

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.560
 like update your UI, does any of it matter?

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.960
 - I don't think it does.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.680
 My whole thing with this is we have tools

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.000
 to capture certain metrics, like all the White House scores.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.400
 That captures, like I said, a metrics

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.720
 and everyone knows them, so we can optimize for those.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.000
 But we don't have tools to measure other stuff.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.040
 Like when someone uses an app, does it feel fast?

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.440
 Like you can't pull every user and say like, how does this feel?

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.280
 I found that most of the answer to this is that feel fast

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.400
 doesn't come from these like architectural things.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400
 It comes from what you're talking about,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.720
 like little tricks that you do.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.200
 And you have to like lie to the user

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.840
 and make it seem like something happened instantly

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.960
 when it didn't.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.720
 That's where you get the snappy feeling apps from.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.560
 Like things like linear, superhuman, like things like that.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.840
 It doesn't really come from this stuff.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.840
 Like all of those systems,

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.840
 they're not like these crazy edge rendered things.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.600
 They're like old school SPA's.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.840
 I'm saying old school now because apparently SPA is.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.040
 - We've bent away from that.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.720
 And that's another thing I just want to talk to you about.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.040
 And I don't know, we'll get into something AWS

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.040
 at some point, I'm sure.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.480
 But the whole like MPA, SPA,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.200
 the whole dialogue around web right now,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.160
 honestly, it confuses me.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.040
 I don't even, I feel like I don't know enough

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.920
 to even engage in that conversation.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.480
 I see really smart people talking about it

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.520
 and like I'll literally read their tweets,

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.800
 like really smart people.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.560
 I'll read them and I just can't even comprehend

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.400
 what they're saying.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.760
 Do you understand that whole debate

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.040
 and like where things are going?

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.680
 Cause I just don't get it.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.520
 - Very little.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.200
 I definitely understand what these options are.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.120
 But like within the options that like the user understands,

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.440
 there's like all these sub options.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.280
 And I think it's mostly framework authors talking

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.880
 with each other on that, which makes sense.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.080
 Like we're never really gonna be able to keep up with that.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.760
 But I'm also confused because I work on like actual products

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.320
 and I like try to make them fast, make them feel snappy.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.600
 And there's things that I'm doing

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.400
 and there's things that I care about.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.760
 Then I look at the conversation about performance

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.120
 and I'm like, I'm not doing any of those things.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.000
 Is that bad?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.760
 Am I like optimizing for this thing that's gonna be dead?

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.840
 Like I'm also like, you know, working,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.120
 like we work, like we're building stuff for developers.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:25.960
 We wanna make sure we're aligned

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.440
 with where things are going.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.920
 But again, it's the same hype cycle, right?

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.520
 I don't think it fully makes sense,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.600
 but you know, the energy around it's impossible to get sucked in.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.160
 And what is the hype cycle on the whole MPA side?

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.840
 Like is the hype cycle that things like streaming

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.120
 at the edge matter?

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.960
 I don't even know.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.520
 I literally just can't even follow the conversation.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.320
 Like is there, is part of that on the hype cycle

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.160
 outside of the edge stuff?

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.920
 Yeah, I definitely would say there's definitely

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.720
 I see conversations with, oh, you're using an SPA,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.560
 that's bad, you need to be doing SSR.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.960
 Everything needs to be SSR.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.880
 If it's not SSR, it has bad performance.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.480
 Yeah, computers should be as like a C way of doing things.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.960
 If you see that, it's probably someone being tricked

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.960
 to use an SPA one day.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.400
 Like it's just like, you know, the usual things

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.240
 that you hear.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.360
 But I think there's a lot of things

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.000
 that make sense as SSR.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.280
 I literally never, my whole career, I never worked.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.760
 I generally don't work on stuff that's like public.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.120
 I work on stuff that's like a BDB SaaS application.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.240
 So it's for a specific number of users

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.760
 and that's not the whole internet.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.640
 And you don't need to worry about like the initial payloads

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.080
 and all that stuff, like how big the bundles are or whatever.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.240
 Yeah, it's like something like use it for like hours

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.160
 at a time because it's like a productivity tool.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.600
 So who cares about the initial load

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.560
 when it's like 0.001% of the whole session?

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.800
 Yeah.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.040
 The joke I made about the obsession with SSR was

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.480
 everyone is optimizing for sites where people land,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.760
 leave as fast as possible and never come back.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.600
 Yeah.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.280
 So I think that's part of the problem.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.200
 The thing is so hard in like all this debate

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.240
 and just thinking about new greenfield projects,

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.560
 I'm just always trying to build new stuff.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.680
 I think part of it's just playing

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.760
 with different new stuff, stacks and whatever.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.840
 But it's like, I can't even understand

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.920
 the different types of things that get deployed to the web.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.920
 And I know people talk about like apps versus sites,

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.640
 but it's way more complicated than that, right?

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.240
 Like do you have a good handle on that stuff?

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.960
 I'm just asking you random questions at this point.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.600
 It's just like it's none of this stuff

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.640
 is like bray sound in a clean category.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.200
 It's like even the app versus site thing, there's,

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.960
 so we have, so as I see we have our docs page.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.800
 Yeah.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.640
 So sorry, docs site.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.480
 So that's definitely like a site.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.560
 It's not an app you use, but even there,

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.560
 there's like client side routing versus server side routing.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.480
 It could be a site that people, for documentation,

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.000
 you might sit there and go to literally

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.160
 every single page and read everything.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.880
 So it makes sense to use client side routing.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.600
 So things like feel fast and you navigate.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.160
 But if people are landing there through Google

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.640
 and like reading one thing and leaving,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.760
 you know, then maybe you want to use server side or MPA,

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.360
 I guess it's called like all these acronyms are jumbled.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.520
 So yeah, it's just hard.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.720
 Like I think ultimately things matter.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.000
 Yeah, it doesn't matter.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.840
 Yeah, I mean, I go back to like the levels

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.120
 I owe like the Peter levels, like single PHP page,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.040
 remote okay or whatever.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.880
 Yeah.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.200
 So we don't care and we want to put that caring,

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.880
 like we want to project that caring onto something

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.680
 and there's things that are out there that are like,

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.680
 okay, if you care like do X, Y, Z.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.040
 So I mean, there's a lot out there that are saying,

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.640
 if you care, use this.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.200
 So all you have to do is care, you'll find something.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.880
 If you care, like you'll make it, you'll make it work well.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.840
 So what is your, if it's not, if edge is just part

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.120
 of the hype cycle right now and doesn't matter

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.920
 that much maybe and we're just all really excited,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.600
 what is the thing that does matter a lot you think right now?

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.440
 What's something like in terms of performance

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.680
 and in terms of building apps for devs like today?

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.520
 Just general purpose.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.080
 I know there's so many different types of use cases,

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.120
 but is there something that's further along the hype cycle

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.680
 that's actually maturing that you're excited about?

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.880
 Yeah, I do think like event driven architecture is something,

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.320
 I think past the hype cycle and lots of people

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.200
 using in production, real companies,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.960
 like lots of new interesting things with that.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.560
 And yeah, I think, I mean, that's like all my work is

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.920
 in that category as well.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.920
 Is that just the more, is that like the better way

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.560
 to put serverless these days?

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.560
 Like, is that kind of like serverless was too,

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.720
 like lumped in with too many things?

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.200
 So now we say event driven applications

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.680
 or is it like you can build a serverless app

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.440
 and not be event driven?

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.840
 Yeah, I know, I just know people hate the term serverless.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.480
 I've, I like, yeah, I don't have a problem with it,

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.160
 but it means the thing and I know it kind of means.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.720
 Yeah, I get what people are talking about.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.200
 But I think it just has baggage.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.600
 So now I say, 'cause when I say, you know,

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.720
 we're trying to make people use serverless

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.200
 so like you should use serverless people, I don't know,

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.960
 there's just some like projection that happens with it.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.720
 So when I say event driven architecture,

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.160
 I feel like that's what I care about.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.240
 I think event driven architecture allows

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.680
 for a lot of things to be serverless.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.200
 So it's unlikely you'll be doing that

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.840
 and also not being serverless.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.080
 But it does like whenever I start talking about like,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.880
 so I asked on Twitter, like why people avoid AWS

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.320
 and a lot of people respond in the way I expect,

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.720
 which is they're used to like deploying their thing

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.040
 and putting it on a VPS or a VM or something,

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.160
 digital ocean droplet and like AWS is more expensive

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.200
 or more confusing or whatever when I just need to do that.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.400
 But I think like that's the 15 years old way

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.920
 of doing app development.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.960
 And, but I hate using the term like monolith.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.320
 I don't want to be like,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.520
 oh, you shouldn't build a monolith and deploy it on a VM.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.840
 It's more just like, you shouldn't have to deploy on a VM

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.040
 and think about VMs or OSs or any of that stuff.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.960
 That's the thing that's important to me.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.000
 But I hate using words like distributed and monolith.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.440
 And I feel like that's not getting it to thing I care about.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.760
 Does that make sense to you?

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.840
 - Yeah, I totally relate to that.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.960
 I like monoliths because I like understanding

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.800
 everything that's going on.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.720
 I don't want like a million separate things that, you know,

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.520
 I just never worked at a company at this scale where,

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.760
 but under this scale, I mean like number of employees

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.120
 where that made sense.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:27.960
 - Yeah, same.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.800
 - I like monoliths.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.560
 I just don't want to have something running all the time.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.240
 The thing I like about the reason I've been using

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.080
 the Ray's event driven architecture more is,

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.320
 the idea I like is that your system doesn't exist

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.040
 unless it's processing some work.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.080
 - Okay, yeah, I like that.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.560
 I mean, that's the skills to zero kind of thing.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.400
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.880
 Unless there's a request that someone asked for,

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.640
 it's like your system does not, there's nothing running,

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.200
 there's no VM running, you're not getting charged for that.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.920
 It's not something that can like turn into a memory leak,

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.760
 whatever.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.160
 It's a whole class of problems that go away.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.240
 And yeah, it's tough because it's one of those things

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.800
 where it seems like minor.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.240
 Like what's the difference between a VM always running

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.880
 and what I'm describing?

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.160
 There's just like a million downstream effects that,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.680
 once you start using it, you're like,

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.480
 oh, I don't have to deal with this anymore.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.400
 - Yeah, well, like I've been in the world

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.240
 where you deploy apps to VMs

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.440
 and you have to think about those VMs

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.400
 and a disk fills up or something.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.240
 Something annoying like that.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.840
 And that's the kind of stuff I never want to think about again.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.520
 And that's, I guess, the promise

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.480
 and what I love about building serverless apps.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.440
 But I guess I want to go back to the monolith thing.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.360
 So event driven architectures, does that not imply,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.400
 like it's not a monolith somehow?

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.200
 Like I feel like those two terms are sort of like,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.320
 at conflict and I can't figure out why.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.160
 - Yeah, I think again, that's why I feel like

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.600
 we have to make up new terms for everything

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.720
 because everything just has baggage.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.520
 So when people, I think historically it was like,

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.640
 your application is a monolith,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.160
 meaning it runs in one process.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.960
 You should break it up into microservices.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.440
 So it's not a monolith.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.160
 And therefore monolith meant not distributed

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.360
 and not monolith meant distributed.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.400
 But for me, I think when I say I'm here monolith,

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.520
 I just mean when you're writing code,

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.040
 when you're authoring code, it feels like one system

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.160
 that you're working on.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.000
 - Yeah.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.400
 - You can easily touch all parts of this.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.000
 It's not this like broken up thing.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.760
 - So it's like author time monolith,

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.400
 not necessarily like infrastructure monolith.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.800
 Like the way it's deployed is maybe very distributed

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.440
 or something, but that's like less the concern.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.320
 It's more like author time concern.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.160
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.600
 And an author time, like especially for the first several,

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.560
 several years of your company, you probably want a monolith.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.120
 - Yeah, the only, and I would say even

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.320
 what the microservices are out,

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.320
 I think I've only ever seen one company

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.440
 get microservices right, which is CloudFlare.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.680
 So they have a whole microservice system,

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.840
 even their functions as their functions platform

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.560
 is built on a concept of services.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.840
 But they remove the distributed part from it entirely.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.160
 They run every single service on every single machine.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.980
 So all the services talk to each other

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.900
 within the same machine.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.880
 So all the complexities of having

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.520
 a distributed system go away.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.480
 So I think they're capturing like the benefits

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.360
 of the isolation and like the compartmentalization

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.880
 without the overhead of just like,

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.120
 it literally being a distributed system.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.400
 But yeah, everywhere else, it's kind of like,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.600
 you now have all these distributed systems problems.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.520
 And I used to be like, I said, you like, you know,

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.040
 I used to be a heavy Kubernetes user.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.520
 So I'm not just hating on this stuff from like,

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.360
 I'm on this team.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.960
 I'm like, I used to be on that team.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.960
 And I remember all the skills that I was proud of having

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.040
 that looking back, I'm just like,

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.000
 I should just not have developed those.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.520
 (laughing)

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.400
 I'm on the other side.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.080
 I mean, I've never messed with Kubernetes,

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.080
 but I'm still on the hating side, I guess.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.840
 That's a whole nother conversation that,

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.000
 I definitely want to get into like the small team

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.080
 versus big team conversation.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.240
 I think that's a separate maybe conversation.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.480
 But I definitely have thoughts about all that.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.760
 And this is all very like, it's very topical for me.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.120
 I'm just trying to like communicate some of this stuff.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.160
 And I feel like I run into the same walls in my brain

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.760
 when I try to explain like,

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.640
 no, I think there's better ways today

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.080
 than we've done all these years.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.200
 And it's just very hard to like communicate

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.680
 what that better way is and why I think it's a better way.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.120
 But it is very much coming from a context of small team

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.760
 or solo development.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.120
 I just don't live outside of that.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.320
 I gotta be honest though, I feel like you don't,

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.040
 I feel the pressure to add that qualifier to like

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.380
 four small teams or for qualified for whatever.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.640
 But to be honest, I don't really think that's necessarily true.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.520
 Like everything we do in the way we do things,

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.040
 we can find examples of big companies doing it

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.960
 the exact same way.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.960
 I kind of feel like that just turns into a thing

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.320
 where people say like,

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.480
 oh, what you're saying doesn't work at CO.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.000
 You can't really argue with them.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.920
 - So you're saying like my intuition

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.480
 about how things should be built today.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.600
 I've assumed that was just for little teams

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.960
 and I just don't understand big teams.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.120
 You're saying that might apply to big teams as well?

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.880
 - Yeah, I kind of like,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.160
 it's kind of taken for granted that the big team

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.200
 should, is inevitable or has to exist

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.880
 or they have to operate a certain way.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.560
 But I know teams that are operating at massive scale

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.320
 and their system doesn't look too different

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.880
 from anything URI do.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.960
 It's a little more advanced 'cause it has more years

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.160
 and more maturity, but yeah,

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.720
 they're doing everything the same way that we're doing.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.920
 So, I mean, that's the thing about this way of building

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.800
 is just like how much leverage every individual has.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.720
 And just as a team,

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.120
 how much smaller you can be and accomplish so much more.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.800
 I don't know how it all plays out,

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.560
 but I can't help but think that like,

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.280
 there's this whole wave of disruption

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.760
 where teams that are 5% the size of big companies,

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.160
 teams are just completely cleaning up

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.560
 because they just have so much less to deal with

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.080
 and such a smaller footprint.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.720
 And just like the fidelity of communication

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.800
 is so much higher when you have a small team.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.760
 I mean, ideally it's one person's brain,

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.800
 like everything can flow through there.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.640
 If one person could accomplish all of it.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.320
 - That's the ideal company, it's one person.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.480
 - Yeah, right.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.000
 So as things trend that way,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.360
 it just does seem like how are all these big companies

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.680
 gonna justify their giant teams

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.480
 when it gets easier and easier to build.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.560
 I mean, it all kind of depends on these managed services

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.880
 that ultimately a big team, like the AWS team.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.520
 I don't know, it's a bunch of little teams really.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.120
 They're putting together this stuff that allows for that.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.320
 So I don't know how that all plays in.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.040
 It does seem like there's some like

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.960
 at the utility level need for big companies

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.560
 to push this stuff forward,

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.240
 but it just opens up these doors

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.880
 where I feel like little startups that are tiny

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.720
 can accomplish more and more.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.200
 We've got data points of that.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.080
 It's just like their little dots on the timeline

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.480
 that don't get enough attention, I don't think.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.320
 - Yeah.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.420
 And I think, again, just having been in a different mindset,

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.200
 the work that we consider overhead

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.760
 or like you should outsource at AWS,

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.640
 it feels really valuable when you're doing it

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.680
 at the company you're doing it at 'cause it,

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.000
 you're really solving problems, you're really unblocking stuff,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.780
 you're really making stuff better.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.920
 And when people say, when people like us are saying,

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.160
 oh, you shouldn't be doing any of that.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.800
 It understandably feels like what are you talking about?

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.920
 It's like obviously necessary

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.720
 and a lot of the quality comes from that.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.360
 But I think the thing you realize when you flip over

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.760
 is there are just a million things

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.120
 you could be working on at any company.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.480
 Oh yeah, if you're working on this,

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.800
 if that goes away, they're just a million things

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.280
 that you could be doing to make your product or company better.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.280
 You're never gonna run out of work.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.720
 There's always something better you could be doing.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.560
 - So the more you can like select

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.840
 into the most valuable thing, the better.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.880
 'Cause there's always that optimization problem.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.160
 It's not going away.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.000
 - Interesting.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.640
 I still don't know if I feel like I can explain

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.960
 how I think serverless or event-driven applications

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.840
 are the future.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.760
 I always just go back to Simon Woodley on Twitter.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.800
 He's like my anchor.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.120
 Whenever I start doubting all this,

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.240
 I just go back to his tweets.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.480
 And I'm like, yeah, he's too smart.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.480
 He gets it.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.320
 - Yeah.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.400
 - There's a lot of people on all of that option too.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.240
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.160
 I mean, he's covered like the whole cloud adoption side.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.200
 I don't know.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.960
 I guess like what is the future for things like Kubernetes?

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.520
 I don't know what the theme of this episode is anymore.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.240
 I'm just like coming up with more thoughts,

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.960
 just bubbling the service.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.240
 But I guess like, are people deceived?

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.520
 Is there, is it not the future?

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.600
 'Cause I know Simon Woodley has said things like,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.480
 I think it's a distraction.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.720
 I think the whole containerization obsession

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.480
 and Kubernetes obsession is a distraction

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.480
 that's set back serverless quite a bit

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.640
 using serverless as a term for kind of what we're talking about here.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.320
 Is that like, is that how you view it?

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.440
 That like, or is there a place for it alongside serverless?

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.320
 It just feels like there's a lot of smart people on both sides.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.520
 It can't all be wrong.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.240
 - Yeah, I think the way, at least the way I felt,

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.120
 is my whole career,

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.160
 I've been figuring out how to manage nodes with less work.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.440
 So back when we had physical servers,

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.720
 like how can I best manage them?

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.440
 Then we got like VMs, how can I best manage those nodes?

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.640
 We got containers, how can I best manage those nodes?

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.320
 And Kubernetes came out and it is the best way

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.400
 to manage nodes, or one of the best ways.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.520
 Like there are some like,

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.200
 Hashi Korps thing is also very good, Nomad.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.040
 But in the whole history of managing nodes,

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.320
 this is like, it's so good.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.000
 It's so much better than any other stuff I've ever had to deal with,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.440
 especially with like, you know,

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.960
 doing it through Terraform and all that.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.680
 It is amazing.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.640
 But the thing that happened was,

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.240
 what if I, what if someone told you,

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.760
 you actually don't have to manage nodes?

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.880
 - I was gonna say, what is a node?

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.200
 Just like something that runs that you're responsible for.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.320
 - Okay, I already don't like it, okay, keep going.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.000
 - Yeah, so I think that's why people love Kubernetes

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.800
 'cause they've been doing some flavor

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.240
 of managing nodes their whole career.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.120
 And it's always been a pain

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.880
 and Kubernetes makes it a lot easier.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.720
 But the question is like,

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.240
 do we even need to manage those anymore?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.720
 'Cause now there's a whole other option

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.720
 that's kind of coming out of left field

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.840
 that is very, very different.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.680
 - Yeah.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.520
 - I mean, don't need to do that.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.920
 And then these things look kind of like overly complicated

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.280
 where like, why does this even exist?

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.440
 - Yeah, it's funny, like my Twitter timeline is so,

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.600
 it's split between what I feel like is this crazy,

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.640
 complicated thing that people dove into with Kubernetes

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.320
 and then like deploy your whole app on Vercel

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.360
 and you don't need anything else.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.600
 It's like the two polar, I feel like opposites of like,

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.120
 well, I look at Vercel and I'm like,

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.760
 there's more, you need more to build apps.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.000
 And then I look at Kubernetes and I'm like,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 I don't know what that is, but I don't really,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.160
 I feel like that's too much to have to think about.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.600
 - Then I see very little of that middle ground

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.360
 of what I think is this amazing way to build apps.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.480
 I don't know, I don't know, lots of thoughts.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.320
 - I don't know.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.120
 And I think it's also hard to gauge.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.800
 I think we're on Twitter, social media, et cetera.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.520
 And that's like, I think at least for myself,

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.280
 that's where I get a feel for what's going on.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.360
 But if you look at actual data for what's going on,

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.200
 it's like very different.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.280
 Like almost the opposite of anything we see.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.600
 So that's always tough.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.920
 So Twitter is, it's just a small,

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.040
 I mean, it's a pretty small network,

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.120
 I guess, of people that actually get on Twitter

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.840
 and say anything.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.680
 I mean, if it's like not even all the devs are on Twitter,

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:26.000
 like what percentage of people on Twitter actually tweet.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.400
 So yeah, it makes sense.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.480
 - Yeah.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.400
 And Twitter tends to be like really front-end heavy

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.920
 and like there's very--

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.760
 - Yeah, worries that we've talked about this before.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.320
 What's that about?

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.080
 Like your theory is that back-end developers

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.400
 just have an amazing life and they don't need the internet

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.800
 or social media.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.600
 - I have no idea.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.200
 I mean, I think I'm mostly a back-end.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.760
 - I think I am too.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.480
 - I mean, I just am so slow at front-end,

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.920
 I must be a back-end developer.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.000
 (laughing)

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.600
 I don't know why else I'd be so bad at front-end.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.440
 - Yeah.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.720
 Sometimes I think I'm a good front-end developer

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.880
 then I see some stuff and I'm like,

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.360
 I actually have no idea how they did that.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.080
 So I can't be a front-end developer.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.680
 - Do you have any working theories for the discrepancy?

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.280
 Why the public discourse, even like Hacker News and stuff,

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.440
 well, maybe not as much.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.280
 I don't get on there.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.120
 I don't know.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:11.960
 It's been a long time.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.000
 But it does seem like front-end dev

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.640
 just sort of dominates the conversation.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.520
 - Yeah, I think it might be,

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.320
 I'm not showing up as an age thing.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.320
 Like if you're earlier in your career,

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.200
 I think you're more likely to be a front-end engineer

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.520
 'cause I was exactly the same way.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.600
 You wanna learn how to build stuff,

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.880
 you want that immediate feedback

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.280
 that you're making progress.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.880
 Front-end is like the best place to do that.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.560
 And I think people that are maybe earlier

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.920
 in their career are also more likely to be on Twitter.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.840
 - I'm having this stuff that they're building

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.760
 can fit into this like mostly front-end

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.480
 with a little back-end model that, you know,

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.680
 Verzell is great for.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.400
 - Yeah, I'm having this flashback.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.040
 Like I've heard someone say that and I think it was you.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.520
 I think we've had this conversation.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:53.600
 I'm just remembering.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.520
 You say, it makes sense.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.680
 Like the feedback loop.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.200
 If you're, or maybe it was someone else actually,

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.400
 it could have been someone else that talked about like,

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.720
 when you're building back-end stuff,

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.840
 there's very little that you can like iterate and see.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.640
 It's so much easier to just build a front-end app

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.960
 and like you change the CSS and you see the button change.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.080
 And like there's that immediate loop.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.720
 Whereas back-end stuff is a little more like,

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.320
 hard to get that, I guess.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.160
 - I get feedback.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.160
 - You've got the right JSON response.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.840
 - You're right, yeah.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.000
 - Exactly.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.240
 I love back-end work.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.560
 I mean, I love obviously cloud stuff.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.440
 I just think every time I do front-end development,

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.140
 I get sucked into it for like weeks

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.080
 to try and do the simplest of things.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.920
 All right, I don't know how long we've been talking.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.040
 Is this an episode, Dax?

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.040
 - This is gonna be a little rough.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.760
 I'm just gonna be honest.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.080
 These first episodes, figuring out a new format.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.520
 - I think it'll be good.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.520
 - I think it's gonna be great.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.640
 I'm excited about it.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.080
 - No rough, but I think it'll be good, yeah.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.360
 - Yeah, a little rough, gonna be good.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.360
 We're gonna just keep doing it.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.120
 And I think that's the trick is like,

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.440
 you just keep doing stuff and it ends up really good,

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.960
 eventually, I don't know.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.800
 - Yeah.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.120
 - We have any other thoughts on the edge.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.440
 That's what we started talking about.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.560
 (laughing)

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.840
 - Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how we should title these like.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.680
 - Yeah, this one's gonna be-

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.840
 - Maybe just be like comma separated list of all the topics.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.860
 - Yeah, that works for me.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.280
 There was stuff I wanted to kind of dig at,

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.100
 like in terms of the edge and how it relates like AWS services.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.840
 I think of like a lot of the problem I have with the edge is like,

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.080
 so Lambda at Edge, you can do all the Lambda E things,

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.280
 node runtime, like, I think it's constrained a little bit.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.720
 Maybe you can only do node and Python or something.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.120
 I don't know, not all the run times.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.600
 - There's like really weird restrictions.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.440
 I don't know if you know this,

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.880
 but Lambda Edge cannot have environment variables.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.960
 - Oh, really?

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.000
 - It's like- - It's such a pain.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.200
 - Huh, yeah, I feel like I've done some Lambda Edge stuff.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.120
 And I guess I never noticed,

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.080
 but that seems like a pretty big thing you would notice.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.760
 - But there's some really weird stuff in SST where we like,

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.440
 let you think there's environment variables,

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.520
 then we do like a string replace in your code.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.360
 Wow.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.440
 - Half our deploys.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.280
 - Okay.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.120
 - Yeah.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.280
 - So Lambda at Edge and then,

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.400
 but that's only in like 14, okay.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.960
 It's like more than the regions,

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.840
 but less than the actual edge, like CloudFront.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.160
 Edges, nodes, whatever, right?

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.960
 Lambda Edge doesn't actually run.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.480
 It sits like between the regions

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.720
 and then all the actual edge locations.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.560
 - Yeah.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.400
 - And then there's five different--

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.800
 - The average latency on it is different.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.920
 - Yeah.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:19.760
 - Yeah.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.640
 But then like if you want to use the CloudFront functions

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.200
 where you run and compute actually at the edge,

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.520
 it's like you can't interact with the page body.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.520
 Like you can only kind of like change the headers and stuff.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.680
 And I just don't know,

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.800
 I guess there's things that that's good for.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.400
 - It's also limited to like a five millisecond runtime

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.240
 or something.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.060
 - Oh yeah.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:37.900
 - It's super short, yeah.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:38.740
 - Yeah.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:39.560
 - So is that work cloud?

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.560
 I've never played with CloudFlare workers.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.640
 Are they more like actually at the edge

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.760
 and actually you can do stuff?

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.200
 Is there, there's like advantages there?

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.400
 - Yeah, I have a whole thing on this.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.400
 So up front disclosure, CloudFlare is the biggest

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.920
 position in my portfolio.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.760
 - Oh.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.600
 - Like I own a ton of CloudFlare.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.520
 - I was waiting for like CloudFlare

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.080
 sponsored this episode and I was excited.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.640
 Like, oh, that's cool.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.920
 Okay, so big, so you're a big CloudFlare fan.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.880
 - You're an investor and that we got it.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.800
 Disclaimed, I've never had to disclaim something.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.920
 I'm being really awkward now

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.240
 because I've never had to do this on a podcast.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.880
 Okay, we've done it.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.440
 We've done the disclaimer CloudFlare, legal.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.280
 You can step away.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.040
 Okay, go ahead, Dak.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.200
 - Yeah, so like, but that's all backed by I think my,

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.720
 just my excitement around what they're doing.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.480
 So I think like we all love the serverless world.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.840
 I think realistically today AWS is the only one

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.880
 that has a complete serverless platform.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.280
 Like it's more than just functions, right?

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.640
 It's functions, queues, all the stuff you need

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.840
 to do a full application.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.360
 And I feel like CloudFlare is the only other company

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.180
 really getting to that level of completeness.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.240
 A lot of that stuff is like still in preview

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.920
 and you know, not widely accessible.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.440
 I think they still have like five plus years to go

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.920
 before like this competition really shows up.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.920
 But yeah, I love their functions platform.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.080
 I think it makes a lot of sense.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.320
 They have really good options.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.960
 It all works well, nicely well together.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.720
 I think with AWS, it feels like it grew more organically

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.920
 and accidentally and with CloudFlare, it was more like,

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.560
 okay, we already know serverless exists

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.000
 and we're like bought into this concept.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.320
 What is like the ideal vision?

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.280
 - They got to kind of design it and build it

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.840
 when it was a thing already.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.440
 Like they had more of a target,

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.040
 whereas AWS kind of invented it sort of in ways.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.080
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.520
 So it's like it's a lot cleaner

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.360
 and there's like less weirdness with everything.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.800
 - But I feel like the only ones that can be,

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.760
 so I think you and I believe that this is

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.560
 like the future of way most applications will be built.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.880
 - Yeah.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.100
 - AWS is like so well positioned.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.080
 But yeah, they're like run time.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.120
 So they have their own run time.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.240
 So the downside is you can't use most node modules,

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.880
 like the most MPM packages.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.720
 - Right.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.560
 - Is that a downside?

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.720
 I think it's kind of like a good filter.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.240
 (laughing)

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.960
 Kind of prevents you from using stuff that isn't great.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.240
 But you can more or less build whatever you want

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.480
 within their run time.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.880
 I think we're all going to be a little annoyed

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.920
 with all these different run times.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.040
 Like you got node, which we're all familiar with.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.120
 Now, Cloudflare has their own.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.800
 There's like Denno and then it was a button

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.600
 and button is going to be fully compatible.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.360
 So that might not be an issue.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.960
 There's like an explosion of run times right now,

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.440
 which is kind of annoying.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.840
 But yeah, I think there's their setup is really good.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.960
 It makes a lot of sense.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.000
 It's really focused on this event driven thing.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.080
 So I don't know how many people are actually using it,

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.280
 but that's my one, I guess my one big question.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.280
 When I hear that like there is no infrastructure as code,

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.640
 how do you actually, are you console clicking?

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.720
 Like what do you, how are you defining apps for Cloudflare?

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.360
 So they have, I wouldn't call it infrastructure as code.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.320
 It's more like a framework for building Cloudflare apps.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.320
 And it was like a CLI tool.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.440
 So it's like all fit and the CLI tool do deployments.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.280
 Yeah.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.360
 So, and you're like, you're building out, like you're just writing

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.720
 TypeScript files or something and using this library.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.320
 Exactly.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.160
 It's like, it's like a, it's more opinionated

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.600
 than you get with AWS because you have to figure out

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.360
 how to structure things, but have like 30% more of a framework

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.440
 and there's a clear way of how you structure applications,

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.400
 how you breaks apart, all gets deployed as these like

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.080
 individual functions that run.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.360
 And there's options for like queues and like,

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:27.800
 like an S3 equivalent and like some database options as well.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.800
 Okay.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.440
 I just, I think you've picked my curiosity, peaked, I don't know.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.920
 You've got me curious if there is actually some kind of,

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.520
 I just imagine like zipping up things and like

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.960
 uploading them through a web UI.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.560
 And that's how you define a Cloudflare application.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.400
 That was just sort of a non-starter in my mind.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.120
 That's where my mind goes when I hear no infrastructure as code.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.200
 But this sounds like not terrible.

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:55.520
 And it makes sense, I guess if people like enjoy building on it,

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.720
 it wouldn't be terrible.

00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.080
 So I shouldn't just jump to the most terrible possibility.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.040
 Yeah.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.400
 It doesn't cover everything and I do,

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.080
 I think they do need to add some native IAC thing in there.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.280
 That's a huge task.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.120
 Oh yeah.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.000
 They might already be working on it, but yeah.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.120
 Okay, that's enough of our edge talk

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.760
 and whatever else we talked about.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.560
 And we're just gonna, we're gonna end it.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.400
 I don't know.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.240
 Goodbye Dax.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.440
 I don't know what do I say at the end of that alone.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.280
 (laughing)

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.120
 So hard.

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.780
 (upbeat music)
