WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
 How crazy if Dax's cat just died in the middle of our episode?

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.620
 I realize now I can just talk because this is gonna be on YouTube. It won't make it on the podcast

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.720
 But it will be on YouTube so I can just talk I just talked to YouTube when you leave. Yeah, I always forget

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.720
 People are talking about New Jersey on Twitter. Let's take a look at it

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.880
 You see Ryan Florence's tweet remix reacts New Jersey. I saw that. Yeah, it may be wonder if he was listening to our

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.400
 Podcast well, I didn't know if if that was a positive thing or a negative thing like it has to be a positive thing

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:03.800
 Yeah, so he knows the positive side of New Jersey not everyone does. Yeah, I replied like oh, so it's super underrated

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.160
 But actually pretty sick like that's I

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:15.160
 Thought it was the armpit of the u.s. So is rain makes the armpit of react. Yeah, I thought New Jersey before our conversation with

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.560
 Ken I thought it was the Arkansas of New York, which is like

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.040
 Meet Missouri's Arkansas. Does that make sense? So Arkansas is kind of like

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.920
 To people in Missouri, which I'm realizing now

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.960
 The fact that we think we can like shit on anything is funny

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.480
 But if we do it's Arkansas and then Australia has New Zealand. I'm sorry. I just defended whole people groups

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.720
 I'm sorry

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.840
 But I thought New Jersey was that to New York. I mean, yeah, it is like a third of it for sure

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.440
 But it shouldn't be

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.800
 Maybe that's what we're saying. Yeah, okay. It's funny

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.560
 Well if I had to rewind a little bit you said Arkansas in my head whenever I hear Arkansas my in my brain

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.760
 It goes our Kansas because at some point I realized it's just it's just Kansas

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:17.680
 That's one and then two there is this point dynamic of like no matter how

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.080
 You know, low on the totem pole you are like you can always find someone

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.960
 Yeah, let's point this out the other day because she ran into

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.200
 like a homeless guy and he was like in Dunkin Donuts and

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.280
 There was another homeless guy there and the other homeless guy had left the first homeless guy started like

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.280
 Saying like kind of racist stuff about the other homeless guy

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.400
 So that's kind of like he's like this guy's like, okay

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.640
 I'm homeless, but at least I'm not homeless and black like that's like his

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.280
 He like creates and not like a mini hierarchy within that so that's that's you guys in Missouri in our Kansas in my head

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.280
 It's just yeah, you know one big circle before you before you answer the New Jersey thing

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.920
 Could you just tell me like before you heard me say that would you have like rated Missouri or Arkansas higher than the other either one?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.800
 I think I would have rated Missouri higher because but that's just because I know about it and I like I know more about it

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.240
 And that's yeah, yeah partially related to you because I know you but then like I know

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.760
 Kansas City and like, you know, mm-hmm all that stuff. I know those arcs

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.920
 So I've definitely heard of those things. Yeah, okay

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.680
 The Ozarks should go this stretch into Arkansas too, but and Arkansas has good parts like Northwest Arkansas is great

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.000
 Because all the Walmart money

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.840
 Wait, is that where they were founded? Yeah, I've been Bill

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.320
 Arkansas they've got like XNA the airport there is like bigger than it should be because the Walmart people just fly to New York

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.160
 Cost that I guess well that puts that puts Arkansas ahead of Missouri for me

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.440
 Yeah, I guess so Northwest Arkansas probably tips the scales the rest of Arkansas is like the Ozarks

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.440
 I mean, it's basically like

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.640
 It's the Ozarks and then Missouri has Kansas City and St. Louis is kind of like I don't know. I'm not a big fan of St. Louis

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.280
 Just never really enjoy it's just very rundown like the downtown area in St. Louis is not great Kansas City is much more like

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.440
 Up and coming a lot of development. It's nice. Anyway. Yeah, that's enough about Missouri

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.320
 Well, there's that quote boy. There's that quote. There's I'm gonna butcher it, but it's something like there's two great cities in America

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.280
 New York and San Francisco and everywhere else is Cleveland

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:28.560
 And that's kind of been my experience with other like quote-unquote cities, you know

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.960
 They're like kind of the same format and there are like little like they're all like different pockets that are a little bit different but

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.120
 Largely like

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.240
 They're one big city and it like you know is just Cleveland over

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:53.880
 That's funny, okay, so the New Jersey you're gonna hi. Yeah, I know we talked about this with Ken, but I just want to reiterate

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.240
 New Jersey is a fantastic place. Yeah, I need to give it a look

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.120
 I will agree that it's not broadly fantastic like you have to find the pockets, but there are like some crazy

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.960
 Nice pockets like where I grew up. I think is like

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.700
 Looking back after all these years as like a kid growing up in America

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.920
 Like where I grew up at least from middle-school onward

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:23.760
 Whether than in Jersey does it was like almost like a dreamland like it was a perfect place to grow up

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.520
 Yeah, wow, I praise New Jersey's great and a lot of people choose to live there

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.480
 Especially rich people and that's how you know

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.980
 People that I usually move to New Jersey eventually interesting, okay

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.120
 But rich people don't choose to live in the Ozarks, so that's how you know

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.560
 That's why it's so affordable, damn it

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.360
 Okay, we got we got a lot of stuff to talk about and where do you want to start?

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.360
 I guess we're a little behind on some things

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.400
 Yeah, yeah, because the planet scale stuff we haven't talked about and now already feels like to new

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.000
 Yeah, yeah, the news cycles. They move fast. Yeah in our circles. I guess we start with that

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.280
 Yeah, I'll start with that. I'm really happy that Aaron Francis got fired. I think that guy

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.680
 And I'm glad to see him without a job and

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.160
 His family with his four kids

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.400
 I'm really excited to see them suffer. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds like you

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.120
 I know you're messing around, but it does kind of sound like you to rejoice in someone's suffering

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.880
 If I don't like him. Yeah, I would probably be rejoicing

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.880
 I think the yeah, the Aaron situation

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.600
 It was really hard for me to feel bad and I've talked to Aaron

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.840
 But like I'm not just saying this behind his back

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.720
 But it was hard for me to feel that bad because I just feel like good for him like he's gonna do so well

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.760
 Whatever he chooses to do he has so many options that people you know, you saw the outreach like yeah

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.520
 But it's just it is pretty surprising like the whole play of scale thing and I feel like I've ranted online about this a lot

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:07.360
 So I don't want to just rant on the podcast to the whole thing like just felt like why why is there so much discourse around this?

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.080
 Like just a startup made a decision and did a thing that happens

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.800
 But I think the thing with Aaron is like that is the one decision

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.280
 They made that I'm like man, how could that not have been an ROI like how is that guy?

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.720
 Yeah, it's a little weird growing your YouTube like that one is tough for me

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.920
 But I don't know like I'm not I'm not internal to play it's good

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.200
 I don't know, you know, all the things that go into it like I know that yeah, so I know they're not stupid

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.680
 Yeah, exactly. Yeah, but it does just seem like any organization

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.000
 That's like hey, it'd be great if we had a YouTube channel can just like scoop him up and suddenly have a YouTube channel

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.360
 Yeah, I know like literally nobody has pulled that off ever. Yeah, right guarantee that you would yeah

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.640
 I'm excited for him to I had a call with him also and I genuinely feel like

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.600
 He's gonna look back on this in a couple years and be like wow

00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:00.120
 I would have totally kept myself if I ended up staying there, especially if he goes independent like I feel like he's gonna I

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.080
 Wouldn't be surprised if he's like quadrupling his income in a couple years

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.800
 That's how I feel and that's my advice is like just do the independent thing cuz like

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:16.240
 There's no ceiling all the reasons that we've talked about I do wonder like I'm I follow the NFL

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.520
 I've mentioned this on the channel. It's kind of out of character for me

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.920
 I mean not out of character in the sense that I live in the Midwest and like we're all depressed and what do we do?

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:31.240
 We just watch sports, but you started a sports company like yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, so definitely not out of character

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.240
 Okay, I follow the NFL, whatever

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.160
 Unapologetically sometimes I'm embarrassed by it. I don't know why

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:42.280
 But in the NFL it's like free agency right now and I feel like Aaron is a free agent and it's like the first time

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:47.840
 I've felt this way about somebody being unemployed like oh, man. He can go get the bag

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.440
 Go sign whatever big deal

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.600
 Cuz he's gonna have all these opportunities at once so that is tempting

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.120
 I would imagine on his side to like explore that and I know he's gonna explore it

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.440
 But yeah, the independent thing man. It's just hard to beat. Yeah, I don't know

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:10.760
 Yeah, so I feel good for Aaron in that way and it sucks to get laid off and I'm sure with two new babies

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.640
 And all that the stress of of all that it's yeah, and it sounds like you bought a house

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.960
 Yeah, there's a lot that goes into it, but yeah, like you said two years from now

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.940
 I think he'll look back and say good thing

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:26.800
 Cuz look where I am yeah, yeah going back to the actual thing. So just to just to recap

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.120
 so planet scale did a few things they

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:36.040
 laid off a bunch of people mostly in marketing sales, but also some engineers they also got rid of their free tier and

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.920
 They put it all together in one post announcing this and also mentioning that

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.320
 These actions they can now you know chart a path to profitability

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.520
 Which means they're now a real company. Yeah, they can work on this forever

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.520
 Which is a big milestone again is a point where we can work on something forever is

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.200
 It's huge and obviously like you can get there earlier or later depending on how many people you have and things like that

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.440
 So that's a big milestone. I think what anyone that's starting a company like getting to that is like

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.160
 Your mindset is just totally different

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.800
 You're like you can kind of like relax a little bit and like really focus on doing big things as opposed to like

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.320
 You know just trying to like stay alive

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.400
 you can make different decisions like you can have a more long-term mindset because

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.960
 Like yeah, you're not beholden to yeah investors and that whole cycle

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.760
 And I think what you said real company is very important for people to understand most the companies

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:34.080
 Especially in the dev tools space most these companies you interact with are not real companies in the sense that like they could just go away and

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:42.800
 I don't know like I think there's this feeling that people like we've all gotten not just founders the entrepreneurs side of it

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.560
 Like feeling entitled to capital, but I think as users of all these things we've just like yeah

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.200
 There should be lots of startups and they should all just be doing well and like I don't know

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.320
 It's like a customer. We've gotten spoiled to buy the VC cycle, but like

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:03.480
 It's different. It's different when you're profitable and that that it's like now

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.600
 We can kind of count on planet scale in a way

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.040
 You can't count on just any database company that hasn't gotten there yet

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.640
 It's like a big long journey that makes sense. And then I think you by the way, I've been I've been I really liked your Twitter the past week

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.200
 I know I've like mentioned a few times when I say it directly like

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.880
 It's good. It's good. You're like is it isn't good because I don't know if it's good for my mental health

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.480
 I think you're right. Yes. That's definitely a factor

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.000
 but I think what I saw is

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.840
 But you like tweeted a bunch of things that like were very like genuine is what you felt and then like it angered a lot of people

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:43.560
 But I also felt like through that chaos and stimulus you then also had like really good things to say

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.720
 Mmm. I feel like you're always like I never really need to say but I feel like

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:53.560
 Your tweets is past week or whatever beyond just the ones that were just like, you know, making people annoyed. I feel like

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.160
 Just like good stuff came out of that

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.840
 So I've been on Twitter more the last week

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.680
 for reasons

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.800
 related to tech or Twitter like for family reasons

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.000
 So I've not been working much the last week. Do I say stuff like this in the podcast?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.560
 I don't even know I don't know families are hard like life is hard

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.880
 Families are hard and like if you're a parent and you're listening

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.440
 I'm gonna say it

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.320
 I'm just gonna say what happened because why not if I can't just like be

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:31.280
 Myself on the podcast when can I be myself, you know, I guess not on the podcast the rest of my life that I don't record

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:41.200
 What's the point of anything? Yeah, raising kids is hard and

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.920
 sometimes it gets so hard that

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.280
 One of you just wants to leave and one of you just leaves for days

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:57.280
 So Casey she she needed a break and I totally get it not like for me. I don't think I mean kind of for me

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.340
 But like from the family situation

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.640
 So she spent some time in Kansas City. I was in prompt to I was

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.680
 recommending it like this was not like she just left us

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:13.280
 But it was very much needed for her to just unplug from it all

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:19.280
 I got to experience a few days with the boys and why she needed to unplug now. Honestly. I need to unplug

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.760
 badly

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.680
 It's it's a lot and I don't know sometimes like I think man

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:31.120
 How do people with more than two kids do it? Like we just have two kids. How do people with four kids do it?

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.880
 I think not every kid is the same and

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.600
 Our four-year-old is a challenge and I'm not going to say anymore

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.200
 I guess because I don't know if these podcasts live forever

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.680
 I don't want him like an adulthood to have therapy because he heard this on the podcast. I don't know

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:54.480
 But anyway, yeah, every kid's different and right now we got we got a challenging dynamic with the two of them

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.160
 So all that to say I've just been dad for a few days

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.200
 And when I'm just dad there's more time to just top on Twitter and say stupid stuff

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.560
 I see you're welcome Twitter. You're welcome in that

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.000
 When I don't have my work to distract me, I guess

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.560
 But it did make me realize like I can have things to say if I just set and think about it for 15 minutes like I just never

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:23.280
 Really devote time to like thinking about what I've learned in my career or what I have to add to the conversation

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.200
 Uh, it's just kind of more like scrolling when I get free time

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.360
 I look at Twitter, but I don't really think about that kind of stuff. Anyway, yeah, I thought about stuff

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.920
 I said stuff. It also like when there's people talking about things that I do feel like

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.680
 like I've done the startup thing for 10 years. I've been

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:46.000
 heavily involved with the startup life. So when people start talking about startup things are just criticizing founders

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.600
 And it's like what do you know? Like what like nobody that's not like literally in his inner circle right now knows why he made this

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.080
 And she made like there's what you say publicly, but like you're not part of it. You have no idea

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.920
 I know so yeah, so I think you were pointing out like

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.800
 Why is everyone okay? So there's definitely this performative air of being upset

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:13.360
 And I think that's kind of what you were talking about where everyone is like so upset and so like outrage

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.960
 And it's just like but then like you take a step back and we and we talked about this before

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.960
 We take that behavior so for granted like someone said something about people are upset

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.760
 We take a step back and you're like

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.600
 I actually don't know any one of my personal life that like would read that and be upset

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.240
 And like say a bunch. Yeah, it's actually really

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.040
 Extremely weird behavior to like yeah

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.480
 Nothing to do with you. Okay. Maybe like maybe if you know some of that like we knew people that were affected

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.320
 And like, you know, it like made me worried for them. Yeah. Yeah, but beyond that it's just like

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.360
 just such a random

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.680
 Events in like the universe and people are like they have all these expectations of it

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.560
 It's like they're lining up and they're like, okay, it's my turn to talk here. Why you let me down

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.880
 You should be doing this

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:03.200
 For me to feel better like you need to say x y and z you forgot to say this thing

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.360
 And if you don't say that thing that means you're a bad person

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:11.440
 We were lining up taking their turn like saying that and it's just like we just accept that as so normal and like

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.840
 Are you even playing scale customers?

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.280
 Like that's the first thing or just like an opportunity to like

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.920
 Go say the same thing you'd always say

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.680
 So I think you talked about that and that was like super frustrating

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.880
 Uh, and then people that were like giving them advice on what they should do and it was just like

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.160
 I tweeted the other day. I was like, you know for years

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.960
 I've been asking engineers to like think more about business and care more about it

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.080
 And this past week you all showed me what that looks like

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.040
 And I regret asking because you guys are really stupid. You're really bad at business

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:45.760
 like

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.560
 They're general ideas that are true and the thing that

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:54.240
 Bugs me the most is when someone takes a general idea and just applies it generally without thinking of the specifics

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.600
 Yeah, so this case I should give you the perfect example because I think what planet scale did is actually in

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.280
 Contradiction with one of my like first principles that I really believe in

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.320
 um, so I very much believe in

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:14.480
 Sacrifice everything except for making your product accessible. Um, like make your stuff as widely as accessible as possible

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:19.600
 Give people little reason to not try it give people little reason not to invite other people to use it

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.240
 Um that maximizes

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.280
 The chance that someone will fall in love with your product if it's not for them

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.280
 They'll try it and they'll refer someone else to it later. Like I really believe in those dynamics

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.280
 So I will sacrifice everything

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.000
 Before I like put up walls and barriers so you can say a plant scale remove their free tier

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.720
 That's a kind of in violation of one of my first principles

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.200
 But you know the details matter, right? This is a general principle. I believe in

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.720
 um

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:51.520
 When I can't apply this principle. I'm usually willing to change the business itself and what we're working on itself to like adhere

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.720
 To this thing because I like so believe in it. I can see why for them

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.880
 Maybe it maybe it's not like a thing that really drives the way they see things

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.440
 And too, it's also not black and white, right?

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.560
 They got rid of their free tier now the entry ticket price is $40 a month

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.920
 That's basically free for any company

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.800
 If you if you're like building a real product trying to make thousands of dollars a month

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.600
 Tens of thousands of months hundreds of thousands of dollars a month

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.720
 $40 a month as an entry price is not insane. It's like

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:28.880
 Pretty reasonable. Um, it's basically free for any serious thing. So I can see black and white like

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.600
 Okay, yeah, it's not free, but like I can see why it's like not that extreme either

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.440
 the second thing is

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:41.840
 There's a lot of technical details here that make this actually very interesting and nobody bothered to like really think about that stuff

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:47.280
 They just jump right right to like the generic comments that everyone makes if you think about plant scale as a database company

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.600
 They showed up and it was really odd because they're a new database company

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.680
 But they started off like handling these like giant workloads

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.920
 Like they didn't like really start with small stuff and they went the other way

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.720
 They like had the giant workloads and they like brought went down market

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.480
 Um, I forgot who they have that one big profile customer

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.640
 uh

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.640
 I forgot what it was but

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.960
 Uh, and like he said that their average

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.880
 ARR customers like $217,000 like massive

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:24.080
 Yeah, and the question is why the reason is every other database a relational database service like rds

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.560
 Like neon like most of everything we've seen

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.720
 They have this architecture where you decouple storage from compute

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:37.680
 Which means you have like a storage layer that's totally separate the handles replication and just storage the data

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.040
 And that scales independently and you have a compute layer which spins up

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.240
 Resources to like run queries and like run the actual database

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.880
 Uh, and what's great about this model is it gives you a lot of

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.840
 ability to handle small to medium even like largeish loads

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.280
 At high efficiency, right? Because if someone's not using

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:02.560
 The database like so like neon often offers like a serverless thing like rds

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.440
 So the serverless thing yep can easily scale the compute up and down because it's totally decoupled from from the storage

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:13.520
 But this architecture is really bad for the highest highest workloads for the biggest workloads

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.600
 You do need a stateful system. You do need

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.080
 Uh, like plant scale setup with the tests and and the sharding and all of that

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.760
 So plant scale showed up because they were filling this weird gap in the market where

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.400
 AWS will refer people to plant scale when they grow out of rds like that

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.600
 Just something that happens. So that's very interesting

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.160
 But then there's a good company. They're like good company with talented people

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.640
 So they thought of features that are good for everyone at any scale right like the branching

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.600
 Uh, the database recommendations they launched a few weeks ago and they kind of went down mark and offer that

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.240
 So for companies like us like at sst we use them. We pay them like three to 400 bucks a month

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.720
 Nothing crazy, but because those features are great

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.880
 So it's very interesting because yes

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.720
 They really focus on this big scale problem

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.880
 But they also ship stuff that anyone could have shipped and they haven't yeah

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.440
 So that's what was very attractive and I see why bringing that all the way down to free tier

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.720
 That architecture just doesn't work. You can't sleep people's databases on architecture. So yeah, okay

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.120
 I get it. I get why this is very challenging to do everything

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:22.320
 Yeah, can we can we just spend a minute and just talk about the free tier era here because I do think like there's this whole ecosystem

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.520
 Of people now and I I can't help but just associate it with the zero interests phenomenon

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.280
 But there's this whole like world of like junk projects

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:36.800
 And it's some of it's there's an education element to it like everyone that teaches

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:41.760
 Can now just like show you how you can deploy a thing and cost it costs nothing. It's free

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.160
 It's all within the free tier of these five different, you know startup sass things. Yeah

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.920
 Uh, so there's this like whole world now where there's this expectation

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.800
 From people building their first projects that everything should be free and I can deploy everything for free

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.960
 And that wasn't the case like 10 years ago

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.160
 Like there wasn't this world where you didn't have to think about

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.440
 Like if you wanted to deploy something you had some hard work ahead of you like you could build everything on your local machine

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.400
 Maybe and it's a rails app or whatever, but then it's time to deploy it and like okay

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.120
 Now I have to actually deploy a database. What am I gonna use now? It's just like it's a given that there are

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.760
 Choices, they're all free and you can just deploy your thing and and send it

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.960
 You know send a link to your relative and you've got a website up there

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.000
 I think a lot of that stuff could just go away

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Like it could all like the money could run up and all the free tiers could get too expensive to maintain

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.240
 For all these companies or the companies just don't exist in five years like it's very possible

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:41.440
 That whole ecosystem. Yeah, it's all just kind of like a big jinga puzzle and the last blocks gonna fall eventually

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.400
 Not and I don't even think planets go like I think

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.960
 Their situation is just so different and they do seem like a more real company

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.040
 Everyone's criticizing them like oh typical vc backup

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.920
 They're like one of the few companies in the space that are actually gonna make it it seems like yeah

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.920
 So much further ahead than everyone else

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:06.400
 I think of like the amazon and the dot-com burst like in 2000 like a couple companies made it out of all that

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.360
 And amazon was one of them and like any of these eras

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.360
 There's gonna be like the standout companies that did things right and that figured it out

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.000
 And then there's just gonna be a whole lot of stuff go by the wayside

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.960
 And I do think it'd be good if you're in that indie hacking space

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:24.240
 Kind of like go ahead and set the expectation that this could just be a unique phenomenon and a unique era

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.080
 Where there's all these free tools and if that goes away, what's your plan?

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:33.200
 Like do you know how to deploy something if vorcel doesn't exist not saying vorcel won't exist

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.520
 But it might not exist who knows in five years. Yeah, it's like the math is so simple

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:44.480
 You know you have a customer acquisition cost you have the lifetime value of the customer and then whatever like that just has to play out

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.320
 Giant companies like AWS or a cloud flare

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:54.560
 Obviously their free tier is backed by something totally different because these are like massively profitable companies

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.160
 They're like making a big amount of money

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.040
 So if they're like we're gonna spend five percent of this on free tier like the math all all makes sense

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:06.320
 Yeah for companies that are not that it's like negative math because you're like front loading that with vc money

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.680
 Yeah, it's

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:12.720
 It's just a bunch of old guys. It's a bunch of old white guys that had a lot of money that are funding all this

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.960
 And eventually that money goes away

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.600
 That's so funny man

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.880
 there was nothing better than living in New York in like

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.600
 the mid 2010s

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.960
 because

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.680
 Just vc subsidize everything you want to take a ride you call an uber pool

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.240
 It costs you three dollars to go anywhere

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:39.280
 The uber pool algorithm doesn't work. So they never actually pull you. So it's a private car for yourself. Anyway, it cost nothing

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.240
 You want to take a scooter? It's free. You want to order delivery? It's free like it was amazing

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.800
 And to be honest, I think like that was the time of my life where I didn't have like a lot of money

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.720
 so

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.600
 Being able to rely on these things like definitely like leveraged

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.160
 My like career and like my life. I remember I mean this this was me scamming things, but

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.480
 delivery.com

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.080
 five dollars

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.280
 free

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.760
 When you sign when you're like if you refer someone you get five dollars and they get five dollars

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.280
 This is something like that, right?

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.240
 But like they don't check anything you just make a new account every time

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.400
 and uh

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.000
 And so I just made a new account every time and I got like some money off

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.960
 So like over the over like the two years I was doing and it's a lot of money

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.160
 Uh, they tried to stop it by making it so you couldn't pay with pay pal

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.400
 You want to pay with your credit card

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.000
 And it would check the fees for the credit cards when used before and they would reject the thing

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.640
 But they only hit the pay pal thing in the front end so I could just unhide it

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:42.080
 And then it kept going and I'm just like i'm like in their database somewhere where like they're like

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.240
 Wow, like our program is so successful. Like but

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.680
 It's it's not really but again ltv of that customer zero zero dollars

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:57.120
 Yeah, that's the the thing that's going to come home to roost eventually is like how much

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.960
 Of these people's customer base in air quotes

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:06.960
 Is like a zero dollar lifetime value like how many people just use the free tier

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.000
 And i've shipped dummy projects to these things

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 And never paid some of these companies and like there's a lot of people doing that. Do you have like a fan going or something?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.200
 Is there it's it's my it's every time somehow the they're like blowing my lawn or whatever

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:27.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like in and out. So it's like there's a noise gate or something that's

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:33.280
 There it goes or they're just actually starting and stopping. Sorry. I think they're just starting

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:38.880
 Yeah, that makes sense. That's how leaf blowers work

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.720
 Yeah, I don't know. I just I do think like there's so much

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.560
 Still, that's just a house of cards waiting to fall and i'm not trying to be pessimistic. I feel like i'm pretty optimistic

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.840
 but like

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.920
 I still think the after effects of the post zero interest rates

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.080
 Uh have not really come yet

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.720
 Like I feel like you're still waiting for all that it takes years for that money to dry up

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.080
 especially when these companies raise hundreds of millions of dollars some of them like

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:10.320
 You can go a long time giving people free stuff and then eventually

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.640
 You got to actually have a business that works. Yeah, and it's and this is again going back to

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.200
 me asking engineers to like think more about business

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.800
 This is actually it's something you should think about when picking vendors because

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.880
 It's it's totally fine to pick an early stage company or like a startup as something to rely on

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.320
 But you have to understand their setup like

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.040
 Yeah, you have to forecast

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:38.720
 I can see that's working out like I this makes sense like I of course there's a chance they're gonna fail

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.920
 But it's not like totally ridiculous. There's a few of these companies that are somewhat popular where i'm like

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:50.480
 There's no there's like such little chance they work out like I think people really underestimate

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.400
 What it takes to build a dev to a company that is sustainable

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.000
 I think most people think oh like i've heard of them and they're popular

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.800
 The people are talking about them that seems really hard going from zero to get there to there is really hard

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.640
 But then people see them they're like oh they made it like they're gonna they're gonna make it

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.680
 Yeah, but it's you really have to address like such a such a large audience

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.560
 And really capture such a huge population to really justify like a venture scale

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.360
 level company and

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.800
 Yeah, it's why like I mean if you look at our setup everything's on AWS

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:28.480
 The one thing that's not AWS is on planet scale and planet scale happens to be like the only company that's

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.880
 Really making money

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.440
 In this space and that that's what it takes like I really need to see

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.560
 that level of

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.640
 You know like future

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:44.240
 Yep, is that enough on planet scale? Yeah, what's next? Well, yeah, what's next? Uh, there's devan

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:52.720
 The name I just love the name. I know make them all the things that could have been bad

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.200
 Yeah, i'm actually surprised they didn't go with like a gender neutral name to be honest

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:04.400
 That's a good point. It's 2024. I don't know. Can devons can devan be a girl name. Oh, maybe maybe it is and i'm just an idiot

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.360
 Maybe i'm the jinder problem here. I'm the problem

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:16.400
 Now i'm googling it. Yeah, I feel like it's one of those names. I can go both ways. It is a gender neutral name. Look at me

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.480
 I just assumed it was a woman's name. What an idiot

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.480
 Okay

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.680
 Give me a second. My cat is like a super weird noise. Uh, I don't know if you have cats before but

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.480
 They make sometimes the weirdest most disturbing noises

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.440
 Yeah, it's been a long time. I had one

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.760
 as a kid

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:45.760
 I had multiple cats as a kid. And yeah, they make noise like the hacking stuff. Yeah, she was just doing a hurt for ball thing

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.680
 Yeah, it just sounds like a possessed human. They sound like very human at times

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.520
 Really weird

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:57.040
 There was like there's a kind of empty lot and sometimes it like screams at night

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.040
 And it's like this

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:03.040
 I think i think i'm the cat screaming. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've got

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.520
 unrelated

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:11.840
 Kind of we've got neighbor kids that all play like in all the backyards and a couple of them scream

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.960
 In ways that like you think a child is being harmed

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:21.360
 Yeah, but it's like they're fun scream and every time my heart drops like what kid just got attacked

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:26.480
 And then oh, yeah, that's just them having fun. It's really it's tough. It's like the boy who cried wolf

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.960
 I kind of want to be like listen you make a scream like that

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.080
 Like when something's really wrong

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.120
 Like I don't want to talk to the males this kid, you know, I don't know anyway

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.600
 Yeah, when you live in a city

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.720
 Sometimes you take a step back and you realize like you're just hearing

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.040
 Very often you'll hear like shrieks of pain stuff

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.960
 Like some people it sounds like pain and you just never think it twice better. You're so you see here

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.640
 No big deal people suffering dying. Yeah, it's just the city life. Yeah

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:57.600
 It's just very normal what what happens here just yet last night

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.000
 Uh, you just hear gunshots

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.040
 But it's it's not like the city where you hear gunshots

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:08.640
 It's like somebody's shooting a rifle at like gallons of water or something. Who knows but he's for fun

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.920
 Yeah, just like for fun, but we're in this rural area and then sometimes it's like

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.480
 And it's like

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.320
 Well, that could have been somebody shooting somebody. I don't know like somebody might have just gone off

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.640
 Like I don't know if I should be concerned. Yeah, and then you wait for sirens or something

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.000
 For the record. I even you don't hear gunshots in the city. That's like not

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:34.640
 Oh, really? That's how it's portrayed in the video games and the movies. No, I mean, it depends on because where you live, but

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.160
 Yeah

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.400
 I don't think I really heard that. That's nice. Okay. Well, I hear those in the Ozarks

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.360
 And I think it's just people hunting or having fun

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:49.760
 You never know when it starts picking up the pace. I start wondering do you ever hear it and starts to get closer and closer?

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.840
 That's what i'm gonna worry

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.320
 No

00:31:54.320 --> 00:32:00.880
 I do listen for sirens though. Anyway, Devin. Yes. Tell me your thoughts on the Devin demo the Devin demo

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.440
 You know the the main thought I had was stupid

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.480
 Uh, but the main thought I had when I saw the Devin demo is look how happy this guy is that engineer

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:13.360
 Yeah, I know I just want to like know that guy and hang out with him because he just looks so pleat

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.520
 He's like got this look on his face like

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.480
 Yeah, we're awesome. Look at what we just did but he's just like genuinely happy about it

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.960
 I don't know wait. Did you see the video they posted of him from like 15 years ago when he's a kid?

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:29.920
 No, no, that's some like crazy math contest. It looks like jeopardy, but it's like some crazy

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.840
 It's a one of those like

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.480
 Where I grew up. This is very normal. It's just random

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.120
 13-year-old math prodigy goes to some like national contest, whatever

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.480
 And he's like just rapid fire answering questions like it's it's so really see yeah

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.200
 Did you have that look on his face that just grim?

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.840
 Sort of yeah

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.840
 So happy they were like look how cracked this team is

00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:00.800
 Yeah, I've heard that the team is nuts in terms of the accolades and the whatever

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.320
 I don't know what to really glean from the demo. I've seen some people

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:12.400
 Uh who've played with it, you know, right there stuff on twitter threads kind of like live streaming their thoughts as they play with it

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:18.160
 It supposedly takes a long time to actually do stuff which seems way more realistic to me

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.800
 That like that's how yeah developers take a long time. You ever worked with a developer like so that that's interesting

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.520
 It seems realistic in that sense. It's got the browser

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:31.920
 It's got it's opening up its own terminal prompts and doing stuff

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:38.960
 I don't know. It's I wish I just wish it was a thing we could all sign up for and play with because to be nothing's real until like

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.120
 If I have to book a demo, it's just it feels very like what it what is this thing

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.280
 Yeah, so once I can actually play with it. I'll probably have more informed thoughts. I do wonder like

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.560
 the current generation of lms. I don't know how far can it get like is it really

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.880
 Making a huge dent, but I feel like if they have the orchestration stuff

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.600
 Kind of worked out then that next generation

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:03.280
 You know the one we keep hearing about with like open AI the big super secret

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.840
 Whatever dupe d5 will be then I imagine we're off to the races and it's going to be super helpful

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.560
 So the word you said their orchestration is key. So this was primarily a demo

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:22.480
 Showing like novel composition novel orchestration of an llm. It's not really a breakthrough in the lms innate ability

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:27.440
 Right, uh, but it goes to show that we're really far from even if you take the current lms

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.480
 We're really far from the ceiling of what they can do

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.040
 Um because really what this

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.760
 Demo really is it's just a bunch of prompt glue and like giving it access to right tools and like

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.160
 Giving it a workflow

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:48.640
 It's not really like progress in like the lms actual capability, but it's demonstrating something that's meaningfully better than what we've seen so far

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:55.120
 Yeah, uh, so I really believe that we're like not anywhere close to the ceiling even if the lms don't get that much better

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.840
 I also know that like this that demo is like nowhere near good enough. I think

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:05.680
 There is one like kind of sobering thing, which is we've all had the ability to hire

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.160
 Very cheap labor somewhere in the world through platforms. I got work

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.160
 We hardly reach for that some people do, but we hardly reach for it

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.280
 So that's a good one. This might end up being one of those things where we're all kind of asking for it

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:24.880
 But when it's actually there like are we actually going to reach for it because the reason we don't reach for it is

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:30.000
 You like you still have to explain what you want to do and you still want to check you still have to check the work

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.960
 And it's a lot of times that has a cross the threshold of like

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.440
 Is it worth all of that versus just like doing it myself?

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.280
 Um, the reality is you'll land somewhere in between but we like programming

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.240
 So it's it is easy to just be like I could just do the work in the time

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.840
 I could ride a good issue or whatever like I could just do it

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:52.400
 Uh, there is that friction for sure another interesting angle

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:57.360
 Uh, especially for open source like like sst where

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:02.960
 People open up valid issues all the time that we just don't want to prioritize

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.840
 And they might also not have the ability to exactly fix it, but if they're willing to like really describe the problem

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.400
 We would probably accept a PR

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.880
 Generated by yeah, AI for it. We would accept the PR from them if they don't want to do it then

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.360
 so I see like

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:23.200
 In the more near term like are there things that you would do there's lower priority like yeah, I can see

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.000
 You experimenting rotate this in there

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 But yeah, I don't I'd actually don't I think the demo. I know people are saying it's not cherry picked and I saw some of the threads being like

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.160
 Oh, it worked, but I'm there's still this gap of the demo

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.520
 To me actually using I'm very motivated to use some of this

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.000
 I'm not afraid of it. I like want to use it. I have all this work

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.200
 I want to get rid of

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.160
 But that gap still isn't bridged for me the only people that have bridged it is co-pilot

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.920
 Co-pilot is the only tool that's actually made it into my workflow plus like me like, you know using chat gbt

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:58.720
 Um, but yeah, when you say yeah when you say co-pilot

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.400
 I sometimes hear people talk about co-pilot and it makes me think

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.800
 That I don't know about all the products. They avail that are available

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.200
 You just use the co-pilot that just like suggest the next code you can write, right?

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.320
 Okay, so people that use VS code have like a much more rich

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:21.120
 Version of co-pilot that does a lot of things. Okay, but I use something called GP vim or something. It's it's a

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:27.680
 It's a plugin for neo vim that just gives me again. Just going back to this composite composition orchestration problem

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:34.160
 The workflow of me using chat gbt while programming sucks because you're like yeah

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.880
 In your editor and you have to like kick out to this other thing and that friction makes it so you use it

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.880
 Let's say three times less

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.000
 Uh, this plugin just lets me use select mode in vim

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.560
 So I'll like select a bunch of lines and I'll be like I'll like start writing half of what I want to do

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.320
 I'll select the lines I wrote and there's a command called like GP append

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.040
 and I

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.840
 I trigger that command and it just finishes. It like basically sends the context of chat gbt

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.640
 Yeah, and then like immediately inserts it

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:07.040
 In my editor. I can select things and tell it to rewrite it in a certain way

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:11.600
 It like makes it a lot more fluid for me to use lms in my editor

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.960
 But you also use co-pilot just from just just the auto complete

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:20.160
 I mean exactly i'm in the oven but the people in VS code have like a lot of more advanced features

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.960
 Okay. Yeah, that's what i'm sensing then and wasn't something renamed a co-pilot or something

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.120
 Like did they rename github to co-pilot or something?

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:31.360
 What there was something that was like, oh now it's just yeah co-pilot

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.640
 And that's where the word co-pilot has become so overloaded, but I don't know if I still use co-pilot

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:41.920
 There's other companies that like I think people call this category of product co-pilots

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.320
 Oh, jeez, and that's also very confusing

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:51.200
 Um, and there's a few editors. There's a cursor AI, which is like a fork of VS code that like just really pushes the AI features really far

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.840
 um

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.760
 Yeah, so I mean again, all these companies are doing are just kind of figuring out last mile ux

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.240
 And I think there's just so much still to be done there

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.160
 Uh, but yeah, this GP even thing. Yeah, I definitely recommend trying it

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:09.360
 I'm gonna look at that. Yeah, like I use it so much like uh ion the go all the go. So if we wrote

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.360
 Yeah, when I started that I was like, I'm gonna try to like use AI as much as possible

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.280
 And I installed that plugin and a lot of it

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:19.040
 It just wrote like sometimes I know exactly what I want to do. I just don't feel like typing it in

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:23.440
 Yeah, and then oh, it just does it. I'm with you. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.680
 The back and forth to a browser. The fact that I do it at all means that it's pretty useful. Yeah

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.840
 Yeah, but it is painful. Yeah, all the orchestration stuff

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.440
 You know that like over the next year, that's just gonna get better better

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:41.520
 It does suck kind of sometimes feeling like when you're in neo them that you're kind of like gonna be the last to get stuff

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:47.360
 Forever we might like it might really get to a point where the features are so good that we start to

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:51.600
 Not use we sort of like go back to VS code which

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.840
 I know

00:39:53.840 --> 00:40:00.320
 But dax we stream on twitch and we do things in the public. We can't not use

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:05.040
 Neovet. I love you. Yeah, but here is at the end of the day. Why do I use neovem?

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:11.600
 It's because it saps less than my energy to to work like it the keyboard shortcuts. Okay, if i'm being honest

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.000
 Uh, it does not

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.240
 I it saps more of my energy not because it's nothing to do with neovem

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.040
 Uh, it's everything to do with my ability to stay on top of things

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.840
 And I will say the astro lsp

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.360
 And in the side of neovem. It's pain

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.000
 Uh, I have to restart neovem like restart neovem not restart the language server

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.600
 I had to restart neovem like a few times a day because it gets to a state where just nothing

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:44.720
 Works. I can't go to definitions. I can't do anything. I don't know what's going on if it's a memory leak

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.600
 I don't know

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.640
 Yeah, but there's a lot of pain. I've been a feeling and I've thought about like

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:53.280
 I just go back to vscode and I just mess around here like I could enable them bindings and just like

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.480
 Go back to life on the main highway

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:03.680
 Well, if I was using astro, I think I would consider also because I think I literally switched off of astro. It's some for something because

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:10.000
 It just I just couldn't get situations get a neovem. Yeah. Yeah, every time I update the astro lsp

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.520
 I'm like, maybe it'll be good now, but it still doesn't still have something

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.120
 I know and I don't blame the astro team. I feel like there's like five of us using

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:22.080
 I blame the astro team. Here's why I blame the astro team if you're listening astro team. Yeah

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.680
 I don't think the file format was worth it

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.600
 You've said this from the beginning and yeah, I think it's made worth it to some people

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.560
 But I can see how just doing a lot of that in a normal ts file

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:39.840
 Would be completely fine for me and I don't have this other layer of tooling that

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.440
 So you would have suggested like jsx

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.640
 Instead of trying to be more html like I think it was a marketing thing. I think they just wanted to be like

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:53.680
 Look how close to html it is. It would be html if not for them practice

00:41:53.680 --> 00:42:00.080
 It's so close to jsx and placid it is so close with that that they tried to model it off of right like they tried to make

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.560
 Yeah, they're so few things are different like they made they wanted to feel familiar if you use jsx which everyone is

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:11.440
 But then it's this weird like I don't know how much they're getting in terms of positive press because it's almost html

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.360
 Because the file would be an html file if it didn't have these fences at the top

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:21.440
 And if you just rename the extension to not html like but it wouldn't be because of all the jsx stuff like all the templating stuff

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:26.000
 So it feels like this weird in between where they don't get any benefits and there's a lot of downsides

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.960
 Yeah, and to underscore that I didn't know it wasn't jsx for a very long time

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.000
 Oh, really? I thought it just was jsx and

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.800
 If you work in it a lot point that out to me and I was like, oh

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:44.880
 Yeah, the class name is the biggest tell for me. That's my jsx thing. That's a react flavor of jsx thing

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.400
 Oh jsx can have class equals stuff because because solid

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:55.040
 Solid has class equals really? Yeah, so I don't even know what jsx is anymore

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.760
 Actually not jsx like

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.120
 Isn't it? I don't really get it. I have no idea

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.840
 But anyway point being is uh, I totally get why they went with that

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:10.080
 Especially their market, you know, like the WordPress market the bigger vision. Yeah, I get it

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.080
 But I wish they had a mode for

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.840
 Just using normal ts files and that kind of simplifies a whole tool chain

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:20.720
 Yeah, yeah, because I start to think like oh, it's my knee of them config just way out of date

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.840
 And I need to go through and and cut down the weeds and clean it up

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:29.040
 And then I switch over to a ts file because I have lots of ts files in my astro project and everything works

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.680
 I'm like, oh, yeah, this is what a language server is supposed to do for me

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.040
 Yeah, yeah, but going back to a broader point

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:41.920
 Everyone's like the stupid the point that I hate that everyone always tries to make they think is so smart

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.520
 You only spend 10 percent of your time typing like why do you care about

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:49.520
 Using the of it like it isn't programming thinking. It's not typing

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:54.640
 Everyone has a dumbass point. Everyone does say that. Yeah, uh, but it's about

00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:00.080
 What feels like painful labor typing out your thoughts is

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.440
 Not enjoyable. It's like annoying. Yeah, so at the end of the day

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.280
 If you have to work for eight hours

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:11.440
 You're gonna feel less tired if the most annoying part of your day is a little bit easier

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.960
 And that's why I use neo-ven because yep after years of using it

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.320
 Uh, it's so much more pleasant to express what I'm trying to do

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.880
 And I will always use it for that reason

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.040
 But with all this AI stuff, it's attacks that same thing, right? Like

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.640
 Uh, it's all these AI integrations and vs code make it so good for me to express what I want to do

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.760
 It might, you know, display the scales. Yeah, exactly. So I can see myself going

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.800
 You're not biased. You'll you'll go with whatever is the least pain. Yeah, um, I hear you

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.360
 Yeah, I know I can edit files faster now

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.200
 But a lot of that's just VIM motions

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:50.480
 But I am so used to neo-ven at this point and the way I have it configured that going back to vs code would be its own friction

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.920
 Yeah, I don't know

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:55.760
 I speaking at dumb points. I feel like you were ready to change topics. Is that okay?

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.280
 No, we changed it. Yeah, I'm never gonna ask permission again. I'm just gonna do it

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.760
 I think I think I've said that before the did you know there are people who don't think

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.400
 Capitalism is best

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:11.040
 Did you know that? Well, it's so funny because you uh, this is like a recent discovery for you

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:17.840
 But to me it's been like the bane of everything for like years and years and years and especially like living in New York

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.520
 It's such a

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.520
 Such a thing that's in the air. Um

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:27.200
 Yeah, it's it's very trendy to blame every single thing on this

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:33.440
 vague capitalism concept. Yeah, I guess I don't even want to spend much time on this because it'll just make me mad

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.120
 Uh, I don't think about capitalism ever. I don't it's not a thing I think about

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.120
 I'm not a capitalism worshipper as I've been called in the last few days

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.840
 Apparently if you tweet anything about

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.400
 startups or about

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.400
 whatever the layoffs

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.280
 uh, then you're just a capitalist and

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:57.520
 Yeah, I guess I am. I I mean I live in america and this is what i've only ever known

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:01.200
 That's it. That's all I have to say the fact that there are people here in america

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.600
 They're like you capitalist worshippers like what do you what what are you?

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:12.880
 What do you want to do with your life like with your fancy ass tech job? It's funny because it is such a common thing in new york

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.520
 Uh, I'll tell you some like specific stories

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.720
 Uh in new york you will often and it's probably not the case any marker signs have changed

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.520
 But there was a period where people would very proudly

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:28.080
 As soon as you meet them, they'd be like oh, i'm actually a socialist or i'm actually a communist

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.320
 Uh, oh, okay. What do you do? I'm a product manager at facebook

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.000
 like

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.440
 You're making probably 300 k to do a nothing job and you're gonna tell me you're a socialist or your communist

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.000
 and here's a second one so we uh

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.480
 Uh, Liz had a roommate

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:50.560
 And like in her friend's circle. There was this guy and he was like head of the communist party in uh

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:56.720
 In new york, so something create something weird like that. Okay, he lives in a two million dollar

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.440
 Beautiful brownstone that faces the park in park slope. It's like one of the most coveted

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:07.920
 Like yeah extremely coveted place to live like liz would like die to like live there was fantastic

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.120
 uh his parents paid for it and

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:16.160
 His partner is like a dancer and this thing this thing that

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:19.040
 People don't realize is like

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.240
 No governor no socialist communist government is making up

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:25.440
 Oh, yeah, we need like 1% of our population to be dancers

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:31.600
 Like that's never something that they come up with that only exists in these capitalists, you know, a system school that can produce

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:38.000
 The resources for people like choose their own life and like meet demand on like these granular ways

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.400
 But yeah, like head of the communist party

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.720
 You know mansion paid by his parents

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.280
 Uh, you know, not really working like like a labor job

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.880
 uh

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:53.440
 Extremely common and the other thing that's a little frustrating for us is uh, especially for Liz

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:59.840
 Uh, these people love to use cuba as an example. They're like oh, but in cuba like

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:05.440
 You know the health care is paid for by the government or like oh in cuba like, you know x y z things

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.960
 it's so offensively ignorant because

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.840
 Yeah, health care is paid for by the government just like everything's paid for the by the government

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:19.120
 Liz's family members when they have family in cuba that are sick then you treatment you know what they have to do

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.400
 In america, they have to go buy medical supplies

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.960
 Travel with like literally gauze

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:31.760
 Like scalpels all this stuff. Oh travel with it to cuba so that the doctors there can do the operation because they don't have

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.000
 Yeah, that's stuff there like it is a

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.720
 Tough tough life to live there. It's extremely difficult and people kind of like flippantly you're like

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:43.600
 Oh, you know these other countries they have x y z you think you just don't know like especially if you're in america

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:47.840
 Like you really don't know how good it is. There's so many problems here

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:52.960
 I think the biggest problems in america are actually that capitalism isn't appropriately applied. I think

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:57.360
 Uh, we let companies get too big. We let companies

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:02.080
 We kind of like kill competition in a lot of ways and capitalism requires like aggressive competition

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.640
 People just like blame everything on it. They're like

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.760
 Everything is because of capitalism and like I don't know. It's very it's very ignorant to me

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.960
 Yeah, I I don't claim to know anything about

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.600
 Anything. I mean, especially this

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:21.520
 But I live in the context I live in I live here in america and like i'm not going to try to imagine a world where

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:27.600
 It wasn't a capitalist economy and I just it just rubs me really weird

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:31.760
 When people start coming at me because i'm a capitalist worshiper like I don't know

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.400
 It's just like a random thing that throw out that's supposed to be an insult because they just it's like

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:41.200
 Incinuated that capitalism is bad for some reason. Yeah, this is responsible for everything. That's bad

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:45.120
 And then if you respond they hit you with this meme. I don't know if you've seen that. I'm sure you have

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:50.240
 I would improve society that that's stupid. Yeah, because that's what you were. Yeah, that's exactly what you were saying

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:55.680
 Maybe we could please improve society. That's not what you said. You said capitalism is bad. You're an idiot. Like shut up. Oh

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.160
 People don't be crazy. I know

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:02.800
 It is uh, it is weird. I feel people don't appreciate what they have really understand where

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.560
 Where it comes from and then the day i'm just like just check the scoreboard. Like

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.400
 That's what it comes down to america is still doing pretty great

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.120
 Yeah, like

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:18.160
 Like significantly better. It really feels like the rest of the world builds on top of the innovation that happens here

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.880
 That's not an accident. That's not something that happens randomly

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.600
 It takes so many little things for that

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.680
 To to be the case. So yeah, yeah, it's it's weird

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.240
 But it is it is trendy. It is like a trendy thing. Yeah, it's really annoying

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.760
 Uh, maybe if you're in that trend, maybe consider your life choices

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.800
 Try a different trend try something else like i don't know

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:44.720
 Anti caffeine or something there's lots of trends lots of trends you could hop on, you know veganism

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:50.720
 Well, that here's the thing that's where you can mess with people if someone's like

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.920
 Uh, you're a capitalist whatever you can be like actually i'm vegan

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:58.800
 Guarantees they have no like mental model for dealing with that. They like

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:03.680
 Probably are just like like what do i say? Like i guarantee they'd be really confused

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:08.720
 Because i think there's so many things that would contradict whatever view they have of me

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.440
 It's like there isn't no box you can put me in

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:18.240
 The other day that guy that replied to you being like oh like you grew up with rich parents

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:23.120
 Right. Yeah, like that was a big assumption to make i don't know what i said

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.520
 So you're like shared any start you shared

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:32.160
 Your trajectory you acknowledge like maybe it was slightly easier for you than it maybe as for other people

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:35.440
 And they were like well, obviously it's because you had rich parents like

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.720
 It's just like it's just so sad like when you whenever you see anyone

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:42.400
 Succeeding is your reaction to be like

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.920
 There's no way they could have done that without some like cheating

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:50.400
 You know that's like this if some pretty let's see the world that way a lot of bitterness online

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.520
 I don't know if online is the caught like if we're if it's shaping us to be this way

00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:00.800
 Like we're seeing so many people in a different context than ours that it creates this bitterness

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.640
 Uh, but I do see it a lot in replies these days and I don't like it

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.400
 For them like for people who see that and this sounds so like

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.880
 I'm on my pedestal high horse here like oh you poor peasants

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.440
 Why must you be so bitter?

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:21.280
 like just for for people to feel that way like to see any situation that's different than theirs and be like

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.720
 Well, I would have been that way if only like whatever

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:30.320
 That's just not a good way to live like again going back to this idea that we're almost so used to this stuff

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:34.560
 That when you think back like step back and think like do I know anyone that would behave like that

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:39.360
 It's like of course not like I don't know anyone that would behave that way that you see that thing with prime

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.000
 Or that guy was like

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.360
 Yeah, I'm being like oh you're some guy that did meth and now acts like a clown, you know, just like yeah

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:50.240
 Obviously any

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:54.000
 Obviously any person is going to realize that that's only going to make people

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.920
 Like come to his defense. Obviously. It's a very sympathetic situation. It's a very admirable situation

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:05.440
 And something people look at in a positive way. So one like not recognizing that and then two just saying like

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:12.080
 Just like the most like mean thing. I like who do you know in real life that would actually do that

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:14.720
 Yeah, like it's such a weird behavior

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.280
 That's definitely a thing right that like

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:23.280
 Online communities like we're so much more rude and and just the way we act versus in person

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.360
 Like people wouldn't be the way they are

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:27.120
 On reddit, you know

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:30.080
 Well, I think this person might be because it's so like it's so

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:36.960
 Be tethered from anything normal that i'm like, are we just connecting with some is it that we're just discovering? Yeah, some more people

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.680
 But some more types of what is this person like in real life?

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:45.200
 Like I can't help but imagine like are they just normal and they have just like this weird thing that they exert online

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:49.200
 Yeah, uh, or are they like weird in real life too? It's it's really odd

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.760
 I feel like I need to say because I feel like i've been picking on lots of different things in this episode

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.000
 I've probably done all these things too

00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:02.160
 Like i've probably said things on twitter I regret where I was like a jerk and if I go back through my replies

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.800
 I could probably dig up stuff that like i've contradicted so like i don't know life is hard

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.520
 And i'm not trying to pick on people. It's just like

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:16.080
 I still have this thesis that we're all just too online that there's just too much online interaction versus

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:22.320
 Real-world react interaction like the the ratio is so out of whack. Yeah. Yeah

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:26.880
 Do you do agree with that? Maybe you don't maybe you think this is fine

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.920
 I I love it for friendships like I feel like we can be friends

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.280
 It's like I can have friends that I have so much more in common with than I ever could

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:40.080
 In person the people around me like I just can't meet people that have so many specific interests

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:44.880
 Uh, so the the online nature of like socialization. I love that

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:50.960
 Uh, but I do worry about our brains. Yeah, to me. I kind of perceive it more like

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.680
 almost like a natural phenomena like

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.520
 if

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.880
 I don't know like

00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:02.960
 All volcano goes off and like life like it's like cloudy or whatever for like three years

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:06.800
 Or like 40 years whatever it is. You could be like

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:11.360
 One perspective is oh like, you know, we shouldn't live like this

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:15.840
 But like you would never say that because it's like a natural phenomena. It's like is reality. Yeah, I'll change it

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.920
 Yeah, this is just the world now

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.640
 Uh, yeah, so for me, it's more like this is just the world now. This is what it is

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:27.840
 And this is what the new normal is. I think uh, yeah this book if you see the movie. I am legend

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.080
 Yeah, so the book version of it

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:35.600
 So the rough premise of people that i've seen it is uh, there's a cure for cancer or something

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.960
 It ends up turning people into these like in the book. It's like

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.920
 Not exactly zombies or like almost like vampires

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.720
 Uh, whatever it makes everyone these like monsters

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.720
 And there's a few people that are immune and the main character is immune

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.200
 And he's like working so hard to like cure

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:55.600
 The world because he's like, you know, yeah, I don't know. He has ability to like research his stuff

00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:03.520
 Uh, and he does discover a cure but at the end he destroys a cure and kills himself because he realizes that spoilers

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:07.520
 Say from his point of view. He was yeah, he was like curing

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:12.160
 The world of being monsters, but then from the world's point of view

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:18.560
 They're all normal and he's just some of this. He's like this crazy monster to them going and trying to change them

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:23.200
 Yeah, so he kind of accepted that the world is shifted and he is the one that is

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:27.440
 No longer has a place in it. I've seen that movie and I don't remember any of that. That's so funny

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.680
 No, the movie the movie wasn't like that and then the movie

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.720
 It was because like here's a cure. I'm gonna sacrifice myself and kill all these dumb zombies

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:40.720
 Oh, you're oh, you're saying the book. You're the you're describing the book book. Yeah, the book is a different ending

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.920
 Oh a different ending. How can you do that in a movie adaptation?

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.760
 Well, the movie has like a Hollywood ending

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:49.680
 The face of the author. I think there was an arrow in movies where it was like

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:55.280
 You would just need a straightforward plots and I think at some point people got bored of them. So now we have like

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:58.000
 crazier plots that maybe are like

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.320
 Leave you not entirely satisfied at the end but like on purpose and it's like intellectual and whatever

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:06.720
 Yeah, but when the movie came out now straight forward zombie movie guy alone in New York

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.760
 He's gonna save the world and he's gonna sacrifice himself doing it

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 Okay, like that

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.560
 The book had this deeper point of

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:19.760
 As impossible as it seems. Yeah, like that is now the new normal

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:24.960
 And that's kind of how I feel about this. I need I need this. Yeah. I think you shifted my perspective

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:31.120
 I need that shift because it is just reality. It's like what is complaining about this amount of time

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:35.440
 We're staying online do nothing. This is the way people talk to each other now. This is just the way

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.680
 Yeah, and there's a lot I love about it

00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:40.800
 Like it's it's changed my life for the better in so many so many ways

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:46.000
 And it's still not impossible to like get that offline time and to do the things

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.920
 that you want to do in the real world. It's just uh

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:55.600
 It's like you said it's the most interesting thing you have is your phone. So like it's been the key to be reset

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.640
 Yeah

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:02.880
 Yeah, this other this reminds of the other thing I've been thinking about I've been for the right way to articulate it

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:07.440
 But with all this AI stuff coming out like we're all imagining what the future will be like

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:10.240
 And I think we have this weird bias where

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:16.960
 All the technology seems so great and amazing and we imagine like a very neat future as a result

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:21.120
 We're like, oh, like, you know, all these things will be like straightforward and clean and neat

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.720
 but

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.480
 If you ask most people do you think the past was neater or do you think now was neater?

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:31.440
 The past seems like simpler and more straightforward and now it just seems more chaotic. Mm

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:38.080
 So with imagine as AI stuff, it actually might just be even like more chaotic in the future. We think like

00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:44.400
 Oh, like yeah, software is going to be easier to produce and it's going to be like more correct and like, you know, all this stuff can do all this stuff

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:45.920
 but

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.560
 The reality is a thousand times more software is going to get produced

00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:51.280
 Very quickly because it's cost of producing is going to go down

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:57.920
 That might end up in like a way messier thing that requires like way more human effort to stay on top of you know, so

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.200
 Yeah, I think there's it's interesting. So

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:08.560
 We think the future is going to be more straightforward, but I don't think it ever is. I think it's just like more and more crazier

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:10.960
 Yeah, it's it kind of takes us back to the car

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.520
 We didn't really talk much about the reaction to Devin

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:17.120
 Right. Uh, there's definitely like the two camps that are forming

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:23.440
 And then there's always the people in the middle that are just kind of like i'm going to be very reasonable and measured on twitter and look at me

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:26.080
 But the people on the extremes are like

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:32.480
 You're all idiots. Of course. This is taking all our jobs. Like here it comes told you and then there's the other side

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:37.520
 That's like not impressed like this just gonna create more junk code that we're all gonna have to maintain

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:42.960
 So where do you know, where do you land on that spectrum? I have no idea. I it's I don't think I'm in the middle

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:47.360
 I just don't know it's it's very unclear. I think a little tiny tea cup

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.960
 Drinking and looking down on the floor like I don't know

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.600
 I guess sort of because when I imagine these people

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:58.720
 Anyone that's unimpressed by lms, they're like, I canceled my chat gpt

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:05.040
 It wasn't useful like you're I'm a hundred percent certain you're motivated by not wanting to believe it's useful because it's so obviously

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:10.240
 Yeah, I don't get that take. Yeah, like there's no way like you you just don't want this

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:15.760
 I'm not trying to make this thing help me. It's just every time I remember oh, I can just I can ask that gpt

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:21.360
 I end up with good outcomes. I feel like if you're not yeah, if you're not seeing that then i'm not sure

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.240
 What you're missing. Yeah, and to me, it's it's so it's such a gap from my experience

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.120
 It can only be explained by like psychology to me

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:35.360
 Like I feel like you don't want this to be useful. Yeah, like you don't want it to be then the people that are really confident saying like

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.080
 Oh, it's just gonna be like

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:42.800
 It's gonna create even more developers are gonna be like 10 times the many I totally get their point

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.120
 And I like see it. I think

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.160
 In the short term assuming there's like no hard take off with like

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.920
 True artificial intelligence. It's actually very simple formula

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:56.160
 Uh, there's all this code that needs to be written today. It's not being written because

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.880
 You can't connect the labor to the person that needs it and it's always gonna be a problem

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:04.160
 It becomes 10 times cheaper maybe a thousand times cheaper

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.040
 All that stuff is gonna get written you're gonna have like a thousand next amount of software

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.080
 Like very quickly because yep, I'm cheaper to produce

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.520
 I can see how the end result of that is not anything good

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.880
 Um

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.120
 Yeah, most of the software in today is bad

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.920
 A lot of the software today. I know have we talked about this customer service thing. I always talk about

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.520
 I don't remember. I think we maybe have some more but uh

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.360
 Like so much is

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.800
 Automatable now

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.120
 Theoretically, um, yeah, you want to go book a hotel. You want to go book? Uh

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.840
 Appointment for a haircut

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:45.200
 Uh, but the actual automation that was put in place there sucks. It's like not good

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.360
 But it allowed companies to get rid of the human stuff

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.880
 So now we're in this crappy middle ground where like you have to use these crappy automated systems

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.720
 When you would just probably ride just talk to someone and explain them what you want

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.120
 But like that person's not there anymore

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:06.720
 So that's kind of I feel like if we let more software reproduce like I don't necessarily think it's gonna be like good

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.520
 Software I think it's just kind of creates more of a mess and helps stuff a little bit

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.200
 Um, I can see how that's the case and I get where people are coming from. This is gonna require like a new

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.520
 Set of work for people to manage and improve and stuff

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:28.720
 But I'm also not sure about that either because I do believe that there's a chance of like, you know, something that is generally better than

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:34.240
 How humans produce products and stuff. So yeah, I just don't know. It's very unclear to me

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:40.240
 I'm confused how anyone can be very certain. I'm very selfish. I don't view things from like a broader perspective

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:46.000
 I just have viewed this whole situation from my perspective and it's like I have very

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.560
 Like specific desires that I'm probably just like wish casting this into is that a word

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.000
 like I just want it to be a certain thing and

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.400
 Any little signal is like I think it's coming. Yes thing. I need like I would I would love to have because

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:08.160
 I don't hire like I haven't historically hired people that are very cheap labor

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:12.720
 Uh, I don't like managing people and I do think I could really enjoy

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.720
 Having these types of things to manage versus

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.640
 human beings

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:24.720
 Uh, so I want that and I think I just like I see any progress and I get excited like maybe that future exists

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.280
 But I don't think about it from a broader like industry perspective what it's going to mean for the landscape

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.240
 I think that's actually really good though because I feel this way about so many things so many things in life

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:39.440
 Uh, it's like figure out how to help yourself before you try to like solve the world's problems

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:44.640
 Uh, yeah, put your own mask on and the airplane scenario. Yeah, so I think yeah to me

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.440
 That's what keeping me grounded. I'm just trying to figure out how to improve my own stuff

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.840
 And through that process I might get some insight on how this might be generally true

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.480
 Yeah across a lot of people. That's why with all this stuff coming out. I'm like school. I'm like bringing it back to

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.360
 Okay, I see Devin

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:04.000
 Am I like gonna go use it tomorrow? Probably not. So that's like not it. Yeah

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.480
 Like I'm not dropping everything until I go find a way to go use it, right?

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:14.240
 Yep, so like you will get one something meets that threshold will be I think it'll be very obvious when you think about it that way

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.640
 What else is going on?

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.640
 Twitter Twitter Twitter

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:23.600
 Why is twitter the best developer community? Get out of here redditors is that true?

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.760
 Hacker news. They're like an objective truth objectively. Yeah, it's just fact

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.880
 Well, you see what I posted about the hacker news thing with plans go. No, wait, what plan scale hackers?

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.640
 The hacker news thread on plan scale stuff was like oh, yeah, no reasonable

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.560
 Like everyone had a reasonable response for the most part

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.640
 Yeah, yeah, like the worst stuff on twitter was yeah all over the place

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:50.800
 Yeah, you know, I only learned who shoe nice was in the last me too. I know who that was either tell that threat now

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:57.840
 My following tab is just his face everywhere. Are you following him? No. Oh wait, maybe

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:06.160
 Oh, I am. Yep. Yeah, I feel like I missed a whole era of youtube like I only got into youtube

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:10.800
 And i'm not even really into it now, but yeah, I feel like I missed all this stuff

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:16.480
 I think I vaguely kind of remember that the uh the other thing so I talk about how lms are underused

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.000
 I also think that uh that's her is cameo

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.280
 Do you know what that is? Oh, that is so underused. Yeah, I had the exact same thought

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:32.080
 Yeah, when this shoe nice stuff happened like, oh, we should totally be memeing each other with like celebrities. I'm not that expensive

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.640
 It's really not that expensive. Yeah, just getting I feel like there's so many opportunities for pranks

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:40.240
 I'm totally gonna do it. Yeah

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:45.760
 I did. I'm gonna have to open a tab and leave it open. So I don't forget like can't cameo

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.800
 This would just be a whole nother layer to our shitposting. Yeah, exactly. That's one of each other

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:55.520
 Yeah, yeah, like maybe I should start making my points through celebrities voices. There you go

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.840
 exactly

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.360
 What a brilliant what a brilliant

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.720
 Content business start up. Yeah, exactly. You know the

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.360
 Okay, this one's odd

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:13.120
 I just uh I pulled up cameo and one of the today's top 10 is the viral oompa loompa

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:16.480
 Did you see this? Oh lady. It's like the chemistry set

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:25.120
 You can you can buy for $20. You can get in a cameo from her. That's just a 4.98 rating. Like who is this person?

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.440
 How did they contact her?

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.360
 Well, the best part is you also get professional impersonators

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.920
 So like oh, is that what it is?

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.480
 Well, no

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.920
 Well, you can also get you know

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.560
 Like obviously you can't get like Brad Pitt to like do a cameo because it's not worth it for him

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:44.320
 Yeah, but they are people who are impersonators that are very very very good

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:51.760
 Interesting. Yeah, but it's okay. I know like it's kind of maybe cameo doesn't even need to exist anymore. Oh, yeah

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.040
 That's another thing. I'm surprised. We don't see more of is more fake

01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:00.800
 Like video people talking that they didn't really do like this. They didn't really say you know what I mean

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.600
 Like I'm surprised there's not more deep fake like stuff happening on twitter

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:11.600
 Yeah, jokes or maliciously or whatever like I feel like that tech is so good now, isn't it? And like you never see

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.000
 Uh, that's true

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.800
 Maybe it's still like it hasn't crossed the throat threshold of like

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.040
 You can do it on a whim which is maybe is what yeah, maybe

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:26.400
 Man so many people like $20,000 to get kenny g to do a cameo like no, thanks

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.880
 Who's who's doing that to be honest?

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:33.280
 I feel like maybe cameo fell off a little bit because i'm looking at their list of people and i'm like

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.000
 These are like not like

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
 Now we're close to anyone that would want doing anything. Yeah, yeah

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.120
 I'm trying to think

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:45.760
 We just said there should be a lot more of this but now I can't think of a single example of like a person that I think would be funny

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.520
 to have

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.520
 Post something. Oh my god. I see the impoluma

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.080
 How wild is that like how'd they find that person?

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.960
 There's there's two of them one is like an one is like a fake version. Oh, really? It is a fake

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:01.440
 It's not the person is from a picture. Oh, I guess there's more than one. There's more than one

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.520
 Oompa loopa at the event, which I guess makes sense

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:09.600
 Okay, there's cameo kids and this looks like fun to have like elmo say something trolly about rsc's that would be fun

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.880
 Oh, that's fun. That's good. Could be a cookie monster

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:17.280
 Yeah, you gotta get someone something really innocent like just talking like a load of shit

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:23.760
 Yeah, I wonder if you can well, maybe not cursing but like you could get them to say funny things in our context that wouldn't be offensive

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:30.880
 Was it was a flip that did the shooting nice thing originally? Yeah, I don't know. I think I want to say flip

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.680
 It was brilliant. That was good. Well

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:41.120
 Initially, I was like has this guy been watching like tech twitter and has all these like funny things to say about it

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.560
 And i'm halfway throughout the car because it came here. Yeah, I got it

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.080
 That's so funny. We have the same thought that there's not near enough cameo happening in the lash. Maybe i'll go on here

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.840
 Oh, there you go

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.560
 Can I yeah some of these are like 20 bucks. Can I pay 20 bucks to have dax say something? Yeah

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.920
 I'll just have you say stuff you would have said anyway

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:06.960
 I gotta find one here that looks like me and then I can have them read all my thoughts

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:14.560
 Yeah, there you go. Just like uncanny valley dax. It's like wait. Is that dax? Yeah, I gotta get a Oscar Isaac from x machina

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:21.120
 Have you seen that? No, I haven't seen movies. Oh, yeah, I need you to tell me what movie I'm not so I watched done gerk

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.640
 Okay

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.320
 What's my next movie? Have you seen what have you like gone to the Oscar winners for this year? No

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:34.880
 Who are they? Well Oppenheimer just crushed it Oppenheimer like did so well. I know so I've seen Oppenheimer and I I loved Oppenheimer

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.800
 Yeah, so

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:41.760
 Do you know those were chris for Nolan's first Oscars? He finally won two really best picture

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.160
 When were the Oscars this happened already? Sunday. I used to be plugged into the world

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:50.560
 What what happened? I don't consume anything apparently where I would know these things

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.000
 Well, the Oscars are super boring so that it definitely shouldn't watch them

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.480
 But but I mean like here like oh these things won the Oscars. I didn't hear anything

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:04.240
 I do feel like a lot of this traditional media stuff is like kind of on a downtrend in terms of like people caring

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.880
 I think this stuff just doesn't show up as much

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.000
 Interesting, so that was the 96 Oscars

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.440
 I'm trying to see the winners because that see I generally I think I like

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:19.040
 Critically acclaimed movies my wife thinks it's a signal that she won't like the movie if it did well in the awards

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.480
 uh

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.160
 She's more into

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.160
 Not good movies. I guess so

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:29.680
 Another one that was nominated was Martin Scorsese's uh killers of the flower moon killers of the flower moon

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:34.160
 I think I've heard of that wait, you've never seen wolf of wall street go watch wolf of wall street wolf of wall street

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:39.680
 Okay, that's old though, isn't it? That's not like a bad old but I mean, okay. It's it didn't win an Oscar this year

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.600
 You're not gonna watch it. I think this is an old movie

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:47.040
 Oh, okay, you're gonna watch anything. This is a hilarious movie. Yeah, I'm super agist about movies

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.200
 Like if it looks like it was made and yeah, I don't like stuff. It's not that old

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:56.480
 No, it doesn't feel like an old movie at all. So silly and Murphy won a one uh best actor, huh?

01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.640
 For Oppenheimer. Yeah, he was so good. That was so good. It was good. Yeah big fan

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:08.240
 Uh, okay, uh, so I'm watching uh, would you say how do you forgot the name of it? Uh wolf of wall street

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.160
 And what's my next movie after that? I really maybe we'll just take a one-on-a-time

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.480
 Directors and like just watching like their top three movies

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.080
 That usually works out. Well, like so it's Steven Spielberg

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:25.280
 Like the original director that people

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:29.440
 That's I've been a little unplug

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.360
 Yeah, get you said Nolan

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.880
 Uh, so Oppenheimer was like you watched a bunch of Nolan movies already

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:44.080
 Yeah, I think I have I mean like I love inception. That was an old movie, right? Yeah. Yeah, uh, done Kirk was, you know, it was it was a movie

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:54.160
 Uh, and Oppenheimer is his latest. So is there any other missing big Nolan movie? I need to watch Interstellar, which I think you've seen

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.360
 I've seen Interstellar. Yeah, although I'd like to see it in my theater. I bet it'd be really good

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:03.200
 Yeah, so I think you've probably seen most of his best ones. Okay. So Scorsese will have a wall street

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:09.680
 Definitely one of his best movies. Oh, so that's Scorsese. I've heard of Scorsese. Yeah, uh, the departed is also very good

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:15.280
 Oh, I've seen the departed. Yeah, you're getting back into old enough movies that I've like that one so loud back

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.800
 Let me go forward. So his newest movie is killers of the flower moon, which is uh, okay

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:23.120
 Okay, so the thing with him is he's so successful now that he can make movies as long as he wants

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.920
 Um, oh, it's a long movie nobody stops him

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:30.640
 So I will say kill the flower moon very good amazing acting liana caprio

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:37.040
 Uh, but was a bit long. So I don't know if you want to do that. I'm looking up how long when you say a bit long

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:41.920
 Have you gone through? Uh, it's like three hours three and a half hours something insane. Yeah, it's tough

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.400
 It's tough. I got two hours on saturday morning. So if it doesn't fit mad you gone through

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.160
 Tarantino stuff like have you seen he's like the kill bill?

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.240
 Yeah, like that's the movie. See did is it I think like

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.160
 I've seen at least one of his movies and I don't know if it's my style

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:02.640
 I don't know if I enjoy the like over the top gore is that like his thing

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:05.680
 I would say all of his movies have some aspect of it

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:08.800
 But a movie like kill bill is like a very extreme version of it

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.200
 so if you look at like um

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.760
 Have you seen uh, I think you've seen

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.400
 Inglorious bastards

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:21.200
 No, is that good. Yeah, i like Brad Pitt. I know he's in that. Yeah, he's great at all

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.160
 No Brad Pitts from shrink field. I think that's why I mentioned it

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.800
 Oh, I have

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:30.800
 I'm just such a small person like I just have such a small world

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:34.480
 And I just regurgitate the same like five facts about my life

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.040
 Jango and jane is also goodly under caprio is really good in that

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:44.000
 What did you say jango and change jango un-chained jango un-chained? Oh, yeah and hateful eight well 2012

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.440
 I think anything post 2005 or six will feel like a new movie to you

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.320
 Like I don't think I don't think they like seem old to really

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:57.120
 Okay, the trailers make them look really old because trailers back then were just so different

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.000
 Just like a guy like in a world where

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.160
 Yeah, no matter what. Yeah. Yeah, no matter how serious the movie is. It's just got this crazy guy

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.280
 Oh, wait. I'm all over the place. Have you seen there will be blood? No

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:15.760
 What is it? You should watch that amazing movie. There will be blood. Yeah, is that a score says who is that?

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.080
 No, it's uh, coen brothers. I think

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:24.400
 Oh coen, but uh, I watched one of their movies, uh, that one and uh academy award

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.000
 Uh

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.600
 What's the name of it?

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:33.680
 The the guy with the cow prod thing. Oh, yeah, yeah, um, uh, no country for old men

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:39.680
 Yes, that's a coen brothers, right? Yeah, so like i've watched that a nice way to go is through directors or actors

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.960
 So in that case coen brothers also did there will be blood which I think

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.640
 Maybe is the best acting performance i've ever seen with uh

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:49.520
 Daniel de luis. He's like the main character in it

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:53.840
 So there will be blood is about like this oil man like building his oil empire and like the late

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:58.560
 100s and it starts from him little like scrounging around in the dirt looking for oil to like

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.600
 The the height of like success

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.960
 And he like kind of goes insane and it's a very crazy interesting also beautiful movie. You'll look good in your theater

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.880
 Oh, okay, but then if you go if you go the other direction, so you watch no country for old men

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:14.160
 the scary guy in that played by havi air bardin

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:21.200
 Yes, uh, his movies are also very good. He was just in the new dune movie. I want to see the new dune movie

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.320
 The new dune movies are very good, but you gotta wait for it to come out for home theater

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:32.400
 I'm the same way there's like there's something nice about watching certain things at home

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.960
 So especially with your setup is probably better than theaters. Oh, yeah, i'm not going to i'm not going to a theater

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:42.080
 Every year. Yeah, but I didn't know how to ask online like when will it be on the news groups

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:47.920
 So like when is it released on theater seem like well usually they have a digital release date

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:51.680
 I mean for movie like doing they might have not announced it. It's probably gonna be a while

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.840
 I just sent you a picture of tommy lee jones

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:57.920
 How will you think tommy lee jones is look at that picture until he's been old my whole life though

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.440
 Yeah, but look at the picture and tell me how old do you think he is from that picture crazy old?

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.160
 Let me see where you sent it to me. It's discord discord

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.520
 Wow, he looks like he died several years ago. He looks

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:10.480
 Seriously, i'm sorry

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:14.560
 Uh, I don't know if this is mean, but like he looks he's 77

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:18.320
 Does he not look like he's 104 in that picture?

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:27.200
 He's always had a crazy wrinkled face like that's been his thing right forever. Yeah. Yeah, i guess he's always a little older

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.680
 And that's one has worked for his

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.920
 Rolls, I guess I haven't seen him in a movie in a long time

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:35.280
 But like he does not look like he would be acting in that current state

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.760
 Maybe it's a bad day. You know, I have bad days

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.520
 Today's probably a bad day. He's like a really accomplished actor

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:44.880
 But like when I think of him, I just think men in black like it's yeah

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.840
 Yeah, that's same

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.880
 April 16th doing to digital release

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:58.160
 Yeah, that's not that far. No, it's not like six or seven. I'll be

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:03.600
 Uh, is that around when i'll be coming to Miami? That's close. You don't have to watch the day comes out

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:09.760
 I'm just saying like that's how close it is like Miami is close. Yeah, exactly. We got stuff to do

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:17.040
 Yeah, uh, it's for uh, your part of the Miami stuff to do is everything on track

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.720
 Yeah, well we have certain things that we have to lift

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:26.640
 Okay, uh, I'm gonna set it. I just sent a list yesterday. I saw that. Yeah, but the timing of it

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.160
 Everything's still on track

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:32.080
 The thing that I need to get on time. I'm gonna set a date where we have to have

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.680
 Yeah

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.440
 Yes, I think i'm gonna do that thing I got yesterday was

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:43.280
 The blocker for your thing. So I think once we think that we're gonna get everything else

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:49.520
 Yeah, yeah, I love this. I love having a secret project that we kind of talk about but because we actually need to talk about it

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.560
 Nobody has a no word on that. That's fun

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:57.760
 Uh, okay, we should probably get off here. How have we been talking forever hour and 20

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:04.400
 You know, there's no end to these episodes. There doesn't have to be uh, a time limit like I what's his name?

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.360
 Uh, really famous podcaster Joe Rogan. He does like five episodes. Yeah. Yeah, what's that about?

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:14.880
 Do people listen for that long because like I listen to podcast on a walk. I can't walk for five hours

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.760
 No, but I think what's smart about it is the people he gets on there

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:23.840
 It's the only opportunity they have to speak for five hours. So they approach it totally differently

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.920
 So that's why I think it like kind of works

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.920
 The whole thing the person

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:31.920
 You're hearing different stuff for them or hear them talk about things in a different way because they're not like

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.560
 I compress everything that makes sense

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:40.160
 Okay, so it's not that everybody that listens to Joe Rogan listens to five hour episodes every week

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:43.120
 I think a lot of people do they just have it on all day while they work or whatever

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:49.200
 Oh, well, they weren't okay. Yeah, interesting. Have you seen any gammel del Toro movies? I don't know who that is now

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.520
 Okay, some of this stuff

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:56.080
 It's he's weird, but some of this stuff is pretty good. Okay wolf a wall street. That's my next one

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.480
 That's all I need to know. I can't remember two movies ahead

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:02.960
 Oh, of course. Okay, I love lower the rings. Yeah, I've watched all the special footage for lower the rings

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:06.880
 That's how they know who doesn't like it who Liz Liz thinks Liz she like

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:10.240
 Doesn't like and she thinks that bad movie and it's funny because uh

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:17.680
 I love this because she's so objectively wrong because return of the team has the record for the most number of Oscars or something

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:19.680
 Something like that. Oh really?

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.760
 If there was gonna be a way to objectively measure a movie like you're right. It's up there

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.120
 Yeah

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:29.760
 I think didn't they kind of like hold off knowing there was gonna be three movies and they kind of like gave all the awards

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:33.760
 They were gonna give for that mo for that series of movies on the last one if I recall

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:34.320
 Oh, really?

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:39.120
 It's like they didn't really honor the first two because it was like they just waited till they're done and they gave them all

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.560
 They were it's yeah

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:46.160
 It was quite an undertaking like if you watch any of the special footage like what a crazy and really like

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:51.280
 That's a nice hat tip to how much of a crazy entertaining books were like

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:55.040
 How many authors have thrown like their entire life's work into one series of books?

01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:02.160
 And like created an entire world all the backstory like there's books that the characters in the lord of the rings read that he wrote

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.440
 They're like

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.440
 It's just crazy like the amount of effort

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:11.280
 That I feel like it's just not gonna happen again like an author is not gonna do that and if they do it'll feel like

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.960
 I don't know. Maybe maybe it could be done again, but it just feels like it'd be forced

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:18.800
 No, it's it hasn't happened in a long time like harry potter was the closest and that was like

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:24.240
 Yeah smaller. It's still very close all those movies too. Yeah, okay. So here's another thing I will say

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:28.240
 So i'm i'm not someone that likes old movies. I'm not like oh things are so better

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:36.560
 Back in the day. Yeah, but there was this golden window where making a movie meant doing all this really hard stuff

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:39.520
 That has gone away. So lord of the rings

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:43.200
 Making that movie meant they were hiking to weird parts of new zealand

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:44.560
 Yeah

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:50.320
 And if you look at newer movies building crazy cities like in these remote places and that stuff just looks better

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.760
 It just looks better. Yeah, like it just comes out better and a lot of the newer stuff

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:58.480
 Everything has like this weird like gloss over it because it's all like green screen cgi

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:02.720
 It's like all the marvel movies like half of it's not real like most of what you're seeing is just

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:09.120
 I'm not like staunch and thinking like you can't ever recreate that. I believe hypothetically you can with the right setup

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.880
 I don't think

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:14.400
 Whatever they're doing now is anywhere close to that. I think it does not work

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:19.680
 It's not the same in the sense that the actors imagine being on a set on a mountain in New Zealand

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.680
 With the wind blowing and like you feel like you're in this medieval time

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.920
 Like I would think the performance would be so much easier

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.520
 To like get what you're wanting to get out of the actors and just for it to feel believable when you watch the movie

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:35.840
 Versus like you're on this stage with all these green screens and you're just like yeah

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.640
 Well

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:41.600
 There's a clip of uh Ian McKellen who plays Gandalf

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:47.760
 So when they made the hobbit movies, there's a clip of him like breaking down and crying because he's literally

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:52.240
 On his in his own an empty room talking to nobody because they're like

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:57.520
 Like he couldn't travel so they like filmed where he was in like this green screen

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:01.360
 He's like a stage actor so like his whole thing is like going off with other people and just like was like

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:05.600
 Such a bad environment compared to like the original movies. Yeah

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:11.760
 And yeah, I bet that feels like like imagine how fun it is like you go to New Zealand with all these people

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:16.160
 You're hanging out every day. You're like bonding like a team and you're doing the stuff. Yeah

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:21.040
 Then like fast forward you're just in a room by herself. I can see why that's like soulless. Oh, yeah

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:25.040
 Yeah, it sounds like the 2024 version of making movies like post-covid

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:30.560
 Get every actor in their own individual room film them pretending to yeah

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:36.000
 Yeah, and they still do it and they're it's impressive what they what they can do talking to nobody when you see the behind the scenes thing

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
 They're just like looking at a tennis ball

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:46.000
 Yeah, so I feel like there was this golden window where like they're like if we're gonna make a movie

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.840
 And it's gonna be a big budget movie. We're gonna do it in hard mode. And I feel like yeah

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:52.560
 It just removed that risk

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:56.240
 Entirely and like the stuff now it just feels a little little glossy

01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:02.640
 Yeah, the new dude. I remember they did film in like Tunisia or something. So like you can still get that like

01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:04.960
 some of that, but

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:08.560
 Yeah, it's not as often not as common anymore. I could talk about lower thereings for a while

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:13.040
 I feel like I had to pee and I don't so we could just keep telling you swallow your pee

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.760
 It's so funny. I get on my four-year-old

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:22.080
 Like he holds his pee and he dances around for like 20 minutes when I please just go pee

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.880
 Uh, but I do the same thing. I'm doing the exact same thing. So what can I say?

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:31.520
 But you you got super into lord of the rings then it feels like that's like kind of like high school

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:36.000
 Yeah, I never had a conversation for you with you where like you've been really into something pop culture

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.240
 So it's like yeah surprising

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:42.960
 I think I used to be more plugged in like that was it would have been high school time like I was still living at home

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.080
 My whole family we watched all the movies and then we watched all the special footage together and that was like

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:54.480
 It was a nice time. I have fond memories of all that. I remember thinking peter jackson was like the coolest human being in the world

01:23:54.480 --> 01:24:00.240
 It's so impressive. Well, I was so excited for his next movie and then it was like the lovely bones or something. I was like what the

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:09.680
 Lower the rings to this I don't I will say uh the king Kong movie he made I actually think was very good

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.640
 I know I never saw it. Yeah, but I think it definitely

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:16.080
 Obviously not to level lower the rings, but he like

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:21.600
 Something like the whole building stuff was was in there. It was impressive. Okay. Here's my sort of lower the rings

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.440
 So

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:29.120
 I had never heard a lord of the rings. We were at the mall like people used to do in the 90s or early 2000s

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:34.080
 And you would randomly decide to go to a movie you wouldn't like plan it three weeks in advance and like book tickets

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:38.480
 And then you would just randomly go to a movie that does feel so foreign like such a long time ago

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.480
 Yeah, so I was with my parents as a kid

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:44.240
 Uh, and we said randomly go to randomly go to a movie. My mom was pregnant

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:47.840
 At the time. So we go to the fellowship for the ring. No idea what it was

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.640
 Start watching it. Yeah, super into it

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:56.560
 Super long movie. My mom was like really uncomfortable like sitting for that long because she was like pretty proud of the time

01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:00.560
 And I kept being like oh five more minutes five more minutes and then she was like it's too much. We have to go

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:04.160
 Oh, no, but it was so was at the scene where uh

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:07.200
 Boromir betrays

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:11.760
 Like the ring takes over and he like betrays. Yeah, whatever. That's what we left there and I was like

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.760
 man

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:19.360
 I really want to know what happens in this movie. I can't wait till it comes out on dvd or whatever it was back in the time

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:21.840
 So wait a year. Yeah, I got it

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:23.440
 I watched

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.800
 The whole movie again to see what happens to the hobbits and what happens to ring

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.720
 And there's only 10 minutes left and then like go like climb the mountain and they look at the distance

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:33.200
 And I didn't know it was a trilogy. I like waited a year to

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.160
 The conclusion to the movie was going to happen at like I thought I missed so and I like

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:44.160
 Yeah, there's only 10 minutes left after he does that basically like they get away and they climb up the mountain and they like

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:48.640
 Like they look they look dramatically and you see like more door and like the dragons and that was it

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.920
 Yeah, so I was like oh

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:57.280
 I don't remember how I knew like I didn't read the books before I actually read the books after the movies

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:02.320
 I don't know how I knew that there were more but like I knew what lord of the rings was somehow coming into it

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:06.000
 I think I had read the hobbit. Maybe I read the hobbit before yeah

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.280
 The hobbits are easy book to read. I mean I read that kid too. It is like a kid's book in a lot of ways

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.960
 Yeah, yeah

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.400
 Yeah, so I think I knew but that's so funny that you went into it and not knowing anything

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:21.680
 Yeah, I wait a year thinking about what happens to hobbits like how did they display their age is so excited to find out

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:26.320
 And I didn't find out for like seven years or whatever however long to go from so funny

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:34.240
 Yeah, those all those movies are long right. They're all like three and a half hours. Yeah, and I think they kind of basically filmed them all in one go

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:41.200
 I think they were just like continuously doing yeah like little breaks between. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we got super into New Zealand after that

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.200
 I got super into it all the actors

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:48.880
 Was there like ever a country that you were like I want to go to that place more than after watching lord of the rings

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.880
 when I go to New Zealand it was

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:56.720
 Just beautiful. It's so impressive because the whole movie is just filmed in New Zealand and there's so many different

01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:02.960
 like climates and like different terrains different. Yeah, yeah, the crazy mountainous stuff

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:10.640
 It's a small right like a big place. Yeah. Yeah, and Peter Jackson's from there, right? Yeah, so he was like

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:17.920
 He became god in New Zealand, right? Like yeah, they night him. I want to say they nighted. I don't know

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:22.080
 Uh, maybe I'm thinking of the guy that climbed Mount Everest. They got knighted. Yeah

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:29.280
 Well, it's it's so crazy to me that someone it seems so random like someone from this really small place

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:38.080
 Got the chance like convinced hollywood to take it back on this thing that wasn't didn't really seem like it made a lot of sense

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:44.480
 And he happened to be from the place where was a perfect place to shoot it. Yeah, it's just like it almost feels like fate

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:47.520
 It's like so hard to see that and that like this was always supposed to happen

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:53.920
 I remember watching all the hobbit movies after and it just wasn't the same wasn't the same like it didn't capture that

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.800
 That same feeling from watching the original or the rings movies

01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:02.480
 And I wanted it too because it was Peter Jackson still and it was like, but I remember thinking like this could have been two movies

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:04.560
 It into one

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:09.360
 Definitely didn't need to be three, but I get like if they just wanted to keep making movies because it was a good time

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:14.160
 Yeah, I mean, that's a great example of what I was talking about like that movie just feels so glossy

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:17.920
 And that's all it's only a word that I can use to that. Yeah, I think about like oh, yeah

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:20.720
 Or the range how like grungy and dirty everything was

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:23.120
 And they try to make stuff look dirty

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:29.600
 Using cgi, but like it just doesn't look the same like something. Yeah. Yeah, whoever figures that out is gonna like

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.520
 Yeah, like what what's everyone missing that cgi doesn't look real

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:36.640
 That uncanny valley or whatever

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:42.320
 Uh, what do you have a favorite of the three or things movies? It's probably return of the king

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:49.360
 Okay, there's a scene turn of the king that always like basically makes me cry when at the end when the movies all over and

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:55.760
 The hobbit to like bowing and then aragorn's like you bow to no one. I'm like cheering up. Oh, yeah. Oh wow

01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:04.240
 The thing that always gets me and Liz always makes funny for this is any any time there's like honor involved

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.440
 Any kind of like deep honor like that. Mm. Always makes me

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:13.040
 Cheer up. So that scene like is like hits me super hard. So I remember that a lot

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:16.640
 But I think I like two towers a lot too because of the battle towers is my favorite

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.880
 Yeah, there's something about the like they have no hope the whole movie

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:26.480
 Oh, yeah, and but then like the way and just the dark like it's all like rainy and dark the whole movie

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.400
 And then that they ever comes there. It just feels so hopeless. I something about that movie

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:34.720
 I love that one and just the the imagery like that castle all of it was done so well

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:40.000
 Yeah, it's just just like impending dread of like this giant army of soulless

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.280
 Yeah

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:44.960
 Man-eating things like from like one last ride or whatever and then yeah

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:48.400
 Yeah, and then Gandalf's like look look for me in the 10th day or whatever

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:55.680
 Yeah, I just I just I just searched like cameo for vega martin's and I was totally going to hit you with like

01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:58.720
 She's out of no one

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:03.920
 He doesn't do it. He doesn't he's not on camera. No, he's wait. He's like it. He's an extremely good actor

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:06.640
 Yeah, he's really good. Yeah

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:11.200
 That movie also that scene where legolas slides down

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:14.720
 On the shield down the stairs and like oh, yeah

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:20.160
 I feel like that was every teenage boys like perfect perfect scene that like

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:24.080
 I I thought about that. It seemed like every day in my life for like years after seeing it

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:29.920
 I'm just like this is the coolest thing I've ever seen like it was so cool, but now as an adult. I'm like

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:35.840
 Eh like I was not doing it for me. Yeah, I'm way more into like airborne character

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.760
 Yeah, I was gonna say who's your favorite character in the series

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:42.640
 So it sounds like back in the day. I just fell for the flashiness of like a lot of us and like his acrobatics and all that

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.640
 But as an adult, I'm like

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:47.040
 Just like the again just the honor

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:50.480
 Encourage of airborne like I really hmm speaks to me

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:52.720
 It's it's funny when there's like

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:57.200
 There's like themes that really get you emotional because there's definitely something like that for me

01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:58.720
 And I can't think of what it is right now

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:02.000
 But my wife could like craft the perfect movie scene that would make me cry

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.280
 Yeah, she knows what values or what things like get at me

01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:10.320
 I can't think of it is right now, but uh, yeah, it's just interesting. It's so stupid for me

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:14.720
 I think it's a little hunter and sacrifice and one of those two things are combined like it always makes me tear up

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:18.320
 to the point where I do it in the dumbest situation, so

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:23.520
 You know laugh ready the frickin Mulan trailer. They remade

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.560
 They remade Mulan, okay

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:31.520
 And it's probably a horrible movie in her watch it, but the trailer is about how

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:35.280
 The king comes to the kings whatever comes

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:42.640
 He's demanding like, you know, you have to we need people for army you have to serve

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.720
 And then it's like this older guy

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:48.640
 And he's like I have to do this for my family like he's like putting on this armor

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:51.840
 And he's old and he's like still trying to do his like thing

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:57.760
 And clearly like he's gonna die if he goes and does this. Yeah, yeah, this is just dramatic

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:02.400
 And then like the music and his daughter decides to go in his place and like that like made me tear up

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:05.520
 I was like, yeah, the frickin Mulan remake trailer

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:10.640
 I didn't know they were remaking Mulan. They did it was like a while. It was a couple years ago

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.960
 Okay, um, but yeah, honor plus sacrifice

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.320
 Killer for me

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:19.680
 Where do you think that comes from like is it something you experienced early in life like informative years that like

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:25.360
 Or is it innate in your personality? Like what I wonder where those things come from like that kind of a

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:28.400
 Like you know, you have this this thing that gets at you

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:31.280
 I don't know. I think it's maybe like just how I

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:35.440
 The way I see life like or the way I I don't know

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:38.640
 I think to me where it gets me is some of these decisions seem so impossible

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:44.160
 That people would do these like sacrifices or these like big things. Yeah. Yeah, that seems so impossible

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:48.720
 It seems so superhuman to me that it's like so overwhelming. So I don't know where that comes from but

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.440
 if I think about like

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:56.720
 If I was trying to be like the absolute best version of what I think a person could be like

01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:01.760
 It goes in that direction. Yeah, I mean this even happened to me like I was reading twitter and do you remember when

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:07.200
 Andrew from the drizzle team was talking about going back to Ukraine. Oh, yeah. Yeah, like so

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:14.400
 I read that and I like it like hit me super hard before we were recording a podcast and I was there like basically crying

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:18.560
 Reading that. Oh, yeah, and like I'm not really someone that's super emotional generally

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.800
 But then like thinking about him like deciding to go back

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:23.840
 To be with like his family and his like country

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:28.560
 I was like that seems like it's an impossible decision to make like I would never yeah some things

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:35.280
 So that stuff just hits me kind of brings yeah brings a lot of perspective to everything else on twitter

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:36.560
 Yeah

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:41.600
 Let me see something like that. Yeah, but you know anything else. Oh, yeah. Well, of course marley and me. It's another classic

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.400
 We'll make everyone cry marley and me. I never heard of marley and me

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:51.120
 Because that's such a movie. It's like the most fucked up movie in the world. Oh, no was it a joke that it would make you cry or

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.800
 No, do you know what the movie is about?

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.960
 No, it's about a dog

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:59.440
 And a family gets a dog are you getting emotional about namas being dramatic

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.200
 It's a story about

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:07.760
 This family game is dog and the dog growing up and like the impact it has on like the trajectory of this family

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:12.960
 And guess how it ends. Of course it ends the dog ends and it's just like that's how dogs

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:18.000
 Yeah, it's so hard to have a dog because you just get attached to it and it's going to die like yeah

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.520
 It's going to die. Yeah. Oh, i'm sorry. I'm sorry

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.320
 I just remember you have a dog

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:28.160
 No, it was fine. I brought it up. But this movie is so fucked up. I'm like

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:32.720
 Why did you why did you make this movie like why did you tell this story?

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:37.280
 Like of course, it's gonna devastate every the whole theater was like in tears

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:43.760
 That just enjoys. Yeah, you enjoyed the idea of tearing everyone's heart out. Yeah, it's fucked up

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.080
 fucked up to make a movie like that. Who made that movie? Scorsese, was it you?

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:50.560
 Who was it? It was a book originally

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:56.560
 Oh, okay. Blame them. Yeah, did I tell you I sold a domain? Wow one of your 500

01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:03.440
 I've never sold a domain. Yeah, I think I paid for every domain i've bought that wasn't like a big time purchase domain

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.320
 Uh like all the little domains i've bought over the years

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:10.080
 All paid for because I sold one domain. And you know what the domain was

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:13.760
 Oh, what is it? Chatching. I love it so much

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.920
 It's like

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:19.280
 Holy odds

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:23.680
 When when go daddy like did the dot and g tld like they they announced this

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.960
 You know you could buy so people were buying a bunch of like stupid stuff

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:29.760
 And I was like, what would what would end in ing and be funny?

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:32.720
 And I did chut like ch a ch

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.760
 In I thought that's funny. Was that recent that was a kind of recent. Yeah, it was like six months ago

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:41.600
 I don't know whenever they did that announcement. You've already turned it around already turned it around sold it and

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.920
 Feels good thousands of dollars. It's just I've never sold the domain before. I've only

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:54.480
 On domains feels good. Good to be the other guy for once the irony of chutching. Yeah, I know that that's not beautiful again fate

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:58.560
 Yeah, now I get to just like watch that domain and see who builds something on it

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:02.000
 No, like what were they gonna do with it? I thought like a payments company, you know, chutching

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.320
 I don't know. We'll see. I bet it's like some crypto scan. I'll probably yeah

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:11.760
 Okay, I really do have to pee now. Okay, it was inevitable. There is a limit on how long we can record

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:14.400
 It's my bladder

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:19.520
 I don't know when we're gonna release this one because I think monday will do the part two of kin

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:26.160
 Did you listen to the end of uh our last episode of the part one? No, or how how chris wrapped it up

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:28.640
 No, uh, he just he came on and he was like

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.400
 The conversation with kin will continue and the next like hey, this is chris. It's so good. Oh, that's really cool

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:36.800
 You gotta listen to it. Yeah, so it's like the suspense

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:41.280
 Because you remember we didn't really in that episode and I know we never really in an episode that well

01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:45.280
 But that was really bad. We like all fell off. Yeah, and it was just like uh

01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:50.000
 So he made it work like it actually were and people are excited for the next part too

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.800
 Like there's people like on the edge of their seats. I love it. Good job chris. That's amazing. Good job chris

01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:59.040
 Maybe best. Okay, I'm gonna pee. All right, see you next. Yeah
